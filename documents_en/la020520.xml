<LD>As the already pleasant weather of Southern California turns even
better with the coming of spring, one rule should apply:
Stairmasters, begone.</LD>
<LD>   And that goes for stationary bikes and treadmills, staples of the
health clubs dotting the landscape. The clubs are good for winter,
when the days are shorter and the forecasts actually include a chance
of rain. But now there's no excuse for staying indoors in the quest
for a little exercise. Besides, if you choose the right spot, the
opportunities for people-watching expand dramatically.</LD>
<LD>   And so I chose the Rose Bowl as a destination. And I chose walking
as my exercise. When I lived in Orange County years ago, I used to
think of the Rose Bowl only as a place for football games, with
tailgate parties and clogged streets surrounding the stadium.</LD>
<TE>   But now that I live just one town away, I've discovered it's much
more than that. On any given day, but particularly on the weekend,
the Rose Bowl complex is home to a slew of people bent on exercising
in one of the most scenic settings in Southern California. Nestled at
the base of the San Gabriel Mountains, the bowl is surrounded by
greenery, playing fields, an aquatics center and a golf course. The
standing joke is that televised scenes of the Rose Bowl on New Year's
Day are the reason a lot of people in chillier climes pack their bags
and head west.</TE>
<TE>   I'd been cycling over for a while, first making the three-mile
loop around the stadium and golf course, then settling in for a few
innings of the high-quality baseball that is played each Sunday at
Jackie Robinson Field, adjacent to the bowl, before pedaling home.
The field is home to the Pasadena Redbirds, one of the premier teams
of the Los Angeles County adult league.</TE>
<TE>   But on this day, I drove, only to find that I'd chosen the day of
the Rose Bowl Flea Market (held the second Sunday of every month).
That translated into thousands of extra people either looking to make
a buck or find a bargain; the parking lot was nearly full when I
pulled in.</TE>
<TE>   Most of us walk at least a little bit each day, but not enough.
Serious walking, though, has become a popular form of exercise,
particularly for those of us in the 50-plus crowd. Walkers are a
common sight at the Rose Bowl, many of them pushing strollers or
exercising a dog. Although walking isn't an exercise that is going to
burn off calories by the truckload, it does produce benefits.</TE>
<TE>   According to Medlineplus, an online service of the National
Library of Medicine, regular, brisk walking--meaning with purpose and
exertion--gives you more energy, reduces stress, tones muscles and
helps control appetite. Further, walking can be done most anywhere
and the cost is limited to how much you want to spend on a pair of
shoes. It should also be done with arms swinging, chin up and
shoulders held slightly back. The Web site recommends a nine-week
program designed to gradually increase walking time for the beginner
from 15 minutes to 40.</TE>
<TE>   I clicked on my heart-rate monitor as I made my way past the first
stalls of the flea market, where vendors were selling everything from
used shoes to furniture. One seller, with a cigarette dangling from
his mouth, was offering ancient washing machines similar to the one
my mother used when I was a child--the kind with a wringer sitting
atop it.</TE>
<TE>   "I had this one guy come up and ask me what it was," said the
vendor to another as I passed.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the flea market was behind me and the Brookside golf course
loomed ahead. I checked my heart-rate monitor and it was at 112, well
within my optimal zone for exercise. I picked up the pace a little as
cyclists of various stripe zipped past me. Runners, some of them just
a gear above my own pace, inched by. And other walkers, going in the
opposite direction, discussed children, romance and the general state
of the world. At least that's what it sounded like, given the
snippets of overheard conversation.</TE>
<TE>   At about the 30-minute mark, I was halfway around the course,
feeling the slightest twinge in my left leg, which went under the
knife seven years ago. I also found myself studying the strokes of
the various golfers on the course, marveling at the incredibly wide
range of styles. (Perhaps the golfers were looking out at me and
wondering why I was walking without adding something more challenging
to the mix--like sand traps and doglegs.)</TE>
<TE>   Near the course clubhouse, an in-line skater cruised by me at a
speed I'm sure would challenge even some cyclists. And then, a few
minutes later, I began seeing some familiar faces--those who were
making the circuit again. One was a very serious-looking young woman
with sweat streaming off her face. Another was a jogger, and a third
was a woman strolling with her golden retriever.</TE>
<TE>   When I reached the end of the circuit, I switched off my
heart-rate monitor and checked the results. The walk around the Rose
Bowl, at a moderate pace, had taken about an hour. Of that hour, I
had been in my optimum zone for more than 58 minutes, burning,
according to the monitor, a modest 504 calories.</TE>
<TE>   I was torn for a moment, having never been inside the Rose Bowl
flea market. But it was Mother's Day, so I headed for the car and
lunch with several generations of my family. But not without a quick
look to see how the baseball game was going at Jackie Robinson Field.</TE>

<HD>Implantable Contact Lenses Are in Sight</HD>
<DH>Optics* A foreign study indicates they are better than
laser surgery for very nearsighted people. They may be available in
the U.S. in two years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANNE PARTIE LANGE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doctors have long said that implantable contact lenses could be a
better way to treat extreme nearsightedness than cornea-reshaping
laser surgery, which has yielded less than perfect results for some
patients.</LD>
<LD>   Various types of implantable lenses have been used in Europe,
Mexico and the Middle East for at least a decade, but the Food and
Drug Administration has not yet approved their use in the U.S. The
only way to get the lenses has been to take part in one of a handful
of clinical trials across the country.</LD>
<LD>   Eye surgeons now say the implantable lenses may be available in
two years, and with potential patients facing another option in
vision correction, some might wonder which works better.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates say they
may have the answer. Their study compared, for the first time, the
two techniques (one in each eye) in the same group of people.</TE>
<TE>   The 61-patient study also used a traditional measure, comparing
one group who received laser surgery (commonly known as Lasik), with
one who received the implantable lenses. But it was the third group
that set the study apart; they volunteered to have both procedures.
Overall, Lasik was performed in 41 eyes, and a lens was implanted in
43 eyes. All of the patients had severe to extreme nearsightedness.</TE>
<TE>   The lens used in this study, the Artisan, floats in front of the
iris and is attached to the iris with two little clips.</TE>
<TE>   One year after the eye surgeries, both techniques appeared to be
similarly safe and effective, but those eyes corrected with the lens
had better clarity and less night glare than eyes on which Lasik was
done. Twenty-one percent of the eyes with the implanted lens had
20/20 vision, and 12% of the Lasik eyes were improved to 20/20. The
results were published in the May issue of the journal Ophthalmology.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that there was less improvement in the Lasik-treated eyes
didn't surprise Earnest W. Kornmehl, associate professor of
ophthalmology at Harvard University's medical school. People with
extreme nearsightedness aren't good candidates for Lasik, he says,
and for them night glare would be an expected problem.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that the improvement [with the implanted
lens] is excellent. But two years doesn't satisfy me about safety.
I'd like to see five- or six-year data on the same type of lens,"
says Kornmehl, who is also a spokesman for the American Academy of
Ophthalmology.</TE>
<TE>   Researcher Alaa Mohamed El Danasoury, director of refractive
surgery services at Magrabi Eye Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,
says, "Most of our patients preferred the Artisan, even those who had
the same refractive outcome [with Lasik] because they saw better with
the Artisan."</TE>
<TE>   One limitation of the implanted lens, he says, is that it cannot
be used on people with large pupils. On the other hand, the lens can
be removed if the patient isn't satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an amazing study," says Robert K. Maloney, director of
the Maloney-Siebel Vision Institute in Los Angeles. "The clear
message is that if you are highly nearsighted, you're more likely to
get perfect vision with the implanted lens than with Lasik."</TE>
<TE>   Maloney is an investigator in a U.S. study using the Artisan lens
in 400 eyes. "We're seeing 20/20 vision in 40% of the eyes," says
Maloney. "For low and moderate nearsightedness, Lasik is still the
best procedure. But in 10 years, half of our patients will be getting
this lens."</TE>
<TE>   For people with more moderate nearsightedness, however, laser
surgery likely will remain a better choice, eye surgeons say.
Although the implanted lens doesn't produce the halos or night glare
that laser surgery can cause, it does carry a threat of infection.
That, in turn, could lead to catastrophic vision loss.</TE>
<TE>   So far there have been no reports of such problems, says Dr.
Edward E. Manche of Stanford University, who also is participating in
the trial of the Artisan lens, but he acknowledges that the
possibility exists.</TE>
<TE>   The procedure also is expected to initially cost more than Lasik,
about $3,500 per eye, compared with Lasik's typical $2,500.</TE>

<HD>An Earlier Warning</HD>
<DH>More people in their teens and 20s are getting skin cancer,
an ominous sign for later in life</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teenagers and young adults increasingly are being diagnosed with skin
cancer, according to doctors who warn that the development could
herald a wave of deadly lesions later in these patients' lives.</LD>
<LD>   This onset is much earlier than in previous generations:
Malignancies once thought to take 20 to 30 years to become noticeable
are being removed from the faces, backs and necks of what one
dermatologist described as "remarkably young" patients.</LD>
<LD>   Melanoma--the deadliest form of skin cancer--now ranks as the most
common cancer among people age 25 to 29. From the mid-1970s to the
late 1990s, melanoma rates rose 60.5% among women age 15 to 29,
according to figures from the American Cancer Society. That
translates into 6.9 melanomas for every 100,000 women in that age
group.</LD>
<TE>   Among men in the same age group, the rate rose 26.7% in that
period, to 3.8 for every 100,000.</TE>
<TE>   While melanoma statistics can be tracked because doctors report
cases to central cancer databanks, there's no comparable tally of
more common skin malignancies such as basal cell and squamous cell
carcinomas, or of a pre-cancerous condition called actinic keratoses.
But estimates from the American Cancer Society suggest rates of the
skin carcinomas are also on the rise. No one disputes that skin
cancer rates overall remain highest in the elderly, in whom tumors
have had a lifetime to develop.</TE>
<TE>   But doctors are especially disturbed by the numbers of younger
people they're treating, which suggest that messages about sun
avoidance still aren't getting through and that the tan made popular
when French designer Coco Chanel dared to brown in the 1920s remains
a sought-after look today.</TE>
<TE>   Although doctors lack the data to know what exactly is behind the
rise in skin cancers among young people, they suggest that several
factors--more time in the sun, improper use of sunscreens and a rise
in tanning salon visits--all play roles.</TE>
<TE>   Dermatologists believe that young people are generally spending
more time in the sun than their parents did and either not using
enough sunscreen or failing to apply it properly. They also contend
that many Americans, including the young, are spending more vacation
hours in sunny climates than in previous decades--a result, they say,
of increased leisure time and more affordable travel.</TE>
<TE>   In a study published in 1997 in the Journal of the American
Academy of Dermatology, a research team led by Dr. June K. Robinson
at Northwestern University Medical School found that during the
decade ending in 1996, the number of Americans who reported at least
one severe sunburn rose from 30% to 39%. Bad sunburns, especially
early in life, are one of the best-established risk factors for
melanoma, along with fair skin and multiple moles.</TE>
<TE>   And more Americans--roughly 1 million a day--are visiting tanning
salons, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. The Indoor
Tanning Assn., a trade group based in Jackson, Mich., estimates that
28 million Americans visit a salon at least once a year, said Joseph
Levy, a spokesman for the group's educational branch.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's 25,000 tanning salons and the 20,000 other businesses
that offer tanning services are especially popular with younger
adults, particularly younger women. Levy said a 1997 association
survey found that about 30% of customers were women 20 to 30, and 5%
were young women 16 to 20.</TE>
<TE>   In an unpublished national study of nearly 1,200 randomly selected
youngsters 11 to 18, Dr. Martin A. Weinstock of Brown University
found that 40% of girls ages 17 or 18 said they used tanning beds,
compared with about 11% of boys that age.</TE>
<TE>   Although Levy said there has been no scientific evidence that
using tanning beds without burning the skin increases skin-cancer
risk, numerous studies over the years have linked the use of tanning
beds to melanoma. In a study that appeared in the Feb. 6 Journal of
the National Cancer Institute, Weinstock and Dartmouth researchers
found that New Hampshire residents who used tanning beds regularly
were 2.5 times more likely to develop squamous cell carcinomas and
1.5 times more likely to develop basal cell carcinomas than those who
didn't.</TE>
<TE>   That same study found that the younger people were when they used
tanning beds, the more likely they were to develop skin cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors also say that advances in sunscreen technology, while
helping protect people from sun exposure, have an unintended
consequence: People feel protected when they slather on sunscreens
with an SPF of 45 or higher to avoid the blistering burns linked to
melanoma. But this may produce a false sense of security because
people think the added protection enables them to stay in the sun
longer, so they absorb more radiation, some dermatologists say.</TE>
<TE>   Is it possible that the increased numbers of young skin-cancer
patients are largely the result of people seeing dermatologists more
often for acne and other skin problems, so the disease is spotted
earlier? Probably not, say most doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get increases like that just from better detection,"
said Weinstock, the Brown dermatologist. Clearly, skin cancers aren't
getting caught as often as they could because doctors have seen
melanoma deaths rising steadily for decades (although melanoma
mortality has more recently dipped slightly in the young as some get
care at a more treatable stage).</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, though, Weinstock said the increases in basal
cell carcinomas are real. Because these cancers grow and don't go
away, the patients that he and fellow dermatologists treat would seek
care eventually.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in curable skin cancers among the young could leave a
major legacy: an increase in deadly skin cancers later on.  That's
because one of the biggest known risks for melanoma is a history of
other skin cancers and pre-cancers. David J. Leffell, a Yale
University dermatologist, said the prospect that today's young
skin-cancer patients could develop more invasive cancers decades from
now "represents a major public health problem."</TE>
<TE>   We get 85% of our lifetime sun exposure by age 18, during a time
when skin cells in our growing bodies are particularly vulnerable to
damage. Ultraviolet radiation begins penetrating the skin "the first
time your mommy puts you in a stroller for a walk," said Leffell.</TE>
<TE>   Even in Connecticut, where the sun's rays are not as strong as in
Sun Belt regions such as Florida or California, Leffell said he
routinely treats 20-year-olds for skin cancer. "That was unheard of a
decade ago," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ronald Moy, a Los Angeles dermatologist, reports a similar
increase in skin cancers among the very young. He recently removed a
large basal cell carcinoma from the nose of a 17-year-old Palm
Springs girl. At a time when most girls her age are fretting about
acne blemishes, this high school student was worried about her scars
being undetectable by the time of her June prom.</TE>
<TE>   As with many younger patients he treats for cancerous or
pre-cancerous sun damage, Moy can't be sure why this young woman
developed problems so early. Maybe because of punishing desert sun.
Skin cancer rates in Southern California outpace the U.S. average,
and sunlight nearer the equator packs more punch. Or, perhaps she
inherited from her parents some genetic inability to repair sun
damage to her skin cells, which is another potential risk factor for
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Such cases demonstrate why doctors increasingly stress the
importance of prevention by protecting yourself from the sun's
harmful effects and why they stress education about the early warning
signs of skin cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Actress Sarah Paulson was headed to Puerto Rico for a vacation two
years ago when her fiance asked her to see a dermatologist about a
funny-looking mole on her back. It was as small as a pencil eraser
and densely black "like someone used a black Sharpie" pen, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her dermatologist performed a biopsy. The diagnosis: melanoma.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 25 years old. Who thought it could happen to me?" said
Paulson, who recently starred in the television series "Leap of
Faith."</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a child in Florida, my parents probably didn't slather
me in sunscreen," she said. Being fair-skinned and blond also put her
at additional melanoma risk.</TE>
<TE>   The cancer surgeon who removed the mole found that it hadn't
invaded other parts of her body. "Had I waited six months," she said,
"there's such a hugely increased possibility that it would have
spread, and it would have been just disastrous."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors say public awareness of skin-cancer risks seems to have
grown since the first Melanoma Month campaigns began in May 1985.
"How many mothers brought their 10-year-olds in for skin checks 30
years ago?" said Paulson's dermatologist, Dr. Glynis Ablon of
Manhattan Beach.</TE>

<HD>The Message in a Bottle of Vodka? It's Blank</HD>

<LD>I was sitting at my desk facing four bottles of vodka when my wife
walked in and said, "Oh, my God!"</LD>
<LD>   Funny how three words can express so much emotion. It was also her
expression that said a lot, the same kind of surprise and horror that
sweeps across the face of virgins when Dracula floats into their
room.</LD>
<LD>   Cinelli stared at the vodka bottles for what seemed like a
lifetime, momentarily in a state beyond speech after her initial
outburst.</LD>
<TE>   Then she said, "What in God's name are you doing?"</TE>
<TE>   I knew her concern was serious because it was the second time she
had invoked the name of a deity. But I was prepared with an answer. I
have been a husband too long not to know how to deal with these kinds
of situations.</TE>
<TE>   "Research," I said. "Here ... " I opened each of the four bottles
and said, "Smell these."</TE>
<TE>   "No thank you," she said. "I'll just smell you after you're done
with whatever you call 'research.'" The word sizzled with unsaid
accusations.</TE>
<TE>   I explained that I wasn't drinking the vodka, I was sniffing it,
quickly adding that this was not a new high I had discovered but part
of a scientific experiment.</TE>
<TE>   "Like the time you tried smoking banana peels?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, that didn't work. What I'm trying to determine is if simply
smelling vodka is enough to sicken six people and empty a factory."</TE>
<TE>   My reference was to an incident that occurred a week ago at the
Fluor Daniel company in Aliso Viejo. Someone mailed a bottle of vodka
to an employee of the firm. It broke, either in the shipping or
handling, and the fumes of the liquor sent six mail-room workers to
the hospital complaining of nausea and wooziness.</TE>
<TE>   The plant's 400 employees were evacuated, and a hazardous material
team called to the complex. They discovered that the mysterious
substance was an 80-proof Russian vodka and not some kind of toxic
liquid from Iraq or Syria.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, according to a company representative, it was shipped out
of Greenville, S.C., which is not included as part of George W.
Bush's axis of evil countries. One Fluor Daniel employee sent it to
another Fluor Daniel employee which, while no doubt intended as a
friendly gesture, is not likely to happen again.</TE>
<TE>   The company's public relations director, Lisa Boyette, said the
vodka did have a strong smell, which surprises me. I had always been
told that vodka had no odor, which is one of the reasons I switched
from gin. Supposedly only certain sophisticated electronic monitors
and suspicious wives with over-developed olfactory organs are able to
detect the presence of vodka in a male human.</TE>
<TE>   Boyette couldn't tell me what kind of vodka it was and had no idea
why its smell made people sick. A fire department investigator
suggested that maybe one person really became ill and the others
joined him in empathetic wooziness. A kind of vodka hysteria, maybe.
There was only one way to find out.</TE>
<TE>   I brought out the four bottles of vodka I had and spilled a little
from each one on a thick towel. Then I sat around sniffing the
samples. Nothing happened. During the course of experimentation, the
dog Barkley sauntered into the room, sniffed the towel before I could
stop him, and curled up on it. Barkley assumes that anything soft is
meant for sleeping on, regardless of the smell.</TE>
<TE>   I add quickly, before animal activists begin hunting me down, that
the dog suffered no ill effects from sniffing and sleeping on the
vodka, and, in fact, seemed more pleasant after the experience. Good
boy.</TE>
<TE>   I swear to you, I felt no nausea, wooziness, giddiness, burning or
even dry mouth after sniffing the towel, and if anything, I certainly
would have suffered from dry mouth. Everything that doesn't cause
death at least causes dry mouth. Trust me. This is my second sniffing
column in a row, and I've become something of an expert.</TE>
<TE>   After several sniffs, I brought the bottles into my office and set
them on my desk. The vodka consisted of Ketel One, Grey Goose,
Absolut and Finlandia. I keep several bottles on hand only to revive
runners in the 10K Topanga Marathon who collapse near our house, and
to treat hikers who are attacked by predatory raccoons.</TE>
<TE>   When towel sniffing did nothing, the dog and I retreated to my
office, where I placed the four bottles on my desk and began sniffing
them in earnest. I was also simultaneously searching the Internet to
determine if I could find anything that would explain the
woozy-wazzles at the Fluor Daniel plant.</TE>
<TE>   I came up empty-handed in my search for vodka-fume poisoning. But
I did learn that the term vodka stems from the Russian word "voda,"
meaning water. The Poles say "woda." Both the Russians and the Poles
claim to have created the drink sometime in the 8th or 9th century,
depending on who you believe. I discovered it several hundred years
later with my research assistant Jerry Belcher.</TE>
<TE>   I was still sniffing and researching when my wife walked in and
then out again, thinking the worst. I figured I was in trouble
already, so what the heck.</TE>
<TE>   I won't lie to you, I did have a little sip from each bottle,
orally, not nasally, the results of which I intend to write up for
the New England Journal of the American Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The dog watched me and licked his lips, but I didn't give him any.
He'd had enough.</TE>

<LD>Which sex education programs most effectively motivate teenagers to
avoid high-risk sexual behavior? The debate usually focuses on
abstinence-only sex education versus comprehensive sex education. But
a new study has found that one of the best inoculations against
high-risk sexual activity among teens may well come from programs
aimed at keeping kids off drugs, away from violence and in school.
The study indicates that an anti-drug and anti-violence elementary
school intervention program that promotes social competency, academic
success and involvement in school has had the long-term effect of
delaying the age at which sexual activity begins, and cutting rates
of pregnancy and birth among young women and men.</LD>
<TE>   That study, published Tuesday in the Archives of Pediatrics &amp;
Adolescent Medicine, looked at 350 Seattle students in 18 urban
elementary schools, as well as their parents and teachers. The study
began in 1981, when the children were in first grade, and continued
until 1987, when they were in sixth. After five years, when no
intervention was provided, the researchers revisited the same
students. When those now-18-year-olds were compared with counterparts
in the same socioeconomic groups who had had no early intervention,
researchers saw significantly reduced levels of risky sexual
behavior, including lower rates of sexually transmitted diseases and
number of sexual partners. The effects of the program were evident up
to age 21, when the study ended.</TE>
<TE>   The pregnancy rate among the 21-year-old women in the multiethnic
sample who took part in the intervention program was 38%, compared
with 56% of women who were not in the program.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the birth rate of those in the intervention group was
23% compared with 40% of those not in the program. The study also
found that program participants delayed the age at which they became
sexually active by about a year and were more likely to have used a
condom the last time they had intercourse.</TE>
<TE>   The intervention proved particularly effective among black
students, who made up 26% of the participants. The rate of sexually
transmitted diseases by age 21 among black students who took part in
the program was 7%, compared with 34% for those who didn't receive
the intervention.</TE>
<TE>   About 79% of the black students who had participated in the
program reported using a condom the last time they had sexual
intercourse, compared with 36% who were not in the program.</TE>
<TE>   "The results fit with our theory that if children become bonded to
school and committed to achieving in school in the elementary grades,
they are less likely to risk that bond [later] by engaging in
behavior that puts their future success at risk," said researcher J.
David Hawkins, director of the University of Washington's Social
Development Research Group and co-author of the Archives of
Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine study with Heather Lonczak, a
research analyst at the University of Washington Social Development
Research Group.</TE>
<TE>   "We never predicted such a big drop in the teen pregnancy or birth
rate in our sample," Hawkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Other intervention programs aimed at intensifying a child's bond
to home, school and community have shown similar outcomes to those of
the Seattle-based program.</TE>
<TE>   "This study is consistent with other research findings that have
found a close connection between teens and their school, and teens
and their parents was very powerful in helping kids take fewer sexual
risks," said Sarah Brown, director of the National Campaign to
Prevent Teen Pregnancy, a nonprofit group in Washington, D.C.,
dedicated to reducing teen pregnancy. "The reason is, school and
their personal relationships are more satisfying, so they don't go
looking for love in all the wrong places."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers in the Seattle-based intervention learned how to help
children with impulse control, as well as teaching them how to get
what they wanted without aggressive behavior and to recognize others'
feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Parents were taught ways to support children's academic success,
manage family life and to give their children positive reinforcement.
When children were in the fifth and sixth grades, parents took a
series of classes called "Preparing for the Drug Free Years," in
which parents learned to monitor their children and help them
practice refusal skills by role-playing. Children also learned
refusal skills in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, when the children who participated in the program
turned 18, they were still "more bonded to school" than their
counterparts in the control group, Hawkins said. The home- and
school-focused program set children on a "better developmental
trajectory," so that through the teen years they had a positive,
enduring stake in pro-social behavior and a belief that they would
have success into adulthood.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids are usually taught just to say 'no' and what not to do, but
it is only the kids who are bonded to the social group that is
promoting those standards who are likely to live accordingly," said
Hawkins. "So that if you have lost your bond to your family, you
don't care that mother tells you not to engage in risky behavior. If
in elementary school the conditions are in place to help kids develop
a strong attachment and commitment to education and their family, the
bonding is the motivation to live according to their expectations."</TE>
<TE>   A hallmark of adolescent behavior is living by the norms of one's
peer group, said Dr. Gregory D. Zimet, a psychologist in the
department of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine.
Zimet, who published a study last month in the journal Pediatrics,
found that adolescent girls with high self-esteem were less likely to
engage in early sexual activity, while boys with high self-esteem
were more likely to report being sexually active. The results of the
University of Seattle study, Zimet said, suggests that changing norms
changes outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason the intervention appears to have a
long-reaching effect, said Lonczak, is because it offers hope. "It
teaches children that they are competent, can succeed and go on to
college and have a future," said Lonczak. "This is not to say that
sex education is not important. It is, and children need this kind of
information."</TE>
<TE>   The power of intervention programs like the one in Seattle comes
from working on the many-faceted environments that influence the
behavior of teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "Simply giving young people information about something is not
enough," Brown said. "There has to be a reason, motivation and
support for using it. What these programs do is change the
conversation in their heads about what is in their self-interest, and
provide a setting and a rationale for kids to do what is in their
self-interest."</TE>

<LD>THE MINORITY REPORT</LD>
<LD>   By Philip K. Dick</LD>
<LD>   Pantheon</LD>
<TE>   104 pages, $12.95</TE>
<TE>   An interviewer once asked Philip K. Dick about the difference
between so-called mainstream fiction and the subgenre of science
fiction. Dick, who'd recently seen one of his books being published
in both formats, wryly noted that the sci-fi edition sold for less.</TE>
<TE>   In the 30-year period that ended in 1982 with his death at 53,
Dick wrote 36 novels and five collections of stories that transformed
him from an obscure author of pulp sci-fi into a kind of cult hero.
Strange and memorable books like "The Man in the High Castle" (1962)
and "Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said" (1974) turned casual readers
into devoted fans. And stories about Dick himself exercised an equal
fascination: his distrust of authority, his misguided attempts to
expand his consciousness with hallucinogenic drugs, and the
inexplicable, sometimes mystical experiences he had at various points
in his life that left him wondering if he was in touch with an
alternative reality or suffering from psychotic episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, some of his visionary fiction has inspired
filmmakers, most notably his book "Do Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep?" that served as the basis for Ridley Scott's 1982 film "Blade
Runner" (which lacked, among other things, the electric sheep of the
original). Scheduled for release this summer, comes a film version of
his short story "The Minority Report," directed by Steven Spielberg
and starring Tom Cruise. In honor of this, Pantheon Books has
reissued this longish short story (first published in 1956) on its
own.</TE>
<TE>   Set in the aftermath of a major (but far from
civilization-destroying) world war, "The Minority Report" introduces
us to Commissioner John Anderton, the founder and head of an
impressively effective policing system known as Precrime. By catching
would-be criminals before they have the opportunity to commit their
crimes, Precrime has reduced the murder rate to a single one in five
years. As Anderton's bright new assistant, Witwer, sums it up: "With
the aid of your precog mutants, you've boldly and successfully
abolished the postcrime punitive system of jails and fines. As we all
realize, punishment was never much of a deterrent, and could scarcely
have afforded comfort to a victim already dead." On the other hand,
as Anderton himself acknowledges, the putative criminals who've been
placed in preventive detention camps have not actually broken the law
and consider themselves innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the unthinkable happens: Anderton sees his own name come up
on a list of future murderers. A minor glitch? An indication of
something more fundamentally wrong with the system? Or, a malevolent
trick by someone who wants to get rid of him? As Anderton scrambles
to figure out what's happening while keeping one step ahead of the
system he helped create, former certainties dissolve. Is young Witwer
scheming to get him out of the way so he can take over his job and
maybe even his wife, Lisa, an attractive policewoman? And whose side
is Lisa on, anyway? Or, is someone or something else going on?</TE>
<TE>   "Which means more to you," Lisa demands at one point, "your own
personal safety or the existence of the system?" "My safety," replies
Anderton, without hesitation. But his confidence, even about a
question as basic as this, will later be shaken. And so, too, the
reader's idea of what's going on in this story. It's not simply that
the plot itself is unpredictable, full of twists and turns, but
rather that the allegorical focus keeps shifting until, by the end,
it is all but dissipated in a welter of contradiction and confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the contradictions offer food for thought: Yes, there is
something alarming about a system that detains people before they do
anything wrong; but perhaps it's a small price to pay for a system
that has saved the lives of countless innocent victims. As for
confusion, one of the central insights that Dick has to offer his
readers is his profound skepticism about our ability to know for
certain what is real and what is not.</TE>
<TE>   In other respects, however, Dick does not seem to have fully
exploited the potential of his own material here. Certainly, he has
not portrayed his characters with any degree of depth. Nor has he
fully explored all the ramifications of their situation or the
implications of the themes he has introduced. In basing the Precrime
System on the precognitive ESP faculties of idiots savants rather
than on the use of, say, psychological, sociological or genetic
paradigms, Dick short-circuits some potentially fascinating questions
about the limits of science and social science in predicting human
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   What first appears to be an allegory about freedom versus
security, fairness versus welfare, the individual versus society and
doubt versus trust soon narrows down to an unnecessarily complicated
explanation of the workings of precognition. And in the final
showdown between Anderton and the man who may be his nemesis, it's
not entirely clear what either of them stands for. Yet these flaws
are finally not a fatal weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Fans of Philip K. Dick tend to be imaginative people, and in this
story he has left a great deal to the reader's imagination.</TE>

<HD>Just Didgeridoo It</HD>
<DH>The aboriginal wind instrument from Down Under beguiles
beginners.</DH>

<LD>"Get your lips loose," said Andrew Werderitsch to the 13 students.
"Don't worry about the spit. Get your lips as big and juicy as they
can be."</LD>
<LD>   No, this isn't a class on advanced smooching. It's a didgeridoo
workshop, the first in a planned series open to players of the
Australian instrument. This one was held at the Circle, a Marina del
Rey area residence that doubles as a creative space.</LD>
<LD>   The didgeridoo, a long wooden pole traditionally made of
eucalyptus hollowed out naturally by hungry termites, is considered
one of the world's oldest instruments. Exactly how old, however, is
hard to say. "There is so much speculation," says Mark Dunn, one of
the owners of L.A. Outback in Laguna Beach, which carries a huge
selection of didgeridoos ranging in price from $49 to well over
$1,000. "Some people say 40,000 years. Some people say that can't
possibly be. It's more like a couple thousand years."</LD>
<TE>   The difficulty in dating the instrument has much to do with the
Australian aboriginals considered its keepers and foremost players
and makers. "They don't have a written language," explains Dunn. "And
they were nomadic people, so there's no archeology. They were
notorious for discarding and moving on."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever its age, there is no doubt about the uniqueness of the
didgeridoo's sound. It can be a low voluminous drone that seems as if
it's coming from inside the Earth or emanating from another planet.
It can be a squeak or a toot, a bark or a cry. "Sometimes it scares
people," says Venice-based Werderitsch, 34. But a lot of people find
it bewitching.</TE>
<TE>   Many may recognize the instrument's sound without realizing what
instrument it is. The didgeridoo, as played by David Hudson, arguably
the best-known aboriginal player, was featured in the opening of CBS'
"Survivor: The Australian Outback."</TE>
<TE>   "It's my favorite sounding instrument," said Ayernye McGuire, 36,
who took the $38, three-hour workshop. Like most of the students, he
brought his own didgeridoo, but some borrowed one from Werderitsch's
varied supply. Playing it, however, proved challenging for McGuire, a
Malibu-based producer, and several of the other beginning students.</TE>
<TE>   "I totally suck," said Tim Timmermans, a 42-year-old jazz musician
from North Hills, as a preface to his turn in front of the group.
What emanated sounded more like a whoopee cushion than music.</TE>
<TE>   "No," joked Werderitsch. "You blow."</TE>
<TE>   With a little instruction from Werderitsch ("Push a little harder
with your diaphragm") and his assistant, Robin Spehar ("Your brain is
thinking about your lips way too much"), Timmermans and McGuire were
soon making the kinds of sounds that could rake in spare change on
the Venice boardwalk, where didgeridoo players can often be heard.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good," said McGuire. "I couldn't even get a sound out of
it at first."</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing about this instrument," Werderitsch explained,
"is the learning curve is really quick. It just takes a little
practice."</TE>
<TE>   Werderitsch (who runs a Web site at www.didjeridu-ings.com) was
introduced to the didgeridoo in 1993. He was hanging out with a group
of percussion players. "One guy brought out a piece of PVC plumbing
pipe. He referred to it as his didgeridoo. He passed it to everyone
that was there. And everyone could do it. Everyone could make the
basic sound." Everyone, that is, but Werderitsch.</TE>
<TE>   "I just couldn't do it," he says. "The kicker is, I was living in
Marina del Rey and that night I took a walk. It was like 11 p.m. and
I walked toward the beach. Right in my path was a long piece of
cardboard tubing, like a fabric supply tube. I took out my Swiss army
knife and made it a little shorter. And right then and there I made a
really clear sound. I was like, 'This is it.' From that moment on I
was sharing it with everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Many people believe the didgeridoo has therapeutic powers that
benefit both the listener and the player. In fact, one woman who
wandered into the class asked Werderitsch if she could stay and
listen. "She's going through a cleansing," Werderitsch explained, as
the woman lay down on a low cot in the room where the advanced
players were practicing.</TE>
<TE>   "I was feeling tired and worn down from being out late the night
before," said the woman, 39-year-old Maureen Blaney, a lawyer.
"During the time I was [listening], I felt more life force returning.
Also, I felt more aligned, as if certain blocks to my energy were
removed."</TE>
<TE>   Student Andrew Gartrell, 30, of Woodland Hills also believes the
instrument creates sort of internal effect. "One of the reasons I've
been interested in learning it is I've been having some chest pains
and the vibrations feel really good," said Gartrell, a product
designer. "It somehow seems to harmonize and synchronize all the
vibrations of the body."</TE>
<TE>   According to Dunn, the didgeridoo is gaining in popularity. "In
Europe, Japan and certainly Australia, it's already been doing its
thing for like 10 years, where it's had a lot of momentum and a lot
of public interest," he says. "Here in the States it seems like just
now people are starting to get turned on to the instrument. We've
been in business six years so we've watched it grow. Our sales have
at least doubled every year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's got such broad appeal. We sell didgs to young high school
surfers, to people in their 60s and 70s, to men, women. People buy
them for so many reasons. It could be just because it's something
cool or something they use for meditation, yoga, anything holistic.
It's got universal appeal."</TE>
<TE>   However, adds Dunn, any healing properties attributed to the
instrument have come from modern culture. "The aboriginal people
quite often find the white interpretation of using it for healing
kind of ridiculous because that's not what the didg was originally
used for. It was used for ceremony. They'll cringe when they hear
people talking about its healing elements. But there's definitely a
market for it."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the attraction, the instrument keeps gaining admirers. "I
love the didgeridoo," said Marcia Dor Etain, 27, a member of the Los
Angeles band Voxbox and the lone woman in the class. "It has such an
organic sound, such an earthy, deep tribal kind of sound. I think
it's a magical instrument. I'm definitely going to be playing the
didg in my band."</TE>

<DH>For a semester, these high school seniors get this close to
dream jobs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Shooting From the Hip Casting in Studio City, the "cattle call" is
on. This day, actors are auditioning for a Lincoln Navigator
commercial that revolves around a wedding scene. In tuxedos and sleek
gowns, they line up as a smiling and cheerful LuAnne Tyzzer snaps
Polaroids of each hopeful. "People think the business is really fake,
but here it's like real people," all hoping to beat the odds and get
the gig, she observes.</LD>
<LD>   The 18-year-old answers phones for the agency, sits in on
auditions and keeps in touch with the actors' agents. "The agents can
be a bit tedious," Tyzzer says. "You don't want to tell them their
client didn't do a great job."</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, at Element Music &amp; Soundesign in Santa Monica, the
soundtrack from Jennifer Aniston's upcoming comedy, "The Good Girl,"
is playing upstairs in the recording studio. Tyzzer's schoolmate,
18-year-old Adam Somers, has just checked in for his shift organizing
the studio's hundreds of CDs on a computer database so the company
can quickly retrieve "any genre, any year, any title, any artist."
He's also been digitizing Element's library of sound effects.</LD>
<TE>   But, Somers says, he really wants to be a composer. "Music is all
I've ever wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   And at Temple Ahavat Shalom in Northridge, another classmate
practices with the junior choir for a musical tribute to the rabbi
educator, Barry Lutz, on the occasion of his 18th year at the temple.
In a clear, sweet soprano, Shira Saltsman, 17, leads the singing,
with cantor and mentor Patti Linsky at the piano.</TE>
<TE>   "Tradition is a huge part of what I am," Saltsman says. While
she's not convinced she wants to follow in her mentor's footsteps,
she's glad she's had the chance to see how much a cantor must learn
about Judaism. "You need to be there for your community in times of
celebration and in times of sadness."</TE>
<TE>   The three teens are among 29 seniors at Milken Community High
School of Stephen Wise Temple in West L.A. who, for five hours each
week, head off to social science class.</TE>
<TE>   The classroom may be a foreign consulate or the orthopedics
department of a hospital. They are enrolled in the Wise
Individualized Senior Experience program, in which second-semester
seniors earn class credit by completing unpaid internships in their
areas of interest, which range from fashion design to computer gaming
and from restaurant management to real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Milken, a private Jewish school, and Berkeley High School in
Berkeley are the only California schools in the program, which was
started in New York in 1973. Under auspices of the New York-based
not-for-profit WISE Services since 1991, the program has spread to 50
schools, most of them in the Northeast.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes education come to life," says Milken Head of School
Rennie Wrubel. "I really believe 12th-graders need to be treated
differently. This is kind of a bridge from high school to the real
world." And, she adds, they learn real life lessons--if they don't
perform well on the job. "It's not like not doing well on a quiz." At
the same time, they are learning to meet and solve workplace
challenges "in a safe environment" and with backup support from their
school mentors.</TE>
<TE>   The program requires students to keep a journal and to make a
presentation at school, where they are evaluated by their faculty
mentor, two other teachers, two students and a parent. The grade is
either pass or fail; three years into the program, no one has yet
failed.</TE>
<TE>   The interns' final presentations wrap up this week. The first of
the 29 was by Michael Richman, 18, whose placement was with Al
Rantel, a nighttime talk radio show host on KABC, where he was an
assistant producer. Richman had prepared an elaborate slide show,
with audio, to augment his talk, in which he describes such duties as
helping scout and sign guests and screen callers.</TE>
<TE>   Richman, who hopes for a career in politics after attending George
Washington University, seems a natural for that arena: He concludes
his presentation by thanking in advance his evaluators, all of whom
"look great tonight. I just wanted to mention that." He earns high
praise from his evaluators, though one suggests if he is serious
about running for public office one day, he might regret some of his
O.J. Simpson and Robert Blake jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Aliyah Phillips, 18, was assigned public affairs duties with the
Israeli consulate. It's a perfect match for Phillips, a dedicated
Zionist who says, "My mom says I came home in first grade and said I
wanted to go into the Israeli army when I grew up."</TE>
<TE>   She helped organize a program wherein Jewish schools in L.A. and
San Diego counties nominate 11th-graders as ambassadors to Israel,
with the goal of planning two programs each year at their school to
benefit Israelis. "I've learned how important it is to gain the
knowledge to support the things you believe in and to get involved in
the community," says Phillips, who will study in Israel next year.</TE>
<TE>   Yoni Blau, who's bound for USC, had a little inside track landing
his placement at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills. His
father is a surgeon on staff. Blau, 18, wants to be a doctor and got
to watch 10 orthopedic surgeries. "The last surgery, I was [just
inches] away, right over the doctor's shoulder." The most valuable
thing he's learned: "How the doctors and nurses work as a team. It's
amazing. The scrub nurse knows what the doctor's going to do next."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the five-hour commitment, each student must attend
weekly meetings with the teacher-mentor. Because some businesses are
reluctant to take on high schoolers, Milken networks by sending out
letters to parents seeking leads. A few students are doing
independent projects rather than traditional internships. One is
making a video satire on applying for college; another is at a real
estate office and will take the licensing exam as her project. In the
past, several girls designed their own clothing lines and are now
studying fashion design in college.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Schneider, a Milken teacher and program coordinator, tells
of one student who, while planning a business career, was interested
in an internship in the medical field. "They sent him home with
suturing stuff and he sutured oranges. Now, he's going to be a
surgeon. It changed his life."</TE>
<TE>   Not all placements turn out ideally. One student, who landed with
a stockbroker, was relegated to making the cold calls to prospective
clients. Others have been used as gofers, or taken advantage of by
supervisors who demanded many more than the agreed-upon hours of
work. The program is open to all students in good standing. They must
write their own resumes and initiate their interviews. Dealing with
rejection is part of the learning experience.</TE>
<TE>   Education First,</TE>
<TE>   Then Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   Working at the casting agency has helped Tyzzer, who has been
taking acting lessons since she was 6, decide she likes being behind
the scenes better. But first she's going to get away from it all.
Living in Los Angeles, she says, "I need a reality check." She will
major in communications and business at Wheaton in Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Francene Selkirk, who owns Shooting From the Hip, thinks a carrer
as a casting agent should be no problem for Tyzzer. "She came in and
she could do everything. She could probably direct the talent some
day soon," Selkirk says.</TE>
<TE>   Selkirk, who has cast commercials for clients such as Footlocker,
Cadillac and McDonald's, has made sure to include her intern in the
whole process--"If you don't let them see what you're doing, how are
they going to learn?" When Selkirk had some teenage casting to do,
she turned to Tyzzer and asked, "Who are the cute guys? Pick the hip
kids" and, she says, "she was right on in her choices."</TE>
<TE>   Because the music-loving Somers wants to get a good liberal arts
education, and "be around people who aren't just musicians," he is
headed to the University of Michigan, where he hopes to "learn to
produce electronic music." His supervisor at Element, executive
producer Jack Purvis, says, "We jumped at the chance" to have him as
an intern, a first experience for them. "He's been keeping us, from a
musical perspective, organized." That's important, says James
O'Brien, who started Element four years ago, because of the
capricious nature of commercial clients. "We could get a call tonight
to change everything and they need it tomorrow morning in Chicago.
This way you're not digging through hundreds of sounds" to find the
right one.</TE>
<TE>   Somers laughs as he tells about his "one chance to really be
creative"--and how he blew it. When a student brought in a short film
for scoring, Purvis, appreciating Somers' technical knowledge,
suggested he take a crack at it. Somers took the video home, watched
it over and over, and had no idea where to begin.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking, 'How badly could I ruin this movie?'" Everything
he tried on his synthesizer was out of sync with the film and finally
he just threw up his hands. "I have a lot more learning to do about
the overall philosophy of music for films. There's a lot more to [it]
than just sitting down and opening up and being creative."</TE>
<TE>   During her internship, Saltsman has sat in with Linsky on bar and
bat mitzvah training, a counseling session with a troubled teen, and
is learning to chant the Torah. For her, it is the perfect
opportunity to combine her interests in music and psychology. She's
headed to UC Berkeley and is thinking of becoming a child
psychologist, "but I definitely want to do musical theater on the
side."</TE>
<TE>   Linsky, who has known Saltsman since she was in preschool at the
temple, says, "I like how she combines her mind, her heart, her soul,
her spirit. She's outspoken but sensitive, a born leader. She takes
risks and chances. She's an extraordinary young woman."</TE>
<TE>   And would she be a good cantor? Linsky smiles and says, "She'd be
amazing." After Saltsman's solo at a recent Friday night Shabbat
service, fulfilling one of the goals of her internship, Linsky told
her, "We need to have a serious talk about your career path."</TE>

<LD>A piano is a beautiful musical instrument. Maybe you have seen a
grand piano like the one shown here at a concert or symphony. Did you
know that a grand piano has more than 12,000 moving parts made up of
wood, metal, fiber, resin and other materials? If you open the top,
you'll see things that look like hammers. Press a key and the hammers
will rise and hit the strings. The place where the hammer strikes the
string is the most critical point of a piano action. Precise
alignment of the hammer is very important. These parts need special
attention in order to function properly and to keep the piano
sounding its best.</LD>
<LD>   If you are lucky enough to have a piano in your home, you know
that it makes beautiful music--and it's also fun to play. A piano
will last for many years if it's cared for and tuned on a regular
basis. A qualified, registered technician should professionally tune
your piano three times in its first year and twice a year after that.</LD>
<LD>   It is important to keep a piano clean. The keyboard should be
covered when not in use to keep dust out. The keys can be cleaned by
occasionally wiping them with a damp cloth and drying them
immediately. A small amount of mild soap can be used if needed. Never
use harsh chemicals or cleaners on your piano keys.</LD>
<TE>   A piano technician can answer questions about how to take care of
your instrument, ensuring that it operates at its best for many
years.</TE>

<LD>"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"</LD>
<LD>   by C.S. Lewis</LD>
<LD>   This story is about a girl named Lucy who finds the secret of the
wardrobe in a mysterious old house. In the beginning, no one believes
her when she tells of her adventures in the secret land of Narnia.
But later on, Edmund, Peter and Susan also discover it and meet
Aslan, the great lion. This story is full of adventure, and I think
you will enjoy it.</LD>

<LD>When Mark woke up, he wondered if this would be the day. He went to
the window, and sure enough, the jacaranda tree had shared its
special secret once again.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the time, the big tree in his frontyard just had branches
and leaves on it.</LD>
<LD>   But deep inside, tiny purple blossoms were hiding, like a secret,
until, around the middle of May, the blossoms burst out and the tree
looked like a beautiful umbrella protecting his frontyard and part of
the neighbor's yard too.</LD>
<TE>   And, when the breeze softly shook the blossoms from the branches,
they covered the ground like a thick purple carpet.</TE>
<TE>   In the kitchen, Mom was drinking coffee and reading the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish Stacey could see the jacaranda tree today," Mark said as
he fixed a bowl of cereal. "I really miss her."</TE>
<TE>   "I know," Mom answered. "I'm sorry her family was transferred to
Germany."</TE>
<TE>   "Remember when we moved to California and I didn't like living
here? Then Stacey surprised me with the secret steps in that tree,
and it helped. I wonder who's helping her now."</TE>
<TE>   "Her mom told me military families help each other. But this was
the longest assignment they'd ever had, and she said it was
especially hard leaving good friends."</TE>
<TE>   "I wish that grouch Mr. DiCosta hadn't bought their house next
door. He never smiles or says hi or anything."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he didn't want to leave where he was living, either," Mom
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess," Mark said. "Anyway, I'll e-mail Stacey and tell her the
tree's secret is out again!"</TE>
<TE>   "Good idea," Mom said. "Now, we'd better scoot. You've got school,
and I'm running late."</TE>
<TE>   "OK. When I get home, I'm gonna climb up the jacaranda's steps. I
wonder if I'll be able to see Catalina Island?"</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Will Mark enjoy the tree as much without Stacey?</TE>

<HD>Passing Fame in the Valley</HD>
<DH>Actors cross paths with regular folks here, home of studios
if not the A list.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tour buses bypass the area. No one would dream of holding the Oscars
here. Zagat guides rarely list it as a prime location for spotting
celebrities.</LD>
<LD>   But what the San Fernando Valley lacks in ZIP Code cachet, it
makes up for in sheer numbers of screen personalities. Industry
insiders estimate that the Valley, now starring in its own secession
drama, is home to more actors than anyplace else, probably because it
is also the address of Universal, Warner Bros., Disney, NBC, CBS and
Nickelodeon.</LD>
<LD>   And most of those actors are of the easily accessible, B-list
variety.</LD>
<TE>   Valley-level celebrities mix and mingle with ordinary folks,
unlike the typical rich-and-famous Westsider, who tends to hide
behind sunglasses and floppy hats, when not secluded behind gates.</TE>
<TE>   That disheveled blond man fumbling for fruit at the Studio City
farmers market? It's none other than actor Ed Begley Jr.</TE>
<TE>   That brown-haired tomboy watching a movie in Sherman Oaks? Kristy
McNichol.</TE>
<TE>   Or that flirt with the wavy hair, at the window table in a Ventura
Boulevard cafe, grinning like he just got his way? Ian Ziering. (You
know, Ian Ziering--Steve Sanders on "Beverly Hills 90210.")</TE>
<TE>   Reactions to all the familiar and semi-familiar faces here range
from blase acceptance to mild amusement to unfettered excitement.</TE>
<TE>   "Omigod!" screeched a big-haired, middle-aged woman strolling past
a pan-Asian restaurant in Sherman Oaks. "There's the dad from 'Eight
Is Enough.' "</TE>
<TE>   And so it was. Dick Van Patten, sitting with his family, munching
on what appeared to be an eggroll.</TE>
<TE>   At Nat's Early Bite Coffee Shop, owner Hugo Carlos serves French
toast and scrambled eggs to regulars such as Tom Selleck and Ike
Turner (whose color glossy hangs on the wall, inviting diners to join
the "I Still Like Ike Fan Club").</TE>
<TE>   "We get celebrities every day," Carlos said.</TE>
<TE>   The Van Nuys restaurant--situated in a packed parking lot next to
a dry cleaner and a video store--even attracts "huge names like John
Stamos, Geena Davis and that guy from the movie 'Booty Call,' but I
can't remember his name," Carlos said. "Bruce Willis' mother has come
in too." In the Valley, one degree of separation counts.</TE>
<TE>   He poured a customer a cup of coffee and wiped ketchup off a
table. "I don't know if Bruce Willis has come in here," he said,
shrugging. "He probably lives on the other side of the hill. That's
where the really huge celebrities live."</TE>
<TE>   While A-listers George Clooney, Samuel Jackson, Will Smith and Kim
Basinger do have Valley digs, "We don't run into too many who say,
'Show me a place in the Valley,'" said Stephen Shapiro, who sells
homes to celebrities for the Westside Estate Agency. "They buy into a
location that fits their image." Malibu, say, or the canyons above
Sunset.</TE>
<TE>   To the dismay of Valley boosters, the area's image remains that of
a smoggy redoubt for Hollywood's has-beens, wannabes, up-and-comers
and longshots, as well as porn stars, soap opera divas and graying
rockers. Or as Jay Leno once joked on NBC's "Tonight Show," the
Valley could be renamed "Unknown Actorville."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the campaign to break the Valley off from Los Angeles
say the abundance of B-listers and behind-the-scenes Industry workers
adds luster to 818 (an area code and sometimes-condescending synonym
for the Valley).</TE>
<TE>   "The real Hollywood is in the Valley," said Richard Close,
chairman of Valley VOTE, the group spearheading secession. "Clearly,
there are a number of Westside snobs.... But if the Valley becomes
its own city, we can change the identity."</TE>
<TE>   And invite more A-listers to call it home. "We'd offer them free
limo rides," joked Carlos Ferreyra, a Valley VOTE board member.</TE>
<TE>   Seriously, Ferreyra said, a Valley city could attract top names in
entertainment by doing more to nurture local culture. As a bonus, he
added, celebrities who jump on the secession bandwagon could get free
publicity.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a historic movement,'' Ferreyra said. "It could become
the place for A-listers."</TE>
<TE>   But it's got a ways to go. Valley-bashing comments from the likes
of former Van Nuys resident Robert Redford still sting. "When we
moved to the Valley, I felt like I was being tossed into quicksand,"
Redford said in a 1990 Times article recalling his teen years. "There
was no culture."</TE>
<TE>   Now, though, the local culture is enriched by the likes of dimmed
TV luminaries Kate Jackson, William Shatner, David Hasselhoff,
Shirley Jones, Mackenzie Phillips, Ed Asner, Todd Bridges and Erik
Estrada, as well as the more-current Lucy Lawless, Damon Wayans,
Laura San Giacomo and teen twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. All have
put down Valley roots.</TE>
<TE>   But it is Begley (remember him in the films "Get Over It" and
"Hounded"?) who seems to pop up in every corner of the Valley. See
him carrying a baby past the fickle fountains at Universal CityWalk.
Or waiting at a bus stop on Ventura Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   There's the tall, bespectacled actor, presiding over the opening
of a Whole Foods Market in Porter Ranch, where he's surrounded by
pineapples, mangoes, a 6-foot loaf of French bread and orange
balloons pulled into the shape of a big carrot.</TE>
<TE>   "People here are anesthetized to the thrill of seeing a
celebrity," said Begley, who grew up in Van Nuys and lives in a
two-bedroom, solar-powered house in Studio City. "You can go about
your day."</TE>
<TE>   Actors can go about their days because Starline Tours' buses skip
the Valley when cruising past celebrity homes. Except for stops at
the Universal Studios theme park, "we don't take people to the Valley
because there's nothing there to show," said Vahid Sapir, president
of the excursion company.</TE>
<TE>   The Zagat guide also skims quickly through the Valley. Only two of
the 46 Los Angeles-area nightspots it lists as star-gazing favorites
are in the Valley (Casa Vega in Sherman Oaks and Ca' del Sole in
North Hollywood).</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there are real celebrities who live there," said Tom
Williams, the guide's co-editor. "But telling people to go to the
Valley is like saying, 'Let's go party in New Jersey.' "</TE>
<TE>   Such snobbery has existed since Hollywood's beginnings, when movie
makers flocked to the Valley's open spaces to build studios.</TE>
<TE>   "At parties, big stars would ask me where I lived," recalled actor
Marsha Hunt, a Sherman Oaks resident since 1934, who starred in
"Pride and Prejudice" and "The Human Comedy." "When I told them, the
big stars would turn up their noses and say, 'Oh, the Valley.' Then
they'd walk away."</TE>
<TE>   But for those infatuated with stars of any wattage, the Valley is
the place to be. People who might have no chance of dining near Julia
Roberts or Mick Jagger at Moomba in West Hollywood can chat with
Virginia Madsen at an Italian dive on Riverside Drive in Sherman
Oaks. Or Danny Bonaduce outside a drugstore in Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   They can shake hands with former "A-Team" star Mr. T at a Sherman
Oaks street festival. They can dine at Vitello's Italian Restaurant,
the Studio City site where Robert Blake's wife ate her last supper
before she was shot to death, a crime many Angelenos sniff at as "so
818." They can watch a Van Nuys jury acquit an unshaven C. Thomas
Howell of criminal charges stemming from a confrontation with a
Reseda skateboarder.</TE>
<TE>   And they can go nuts over Alyson Hannigan at a Burbank karaoke
bar.</TE>
<TE>   'Omigod!" Christine Rizkowsky shrieked.</TE>
<TE>   Near the dance floor at Dimples, sipping a drink, was Hannigan,
who co-stars on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and played the band-camp
girl in the "American Pie" movies.</TE>
<TE>   Rizkowsky rushed over to the thin, young actress and gushed,
"You're so pretty and talented.... I can't believe I'm standing here
next to you."</TE>
<TE>   Then the 19-year-old hugged Hannigan while a friend snapped a
picture.</TE>
<TE>   The encounter sealed Rizkowsky's decision to move from San Diego
to Burbank to pursue her acting ambitions. "It was so exciting to see
someone famous," she said. "I want a part of that."</TE>
<TE>   Star-seekers shop at Maxsons Drugs in Sherman Oaks, where Tim
Conway was eyed hunting for a bathing suit. They've also stolen
glimpses of customers Alex Trebek, Barbara Eden, Loni Anderson, James
Eckhouse and Bernadette Peters.</TE>
<TE>   "We get celebrities all the time," said Gina Compton, a Maxsons
makeup artist who orders foundation for Ann Jillian. "We're used to
it."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Hanks used to go to Maxsons. Then he made it big and moved
over the hill.</TE>
<TE>   But Peter Scolari, Hanks' other half in the early '80s sitcom
"Bosom Buddies," has been spotted in a Ventura Boulevard cafe and at
a high school carnival in Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley is where, on many a Sunday morning, heads turn as a
middle-aged man with mussed hair buzzes by on a bike in the canyons
north of Mulholland Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Begley Jr. is everywhere.</TE>

<HD>Stuff the Sausage Casings in Favor of Better Biomaterials</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What do kidney dialysis and processed meat have in common? The
answer: sausage casings!</LD>
<LD>   Back in the '30s, the Dutch doctor Willem Kolff was trying to
build an artificial kidney and was desperately seeking a substance to
use for tubing. It needed to be able to hold blood but porous enough
so that waste products such as urea would diffuse right through it.</LD>
<LD>   Artificial sausage casings made of chemically modified cellulose
fit the bill. (Kolff's colleagues thought he was rather eccentric,
but he ended up inventing the dialysis machine.)</LD>
<TE>   Kolff is just one of many medical inventors who've waxed creative
over the years. They've used mattress stuffing and industrial
lubricants in breast implants, textiles such as Dacron and velour to
make artery grafts and materials found in ladies' girdles for parts
of artificial hearts. "Without people doing these things, we never
would have seen the enormous progress we've seen," says Robert
Langer, professor of chemical and biomedical engineering at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</TE>
<TE>   But there can also be drawbacks to getting medical inspiration
from one's breakfast hot links or lingerie. Those materials weren't
designed with the medical purpose in mind and thus can be less than
perfect for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Dialysis tubing, for instance, can cause blood clots to form.
Dacron grafts can only get so narrow before (again) clotting becomes
a problem.</TE>
<TE>   Thus it may make sense to design biomaterials from scratch, Langer
says, so you can brainstorm precisely the properties you want.</TE>
<TE>   Langer's been doing that ever since he was a hospital chemical
engineer in the '70s and observing how medical materials were
derived. "I just thought, gee, we could do better," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Suppose, for example, you want some kind of fancy biomaterial
that'll allow you to deliver a medicine slowly, over a period of
time. Langer designed just such a substance from scratch using the
following reasoning:</TE>
<TE>   * You want to embed the medicine in a substance that disintegrates
slowly from the outside, releasing the drug as it does so.</TE>
<TE>   * The substance should be nontoxic (of course) and "hydrophobic,"
or water-hating, so the drug inside is protected from release all at
once.</TE>
<TE>   * It should be held together by chemical bonds that can be slowly
chipped away. It's better to use bonds degraded by water rather than
by one of our body's enzymes, because amounts of enzymes can vary a
lot between people, whereas we're all chock-full of water.</TE>
<TE>   * Different drugs need to be released at different rates, a goal
that is niftily achieved by mixing two different substances together
with different ratios.</TE>
<TE>   The substance that Langer came up with after a lot of cooking in
the chem lab is being used to slowly deliver chemotherapy to people
with a certain kind of brain cancer. Other futuristic substances and
methods are in the works in Langer's lair--such as smart medical
chips that could be embedded under the skin to deliver different
drugs when needed. (A diabetic, for instance, could get a squirt of
insulin every time the chip sensed that sugar levels were getting too
high.)</TE>
<TE>   And the lab has come up with a "Star Trek"-like method for getting
drugs into people and samples of blood chemicals out of them without
piercing the skin. (Could jabbing people with needles one day seem
medieval?) You apply a surge of ultrasound, which alters the skin's
structure and makes it porous for a second. Drugs go in, sugar and
cholesterol samples come out. (Normally, only small chemicals such as
nicotine can get across the skin barrier.) The method, in clinical
trials right now, is harmless, Langer says. "And it doesn't
hurt--I've had it done to myself."</TE>
<TE>   "Smart sutures" are also in Langer's cookbook. Anyone with a kid
will have seen those squooshy blobs shaped like hands that stick on
walls and that can be manhandled yet miraculously regain their shape.</TE>
<TE>   Langer and co-workers have developed biomedical materials that
"remember" their shape as well--and, oh, how handy they could be.
Imagine threading a thing that looks like a piece of string through a
narrow incision in a body. Once inside, ta da! Warmed by body heat,
the string alters its form--not into a hand (though that would be
feasible, to say nothing of startling) but into a knot that deftly
ties itself.</TE>
<TE>   Langer and colleagues have made such biodegradable sutures and
used them to tie up wounds in a rat. But why stop with a knot? "You
could make it from whatever shape you want--maybe a string that turns
into a stent to keep blood vessels open, like one of those Chinese
finger puzzles," Langer says. "You can put all kinds of small things
through tiny incisions and they can convert to whatever shape you
want. It'll change the way we do medicine."</TE>

<HD>Cancer Rates to Triple in Those Over 75</HD>
<DH>Report* As the U.S. population ages, more people will
develop the disease. The overall rate is expected to double, cancer
society says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DELTHIA RICKS</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cancer incidence is expected to double during the next 50 years for
Americans, and the greatest burden will be among those 75 and older,
whose cancer rates will nearly triple because of their unprecedented
ranks in the population, according to a report released last week.</LD>
<LD>   The number of people who will develop some form of cancer will
rise from the current 1.3 million people per year to 2.6 million by
2050. The increases, which are expected to occur steadily in the
coming decades, are because of a large aging population that will
live longer and ultimately encounter cancer, medical experts predict.</LD>
<LD>   "Cancer is a disease of aging," said Dr. Michael Thun, who heads
epidemiologic research for the American Cancer Society. "With
longevity people will live into the ages when cancer is more likely
to occur."</LD>
<TE>   The report, which appears in the current issue of Cancer, a
publication of the American Cancer Society, is a joint research
effort of the society, the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the North American Assn. of
Central Cancer Registries.</TE>
<TE>   News of the rising number of diagnoses comes even as the same
group of researchers found that cancer incidence continued on a
steady decline that began in 1973. Researchers used 2000 census data
and current information on cancer incidence rates to project what the
cancer picture will be like during the next 48 years.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Brenda Edwards, associate director of surveillance programs at
the cancer institute and chief author of the report, said the leading
cancer types in the next half-century will be the same as today's:
lung, breast, prostate and colon.</TE>
<TE>   "We are aging faster than our improved abilities of diagnosis and
treatment," Edwards said. She underscored that treatment strategies
in the coming years, however, will help older people live longer,
productive lives.</TE>
<TE>   The population of people most likely to develop cancer are those
75 and older. By 2050, more than 1.1 million people in that age group
will develop some form of the disease each year. Currently, that
number is 400,000 per year.</TE>
<TE>   Thun said much of the increase will be because of unprecedented
demographic trends.</TE>
<TE>   Between now and mid-century, for example, people 85 and older are
expected to have increased fourfold. As people age, the report
underscored, so too will their need for cancer treatment services.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers said more doctors will be needed to treat the growing
number of cancer patients. Already, cancer centers and medical
schools are bracing for the increase.</TE>
<TE>   "We're putting a huge focus on this patient population," said Dr.
Arti Hurria, a geriatric oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in Manhattan. "One thing that is happening now is that
we are training people in both fields." Hurria was referring to
geriatrics, the specialty that focuses on people 65 and older, and
oncology, the area of medicine that centers on cancer treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Hurria said the plan is to focus on patients' functional age: that
is, their level of independence and individual physical strengths.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to get away from looking at chronological age alone
because two 75-year-olds can be very different people," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Norman H. Edelman, vice president of the health sciences
center and dean of the medical school at SUNY Stony Brook, said the
school has just received funding for a geriatric education center,
which will be run out of its department of medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a program conducted throughout the entire school of
medicine," he said. "We're training people in all areas, and cancer
is a major part of this."</TE>
<TE>   Geriatric-focused medicine is important, he said, because it
zeroes in on the specific needs of patients.</TE>

<HD>Stepping High, Not Faster, for Better Aerobic Fitness</HD>

<LD>When step-class teachers pump up the speed of stepping along with the
volume, it not only makes it harder to follow the routine, it puts
people at risk of orthopedic injuries. The Aerobic and Fitness Assn.
of America recommends a cadence of 118 to 128 beats per minute, not
the 125 to 133 beats a minute that one survey found is often taught.
But keeping step classes safe doesn't sacrifice fitness, according to
a recent study of 30 women at Southwest Texas State University in San
Marcos.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike previous research that looked at the body's response to
simply stepping up and down from a bench, this study monitored
volunteer students as they moved their arms and stepped on and off 6-
and 8-inch benches in a choreographed routine, just as they would in
an aerobic dance step class. Their responses were also measured when
they worked out at two different cadences, of 125 and 130 beats per
minute.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers found that the intensity of the workout was not
affected by the cadence, but it did increase when the height of the
step was increased a mere two inches. Heart rate, for instance, rose
by 10 beats per minute on average. Taller and more fit people may
need the higher bench to get the most from step exercise, report the
researchers.</LD>

<TE>   Intelligence, Length of Breast-Feeding Linked</TE>
<TE>   Several studies have shown that breast-feeding is positively
associated with intellectual development in young children, but now
researchers have taken a look at what happens when breast-fed babies
grow up.</TE>
<TE>   Information on a very large group of children born in Denmark
between 1959 and 1961, all of whom were breast-fed for different
periods of time, gave researchers the unique opportunity to track the
IQ scores of about 3,000 of them as young adults.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found a "robust" association between the length of
time a baby was breast-fed and his or her intelligence as an adult.
Babies who were switched to formula after less than a month didn't
score as high on IQ tests as those who nursed for two months. Those
breast-fed less than one month had an average adult IQ of 99.4. Those
nursed two to three months scored 101.7.</TE>
<TE>   And the longer a child was breast-fed the smarter he or she
was--that is, up to a point, which seemed to be about nine months.
Those who nursed for four to six months had an average adult IQ of
102.3; those who nursed for six to nine months had an average IQ of
106. After nine months, the average IQ was 104.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the large numbers of people in the study, the
researchers were able to statistically eliminate factors that might
have an impact on IQ, such as the mother's age, education and social
status.</TE>
<TE>   Among several theories to explain the link to intelligence is that
breastfeeding may be an indication of how much time a mother spends
interacting with a child after the first year.</TE>
<TE>   Another explanation is that there are substances in breast milk,
like the fatty acid DHA, that were not in infant formula or cow's
milk in the early 1960s. DHA (docosahexanenoic acid) is believed to
have a role in transmitting nerve signals in the brain. Today's
formulas contain a precursor to DHA.</TE>

<TE>   Fibromyalgia May Be Disturbed Reaction to Stress and Pain</TE>
<TE>   More is known about what fibromyalgia syndrome isn't than what it
is. It's not arthritis, because the joints don't hurt--the muscles
do. It's not chronic fatigue syndrome, even though that, too, is a
condition that causes generalized pain.</TE>
<TE>   There is growing evidence that fibromyalgia is a disturbance in
the body's reaction to stress and pain that involves a complex
interplay of abnormal hormonal responses. Oregon Health &amp; Science
University researchers in Portland recently reported that women with
fibromyalgia have a defect in growth hormone secretion and suggest
that a drug long used to treat myasthenia gravis may correct it.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, 20 women with fibromyalgia and 10 healthy women
walked quickly on a treadmill until they were exhausted.
Growth-hormone levels went up in the healthy women but not in those
with fibromyalgia. However, when the women were given the stress test
again after taking Mestinon, a drug that inhibits the hormone
somatostatin, those with fibromyalgia had an increase in the growth
hormone similar to that of the healthy women. The women could have
abnormally high levels of somatostatin, which inhibits their ability
to secrete the needed growth hormone.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be that in the past these women had so much stress or
trauma that they overstressed their stress response and their
reaction has diminished," says Robert Bennett, professor of medicine
at OHSU, who conducted the study.</TE>

<TE>   Specialists Heat Up a Safe Alternative to Back Surgery</TE>
<TE>   When all else fails to remedy chronic disc-related low back pain,
some people turn to surgery as a last resort. Five years ago, two
back specialists who favor nonsurgical treatment for back pain
devised a therapy called IDET (intradiscal electrothermal treatment)
that they believed offered a safe alternative. Two studies confirmed
the short-term success of the therapy for people with very specific
kinds of disc problems, and this month the third study--a two-year
follow-up of 58 people--has been published.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers who developed the therapy found that two-thirds of
those with disc problems improved 50% and maintained the improvement
for two years. When the therapy was effective, the patients' pain
continued to diminish over the years, and their functional ability
improved.Intradiscal electrothermal treatment involves the insertion,
using a needle, of a tiny tube into the outer wall of the disc. At
the end of the tube is a heating element that reaches about 170
degrees. The heat toughens and seals the disc and destroys abnormal
nerve endings. A local anesthetic is used for the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   "People who were too uncomfortable to do rehabilitation exercises
can do them after IDET, and that may be responsible for the
improvement," says Jeffrey A. Saal, associate clinical professor in
the department of functional restoration at Stanford University
Medical Center. "IDET buys people some time as well. If we can stop
the degeneration for a few years, it might stop itself."</TE>
<TE>   Saal says he and brother Joel Saal have performed the treatment on
about 2,000 people and that about 40,000 people have had the
procedure worldwide. The therapy was approved by the FDA in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   An editorial commenting on the study points out that an important
next step is to compare the therapy to two other treatments, surgery
and steroid injections.</TE>

<HD>How Sweet It Is: If You're Eating Carbs, Check an Index</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB CONDOR</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone's training table needs carbohydrates; there's no argument
about that. Our bodies convert carbohydrates to glycogen, which
serves as our main fuel in muscles.</LD>
<LD>   The hottest debate about carbs focuses on how many you need in
your diet compared with amounts of protein and fat. For most active
people, consuming 55% to 65% carbohydrates, plus 15% to 20% protein
and 20% to 25% fat, are ideal ranges.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, more than a few nutritionists say Americans are
missing a more fundamental question about carbohydrates: Just which
ones are best for feeling good and increasing energy? In the 1970s,
carbohydrates were divided into simple or complex groups.
Nutritionists suggested eating mostly complex carbs, such as produce
and beans, while avoiding the simple sugars in table sugar and
sweets.</LD>
<TE>   Then in the early 1980s, University of Toronto researcher David
Jenkins discovered some complex carbohydrate foods actually rushed
their way into the bloodstream. Foods such as potatoes and rice led
to a fast rise in blood sugar or blood glucose, followed by the
matching rapid drop in glucose levels. Jenkins' intention was to
discover the best foods for people with diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   He created the glycemic index, which measures how fast
carbohydrates in a certain food convert to glucose, which then enters
the bloodstream and muscles (as glycogen). The glycemic index
basically tracks how fast your blood sugar rises after eating
carbohydrate-dense foods, such as fruits, vegetables, grains and
processed foods (pasta, bread, cereals, crackers and cookies are
measured most often).</TE>
<TE>   In his first study, Jenkins listed values for a variety of foods.
The value of glucose (a simple sugar) was 100. All other foods were
matched against it and slotted as low-, medium- or high-glycemic
foods. More than 300 foods have been cataloged.</TE>
<TE>   Other glycemic indexes were produced, using white bread as the 100
value because it is a common food among Americans. If you are ever
confused about why certain foods have different glycemic index
values, that's why. Other times you may see a food higher in one
listing than another. Whether the food is cooked or raw can change
values; the same goes for ripeness. An unripe banana is about 30
points lower in glycemic effect than a ripe one.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the glycemic index recommend eating carbohydrate
foods lower on this scale for optimal health. Some champions of the
index, including nationally known authors, contend that using the
rating system is the best way to lose weight and feel healthy. Janet
Rankin, a professor in the human nutrition, foods and exercise
department at Virginia Tech, isn't that enthralled with the glycemic
index.</TE>
<TE>   "People tend to overuse the glycemic index," she said. "It is more
valuable at snack time, since that is when we tend to eat single food
items."</TE>
<TE>   In general, Rankin said, Americans consume lots of high glycemic
foods, such as white bread and bagels. Recognizing high-glycemic
foods can help you make better choices. Or you can alter the food's
sugar effect by combining it with low-glycemic foods. For example,
Rankin said drinking a glass of nonfat milk with your bagel
"significantly lowers the glycemic value."</TE>
<TE>   Rankin said high-glycemic foods are most valuable during exercise:
"Research shows these foods do their job by getting glucose into the
bloodstream quickly when you need it."</TE>
<TE>   The studies are less clear about consuming high-glycemic foods
after a workout, though some nutritionists suggest this is about as
good a time as any to munch on a sugary treat because your body needs
the carbs for recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Benardot, associate dean of nutrition research at Georgia
State University, said the glycemic index is a clearly designed
instrument but can be confusing in "how to apply it" to everyday
eating.</TE>
<TE>   Benardot said the single best change you can make in your daily
diet is reducing the size of meals. He proposes eating six small
meals rather than three larger ones. This matches up best with the
typical blood-glucose cycle of rise, level out and fall.</TE>
<TE>   If you eat more frequently, your body has a more controlled
response to foods. Going too long between meals or snacks causes your
body to pump out more insulin when you do eat, Benardot said, a
condition that causes too much flux in blood glucose.</TE>
<TE>   Nutritionists generally recommend eating more foods low or
moderate on the index (less than 50) and selecting more healthy foods
among those high on the index. Here are some sample glycemic values,
using glucose as the 100-point comparison value.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast: Cornflakes, 83; Rice Krispies, 82; doughnuts, 76;
waffles, 76; Total, 76; Cheerios, 74; bagel, 72; oatmeal, 49; yogurt,
sweetened, 33; soy milk, 30.</TE>
<TE>   Lunch: White bread, 71; whole wheat bread, 69; taco shells, 68;
cheese pizza, 60; white pita bread, 57; green peas, 48; baked beans,
43.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner: Instant rice, 91; white rice, 88 (some versions as low as
55); baked potato, 83; spaghetti, 40; black beans, 30.</TE>
<TE>   Snacks: Vanilla wafers, 77; orange soda, 68; angel food cake, 67;

<LD>One of the most widely used diabetes drugs may be incorrectly
prescribed to one-fourth of the patients taking it, causing
potentially life-threatening complications, a new study warns.</LD>
<LD>   The drug, metformin (Glucophage), can trigger a buildup of lactic
acid in the blood of patients with poor kidney function or congestive
heart failure. The condition, called lactic acidosis, is fatal in
nearly half of cases.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
who studied the prescriptions of 100 diabetic patients, found that
nearly one in four people who took metformin had either limited
kidney function or congestive heart failure. "We were surprised the
numbers were so high," said Dr. Russell Rothman, a study co-author
and a health researcher at the university.</LD>
<TE>   The findings were reported in last week's Journal of the American
Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   More than 25 million prescriptions were written for metformin in
2000; the drug helps lower the blood's sugar level.</TE>
<TE>   The drug's package insert carries a warning alerting doctors to
this potential complication. "Most physicians don't bother to read
the package inserts," says Rothman. "We prescribe thousands of drugs
so it's very hard to keep up with all the contraindications."</TE>
<TE>   Lactic acidosis triggered by metformin is quite rare, however, and
occurs in only one in 10,000 cases. Consequently, "patients shouldn't
blow this out of proportion," says Dr. Christopher D. Saudek,
president of the American Diabetes Assn. and professor of medicine at
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. "They should talk to their
doctors before making any changes in their medications."</TE>

<HD>Whether Farmed or Wild, Salmon Is Rich in Omega-3</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHELDON MARGEN and DALE A. OGAR</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's time to answer some of the mail that has piled up on our desks
and in our electronic mailboxes. Here are some reader questions we
hope will interest you as well.</LD>
<LD>   Question: My cardiologist says that farmed Atlantic salmon is not
a source of omega-3, that I must use canned salmon or wild salmon.
Not only are those types of salmon expensive, they're also hard to
find.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: It is true that in oceans and lakes, fish get omega-3
fatty acids from eating algae. But farmed fish also eat algae and, in
general, have as much omega-3 as do wild fish. They tend to be fatter
(three to five times as much fat); thus the proportion of omega-3 to
other fat may be lower.</LD>
<TE>   For example, in wild fish, omega-3 fatty acids account for about
one-third of the total fat in the fish, compared with about one-fifth
of the fat in farmed fish. But the amount of omega-3 you'd get in a
serving would be about the same because the farmed fish has more fat
to begin with.</TE>
<TE>   Evidently, fish just won't grow and thrive unless they have
omega-3 in their diets. So the farmed fish have to be fed algae or
fish oil to make sure that they get it just as they would in the
wild. Since fish vary tremendously in the amount of fat (and omega-3)
they contain, it's always a good idea to eat a variety of fish,
especially the fatty ones.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you have information about a recent Swedish study on
acrylamides in fried foods? This seems to be a significant health
issue.</TE>
<TE>   A: It's probably just as well that you haven't been able to find
out much about this study. We actually thought it got more publicity
than it deserved. The short answer to your question is that this is
not something you should worry about. The study, which hasn't yet
been published, did not show anything that should cause people to
change their eating habits.</TE>
<TE>   For those who missed this particular round of scary headlines,
researchers in Sweden showed that fried or baked starchy foods (such
as potatoes, bread, cereal and crackers) were found to contain high
levels of an animal carcinogen known as acrylamide.</TE>
<TE>   We have long known that high-heat cooking can produce a number of
chemical compounds, some of which are carcinogenic. But, of course,
deep-fried foods should be eaten only in moderation--you'd have to
eat huge quantities before acrylamide became the biggest problem
you'd have with these foods.</TE>
<TE>   We still maintain that eating such foods as bread, pasta,
breakfast cereal and other complex carbohydrates is a good idea; this
study should not dissuade you from including them in your diet.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is food cooked in a microwave oven less healthy than food
cooked in a conventional oven?</TE>
<TE>   A: In the early days of microwave ovens, some people worried that
the seals around the doors were not sufficient to keep the microwaves
themselves from leaking out, and that someone standing directly in
front of the oven watching the miracle of cooking might be exposed.
Although that was never a very big problem, the new generations of
microwaves have better seals.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of cooking process, there is no danger from the
microwaves themselves. In a microwave, vegetables can be cooked in a
small amount of water in a short amount of time. This is good because
it preserves the nutrients in the same way steaming does.</TE>
<TE>   Some caution is appropriate, however. If you are cooking raw meat,
you must check carefully to make sure that it is fully cooked because
microwaves do not always cook evenly.</TE>
<TE>   If you are using the microwave for reheating cooked food, the same
caution is necessary.</TE>

<LD>Some health problems can't be prevented, but many others--with good
habits--can be reduced or avoided completely. A perfect example is
found in our mouths.</LD>
<LD>   We all get one set of permanent teeth, but what happens to these
teeth as we age depends in large part on the care we give them
through the years.</LD>
<LD>   The idea is simple: The more you brush and floss, the less likely
you are to get cavities and gum disease. And the fewer cavities and
gum problems you have, the better your chance of skipping hours in
the dentist's chair. You're also less likely to develop adult dental
problems, such as the need for crowns, dentures and gum surgery (all
of which can involve lots of time, money and pain). By taking care of
your teeth now, you improve the chances of keeping a healthy smile as
you grow.</LD>
<TE>   Cavities are caused by a combination of factors, such as diet, how
long the food is in contact with the teeth and brushing habits, says
Dr. Richard Udin, chairman of pediatric dentistry at USC.</TE>
<TE>   When we eat, the bacteria in the mouth turns the sugar in food
into acid. Because sweets such as cookies and candy have the most
sugar, it's especially important to limit how much of them we eat.
But starchy foods too, such as breads and pasta, are also sources of
sugar.</TE>
<TE>   "Over a period of time, the acid will eat away at the tooth
enamel," Udin says.</TE>
<TE>   Once the acid works it way through the enamel, the tooth begins to
decay. A dentist must remove the decay with a drill and replace it
with a filling. Left untreated, a cavity can cause serious damage to
the tooth.</TE>
<TE>   By brushing your teeth as soon as possible after eating, you
remove the acid before it has a chance to cause decay. Ideally, you
should brush after all meals and snacks. (When this isn't possible,
at least rinse your mouth out with water.) Kids should floss once a
day to remove plaque between the teeth and under the gums. It's also
important to visit the dentist twice a year for a cleaning and exam.</TE>
<TE>   These days, dentists often recommend that kids get dental
sealants, a plastic coating that protects the biting surfaces of the
teeth, where most cavities develop.</TE>
<TE>   Udin also suggests that kids use a fluoride rinse for children.
(Swish the rinse around, then spit it out without swallowing any.)</TE>
<TE>   Fluoride toothpastes also are recommended. You just need a tiny
amount, and, again, rinse well and don't swallow it.</TE>
<TE>   These good habits will give you a happier mouth, whether you're a
kid, teenager or adult.</TE>
<TE>   As Udin points out: "You can get cavities at any age."</TE>

<HD>Medicare Warily Eyes Treatment for Macular Degeneration</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRUDY LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two-thirds of all Americans have never heard of macular degeneration,
the leading cause of blindness in Americans over age 65. As we live
longer, however, chances are that some of us will learn firsthand
about this incurable eye disease that robs people of their central
vision.</LD>
<LD>   So when a new experimental treatment came along that promised to
stop vision loss, it was no surprise that many doctors and patient
advocates began to clamor that the therapy be covered by health
insurance programs. After all, the eye disease affects nearly 2
million adults over age 65.</LD>
<LD>   The treatment, called ocular photodynamic therapy, is used to
treat patients with the "wet," or more serious form, of macular
degeneration. Blood vessels in the eye grow abnormally, leaking
fluid, then forming lesions that result in sudden and severe loss of
sight. Each year about 200,000 people are diagnosed with wet macular
degeneration. Some lesions are easy to detect.</LD>
<TE>   Those are the "classic" kind. The occult variety are less defined
and harder to spot.</TE>
<TE>   With photodynamic therapy, a doctor injects a patient with the
drug verteporfin, or Visudyne. A laser activates the drug, which
temporarily seals the leaking blood vessels. The blood vessels
eventually reopen after several months, however, and several
treatments are needed. Dr. Kirk Packo, a Chicago ophthalmologist,
says most patients require five treatments over two years, each
costing $2,200--or a total of about $11,000. Follow-up care is also
necessary, which adds another $3,000 or so to the cost.</TE>
<TE>   The treatment is not a cure for macular degeneration but some
scientists contend that it can significantly benefit patients by
delaying the onset of blindness. And the Food and Drug Administration
has approved verteporfin for treating the disease. Sound like a
slam-dunk case for coverage by health insurers? Not exactly. Things
in science--or in government rule-making--are never that easy.</TE>
<TE>   The photodynamic therapy is prompting a dispute between government
scientists and patient advocates over just how effective the
treatment really is and whether the federal Medicare program should
pay for it. The outcome of the debate is important to patients with
macular degeneration and their families because medical treatments
approved for Medicare often are later covered by private health
insurers.</TE>
<TE>   That's why experts say it's crucial that strong scientific
evidence supports expensive new technology. But as so often happens,
politics cloud the picture with doctors, patient advocates and the
medical industry lobbying for coverage of every new procedure that
comes along.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the FDA approved verteporfin, the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that runs the Medicare
program, said it would cover the treatment and drug for patients with
classic lesions. Six months later, the Vitreous Society, an
organization representing retinal disease specialists, asked the
centers to cover treatment for occult lesions.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the centers agreed to pay for the treatment, saying in
a press release that the expansion of coverage could affect as many
as 70,000 new patients</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, federal officials had a change of heart after
hearing complaints about the validity of a research study that had
been instrumental in the original decision. The clinical study that
the centers relied on contained "some significant methodological
flaws,'' says Dr. Sean Tunis, director of Medicare's coverage and
analysis group.</TE>
<TE>   Tunis says the study by researchers at several universities,
including Johns Hopkins medical school in Baltimore, and published
last year in the American Journal of Ophthalmology, failed to
demonstrate its main objective: that the drug-laser therapy helped to
arrest the downward course of the disease in patients after a year of
therapy. The study did find, however, that, after two years of
treatment, patients who underwent the therapy had less vision loss
than those who did not.</TE>
<TE>   But Tunis says it was not clear if the two-year result was an
actual benefit of the treatment or a statistical anomaly. Moreover,
he noted that 5% of patients in the study had a sudden loss of vision
after undergoing the treatment, compared to no sudden vision loss in
study participants who did not have the therapy.</TE>
<TE>   But several advocacy groups, including the Vitreous Society, the
Alliance for Aging Research, the American Macular Degeneration
Foundation and the American Council for the Blind, are determined to
get the federal agency to reverse its decision again.</TE>
<TE>   They've hired a Washington, D.C., public relations firm to help
them. They contend that the treatment benefits patients by slowing
the advance of the disease, and thus the disability and loss of
personal independence that comes from blindness. They also argue that
if Medicare doesn't pay for treatment, only the rich will be able to
afford it.</TE>
<TE>   "We've said this is not a magic bullet but so what?" says Charles
Crawford, executive director of the American Council for the Blind.
If the procedure can enable someone to live a more normal life for
two to five years, he says, "isn't it worth it?" Officials at the
centers say the agency does not consider cost when deciding which
medical treatments the Medicare program should cover. Several years
ago, when Medicare officials tried to weigh cost along with
scientific evidence, patient advocacy groups protested, saying
treatments--typically ones that served their particular
interests--should be covered without regard to cost.</TE>
<TE>   Often, these groups get financial support from drug companies or
medical device firms, which may mount their own publicity campaigns
to generate demand for their products in hopes of eventually getting
private or government insurers to cover their treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Novartis Opthalmics, the maker of Visudyne, is encouraging older
adults to have eye exams and to receive therapy, if appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Its campaign includes magazine advertisements, a media tour by
actress Lauren Bacall and an Internet site that asks people to sign
up for more information about Visudyne.</TE>
<TE>   "The campaign is not really about a drug," says Shelly Spoeth, of
the Atlanta office of Ketchum, a large public relations firm that is
handling the Novartis account. "It's a nonbranded awareness
campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Visudyne is the only drug available for use with ocular
photodynamic therapy, and the market potential is huge as millions of
baby boomers are set to hit age 50 and beyond. The controversy over
whether the government should pay for photodynamic therapy is just
the beginning of many debates that will take place as new medical
treatments and technologies hit the market in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   How do we make sure people can get the medical treatments that
really work--and not just the ones that have the most special
interests aligned behind them? With medical insurance premiums rising
quickly, and the cost of health insurance unaffordable for many, it
is important that we find a better way to sift out new treatments
that are wasteful, inappropriate and, in some cases perhaps, just not
worth the cost.</TE>

<HD>Cancer-Remedy Maker Closes</HD>
<DH>Controversy* BotanicLab can't recover from the recall of
two herbal products and a class-action lawsuit over its prostate
treatment.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The maker of a controversial herbal treatment for prostate cancer has
announced it will go out of business June 1 because of financial
problems resulting from a voluntary recall of the small company's two
products and a pending class-action lawsuit against it.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a combination of the recall and being shut down for five
months. We just didn't have the financial capabilities," said Barre
Rorabauch, chief of operations for International Medical Research
Inc. of Brea, which does business as BotanicLab.</LD>
<LD>   The company produced PC SPES, a formula that contained eight herbs
used in treatment of prostate cancer, and SPES, marketed to boost
immune function. Several small studies found that PC SPES was
effective against late-stage prostate cancer.</LD>
<TE>   But in February, the company voluntarily withdrew both products
from the market after the California Department of Health Services
found traces of the prescription drug warfarin, a synthetic blood
thinner marketed as Coumadin, in PC SPES, and traces of the
prescription anti-anxiety drug alprazolam, known by the trade name
Xanax, in samples of SPES. The company denied that any prescription
drugs had been knowingly added to its products, which would be
illegal without approval from the Food and Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The same month, several prostate cancer survivors who had used PC
SPES filed a class-action suit against the company, its officers and
Sophie Chen, an associate research professor of medicine at New York
Medical College who developed PC SPES, alleging unlawful business
practices, false and misleading advertising, negligence and "medical
battery."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Dr. Robert Nagourney of Rational Therapeutics, a
treatment and research group in Long Beach, presented results from a
two-year analysis of PC SPES samples at the American Assn. of Cancer
Research meeting in San Francisco. The analysis found samples
contained varying amounts of DES, a synthetic female hormone that has
been used in treatment of prostate cancer; warfarin; and the
prescription anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. At least two other
labs also found traces of DES in PC SPES.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy has divided many prostate cancer survivors. "It's
very sad.... It saved many lives; it was a very good medication,"
said Charles Reinwald, chairman of the nonprofit Cancer Cure
Coalition in Scarsdale, N.Y. Reinwald estimated that about 10,000 men
had been using PC SPES, which was developed in the early 1990s. John
Tiedt of Moore, Winter, Skebba &amp; McLennan of Glendale, one of three
law firms representing plaintiffs in the class-action suit, said he
understood "the plight of those men."</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, some men suffered dangerous side effects, such as
excessive bleeding or blood clots, because of prescription drugs in
the formula of which they and their doctors knew nothing.</TE>

<HD>Next in Skin Cancer Fight: Protection From UVA Rays</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We've all heard that to protect our skin from the sun's aging effects
and cancer-causing rays, we should stay out of the sun. The next best
thing, of course, is to apply sunscreen or wear protective clothing.</LD>
<LD>   One thing that some people don't realize is that there are two
types of ultraviolet radiation that can age your skin and lead to
cancer, and the SPF ratings on most sunscreen lotions and sprays
address only one: the potent burning rays, or UVB.</LD>
<LD>   The higher the SPF rating on your sunscreen, the more short-wave
radiation, or UVB rays, it's keeping from your skin.</LD>
<TE>   Increasingly, though, dermatologists are concerned about the role
of long-wave ultraviolet radiation, the more penetrating rays known
as UVA radiation, as another source of burning rays and skin cancer
risk. These are the rays that penetrate below the epidermis of the
skin, into the dermis, where the body makes collagen and elastin that
provide skin's firmness and structure.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, there is no rating system in place to quantify how well
sunscreens shield us specifically from UVA radiation, which is the
main type that people are exposed to at tanning salons as well as
through sun exposure: solar radiation is about 95% UVA and 5% UVB.</TE>
<TE>   The American Academy of Dermatology has asked the Food and Drug
Administration to establish labeling standards for UVA sunscreen
ingredients similar to the SPF rating used for UVB.</TE>
<TE>   For now, it's up to consumers to find products that provide good
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Many products that block UVA rays contain physical sunscreens that
reflect, scatter or absorb light. They include zinc oxide, the pasty
white cream beachgoers smear on their cheeks and noses, and another
heavy cream called titanium dioxide.</TE>
<TE>   You might recognize on some labels the term "micronized zinc
oxide," which refers to a lighter version of zinc oxide. There's also
a newer chemical sunscreen, Parsol 1789, that absorbs UVA light.</TE>
<TE>   The jury is out on how well any of these products protect from UVA
rays.</TE>
<TE>   Products that claim on their labels to offer "broad spectrum"
UVA-UVB protection may not do enough to keep UVA rays from damaging
your skin, said Dr. Richard Glogau, a dermatologist at UC San
Francisco. "We've seen some [products] with SPF 30 and SPF 45 that
have poor and mediocre UVA protection."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Arnold Klein, a Beverly Hills dermatologist, also notes that
there haven't been scientific studies to show that micronized zinc or
titanium dioxide are good blockers of UVA radiation.</TE>
<TE>   Klein prefers mexoryl, a product derived from camphor that's
available for use in sunscreens in Europe but not yet in this
country. It's been shown in several European studies to offer
superior protection against a broad range of UVA radiation. This
product is available in the Anthelios sunscreen line made by France's
La Roche-Posay. The FDA is reviewing mexoryl for sunscreen use, but
for now you can buy Anthelios products in Canada or France, or from
foreign-based Internet sites.</TE>
<TE>   Dermatologists say people are much too sparing with sunscreens.
They recommend that people apply sunscreens with a rating of at least
SPF 15 as part of their daily ritual, before going to school or work,
and before outdoor activities. When outdoors, sunscreens should be
reapplied after 30 minutes in the sun and every couple of hours after
that, more if they rub off or after swimming.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, researchers are working on a sunscreen pill that could
make full-body sun protection even better.</TE>

<LD>Regardless of your age, the earlier you treat cancers and
precancerous conditions, the better the outcome, and the greater your
options for less-invasive therapy. The following are the major types
of cancers and treatment options:</LD>
<LD>   Actinic Keratosis</LD>
<LD>   A pre-cancer growth that appears on sun-exposed areas of the face
and hands as a scaly, rough, raised, red and occasionally bleeding
patch. It signals that skin cells are undergoing changes that could
lead to cancer. Up to 5% of these scaly growths will become squamous
cell carcinomas. President Bush had two such growths removed from his
face last August. Sometimes, this diagnosis reforms even the most
avid sun worshippers. Take Staci Howard, a 34-year-old Studio City
writer who never applied sunscreens in the years she nurtured a tan
on beaches and in tanning salons. Having an actinic keratosis removed
from her upper lip last year convinced her to give up tanning: "It
took me a long time to kind of grow up about this."</LD>
<TE>   Treatments: Most often, an actinic keratosis can be frozen off
with liquid nitrogen. It can be removed by surgical shaving, cutting
or lasering. Chemical peels with trichloroacetic acid or glycolic
acid can be effective in treatment and prevention. Nonsurgical
options include the repeated at-home application of 5-fluorouracil,
also known as 5FU or Efudex, which causes redness and inflammation.
Some doctors prescribe a less-irritating formulation, called Carac.</TE>
<TE>   Dermatologists cite a promising topical treatment called Aldara,
the brand name for imiquimod, previously used on genital warts. Dr.
David J. Leffell, a Yale University dermatologist, says Aldara is the
first in a new category of skin-cancer drugs that work by recruiting
the body's own disease-fighting systems to attack cancer cells. The
FDA has approved a topical version of an anti-inflammatory drug,
diclofenac, marketed as Solaraze, for actinic keratoses, and clinical
trials are examining whether the oral anti-inflammatory drug Celebrex
can eliminate them.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors treat small actinic keratoses with photodynamic therapy, a
two-step process that begins with the application of Levulan, which
is absorbed by the precancerous cells, followed 16 hours later by
exposure to a blue light that activates the drug and destroys the
cells. One session usually does the trick, but patients experience
some burning and discomfort afterward and sometimes encounter
difficulty getting insurers to cover it.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-acne, anti-wrinkle cream Retin A, one of the class of
vitamin A-related retinoids, eliminates actinic keratoses in many
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Basal Cell Carcinoma</TE>
<TE>   The most common skin malignancy, it affects about 800,000
Americans each year and accounts for about 75% of skin cancers. It is
rarely fatal. The condition is predominantly caused by sun exposure,
but doctors believe some people are genetically predisposed to it.
This slow-growing cancer often appears as a firm, flat, pale area or
as a small, pink or red shiny or waxy area. It often affects
fair-skinned people.</TE>
<TE>   Treatments: Superficial basal cell carcinomas respond well to
Aldara, said Dr. Arnold W. Klein, a Beverly Hills dermatologist.
Options include freezing with liquid nitrogen (which leaves a blister
and scar), radiation (a less attractive option in young patients),
scraping with a curet and destroying remaining cells with electric
needles, or vaporizing with lasers.</TE>
<TE>   You may want to find a dermatologist with specialized training in
Mohs micrographic surgery. This technique, covered by insurance,
allows the doctor to remove the cancerous growth and do instant
microscopic analysis to ensure that all the diseased tissue has been
removed, saving the patient the time and expense of waiting for lab
results and a possible repeat visit.</TE>
<TE>   Mohs surgery is preferred in delicate or difficult areas, such as
the nose, ears, around the eyes, forehead, fingers, genitals or where
cancer has recurred.</TE>
<TE>   Squamous Cell Carcinoma</TE>
<TE>   This appears as lumps or sometimes rough-looking or flat reddish
patches. The Skin Cancer Foundation estimates 200,000 U.S. cases are
diagnosed annually, accounting for about 20% of skin cancer, most
often on sun-exposed areas. Because it can invade the lymph nodes and
other tissues, it causes about 2,000 deaths each year.</TE>
<TE>   Treatments: It can be removed with simple excision, although that
typically requires removing more tissue than with Mohs surgery, which
gets the highest cure rates. Doctors may suggest electrodessication
and curettage, freezing or radiation. If it spreads, it may be
treated with systemic chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Yale's Leffell is optimistic that Dimericine, a cream containing
an enzyme that repairs damaged DNA, might be the long-sought
"morning-after" cream that could undo the solar ravages that produce
squamous cell carcinoma. He cited a study in which people with
xeroderma pigmentosum, an inherited condition that produces numerous
cancerous and precancerous skin lesions, had 60% fewer new lesions
when they applied Dimericine.</TE>
<TE>   Melanoma</TE>
<TE>   Originating in melanocytes, the skin's pigment-producing cells, it
can spread to major organs and tissues. It tends to appear on men's
upper backs and women's lower legs, but can turn up anywhere. Risks
include genetics, a history of many skin moles, severe sunburns and
tanning-bed use. It accounts for 4% of skin-cancer cases and causes
79% of skin-cancer deaths. This year, the American Cancer Society
estimates 53,600 people will be diagnosed with malignant melanoma
(5,300 of them in California), and 7,400 of them will die.</TE>
<TE>   Treatments: If caught early, melanoma is more than 96% curable.
Researchers are working on better devices to map moles and detect
earlier any changes requiring a biopsy. Doctors characterize melanoma
by stages based upon thickness and involvement of lymph nodes or
organs; those stages were revised this year. In many cases,
dermatologists refer patients for sentinel node biopsy, which
involves injection with a special dye that helps identify lymph nodes
the tumor drains into. There is no cure for advanced melanoma;
chemotherapy and immunotherapy typically buy extra time. Several
melanoma clinical trials are testing gene therapy to replace damaged
cells, make the melanoma more sensitive to treatment, or deliver
vaccines directly into the diseased cells. With any skin cancer, find
a doctor experienced in diagnosis and treatment. Dermatologists,
trained in the biology of skin, have varied practices: Some
specialize in acne and wrinkles; others in cancer and surgery. Ask
your doctor whether surgical treatment of skin cancer is a big part
of the practice, or whether he or she typically refers patients to
Mohs surgeons.</TE>

<HD>In 'Enough,' No Victimhood for Lopez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled by Times staff writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Everyone has a limit." "Self-defense isn't murder." "Love is a scary
thing."</LD>
<LD>   These are some of the advertising come-ons Sony Pictures
Entertainment is using to entice moviegoers to see the new Jennifer
Lopez thriller "Enough," in which an ordinary woman turns the tables
on her predatory husband. The film opens Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Like Ashley Judd in "Double Jeopardy" and Julia Roberts in
"Sleeping With the Enemy," Lopez is mining a genre that seems to have
strong appeal for female audiences: victimized women getting revenge
against their abusive mates.</LD>
<TE>   In the movie, directed by Michael Apted ("The World Is Not
Enough") from an original screenplay by Nicholas Kazan ("Reversal of
Fortune"), Lopez stars as a hard-working woman who thought she met
Mr. Right--a charming, wealthy contractor played by Billy
Campbell--only to discover that he has a controlling and dark alter
ego. When she tries to escape the marriage, he pursues her, until she
has had enough of fear and running.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of playing the poor victim, she retaliates," said Paul
Dergarabedian, who heads the box-office tracking firm Exhibitor
Relations Co. "I think female moviegoers appreciate that type of
movie. Women are tired of being victimized in movies."</TE>
<TE>   Though Lopez has forged a successful dual career as singer and
actress, she has yet to wield the box-office clout of say, Roberts,
Drew Barrymore or even Jodie Foster. J.Lo's last film, "Angel Eyes,"
was a flop, grossing only $24 million, but prior to that she had two
sizable hits in "The Wedding Planner" ($60.4 million) and "The Cell"
($61.3 million).</TE>

<LD>Ellen DeGeneres is going to Siegfried and Roy's house.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm dying to meet those big cats," DeGeneres said, referring to
the pair's tigers.</LD>
<LD>   DeGeneres really will visit with Siegfried and Roy while she's in
Las Vegas, but she's ostensibly there to be the host of "Divas Las
Vegas," a music special airing at 9 p.m. Thursday on VH1. The show is
the fifth such special from the cable network and this year features
the Dixie Chicks, Cher, Mary J. Blige and Celine Dion in concert from
the MGM Grand. It's a Vegas preview for Dion, who in 2003 will take
up a two-year residence at Caesar's Palace. Wayne Newton is the
show's announcer.</LD>
<TE>   As for DeGeneres, she's back on tour doing stand-up comedy after
the less-than-a-season run of her CBS sitcom, "The Ellen Show." "I've
finally--I mean, it takes me a while to catch on to this business--I
don't take it personally," DeGeneres said, adding that CBS Television
President Leslie Moonves gave her more than a fair shake, even if
there wasn't "a place for us on the CBS lineup."</TE>
<TE>   DeGeneres, who drew raves as the host of last year's Emmy
telecast, is set to try her hand at a syndicated talk show sometime
next year. "It's a job I think I'm made for," she said.</TE>

<LD>With six nominations apiece, Brooks &amp; Dunn and Toby Keith will have
the eyes of the public on them at Wednesday's Academy of Country
Music Awards ceremony. But many in the country music industry will be
watching what happens with lower-profile nominees.</LD>
<LD>   One big question is how much of a boost emerging artists may get
from the show, which will take place at Universal Amphitheatre, at a
time when Nashville is having trouble getting new acts into the upper
reaches of the country chart, or keeping them there if they do make
it.</LD>
<LD>   Giving newer artists a career boost also is a goal of Tuesday's
Sizzlin' Country concert, an annual fund-raiser for the Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation held at Warner Bros. in Burbank. The lineup this
year includes such freshman and sophomore performers as Jamie O'Neal,
Trick Pony, Cyndi Thompson, Carolyn Dawn Johnson, Blake Shelton,
Tammy Cochran and Trace Adkins.</LD>
<TE>   "With the younger acts, we haven't seen an explosion in sales yet,
but there is an optimistic feeling," says Ron Baird, president of the
Country Music Assn., the Nashville counterpart to the L.A.-based
Academy of Country Music. "This week there are seven acts in the Top
50 in [the Radio &amp; Records trade journal] that have never been on the
charts before, which is a very healthy sign for the industry."</TE>
<TE>   How to groom a new crop of stars has been the source of
considerable hand-wringing in Nashville in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the multiple nominees in this year's ACM Awards, from
Keith, Brooks &amp; Dunn and Garth Brooks to Alan Jackson, Travis Tritt
and Tim McGraw, are established acts with numerous albums under their
belts. Still, there are nominations for newer-generation acts,
including Johnson, Cochran, Shelton, Trick Pony, Chris Cagle and Phil
Vassar, and they could see sales spike if they win in front of CBS'
national audience (the three-hour telecast starts at 8 p.m.).</TE>

<HD>Pedro the Lion Keeps Audience Guessing When It Will Attack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Bazan wants you to understand: The no-frills indie rock he
plays with his band Pedro the Lion is emphatically unpretentious, but
it has a message or two, sometimes questioning his own Christian
faith, or criticizing geo-politics.</LD>
<LD>   So Bazan takes questions from the audience.</LD>
<LD>   One fan at Pedro the Lion's concert Saturday at the El Rey Theatre
quickly shouted, "When are you going to rock?"</LD>
<TE>   It was one of those half-serious, half-insulting jabs that are a
long tradition in indie rock. But if Bazan was frequently content to
allow his songs to unfold slowly, he also occasionally exploded late
in his hourlong set with raw, Crazy Horse-like energy.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Bazan--who is the only recurring member of Pedro the
Lion--has sometimes kept things quiet and purposely intimate. But
Bazan and his three-piece band focused mostly on its newest album,
"Control," which contains a harder rock edge amid the usual
challenging, and infinitely questioning, lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   Among the songs that cut the deepest was the hopeful and morose
"Indian Summer."</TE>
<TE>   The band also performed the quietly desperate "A Mind of Her Own,"
a song taken from 2000's "Winners Never Quit," Bazan's concept album
about a politician whose corruption hastens the collapse of his
world.</TE>
<TE>   Bazan sang, "I wish I could have seen their faces when they heard
the news/ Now that's the sort of smack that leaves a bruise." Quiet
or loud, Bazan explores dark themes that are recognizable and
understandable to anyone.</TE>

<HD>Fest Background Music Sadly Overshadowed</HD>
<DH>A silly play gets in the way of an exquisite score in the
third installment of MicroFest 2002.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MicroFest 2002, which by definition lies defiantly outside what
passes for the musical mainstream, took a particularly bizarre turn
at Pasadena's Pacific Asia Museum in its third installment Saturday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Within a windowed performance space on the second floor of the
museum, the Shadow Theater of Anaphoria backed an hourlong shadow
play of dubious value, "Their Venture Beyond the Horizons: An Odyssey
Submerged in the Inner Tribes," with a shimmering, often exquisite
score of alternatively tuned toccatas and meditations.</LD>
<LD>   Directed by composer Kraig Grady, the ensemble performed on four
metal mallet percussion instruments--including two bass variants
called the Mt. Meru that produced impressively deep, tolling
reverberations--a battered reed organ and two stringed instruments
hidden behind the stage.</LD>
<TE>   There was no need to adjust one's ears for alternative tuning
systems; this music had an allure and beauty that communicated
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   The prologue, where a silhouetted hand holding a ball gave way to
projections of a comet flying through outer space, was a most
striking sequence--and one's hopes immediately went up. Alas, the
ensemble's sonic splendors were then lavished upon a piece of
silliness burdened with antic barbed voices and so-called humor whose
chief reference point was not the imaginary South Seas island of
Anaphoria but good old Southern California (with mentions of
McDonald's, the Santa Monica Mountains, energy bars, Charlton Heston,
etc.)</TE>
<TE>   The shadow play was credited to an "author" named Isafa--and
according to the program notes, "Rumors have varied from Isafa being
a woman of notoriety to Isafa being a collective endeavor." If you
had written this play, you might want to hide behind "rumors" too.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood's Paternalism Is a Direct Hit on Fairness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTIN GLOVER and JENNIFER WARR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We were dismayed to see the quote "Directing is a very paternal
occupation" boldly highlighted as a subhead in the story about Mark
Rydell ("Mark Rydell: On Acting, Directing and Woody," by Susan King,
May 1).</LD>
<LD>   The comment itself was shocking for many reasons, not the least of
which is that Rydell is a consummate director and a terribly kind,
generous and thoughtful person. Women who have worked with him have
only the deepest respect for him. It is the kind of remark that was
perhaps "casual" yet is revealing "jargon" that sadly affirms what
most people in Hollywood believe: that "directing is a man's job."</LD>
<LD>   Rydell made the statement in the context of discussing his merits
as a leader, noting the similarities between being a director and a
father. But why didn't the word "parental" leap to mind in describing
the director's occupation, thus including both paternal and maternal
nurturing instincts?</LD>
<TE>   The appearance of this quote was particularly disturbing in light
of the front-page article that had run in The Times the day before
("A Hollywood League of Their Own," by Rachel Abramowitz, April 30),
which explained in some detail that even though "women run the top
guilds, female actors and directors still struggle." No fooling. And
let us add to that list: female writers and craftspeople, including
cinematographers, art directors, editors, etc.</TE>
<TE>   The April 30 article reported that "female film directors are
working less and less," which is not news to us. The latest
statistics from the Directors Guild of America reflect the ongoing
problem: During the year ending April 2002, only 6.2% of features
were directed by women, and of the 40 top prime-time shows in
2000-01, 11% were helmed by women.</TE>
<TE>   Even though many women express similar sentiment as Callie Khouri
did in that article--"We should be past it"--the fact is that many of
those in power in Hollywood (mostly men) like to believe the fairy
tale that we are "past it," that the "female issue" was solved long
ago. Because many of them believe their own wishful thinking, little
effort has been made over the last few years to bring equality to
hiring practices--thus, the current stalemate.</TE>
<TE>   A blatant example of such "wishing away" happened several years
ago when the International Photographers Guild (now the International
Cinematographers Guild) Women's Caucus was summarily dissolved by the
guild leadership. The reason given was that "you [women] don't have
those problems [of being discriminated against] anymore." Tell that
to the many female camera operators and directors of photography who
still struggle for recognition and employment while most jobs are
automatically awarded to the guys.</TE>
<TE>   All the examples of "film directors who seem to enjoy acting as
much as directing" cited in the May 1 article--as in an earlier
Calendar article about hot young directors ("The New New Wave," by
Patrick Goldstein, Dec. 12, 2001)--were male. There have been and are
extremely successful female actor-directors--to name a few: Ida
Lupino, Penny Marshall, Diane Keaton, Elaine May, Betty Thomas,
Anjelica Huston. But this kind of "reporting" reflects what most
published books and articles on "great directors" imply: that there
are no female directors worth including.</TE>
<TE>   Until we at least begin to include on those lists female directors
who have succeeded (Jane Campion, Lina Wertmuller, Agniezska Holland,
Martha Coolidge, Penelope Spheeris, Mira Nair, Mimi Leder, Lynne
Littman, Agnes Varda, Barbara Kopple, Joan Micklin-Silver, Claudia
Weill, Kathryn Bigelow, Clare Peploe, Kimberly Pierce, for example),
mainstream film history will remain an exclusionary and chauvinist
lie that perpetuates the deluded idea that "directing is a very
paternal occupation."</TE>
<TE>   What hooey. And it is a shame that The Times highlighted that
quote, giving it much more attention, we suspect, than Rydell ever
meant to give it.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the bigger loss is the one-sided vision of the world--seen
only through "paternal" eyes. Just as we do not want a handful of
powerful corporations to tell us what to buy and what to think, we do
not want only "the chosen" sex to tell us how to "see" the world. We
believe that the audience not only deserves better, but is also
hungering for more.</TE>

<HD>Thornton Gets Back to Music</HD>
<DH>After a 20-year break to do movies, the actor is making
time to pursue singing and songwriting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's early in Billy Bob Thornton's afternoon sound check at the El
Rey Theatre, and his rendition of two '60s British rock tunes is
discouragingly generic--the routine bar band fare that gives a bad
name to actors who want to be pop stars. Think Bruce Willis. Think
Kevin Bacon. Think Keanu Reeves.</LD>
<LD>   But then Thornton, an actor with a remarkable eye for absorbing
character roles, switches to his own material and even the busy stage
crew in the old movie house pauses to take notice.</LD>
<LD>   "Private Radio," the title song from Thornton's debut album on
Lost Highway Records, is an expression of despair and desperation
that would be at home on the most acclaimed singer-songwriter
collections. Think Kris Kristofferson. Think Steve Earle. Think
Johnny Cash.</LD>
<TE>   "There are voices in my head, and demons in my soul," Thornton
sings in a voice that may be too ragged for mainstream radio but
which carries an actor's authority and a poet's vulnerability.
"Sometimes they keep me warm, sometimes they leave me cold."</TE>
<TE>   Not everything on Thornton's album or in his set list for Friday's
El Rey performance reaches the level of "Private Radio," which was
co-written by Marty Stuart and Mark Collie. Watching him pour his
feelings into the vocal, however, makes you understand why he has
returned to his first love, music, after a 20-year break for movies.</TE>
<TE>   It also helps explain why the thin, soft-spoken Thornton would
open himself up to the humiliation of pop observers who dismiss any
actor-singer effort as a vanity project.</TE>
<TE>   Before "Sling Blade," before "Monster's Ball" or "The Man Who
Wasn't There," before actress Angelina Jolie, Thornton dreamed as a
boy in small-town Arkansas of being a rock 'n' roll star. He sang
Dave Clark Five and Wayne Fontana hits in a band by the time he was
10, and he spent much of his teens as a singer and drummer in other
bands that played Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd tunes.</TE>
<TE>   When bookings became scarce, Thornton kept close to music in his
early 20s by working as a roadie. Even when he finally headed to Los
Angeles in the early '80s, his goal was as much music as movies. But
it was the latter that finally brought him fame, thanks to his
writing, directing and starring in "Sling Blade," the marvelously
original 1996 look at good and evil.</TE>
<TE>   Now that he is in his mid-40s, Thornton figured that he either had
to carve out time in his film career to make an album or say goodbye
to ever doing it.</TE>
<TE>   Like most singer-songwriters, Thornton is pretty much telling his
own story in "Private Radio" and other key songs on the album,
including the haunting "Your Blue Shadow," a look at his own
obsession in the months between falling in love with Jolie and
untangling their lives so they could be married.</TE>
<TE>   The album, which features liner notes by Johnny Cash, was slammed
by some critics as simply another actor flexing his ego. Rolling
Stone, however, praised it as a "pleasing Southern Gothic
exploration." The CD has sold only about 11,000 copies, and Thornton
says Lost Highway didn't adequately promote it. He says he'll release
his next album on another label. A label representative was
unavailable over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, the title 'Private Radio' just means all the things that
are going through your head--your dreams, your fears ... mostly
fears," Thornton says later, heading home in an SUV to freshen up
before the evening's concert, the start of a nine-city U.S. tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I was raised in the South, where beauty and pain are mixed
together almost equally. I have a lot of fears--not physical fear so
much. I'm not afraid of like walking down the alley. I'm afraid for
my family, things like that, and afraid of failure, always that. I
used to have a fear of death. I've been through a lot. But these days
I kind of leave that to providence."</TE>
<TE>   The walled and gated Spanish-style house, formerly owned by Guns
N' Roses guitarist Slash, is a worthy estate for a two film-star
family. It's a massive, 11,000-square-foot home, but Thornton isn't
interested in giving a tour.</TE>
<TE>   He heads to a downstairs recording studio where he has been
working for weeks on the follow-up album to "Private Radio." It's a
dark, melancholy concept album--and you get the sense that it is
drawn from the same difficult personal journey outlined in the song
"Private Radio."</TE>
<TE>   "You know my favorite song of all time?" he asks later, when
talking about the stark mood of his music. "It's [Kris
Kristofferson's] 'Sunday Morning Coming Down.' That song is the way I
have felt much of my life ... the sense of absolute loneliness, yet
still seeing the beauty of life and believing in it."</TE>
<TE>   On stage at the El Rey, the British rock numbers don't sound any
less anonymous than they did at the sound check. But he eventually
moves to his own material, and the level of intensity builds. "Your
Blue Shadow" casts an emotional net over the crowd, much of which was
drawn by Thornton's acting feats. Of a dozen or so fans questioned,
none had heard the album.</TE>
<TE>   Thornton seems torn between his lively, good-time rock 'n' roll
past and his more mature and probing singer-songwriter instincts--and
the mix is often distracting. To work out a proper balance, he
probably needs to spend lots of nights in clubs playing to live
audiences. The question is whether he will reserve enough time in his
hectic film career to allow his music to grow.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Thornton vowed he would not abandon his music
despite the challenge in overcoming the skepticism of actors in pop.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that matters is the music," he said at one point
in his Arkansas drawl. "I know plenty of terrible musicians who
aren't actors, and I know plenty of terrible actors who aren't
musicians, so what's the problem? The gratifying thing is that
musicians seem to be able to look past the titles and the job
descriptions to simply listen to the work."</TE>
<TE>   He then recalls with delight bumping into one of his favorite
musicians, Elvis Costello, in a Dublin airport.</TE>
<TE>   "When he said he was a big fan of my work, I thought he was
talking about the movies, but he had already heard the album,"
Thornton says, with the excitement of that little kid back in
Arkansas thinking about making music someday. "He even came to my
show and joined me on stage when I did [Leon Payne's] 'Lost
Highway.'"</TE>
<TE>   Things went so well that Thornton and his band will open for
Costello on a brief Midwestern swing next month. Not a bad double
bill.</TE>

taking itself seriously or what? The show's writers have issued a
document resembling a diplomatic white paper, replete with bullet
points explaining in detail "why Nina is the mole."</LD>
<LD>   Not needed. As if even huge fans--including your hopelessly
addicted humble servant--were expecting logic from "24," whose entire
season is supposed to occur during a 24-hour period, with each
episode an hour in the volcanic lives of its Los Angeles characters.</LD>
<TE>   For you non-viewers, Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke) has been the most
trusted subordinate of protagonist Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) at
the government's Counter Terrorist Unit he heads. She's also his
former lover.</TE>
<TE>   Intimacy, shmintimacy. I had her picked out as the mole working
for Serbian war criminal Victor Drazen (Dennis Hopper) long before
she was outed at the end of last week's episode when speaking Serbian
to him on a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   Had I played super detective and meticulously revisited her
behavior since the series premiered? Get serious.</TE>
<TE>   Then what tipped me off? Only instinct. Beyond some early
murkiness about a stolen key card, Nina's loyalty to Jack was beyond
reproach. That made her the least likely CTU operative to be a
traitor since double-dealing agent Jamey Farrell (Karina Arroyave)
turned up dead earlier in the season.</TE>
<TE>   Least likely equals most likely in a series with this many hairpin
curves.</TE>
<TE>   District Director George Mason (Xander Berkeley) the mole? That
was too obvious. He hates Jack, especially after Jack put him out
with a tranquilizer gun in the premiere. Nina's present lover, Tony
Almeida (Carlos Bernard)? Again too obvious. He looks shifty and, to
confuse matters, did a noble deed late in the series. Jamey's
replacement, Milo Pressman (Eric Balfour)? Get out! Naming him Milo
(making viewers think Milosevic) had to be a red herring.</TE>
<TE>   That left only Nina, whose integrity and loyalty were guilt
giveaways to the astute (blush) viewer. And if it turns out that last
week's episode was more plot misdirection from the writers, and Nina
isn't the mole, I'll be very angry.</TE>
<TE>   Not that I won't return to "24" next season, even though it became
about the most illogical drama in prime time after those tight early
scripts that drew me in irrevocably. Wouldn't think of missing it.</TE>
<TE>   But it's made no sense at all.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, after going without sleep all season, no one here
seems even drowsy.</TE>
<TE>   And take Jack's wife, Teri. She's played by Leslie Hope, who
deserves an Emmy if only for keeping a straight face as her character
endures one upheaval after another.</TE>
<TE>   Let's review this poor woman's melodrama during just 23 hours:</TE>
<TE>   Teri's daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) disappears. Teri escapes a
killer working for Drazen--a man she thought was helping her retrieve
Kim--after clunking him on the head with a rock and tying him to a
tree with a belt and jumper cables.</TE>
<TE>   She is captured by Drazen's terrorists, then reunited with Kim,
who earlier was taken prisoner by Drazen's boys. She and Kim are
taken outside and ordered to kneel beside open graves as guns are
aimed at their heads for an apparent execution.</TE>
<TE>   They survive that, but Teri is raped. She kills a terrorist guard.
She has unbearable pain in her side. She and Kim are rescued by Jack.
They are cut off from Jack. They are re-rescued by Jack in a chopper.
When they arrive at a hospital to be checked out, Teri learns she has
a bursting ovarian cyst. Teri and Kim are brought to a CTU safe
house, where she learns from a home pregnancy test that she's
expecting. She learns Jack has slept with Nina.</TE>
<TE>   The safe house is attacked by terrorists. Teri and Kim escape in a
car. Teri parks the car on the side of a mountain, leaving Kim inside
while checking to see if they lost their pursuers. When she returns
to the car, it topples over the side of the mountain. As the car
explodes in flames, Teri faints. When she come to, she has ...</TE>
<TE>   AMNESIA!</TE>
<TE>   Helped by an old friend, Dr. Phil Parslow (Vincent Angell), Teri
makes her way home, where she is attacked by an assassin who wounds
Dr. Phil. The assassin puts a gun to Teri's head, demanding to know
the whereabouts of Kim. Teri can't say because (amnesia, remember?)
she doesn't know she has a daughter. About to kill Teri, the assassin
is shot in the back by Tony of CTU. Recovering her memory, Teri
arrives at CTU. Unaware that Kim somehow escaped the car before it
exploded, Teri thinks Kim is dead. She learns Kim is alive and
apparently safe. She learns that Jack has been captured by Drazen.
She learns that Kim has been recaptured by Drazen.</TE>
<TE>   That about brings Teri up to date. I don't know what's ahead for
her Tuesday, but don't rule out ninja warriors.</TE>
<TE>   Teri doesn't know that Kim escaped Drazen by jumping into San
Pedro Bay, untying her bonds under water and swimming away.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Bauers aren't alone in leading active lives on
"24." The family's perils are closely tied to Drazen's plot to murder
Sen. David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), a leading presidential candidate
whose son Keith (Vicellous Shannon), has killed his sister's rapist,
and whose ruthless wife, Sherry (Penny Johnson Jerald), has spent the
season trying to manipulate her husband.</TE>
<TE>   That includes persuading campaign aide Patty Brooks (Tanya Wright)
to spy on him by becoming his lover. It didn't work, but there's
always next season.</TE>
<TE>   Fox has decided to renew "24" despite its soft ratings and the
show's burden of maintaining its present serial format and story
line. One character I lost track of was Mandy (Mia Kirshner), the
cute little bisexual terrorist who had a hot tryst in the bathroom
with another passenger before planting a bomb on a jet and
parachuting to safety seconds before it exploded over L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Why not bring Mandy back next season as Nina's replacement at CTU?
It would work if everyone else gets amnesia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "24" airs Tuesday night at 10 on Fox. The network has rated the
final episode TV-14-V (may be unsuitable for children under 14, with
an advisory for violence).</TE>

<HD>'Nightline' Set to Finally Air Gay Life Series</HD>
<DH>Television* Host Ted Koppel says the five-part program,
postponed twice, will cover the 'vast majority,' who live 'quiet,
conventional' lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>ABC is hoping the third time's the charm for a five-part "Nightline"
series on gay and lesbian life, which is scheduled to air this week
after being twice postponed because of breaking news, including the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The programs came about when "Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel and
executive producer Tom Bettag realized that over the years the show's
coverage of gay life had been largely limited to acts of violence
against gays, AIDS or "the first five rows in the Gay Pride parade,"
Koppel said. "What struck us is we never really talk about the vast
majority of gays in this country who lead quiet, conventional,
uninteresting ... lives. This is a series that focuses on everyone
else."</LD>
<LD>   But the title, "A Matter of Choice?," has disturbed some in the
gay and lesbian community who think there is nothing optional about
being gay. Last summer, when the series was announced, the Gay &amp;
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation complained that the title
perpetuates an "outdated but still harmful stereotype."</LD>
<TE>   Koppel, whose show will expand to an hour for an extended stretch
beginning this summer, isn't backing down. "I realize I may have
offended some people by insisting on that title," he said in an
interview, but in his reporting and throughout the series, "the word
'choice' comes up again and again and again." The question, he said,
"summarizes the essence of the dilemma gay people face in this
country."</TE>
<TE>   Koppel said of the gay community, "This is a series about them,
not a series for them.... There is not much in this series that will
surprise anybody who is gay, and a lot that will surprise anybody who
is not."</TE>
<TE>   The series starts tonight at a retirement community for gays and
lesbians near Bradenton, Fla., where senior citizens talk about when
they discovered they were gay and the consequences in their lives.
Tuesday, the program moves to Roanoke, Va., the site of a gay
hate-crime murder, and subsequent soul-searching by the community.
The city intrigued Koppel, however, because he found it both
staunchly Southern Baptist, "where being gay really did mean being
out of the ordinary," and "surprisingly tolerant.... People are
allowed to live relatively normal lives there as gays, without being
harassed." Koppel explores the issue of whether being gay is a choice
with gay and lesbian teens, Roanoke religious leaders, and gay and
straight families.</TE>
<TE>   Despite concerns about the title, GLAAD news media director Cathy
Renna called the series "unprecedented" for showing rarely seen
elements of the gay and lesbian community. The installment on older
gays, she said, "gives voice to a part of the community that is
invisible."</TE>
<TE>   Koppel will conduct a live town meeting from Roanoke to end the
series Friday, and Renna is curious to see how different it
potentially will be than if that event had aired in September. The
topic of gay adoption and the Catholic Church scandal have come to
the forefront since then, and "issues around discrimination and hate
violence are now more universally understood" because of the
September terrorist attacks, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Koppel said he and producers are still working out the
format of the new half-hour addition, "Nightline Close-Up," which the
show will produce to fill time between Bill Maher's departure this
summer and Jimmy Kimmel's arrival in January. The program will be
taped, unless there is breaking news, and will probably emphasize
stories about "people who normally don't make the news. Some of the
best programs we do don't deal with famous people, but people who
were on the periphery of famous events."</TE>
<TE>   The more feature-oriented half-hour, Koppel said, "offers us a
chance to demonstrate the versatility of the 'Nightline'
correspondents and producers. It's nice to be needed."</TE>
<TE>   Kimmel was hired after ABC failed to lure David Letterman from
CBS, a move that would also have displaced "Nightline." Koppel said
he met Kimmel for the first time last week at ABC's fall schedule
presentation to advertisers. "I've never been particularly concerned
about what follows us," Koppel said, adding that Kimmel "seems like a
very funny guy, and I'm sure he'll do a good job."</TE>

<HD>For R&amp;B's Usher, Ego Is Still Instrumental</HD>
<DH>The popular artist places himself firmly at center stage
when his '8701' tour stops in Irvine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>R&amp;B heartthrob Usher says he called his latest album "8701" to
reflect the growth and maturity he achieved between 1987, when he
launched his career, and 2001, when "8701" came out. But when it
comes to the art of seduction, on which he's built his career as a
modern-day Romeo, his attitude is still primarily "my way."</LD>
<LD>   Nobody expects Shakespeare from today's pop masters of romance,
but it didn't take a master in Jungian analysis to catch the
overriding self-centeredness at the core of his Evolution 8701 Tour
during its stop Saturday night at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in
Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Songs were drawn by and large from "8701" and from his 1997
breakthrough album "My Way," which have sold nearly 8 million copies
combined in the U.S., so clearly he's in sync with his audience.</LD>
<TE>   The predominantly female crowd at Saturday's show didn't even mind
the rampant egocentricity when he sang "I want someone who makes me
feel good in love" in "I Need a Girl," his recent collaborative hit
with Sean "P. Diddy" Combs and rapper Loon.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, that was written by Combs, not Usher, but there's a
disturbing lack of any sense of another individual in most of the
love songs Usher does write.</TE>
<TE>   That's because he celebrates the physical expression of love far
more than the spiritual or relational aspects. At 23 he may be a
full-fledged adult, but his material still carries a large dose of
adolescent point of view.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Usher Raymond IV is a skilled singer and a
tremendous dancer, and he could stand to give the latter even more
stage time. The choreography was sporadically dazzling, and in a
brief solo number near the end of the show, he suddenly pulled
together a routine hinting that he might give Prince or Michael
Jackson of yore a run for their money.</TE>
<TE>   The staging of several numbers also gave any amateur psychologists
on hand plenty to mull on. His treatment of "U Remind Me" got a new
spin as he lamented memories of a departed love getting in the way of
proceeding with a new relationship.</TE>
<TE>   On the recording he comes off attractively vulnerable; onstage
singing the song to each of the four lithe female dancers he
partnered successively, he appeared fickle at best, calculating at
worst.</TE>
<TE>   On the wardrobe front, he changed outfits as often as Cher or
Britney Spears, only to peel most of them off time and again,
something the women watching never found repetitive.</TE>
<TE>   Rap duo Nas, however, did suffer from repetitiveness in its
30-minute set that preceded Usher due to nearly identical tempos in
several numbers, while opener Faith Evans stopped just short of
medley syndrome with a string of two-minute snippets of nine songs.</TE>
<TE>   Only at the end did she let one song unfold, and it made all the
difference as she at last took enough time not only to create musical
momentum, but then to build it to a peak that exploded into a great
gospel workout.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rei Aoo is a lovely dancer whose dramatic line lends a poignant
lyricism to her balletic moves. Her choreography, however, tends to
be pop-derived and muddled. But it was Aoo's programming that proved
deadly Saturday night at the Madrid Theatre, as Rei Aoo's Dance
Planet presented "Time Goes On"-- an evening of seven works, only
four of them hers.</LD>
<LD>   Aoo danced Terry Beeman's "Prelude" and "Monologue" as bookends to
the first half, with "Prelude" a kind of warm-up exercise, her feet
skimming the floor as she perused a book. "Monologue" was set against
a video featuring moving cars (by Aoo and Richard Kuller), in which
the centered dancer stretched and slinked sensuously across the
stage.</LD>
<LD>   Aoo's "A Love Story" showcased Anthony Garza and Tiler Peck in a
romantic, if uninspired, pas de deux; Aoo's "Highwayman," a narrative
set to Loreena McKennitt's, music was more literal than original.
Aoo's "Time Goes On" was a joyful romp in which Jannell Burgess,
Melody Burns, Amanda Huff , Kiyoko Ortiz, Jaclyn Riesz and Aoo--in
turbans and harem pants--soared in unison. Aoo's previously reviewed
"Horsemen in Wilderness" again accentuated vigor.</LD>
<TE>   Becca and Gregg Russell's 35-minute centerpiece, "Peeping From the
Box," was an amateurish take on voyeurism. Dancers cavorted with
boxes on their heads before the piece segued into a series of vapid
moves: Performers then dressed as doctor, nurse, homeless woman and
photographer threw in fouettes and tap dancing to no effect.
Voyeurism? This work is better left unseen.</TE>

<LD>In addition to its typical five-program concert season in churches
and museums, and its collaborations with other institutions, the
early music ensemble Musica Angelica will bring two internationally
known conductors to the podium next season for five programs at
Zipper Hall at the Colburn School for the Performing Arts and to
UCLA's Royce Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Italian conductor and recorder virtuoso Giovanni Antonini will
lead and solo with the period-instrument orchestra in November,
playing music by Bach, Handel and Vivaldi, among others.</LD>
<LD>   A founding member of the baroque ensemble Il Giardino Armonico,
which he has led since 1989, Antonini won a Grammy Award in 2000 for
his collaboration with Cecilia Bartoli on her CD "The Vivaldi Album."</LD>
<TE>   British conductor Harry Bicket will lead the baroque orchestra in
Bach's Mass in B minor in March and in concerts featuring Handel and
Rameau.</TE>
<TE>   The expansion of Musica Angelica's offerings is an effort to raise
its artistic profile and expand its audience base, said director and
archlutenist Michael Eagen, who founded the ensemble in 1993.</TE>

<HD>'Star Wars' Is Still a Force for Movie Fans</HD>
<DH>Box Office* 'Attack of the Clones' rockets past
'Spider-Man' for the top spot. The popularity of the two films is
resulting in a record May at theaters.</DH>

<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what has proved to be the most lucrative moviegoing May ever, a
second major blockbuster premiered over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   After George Lucas cleverly distanced his film from comparisons to
the mighty "Spider-Man," which has been laying waste to record books
over the last three weeks, the fifth installment of the "Star Wars"
saga, entitled "Episode II Attack of the Clones," displayed ample
evidence of the series' continued appeal as a pop-cultural
phenomenon, capturing an estimated $86.1 million in 3,161 theaters
and on about 6,000 screens in its first weekend ($27,254 per
theater), the third-highest-grossing three-day weekend ever, behind
"Spider-Man" and "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."</LD>
<LD>   Including the record Thursday gross of $30.1 million and assuming
Sunday estimates hold up, "Clones" is already over $116 million in
its fourth day of release. "Spider-Man" topped the $100-million mark
in three days, but "Star Wars" creator George Lucas deliberately
opened on fewer screens (about 1,500 short of "Spider-Man") to
downplay the horse-race aspect. In addition, "Clones" clocked almost
$67 million overseas in 74 countries including most of Europe.</LD>
<TE>   "Clones" also demonstrated that there's room for more than one
special-effects blockbuster at a time. The previous "Stars Wars"
installment, "Episode I The Phantom Menace," took five days to get to
$100 million. That film went on to gross $431 million in the U.S. and
$923 million worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man" and "Attack of the Clones" have propelled studios and
theater owners to a phenomenal May, with the first two weeks alone
bringing in more than $400 million, according to the tracking firm
Nielsen EDI. The past weekend's grosses for all movies came to about
$175 million, according to Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor
Relations, almost 80% ahead of the comparable weekend last year.</TE>
<TE>   The month to date is at $581.6 million, about 63% ahead of May
2001. The coming weekend could add another $200 million or more in
admissions, surpassing the $185.3 million from last year's four-day
Memorial Day holiday, the current record.</TE>
<TE>   Coming into May, box office totals for the year were at $2.62
billion, about 15% ahead of last year. Adding in the past three
weekends, that increase is now at 21%, with $3.23 billion to date.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to the weekend just concluded, "Clones" seems to be
getting a warmer reception from critics than "The Phantom Menace,"
and more significantly, the fan base is older than for "Spider-Man,"
(64% of the audience was over 25 years of age, slightly more male
than female, with the family audience accounting for only 44% of
admissions). This usually indicates a film will continue to perform
strongly.</TE>
<TE>   As with "Spider-Man," the marketing on "Clones" was designed to
create awareness and let hype build through media coverage and
Internet chat rooms and discussion groups, and that could be a key
factor in their playability over the next several weeks, because
there's no other true "event"-style film on the horizon until the
July 3 premiere of the "Men in Black" sequel.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy certainly seems to be working for "Spider-Man," which
continues to defy the odds from weekend to weekend. After its
gigantic premiere, "Spidey" slipped only 38% in its second weekend to
$71.4 million, declining far less than most other movies that open at
such high levels. Even with the fierce competition from "Clones," the
third-weekend drop was again only about 36%, to a still-amazing
estimate of $46 million in 3,615 theaters, the largest gross for any
movie in its third weekend of release.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man" is now Columbia Pictures' highest-grossing film ever,
surpassing the $250.7 million for "Men in Black." It also holds the
speed record for reaching $250 million in 15 days; it took "Phantom
Menace" 19 days to get there.</TE>
<TE>   The 17-day total on "Spider-Man" is an unprecedented $286.5
million, making it the 14th-largest-grossing movie of all time after
only three weeks of release. It should reach the $300-million
threshold over Memorial Day weekend, which will probably be the first
true face-off between "Spider-Man" and "Clones," in terms of
long-haul appeal. But again, with little else in the way of a
spectacle on the horizon, the two films might comfortably co-exist
throughout the coming month.</TE>
<TE>   Of the other movies currently playing, only one opened over the
past weekend, the British comedy "About a Boy" starring Hugh Grant,
which got off to a good start of about $8.4 million in 1,207
theaters, playing overwhelmingly to older females. Universal will
expand the movie by about 500 locations for the holiday weekend. The
second weekend for the adultery drama "Unfaithful," starring Richard
Gere and Diane Lane, was a more-than-acceptable $10.3 million in
2,625 theaters, for a two-week total of about $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   In fifth place, the low-budget teen comedy "The New Guy" took in
an additional $6.5 million in its second weekend in 2,687 theaters
for $17.3 million in two weeks. After six weeks, "Changing Lanes,"
starring Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Affleck, is still cruising, with
an estimated $3.1 million and more than $61 million so far, one of
the spring's better performers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Scorpion King" is about exhausted, dropping to $2.7 million
in its fifth weekend in 2,555 theaters for a total of $85 million.
"The Rookie," starring Dennis Quaid, has proved a substantial hit,
with almost $71 million to date, $2 million of that over the weekend
in 1,849 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "Murder by Numbers" is nearing the end of a middling run, with
$1.7 million in 1,580 theaters and $30 million to date. Rounding out
the top 10 is "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," one of the surprises of the
specialized market. The weekend brought $1.2 million on only 275
screens and almost $6 million to date.</TE>

<DH>Michael Mizerany's witty, coming-out play effectively
balances seriousness with comedy.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Part "Stairway to Heaven," part "Pilgrim's Progress," Michael
Mizerany's new dance play, "The Bible Wall," is witty and touching.</LD>
<LD>   Seen Saturday at the Whitmore-Lindley Theater Center in the
burgeoning theater district of Magnolia and Lankershim boulevards in
North Hollywood, this "semiautobiographical" coming-out work, written
and choreographed by Mizerany, takes place in Limbo.</LD>
<LD>   Luke, the protagonist danced by Mizerany, faces childhood traumas
induced by Catholic doctrines about homosexuality. He is guided by
Joe Seely, an unlikely Christ-like figure who spends his time
watching reruns of "The Golden Girls" and ordering pizza when not
serving a higher power as comforter, interrogator and soul catcher in
the rye.</LD>
<TE>   A finely honed dancer, Mizerany knows how to occupy and cut an
expressive figure in space as well as focus the viewer's eye exactly
where he wants it. The surprise is how good a writer he is in
balancing seriousness and comedy, and the general and the particular.
The most touching moments involve Luke reliving the rejection of
Keith, his first love.</TE>
<TE>   Seely did splendidly in his virtuoso actor's role, shifting
character from a Christ figure sometimes out of his depth to Irish
priest, from Luke's disgusted dad to lover Keith, as dictated by
Marco De Leon's swift lighting changes. (De Leon also designed the
modest set that makes much of little.)</TE>
<TE>   Juan Zadala excelled in two comic roles that suggest that even in
the next world some souls are more equal than others.</TE>
<TE>   The evocative liturgical music was drawn from Richard Einhorn's
score for Carl Dreyer's 1928 silent film, "The Passion of Joan of
Arc."</TE>
<TE>   Don't miss Mizerany's childhood and family photos on the bulletin
board next to the ticket booth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Information: Michael Mizerany's "The Bible Wall" repeats Friday
and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 7 p.m. at the Whitmore-Lindley
Theater Center, 11006 Magnolia Blvd., North Hollywood. $18. (818)

<HD>'Lindbergh Flies Again': Now, That's the Spirit</HD>
<DH>Although grandson's flight can't compare to the original,
the tale of the 1927 crossing is uplifting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Early in "Lindbergh Flies Again," the History Channel documentary on
the 75th anniversary of the historic transatlantic flight, Lindbergh
biographer A. Scott Berg explains how astounded the public was at
what the daredevil pilot from Minnesota had done.</LD>
<LD>   The modern equivalent to Lindbergh's flight from New York to
Paris, Berg says, would be to fly from the Earth to the moon--in a
craft you helped build with money you scraped together from
donations.</LD>
<LD>   "Imagine Neil Armstrong raising the money to build the rocket to
go to the moon," Berg says. "That's what Charles Lindbergh did."</LD>
<TE>   Imagine indeed. Anniversary or no, the Lindbergh story is an
oft-told American tale, and rightly so.</TE>
<TE>   "Flies Again" is a first-rate account of the daunting challenges
that faced Lindbergh--who was 25 but, as the narrator points out,
looked 19--when he dared to try to win a $25,000 prize for making the
first nonstop flight from New York to Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Even Lindbergh buffs will find some nuggets here. Like this:
During his two years as an airmail pilot flying the St.
Louis-to-Chicago route, 31 of Lindbergh's fellow pilots died in
crashes. Thirty-one of 40.</TE>
<TE>   The production is helped enormously by historic film footage and
new interviews with people who saw the Spirit of St. Louis depart
from Roosevelt Field in New York or land 331/2 hours later at Le
Bourget Aerodrome in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   As "Flies Again" notes, the spirit or, more accurately, the money,
may have come from St. Louis but the grit and know-how to build the
plane came from a ragtag outfit in San Diego called Ryan Aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Only a bunch of financially struggling dreamers could figure they
could accomplish for $10,000 what larger companies were trying and
failing to do for other competitors at 10 times that amount.</TE>
<TE>   The last surviving employee from those two furious months at Ryan
is Georgia Borthwick, who was a 19-year-old office worker. Her
recollection of the shy, repressed youth who talked her into a flight
over San Diego before he left for St. Louis and immortality is one of
the gems of "Lindbergh Flies Again."</TE>
<TE>   Borthwick notes there was doubt even at Ryan that the plane would
lift off, particularly from a soggy, rutted runway.</TE>
<TE>   "The most exciting thing was that he got into the air," says
Borthwick with a joy undiminished by decades.</TE>
<TE>   (In the blown-up picture of Lindbergh and the Ryan workers that
adorns an entire wall at the San Diego Aerospace Museum, Borthwick is
the sassy-looking brunet standing directly in front of Lindbergh.)</TE>
<TE>   Framing "Flies Again" is the recent flight of Erik Lindbergh, 37,
a Lindbergh grandson. In a state-of-the-art single-engine private
plane, Erik retraced his grandfather's flight in half the time and
with twice the food (six sandwiches compared to Lindy's famous
three).</TE>
<TE>   To compare the two flights, of course, is an enormous stretch. To
trim weight, Charles Lindbergh dared not take a radio or sextant;
Erik's plane had a global positioning system, e-mail-capable computer
and a satellite phone, and he was in nearly constant communication
with mission control in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the effort was on behalf of two worthwhile causes: getting
schoolchildren interested in the legacy of the 1927 flight and
promoting a contest by the St. Louis-based X Prize Foundation that is
offering a $10-million prize for the first privately funded space
flight.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Flies Again" tends to hype the dangers of the
over-the-water flight, Erik has a good bit of the Lindbergh charm and
it's impossible not to root for him. Interestingly, his family was
dubious.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that there would be familial angst, reservations and even
downright adamant 'you shouldn't do this,' " said Erik's wife, Mara.</TE>
<TE>   Some things never change. Risk-takers make for difficult
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Lindbergh Flies Again" airs Monday, 9-11 p.m., on the History
Channel.</TE>

<HD>Diemecke Ends Season on Bold Note</HD>
<DH>The Mexican conductor expresses a flamboyant style as music
director of Long Beach Symphony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enrique Arturo Diemecke ended a curious first season as music
director of the Long Beach Symphony on Saturday night. It was curious
because the Mexican conductor, who also heads orchestras in Mexico
City and Michigan, was hired in Long Beach last year after the
orchestra had chosen the season's programs. Still, Diemecke was able
to make some changes for this final one at Terrace Theater.</LD>
<LD>   He began the evening with Silvestre Revueltas' savage "Sensemaya."
He concluded with a flamboyant and reckless performance of Mahler's
First Symphony that couldn't have been more different from the
carefully gauged and well-executed Mahler interpretations that were a
specialty of his unflamboyant predecessor, JoAnn Falletta. "Music
With Passion" is now the motto on the orchestra's brochure, and it
uses a publicity shot that makes Diemecke look more like Las Vegas
magician than conductor.</LD>
<LD>   One excellent magic trick that Diemecke could perform would be to
transform Long Beach into a center for Mexican music. Now and then,
the Los Angeles Philharmonic or the Santa Barbara Symphony performs
something by Revueltas or Chavez, Mexico's most famous 20th century
composers. But remarkably little of a very rich Mexican musical
tradition and active current scene seems to make its way to Southern
California where, by all rights, it should thrive.</LD>
<TE>   Diemecke has made a series of recordings for Sony devoted to
Mexican classics with his National Symphony Orchestra of Mexico, but
they are not imported to the U.S. However, two, with big Revueltas
works, were for sale Saturday. They are big sellers in Mexico and for
good reason. The music is riveting, and the performances are full of
bold personality.</TE>
<TE>   A sense of that personality could be felt in Diemecke's reading of
"Sensemaya," which describes the ritual slaughter of a snake. The
snake slithers in an insinuatingly sexy ostinato figure; the
orchestra pounces with increasingly frenzied violence. The slithering
on Saturday was alluring; the pounce, though, seemed a touch
restrained, held back by hesitant brass.</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing held back in the Mahler. Diemecke's ideas about
this symphony are his own. As in "Sensemaya," he conducted without a
baton and from memory. But here he seemed almost to be making it up
as he went along.</TE>
<TE>   Mahler gives a great many directions in his score, such as when to
push ahead or hold back. With a heavy foot on the pedal and on the
brake, Diemecke exaggerated all those and made up many more. If a
melody rises and takes a dip, that could be the occasion to step on
it and then slow down.</TE>
<TE>   Diemecke favored in-your-face brass playing, and trumpets seemed
at times about to careen out of control. The conductor is not the
first to find hints of klezmer in the Scherzo movement, but he is the
first to highlight them quite so raucously.</TE>
<TE>   Ever wanting more, Diemecke added the nostalgic "Blumine" movement
that Mahler first included in the symphony but later excised.</TE>
<TE>   For Diemecke, the flowers Mahler was referring to in the title
(the symphony was originally intended as a nature portrait) had
psychedelic properties. Mahler never hesitated to milk the closing of
his symphonies but leave it to Diemecke to double the fat content of
the glorious peroration to the First.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with the sleek performance of the same symphony that
Esa-Pekka Salonen led with the Los Angeles Philharmonic two weeks
ago, Diemecke's reading proved downright perilous; he courted danger
with his orchestra more than once.</TE>
<TE>   I was reminded of the Ferris wheel that used to be in an amusement
park near where the Terrace Theater now stands. It was a spectacular
ride but not a safe one; every now and then someone was killed on it.
Still, it may not be a bad thing to have a little of that seedy
excitement returned to gentrified Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the precarious Mahlerian wild ride was preferable to
the dutiful, dispirited performance of Richard Strauss' First Horn
Concerto, which was also on the program. Calvin Smith, the
orchestra's principal horn, was soloist.</TE>
<TE>   Next season is Diemecke's own. Long Beach, look out!</TE>

<LD>It's time for "Boston Public" to take its summer break, but not
without one last heavy-handed lesson.</LD>
<LD>   Heading the curriculum in tonight's season two finale (8 p.m.,
Fox): Honesty.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, a brutal attack left popular teacher Harry Senate
(Nicky Katt) on the brink of death. Tonight, Ronnie Cooke (Jeri
Ryan), the classroom newcomer and former lawyer, faces a moral
dilemma: To see justice done, she might have to lie in court about
witnessing the assailant flee.</LD>
<TE>   But is that what Harry would have wanted? Ronnie's actions on the
witness stand speak loudly enough, but in case there's any doubt, she
later makes an impassioned speech, coming down squarely in favor of
the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as Harry vegetates in the intensive care unit, the
attack has turned the usually acrimonious Winslow High into one big
family overflowing with song, prayer and supportive words.</TE>
<TE>   While the regular principal, Steven Harper (Chi McBride), stands
vigil with Harry around the clock, Scott Guber (Anthony Heald) takes
over as acting principal, encouraging students and faculty to freely
express their emotions. Even cranky history teacher Harvey Lipschultz
(Fyvush Finkel) shifts into teddy bear mode.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie steps in to run Harry's class, in between testifying and
playing interrogator in her spare time, putting together a case
against the attacker on behalf of the apparently incompetent police
and prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Writer-producer David E. Kelley's quirky humor comes through in
one of tonight's surprising romantic twists. But the climactic
courtroom theatrics are a bit of stretch, even by his standards.</TE>
<TE>   At least school is almost out.</TE>

<HD>Artifacts Will Help Tell Personal Stories of Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>Collection* The American History museum will display photos
and objects for a show opening on the first anniversary of the
attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACQUELINE TRESCOTT</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Standing in a storage room at the National Museum of American
History, curator David Shayt unwraps a large gray box and carefully
pulls back layers of tissue. Underneath is his prize--a cook's apron
from Nino's Restaurant on Canal Street, one mile from the site of the
World Trade Center. It has a stain around the waist and is covered
with badges and insignias from groups that came to dig, serve meals
and sometimes sing at ground zero.</LD>
<LD>   "Overnight, Nino's Restaurant was converted into a resting place
for the police and firemen. A place to have a meal, to rest," says
Shayt. The badges from U.S. Customs, the Calgary Fire Department, the
North Canton (Ohio) police and others have created a somber, but
colorful artwork--like an AIDS quilt of its time.</LD>
<LD>   The apron is one of the artifacts Shayt collected for an exhibit
that will open on the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. Half a dozen people are at work on the exhibit, which will
occupy 5,000 square feet on the Smithsonian Institution museum's
second floor, across from the display of first ladies' gowns.</LD>
<TE>   "September 11: Bearing Witness to History," which will be open
until Jan. 11, will center on photographs and personal stories,
presenting at least 30 artifacts. By comparison, the current
exhibition on the American presidency has 900 objects.</TE>
<TE>   The horrific events of Sept. 11 were probably the most widely
watched tragedy in history, presenting special challenges for
curators more comfortable dealing with events much further in the
past. The exhibit "is not about explaining Sept. 11, but it is about
sharing stories," says James A. Gardner, associate director for
curatorial affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The museum will not offer an explanation of the origins of
terrorism, the way it might for labor history or the development of
electronics. "There is a lot to be said on the subject of terrorism,
but it is not an appropriate role for us. This exhibit is not a good
place to deal with Islamic-U.S. tensions," says Gardner. The job of
bringing meaning to the event will come eventually, he says, but
right now the interpretation will be left to the stories and the
artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the museum group working on the exhibit held their
first brainstorming session Sept. 13. They discussed the role of a
national museum at a time of national tragedy. (Congress passed
legislation in December making the American History museum an
official repository for artifacts from the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.) They wondered if approaching survivors or family members
would be too painful or exploitative.</TE>
<TE>   They all agreed they had to start quickly, even while wrestling
with their own feelings about the attacks. "Everybody was affected by
it, everyone witnessed it," says curator William Yeingst. "For us as
historians, it is crucial to separate the emotions and get some
perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Peter Liebhold, another curator, worried that it was too soon
to start collecting. "There are issues of taste and respect. The last
thing we wanted to do is approach someone too soon," says Liebhold.</TE>
<TE>   Timing Considered Crucial to Collecting</TE>
<TE>   What convinced them to begin immediately was the likelihood that
many desirable objects and stories might quickly vanish, and the
realization that this exhibit would not be the last word on those
tragic events.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the final exhibition the Smithsonian will do on
9/11," says Marilyn Zoidis, chief curator and designer of the
exhibition. "And because we don't know the full story, it is not a
historic account. It will be 'bearing witness' because we all learned
of a way to connect to the story."</TE>
<TE>   As the collecting progressed, the designers interviewed museum
visitors to learn what they expected in a Sept. 11 exhibit. The
answers included "flags, pieces of buildings, airplane parts, the
iconic aftermath," says curator Kathleen Kendrick.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the planned exhibit's emotional content, the designers
have given special attention to pacing and privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the material will affect people in different ways, so we
are going to have lots of seats. There will be places to reflect and
compose yourself. If they want to leave, there will be a way," says
Zoidis. A place for visitors to leave their own memories also will be
included.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner says they even have discussed the floors. "Should it be
carpeted? Maybe that is not comforting. On the other hand, mourning
is a quiet experience; you want it hushed," he says. "Usually we make
these decisions on the basis of aesthetics."</TE>
<TE>   While the approach was being decided, the curators did their
detective work.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, Joseph Lombardo, an executive with the risk-management
firm Aon, gave the Smithsonian a 1940s Wurlitzer. He survived the
attack on the World Trade Center and later talked with Shayt, who had
been his contact for the earlier gift. "As we talked, he told me Lisa
Lefter, one of the employees, had just had her briefcase returned,"
says Shayt. Lefter had left it on her desk on the 103rd floor of the
south tower. It was found in the street a day and a half later, with
her resume tucked inside.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a way for us to begin to tell the story of the office
worker," he says.</TE>
<TE>   On one trip to Fresh Kills, the Staten Island landfill that is one
of the destinations for World Trade Center debris, Shayt spotted a
firetruck. It was intact but badly burned. He returned to the site
with Liebhold, and the two got on top of the truck with a hacksaw and
dislodged the door. "We wanted something emblematic of the fire
department," says Shayt.</TE>
<TE>   As the word of the Smithsonian effort spread, people called to
offer items. One call came from the wife of an ironworker, Jim
Connor, who arrived on the first day to help with the rescue effort.
Eventually the museum received his shoes, the bucket he was carrying,
tool belt, wrenches and respirator.</TE>
<TE>   Through a contact at American Window Cleaner magazine, the team
found Jan Demczur, a window washer who used his squeegee handle to
open a hole in a wall inside the north tower of the World Trade
Center, allowing himself and five other men to escape a smoke-filled
elevator.</TE>
<TE>   Other artifacts include five parts from the two Boeing 767s that
crashed into the trade Center. One is a part of a wing and the others
part of the fuselage. They were found on the street by the FBI and,
once eliminated as evidence, given to the museum.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted them as a way to acknowledge the lives lost on the
plane," says Shayt.</TE>

<HD>Crazy for Love</HD>
<DH>The filmmaker whose creative drive was seen in 'Boogie
Nights' and 'Hard Eight' has taken on the romantic-comedy genre, and
he's determined to push the limits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CANNES, France--"It's so simple," Paul Thomas Anderson says, looking
out at the rain from the marble-floored living room of the rented
villa shared with about a dozen of his cast and crew just outside of
town. "A camera, film, a microphone. Stuff comes in, stuff goes out.
That's it."</LD>
<LD>   Except that with Paul Thomas Anderson, nothing is ever quite like
that. Simple is just not in the cards.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't take more than seconds in the presence of this gifted,
aware 31-year-old writer-director to feel the intensity and creative
zip that led to "Hard Eight," "Boogie Nights" and "Magnolia." He is,
in the best sense, a filmmaker who is driving everything--the
audience, the form, his collaborators, himself most of all--to go
further than they have before.</LD>
<TE>   Which is how his latest film, "Punch-Drunk Love," which premiered
at the Festival de Cannes on Sunday, came to be.</TE>
<TE>   The idea, Anderson explains, was to shake himself up, "to strive
for a 90-minute length, to strive for romantic comedy," to not, in
short, do business as usual. "I felt like I'd become pretty good to a
certain extent at my job," he says. "I wanted to scare myself."</TE>
<TE>   The result is a blithe misfit tango starring Adam Sandler and
Emily Watson, a romantic comedy as wonderful as it is strange that
expands the genre to its absurdist outer limits and makes us believe.
Sandler plays a nonflying small businessman obsessed with amassing
frequent flier miles, an innocent as prone to violent moods as only
someone systematically squashed by seven sisters can be, while Watson
is the woman who still manages to fall for him.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers were never like this, but then
again, maybe they were.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always loved the romantic comedy genre, especially
Astaire-Rogers movies like 'Carefree' and 'The Gay Divorcee,' but
they're a bit out to pasture, they've kind of become standard, like
action movies," Anderson says. "These are dark, confused days for
movies; stuff is not working. It's a good opportunity for small
revolutions to happen, for filmmakers to feel a responsibility to mix
it up a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson also had a long-standing passion for working with
Sandler, for a very basic reason. "He's always just made me laugh, he
gets me, I wanted a piece of him," the director explains. "And he's
amazing in his approach. He just does it; he works from instinct,
from his gut. Sometimes there's nothing more disturbing than an actor
parading the work, where you say 'look at the cheese on that.' I want
to see acting with a capital A when I'm in the mood for it, but
sometimes it's 'back off on the fromage.'"</TE>
<TE>   Anderson wrote Sandler's character of Barry Egan specifically with
the actor in mind, and it's hard to imagine someone else playing the
man's particular contradictions. "I wanted just to write a real guy,"
the director explains, "not to be afraid of getting caught in the
trap of character. Writers are always worried about moments that are
'out of character,' but everyone does things they don't want to do,
where you wonder 'where did that come from?' We're all a bit of a
mess."</TE>
<TE>   One of Egan's most noticeable traits, his determination to take
advantage of a marketing loophole and accumulate huge numbers of
frequent flier miles, is based on a real person, a civil engineer at
UC Davis who gained 1.25 million miles by buying 12,150 cups of
Healthy Choice pudding for $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   "This made sense to me," says Anderson, who read about it in Time
magazine. "And, for whatever reason, pudding is funny."</TE>
<TE>   Egan's other defining characteristic, having seven sisters, though
partially due to Anderson's passion for "high concept ideas, like the
seven dictionary makers in 'Ball of Fire,' " also has a real-life
connection. "I'd seen an episode of 'Cops' where the guy had his
shirt off, he was all scratched up and crying; one of his sisters had
beaten him up. The cops needed to take him somewhere, and he kept
naming all these other sisters he couldn't go to. Someone asked how
many there were and he said, 'I have seven.' And it was like, 'That
poor guy.'"</TE>
<TE>   Not only is some of "Punch-Drunk" based on real people, it also
has real people in it. Lots of them. The four blond Mormon brothers
from Utah who are the bane of Barry's existence are played by four
Mormon brothers from Utah, and four of the seven sisters are related
to each other (two are sisters, and two others are their cousins.)
More than that, with the exception of Sandler, Watson and co-stars
Philip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman and Mary Lynn Rajskub, everyone
on screen is a nonprofessional.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought that would be more fun or more interesting, and I
got a bit bored by casting sessions," Anderson explains. "You go on a
location scout, you find a place with people and you say, 'We've got
to make the actors look like that.' I thought, 'Why don't we just ask
them if they want to be in the movie?' That's better than having 20
people outside an office waiting to say, 'More pudding, sir?' until
someone says, 'You've got the job.' It saves lot of heartache and
trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Using real people also fit in with Anderson's overall
determination to keep things as uncomplicated as possible. "Picasso
said he spent his youth trying to paint like the old masters and the
rest of his life trying to paint like a child," he says. "We had a
plan of attack not to have a plan of attack. I told Emily to throw
the ways she's worked before out the window.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing was, 'We don't know where we're starting, but
we're not starting here.' OK, but what does that mean? We'll find it
as we go along."</TE>
<TE>   That finding turned out to take longer and be more complicated
than anticipated. "I struggled initially; there were scary moments
when I didn't know what I was doing," Anderson says. "We scrapped the
first two weeks of shooting because I was still making the same
movie. I had to educate myself on how to keep it simple."</TE>
<TE>   Proving an unexpected ally was the threat of Hollywood strikes in
2001, which although they never materialized had actors so lined up
with back-to-back projects that both Sandler and Watson had other
movies they were committed to before filming on this one originally
was scheduled to end. "That was the best thing that ever happened,"
the director says. "We were able to stop and then start again. We
stretched the shooting and editing out over a year and a half; it
just became a great accidental way to learn. So much about making
movies is not conducive to any kind of creative thinking. It was a
luxury to sit with it for a while."</TE>
<TE>   One luxury Anderson denied himself was dunning Joe Roth, whose
Revolution Studios financed the picture, for funds over and above the
film's estimated $29 million to $30 million budget. "I told him,
'I'll never come ask you for more money. I can make it for this.'
Movie-making can become a fair and simple game if that stuff is
respected and kept to."</TE>
<TE>   It is finally the filmmaking itself that means everything to
Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Ask him about any aspect of this intricately put-together film,
details such as the hypnotic digitally created plasma screen art by
Jeremy Blake that fills the frame at key moments, and his eyes burn
with the excitement of it all.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the fun, that place where ideas come from, what you're
seeing, doing and thinking about," he says. "I love to work."</TE>

to Howard Reich's article on Richard Rodgers ("He Composed Dreams of
Urban and Middle America," May 11). Reich is a distinguished music
critic and his article was informative, scholarly and suitably
admiring. But one major thrust of its theme was painfully
objectionable.</LD>
<LD>   As most readers were awakening to their weekend and reading
Reich's tribute to and assessment of the work of Rodgers' staggering
body of work, I was at the Los Angeles Coliseum singing to the
bravest, most admirable audience for which I've ever performed. That
audience's spirit-soaring response to one particular Rodgers work
powerfully disputed Reich's lone caveat to Rodgers' genius: his
criticism of the direction of Rodgers' musical output in the second
half of his career.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of "Oklahoma!," Rodgers' first musical with Oscar
Hammerstein II manning the words rather than Lorenz Hart, Reich
observes, "With this show, Rodgers transformed himself into an
utterly new composer, simplifying his art for mass appeal, attaining
unprecedented popularity and, alas, leaving behind the searing work
he had done with Hart."</LD>
<TE>   His point is that Rodgers' work in his Hammerstein years was not
merely different--it was lesser.</TE>
<TE>   Reich's piece aptly places Rodgers' brilliance as a Broadway
composer alongside that of George Gershwin, Harold Arlen, Cole
Porter, Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern and the rest of an elite pantheon.
He observes of Rodgers' tunes that he "announced himself as a sublime
melodist on a par with Schubert or Chopin."</TE>
<TE>   But it is with the following paragraph that I take issue. I offer
in evidence the 60,000 souls (I use that word in its fullest and most
ennobling meaning) in the Coliseum that morning.</TE>
<TE>   "No doubt Rodgers justly took pride in the operatic flourishes he
brought to 'Carousel' (1945), particularly in its 'Soliloquy,' which
covered a breadth of emotion more commonly associated with European
opera. Yet, ultimately, the songs from this musical--as well as the
blockbusters 'South Pacific' (1949) and 'The King and I'
(1951)--showed Rodgers writing melodies that were catchy and clever
but also simplistic and superficial."</TE>
<TE>   Let me describe that very special audience I joined on that
Saturday morning. The event was the Entertainment Industry
Foundation's ninth-annual Revlon Run/Walk for Women. People filled
the Coliseum field and lapped up high into the stands following a 5K
run or walk around the USC campus to raise more than $3 million to
fund the National Women's Cancer Research Alliance. This march to
effect a cancer-free near future was infused with tears and with joy,
fueled by fears and by hope.</TE>
<TE>   Every participant was courageously dealing with her own cancer
experience or was there to celebrate and support the struggle of a
loved one, in many cases the loss of someone who meant everything to
them.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Loggins and his band and the Dorrell Coleman band already
had rocked the Coliseum with their joyous music. I had been invited
to perform something that would commemorate the spirit of those
gathered so specially there.</TE>
<TE>   I chose Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's "You'll Never Walk Alone" from
"Carousel": "When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high.
And don't be afraid of the dark," with Rodgers' inspired and
inspiring music rising to capture the full power of those words.</TE>
<TE>   Reich quotes Rodgers' explanation of his musical process: "It is
simply using the medium to express emotion." The emotion of his
music, the sublime emotion of that music, was reflected on the faces
and in the hearts of those wonderful people before me. Yes, this is
what they felt. Yes, this is the spirit and belief and vow to which
they were now dedicating their lives. Yes, the melody and power of
that music expressed what they had all come here to say and to feel.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of the greatest privileges of my life.</TE>
<TE>   Thank God that Richard Rodgers did not stop composing after the
first half of his career.</TE>
<TE>   It was not only on that particular occasion that this work sings
out to us. I noted this a few months back when America (and so much
of the world) was just crawling out from the shock of the World Trade
Center terrorist atrocities. The Emmy Awards were going forward after
understandable delays. But the meaning and memory of 9/11 was still
the prevailing presence for all of us. As a finale, the incomparable
Barbra Streisand appeared to our delighted surprise and gave a
rendition of "You'll Never Walk Alone" that none of us will ever
forget. The sheer beauty and power of the composition and of the
performance brought to the world a surcease and a healing that we
sorely needed.</TE>
<TE>   We knew we did not walk alone. Whatever our religious conviction,
we, each and every one, knew that we did not walk alone. Millions of
people, hundreds of millions--we had conjunction and, with it,
strength.</TE>
<TE>   I could refer you as well to "Climb Every Mountain," simply one of
many others. But we are talking about one specific song here, "You'll
Never Walk Alone," a song that could validate decades of work if it
needed to. But it most certainly does not need to.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Reich, I understand and appreciate your abiding respect for
the Rodgers body of work, but please do not overlook the latter work
that so enriched our music and our humanity.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Mitch Richmond grabbed a basketball and took a seat on the scorer's
table next to the Sacramento King bench.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it was instinctive, the natural tendency toward what feels
comfortable. The sight of him there Sunday was brief reminder of the
way it used to be: Richmond, with the rock in his hands most of the
time, hooping it up as the best player the Kings had.</LD>
<LD>   Richmond spent the prime of his career here, from 1991-98, putting
up his usual 22 to 23 points a night, topping out with a career-high
average of 25.9 points a game in 1996-97. Once you got past Michael
Jordan, Richmond was as good as any shooting guard in the league.</LD>
<TE>   Richmond was very good and the Kings were very bad. They made the
playoffs only once in his nine years here, taking one game from the
Seattle SuperSonics in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to say what would have sounded like the more farfetched
concept then: the Kings participating in the Western Conference
finals or Richmond sitting on the bench--anybody's bench--and simply
watching them, wishing he could get so much as a floor burn.</TE>
<TE>   You could say Richmond played a bigger part in the Kings' getting
here than the Lakers'. He was traded to the Washington Wizards in
1998 for Chris Webber, now the Kings' top player.</TE>
<TE>   And ever since Richmond came to Los Angeles as a free agent last
summer his role has steadily diminished.</TE>
<TE>   He did not play in 18 of the 82 regular-season games because of
coach's decision. He averaged only 11 minutes and 4.1 points when he
did see action and shot a career-low 40.5%.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't removed his warmups once during the Lakers' first nine
playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming here, I thought I'd play 20-25 minutes a game and go from
there," Richmond said. "It hasn't happened."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers thought he could add some scoring punch to their
reserve corps and give them eight to 10 points a game. That hasn't
happened either.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't always looked comfortable in the triangle offense. His
36-year-old legs lack spring. Probably the saddest moment of the
season, the time when you knew it just wasn't there for him, came in
San Antonio in March. Richmond knocked down a pass near the sideline.
He tried to grab the ball, but instead he toppled over and fell.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson didn't tell Richmond he wouldn't have a
role in the playoffs. He didn't tell the media, either, as he did
when he said he was "not very comfortable" playing Slava Medvedenko
or Mark Madsen.</TE>
<TE>   But it became pretty clear pretty soon in the first-round series
against Portland. Jackson has relied heavily on Kobe Bryant and Derek
Fisher in the backcourt, with Brian Shaw off the bench and the
occasional appearance by Lindsey Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   "As I look at it now, I think he's gone with a comfort level,"
Richmond said. "I look at the guys that he's playing, the bulk of the
minutes. It's the guys that have been here, the guys that went to the
championship, the guys that have been in that situation that he feels
comfortable with at that time."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said it's also a matter of circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the amount of pressure we've faced defensively, we
need a ballhandling, playmaking kind of guard," Jackson said. "I've
been looking for an opportunity to play Mitch, but so far we haven't
had a real opportunity to play him where it feels comfortable and
he's got a comfort zone where he can play at."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers haven't even had a blowout victory to get him some
minutes in garbage time.</TE>
<TE>   Richmond would gladly accept a championship ring, which would make
it all worthwhile. But he'd rather earn it.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to participate in some way, if it's one minute or two
minutes," Richmond said. "Dive on the floor and get a loose ball or
something. You want to say that you meant something."</TE>
<TE>   For now, the most positive thing Richmond has done is not be a
negative. He still has a great attitude, and he even makes jokes
about his lack of playing time. It doesn't hurt that the Wizards
bought out his contract for $10 million, which is why he had no
problem signing a one-year deal with the Lakers for $590,000.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant calls him "the ultimate professional."</TE>
<TE>   "There have been guys in the past who have made [not playing] a
distraction," Bryant said. "He hasn't done it. We've never even
talked about it, never even had to address the issue. He just
continues to be a professional, continues to work hard and if Phil
needs him to go out there in the game and perform, he's going to be
ready to do it."</TE>
<TE>   There aren't any banners in Arco Arena to commemorate anything
Richmond or the Kings did while he was here.</TE>
<TE>   He can look around and remember, though, remember when those
crowds were cheering for him.</TE>
<TE>   "What has carried me to this point, smiling, cheering the guys on,
is what I did accomplish earlier in my career, what I know I still
can do if I get the opportunity," Richmond said. "I can't sit up here
and lie to you and say it's not difficult not being a part of it,
knowing that I can contribute."</TE>
<TE>   He was the rookie of the year with the Golden State Warriors in
1989, when he came into the NBA pumping in 22 points a game. He was
the best player on a court full of All-Stars one February day in
1995. He's one of the top 25 scorers in NBA history. But most fans
haven't seen much of him because his teams weren't playing in May.
And now that he's finally on a championship contender, he's a
non-factor.</TE>
<TE>   He has never had it all together all at once. It's why he has a
hard time deciding which uniform he identifies with most closely.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent the bulk of my career [in Sacramento]," he said, before
he quickly switched back to his first three years, the Run-TMC days
with Tim Hardaway and Chris Mullin. "And I had some great times at
Golden State. That's where the fun was, really. Just going out and
lacing 'em up and having a good time."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps he hasn't worn his final jersey. He said he wants to play
next season. First, he'd like to play this season.</TE>

<HD>Another Win for Clemens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the way Roger Clemens is pitching, Bert Blyleven should consider
warming up.</LD>
<LD>   Clemens struck out 13 and recorded his 287th win, pitching the New
York Yankees past the Minnesota Twins, 3-0, Sunday at Yankee Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Clemens (7-2) moved past Hall of Famer Robin Roberts and into a
tie with Blyleven for 22nd place on baseball's all-time victory list.</LD>
<TE>   "I spoke with him briefly in Minnesota and again here," Clemens
said of Blyleven, a broadcaster for the Twins who worked the game.</TE>
<TE>   "If I catch him, he's coming back. That's what he said, he's
mounting a comeback. I said, 'All right, get ready.'"</TE>
<TE>   Clemens gave up four hits in eight innings and won his sixth
consecutive start. He set a season high for strikeouts and walked
two.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't go nine, can he?" quipped Blyleven, who last pitched in
1992. "Actually, I think it was great. He's going to continue going
up the ladder."</TE>
<TE>   Next in line for Clemens on the career victory chart is former
Dodger and Yankee left-hander Tommy John, who is at 288.</TE>
<TE>   Including last weekend's three-game sweep at the Metrodome, the
Yankees finished 6-0 against Minnesota. It was the first time in the
Twins' 42-year history that they did not win a game against the
Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, Seattle 2--Brian Daubach doubled in the go-ahead run at
Fenway Park in the series between the teams with the two best records
in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox won the last two games after losing the opener to the
AL West leaders.</TE>
<TE>   That enabled Boston to keep the best record in the majors (29-11)
over Seattle (29-14).</TE>
<TE>   Boston Manager Grady Little missed the game because of the death
of his mother, Dorothy, in Bryan, Texas, on Saturday. Bench coach
Mike Stanley ran the team.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 11, Oakland 0--Esteban Loaiza (2-0) didn't take long to
prove that he's sound, throwing a two-hitter in his second start of
the season as the Blue Jays completed a three-game sweep at Toronto.
It was Toronto's first three-game sweep since last Aug. 24-26 at
Baltimore. The Athletics have lost 13 of 16.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, Baltimore 0--Greg Vaughn hit two home runs for the
second game in a row at Baltimore and rookies Travis Harper (1-1) and
Steve Kent combined for the Devil Rays' first shutout of the season.
Vaughn ended a homerless streak at 222 at-bats Saturday night. He has
348 home runs in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 5, Cleveland 4--The Indians' Jim Thome couldn't handle
Carlos Beltran's two-out grounder, which bounced through the first
baseman's legs and allowed two runs to score as the Royals rallied in
the ninth inning at Cleveland. The Royals are 6-1 against the Indians
since May 9.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 2, Texas 1--Seth Greisinger (2-1) gave up one run and five
hits in 62/3 innings and Dmitri Young homered to lead the Tigers to a
three-game sweep at Detroit.</TE>

<HD>A Very Merry May for Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They win 18th in 21 games, 6-1 over Chicago, and
are 24-17, best start since '95 and four games out of first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Dare to dream? The Angels have mastered the art of the summer playoff
flirtation followed by the September collapse, but this year's team
so far appears diversified enough to survive September and challenge
for October.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels won again Sunday, a 6-1 victory over the Chicago White
Sox, with Jarrod Washburn, Al Levine and Troy Percival teaming on a
four-hitter and Darin Erstad and Troy Glaus driving home two runs
apiece. That's 18 victories in 21 games, with the Angels four games
out of first place in the American League West and closing fast in
the rearview mirror of the Seattle Mariners.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels are 24-17, their best start since 1995. Yes, the Angels
coughed up an 11-game lead that year, but lost amid the rubble is the
memory of one of the most dominant offenses in franchise history.</LD>
<TE>   "Position by position, that team definitely had more talent,"
outfielder Garret Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just beat people up that year," coach Joe Maddon said.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Phillips led off and hit 27 home runs. Jim Edmonds batted
second and hit 33. Tim Salmon and J.T. Snow had career years, Salmon
with 34 home runs and Snow 24. Chili Davis hit 20. Anderson arrived
from the minor leagues in June and hit 16. From the ninth spot in the
lineup, Gary DiSarcina batted .307.</TE>
<TE>   This team wins in other ways, ways that help ensure the winning
can keep going when the homers stop coming. The Angels did not hit a
home run Sunday, but a versatile offense and dependable starting
pitching carried the day, again.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad had three hits, including a single that became a double on
pure hustle. David Eckstein, Glaus and Orlando Palmeiro each stole a
base. Eckstein executed a sacrifice bunt and a suicide squeeze, the
latter so well he got a single out of it.</TE>
<TE>   "What I like most about this club is our situational hitting
prowess," Maddon said. "Right now, it's more of an academic approach
to baseball. In 1995, that was more brute strength. This is more
finesse."</TE>
<TE>   So, on a day in which cleanup hitter Anderson went 0 for 5, the
offense rolled merrily along. The Angels have fewer home runs than
any team in the league save the Kansas City Royals and Tampa Bay
Devil Rays, but they have outscored opponents, 161-65, over the last
21 games.</TE>
<TE>   The success also is testament to a terrific rotation, the
foundation of the team as envisioned by Manager Mike Scioscia and
General Manager Bill Stoneman. If nothing else, the Angels wanted to
take the field each day with a starting pitcher capable of throwing
seven innings and keeping the team in the game.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the Angels started with Chuck Finley and Mark Langston
and added Jim Abbott, but they still challenged for a pennant with
Shawn Boskie, Mike Bielecki and Brian Anderson in the rotation, never
really finding quality starters behind the big three.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I've been here, that's always been a question mark, until
this year," Anderson said. "We always had Chuck and Mark and you
don't recall who else after that."</TE>
<TE>   Said Percival: "The biggest difference is in the strength of the
pitching staff. The starters are saving the bullpen. You will see a
definite difference come September. Our bullpen will be a lot
fresher."</TE>
<TE>   In Kevin Appier, Ramon Ortiz, Aaron Sele, Scott Schoeneweis and
Washburn, the Angels believe they have five starters capable of
turning in quality innings every time out, the kind of consistency
that extends winning streaks and stops losing ones. In this 18-3 run,
an Angel starter has reached the sixth inning 20 times in 21 tries.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what was expected of us," said Washburn, who scattered
three hits over seven innings while fighting back stiffness.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels invited a touch of national skepticism by not beating
an opposing ace during their run, but they tagged Chicago ace Mark
Buerhle for three runs in the first inning en route to another
victory. So there.</TE>
<TE>   But as the Angels of '95 could remind the Angels of '02, a nice
May counts for nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge of the season is not to do it for two or three
weeks," Scioscia said, "but to do it for six months."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge of summer, and of September, awaits these Angels.</TE>

<HD>Griffin on Fast Track?</HD>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>When the Angels hired Mike Scioscia as manager, the White House did
not issue a commemorative proclamation. When the Kansas City Royals
hired Tony Pena as their new manager last week, Pena received a fax
with congratulations from Hipolito Mejia, the president of the
Dominican Republic.</LD>
<LD>   Pena, in Anaheim with the Royals tonight, is the third major
league manager from the Dominican Republic, following Felipe Alou and
Luis Pujols. When the Royals and the Detroit Tigers--managed by
Pujols--play in July, in the first meeting of Dominican managers, the
pregame managerial handshake is expected to be pictured in every
newspaper back home.</LD>
<LD>   The next Dominican manager also could be at Edison Field tonight.
Alou suggests Alfredo Griffin, the Angel first base coach, ought to
be in line for a managerial job. Griffin played in three World Series
during his 18-year career, and the Angels hold him in high regard for
his work in tutoring infielders David Eckstein, Adam Kennedy and
Alfredo Amezaga.</LD>
<TE>   Although he appreciates Alou's support, Griffin said he could
probably not be hired without first managing in the minor leagues, a
step he would not take without first discussing it with his family.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm good at what I'm doing here," Griffin said. "I enjoy it."</TE>
<TE>   Griffin has managed in the Dominican winter league for two seasons
and says he is considering an offer to manage there this winter.
Dodger third baseman Adrian Beltre played for Griffin on a team that
reached the league finals, and endorses him for a major league
managerial position.</TE>
<TE>   "He's honest with the players," Beltre said. "He's played the game
long enough. The way he managed down there, I think he's good enough
to manage here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the torn hamstring that wrecked his season on the
field, catcher Bengie Molina endured an emotionally trying 2001
season off the field, one in which his wife suffered a miscarriage,
his grandmother died, his mother was hospitalized and his parents
separated.</TE>
<TE>   The news is much better on and off the field this year. He's
hitting .291 and has thrown out a league-high 50% of opposing
baserunners. Better yet, his wife and mother are healthy, and his
parents are trying to reconcile. They plan to visit from Puerto Rico
in a few weeks. "They're trying to get back together," Molina said.
"It would be great for us and for our family."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak called the last-minute bill passed by
the Minnesota Legislature for a new baseball stadium "a giant step
backward."</LD>
<LD>   The mayor said Sunday that the bill sent to Gov. Jesse Ventura
late Saturday night makes it hard for Minneapolis to retain the
Minnesota Twins. It requires potential host cities to hold a
referendum asking voters to authorize higher restaurant and lodging
taxes for debt repayment.</LD>
<LD>   It also allows two or more cities to join together in bids for the
stadium site, but county participation is prohibited, which deals a
severe blow to Minneapolis, where taxpayers previously voted to limit
city involvement in a new stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Before the stadium bill was voted on in the state's House, some
Minneapolis lawmakers attempted to send the stadium bill back to a
conference committee for further discussion. But the House defeated
the motion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop Alex Gonzalez of the Florida Marlins was put on the
15-day disabled list because of a dislocated left shoulder. He will
consult with team physician Dan Kanell in Miami after he was injured
in Saturday's game against the San Francisco Giants.... The Milwaukee
Brewers put outfielder Matt Stairs on the 15-day disabled list
because of a strained left hamstring and activated infielder Luis
Lopez. Stairs' move is retroactive to Friday.</TE>

<LD>Jerry West, president of basketball operations for the Memphis
Grizzlies, is planning on buying a "modest" 15,000-square-foot house
in Southwind, an upscale gated community, according to Jerome
Obermark of the Memphis Commercial Appeal.</LD>
<LD>   The asking price is $3.9 million with seven acres, or $4.5 million
with 13 acres.</LD>
<LD>   It has 16 rooms, including five bedrooms, six bathrooms, three
half-bathrooms, six fireplaces, a paneled library, a weight room and
a three-car garage.</LD>
<TE>   What? No basketball court?</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which was the first NBA team to win three consecutive
championships?</TE>
<TE>   Come again? Jose Canseco's retirement recalls the appraisal of him
early in his career by Detroit Tiger manager Sparky Anderson: "I'll
tell you what. This kid is going to be something. Just look at him.
He's built like a Greek goddess."</TE>
<TE>   More Canseco: After a few years with the Oakland Athletics, he
predicted he would become the first 50-50 player--50 home runs, 50
steals--but said he couldn't do it at the Oakland Coliseum unless the
fences were moved in.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sandy Alderson, then the Athletics' general manager: "We'd be
happy to shorten the basepaths."</TE>
<TE>   Average guy: And this, from Canseco: "I see myself as a common
person. I watch cartoons like everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Bulletin board material: Rick Telander in the Chicago Sun-Times
before Saturday's Laker-King game: "The Kings' Vlade Divac has made
some asinine statement about L.A. not winning a third straight title
this year because the Lakers don't have home-court advantage. Way to
go, Vlade.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is any hope for a team to beat the Lakers, it is that
Shaq and Kobe are either injured or asleep. Tossing insults their way
pretty much takes care of the latter solution."</TE>
<TE>   Cold response: Dan Devine, the former Notre Dame and Green Bay
Packer coach who recently died at 77, coached Missouri to a 69-21
pounding of Kansas in 1969. Kansas people believed he ran up the
score.</TE>
<TE>   Said Kansas coach Pepper Rodgers: "I flashed him the peace sign
and he gave me half of it back."</TE>
<TE>   Hogging the limelight: Kansas City Royal coach John Mizerock is
from Punxsutawney, Pa., and reporters ask him questions about his
home town.</TE>
<TE>   Suffice to say he isn't a big fan of the town's most famous
resident: "I try not to be home for Groundhog Day."</TE>
<TE>   Really unfair: Bud Geracie in the San Jose Mercury News:
"According to Maverick owner Mark Cuban, 7-5 Chinese star Yao Ming is
'playing against guys half his size.' That's [nearly] 3-9."</TE>
<TE>   More Geracie: "During a Giant game at Montreal, a foul ball
shattered a window behind home plate, causing an 18-minute pane
delay."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Minneapolis Lakers, 1952-1954.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Mavericks: Most luxurious airplane, cushiest bench seats, plushest
locker room, softest towels and robes, hardest fall. At least it
won't be tough to find people to blame, since the Mavs have 16
assistant coaches."</TE>

<HD>Most of the Time, They're Career Savers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: The Dodgers' Gagne is far from the only starter
who benefited from converting to a closer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Smoltz already had been converted, but he did not officially
become a convert until he signed on the dotted line last winter.</LD>
<LD>   That's when Smoltz, one of the most successful major league
pitchers in the 1990s, spurned free-agent contract offers from
several teams that still coveted him as a starter and opted to remain
with the Atlanta Braves as a closer.</LD>
<LD>   Up to that point, Smoltz was a reluctant reliever. He had started
every regular-season game he had appeared in since 1987 until he
returned last season from an elbow injury that forced him to miss the
2000 season. He saved 10 games--and possibly his career.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a totally different role, it's night and day," said Smoltz,
who has 13 saves this season. "You fight a lot of demons that you
definitely don't fight as a starter."</TE>
<TE>   The overwhelming majority of those who are paid to finish games in
the major leagues began their pro careers starting them. A dominating
pitch or two, good control and the ability to bounce back quickly
from failure are traits shared by closers, but baseball executives
and managers say there is no formula for a successful conversion.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Koch of the Oakland Athletics, for example, never pitched in
relief in the minors, but he has never started in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't just one way to find guys that will fill that role,"
Dodger General Manager Dan Evans said. "Sometimes you have to be
creative. Sometimes, you just have to be lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Great arm strength and weak bats turned position players such as
the Angels' Troy Percival and Trevor Hoffman of the San Diego Padres
into relievers in the minor leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as Keith Foulke of the Chicago White Sox, emerged as
closers after faltering in major league stints as starters.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Gagne, who had never earned a save during his pro career, got
his shot as a closer with the Dodgers this season because of a logjam
of talent in the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes when a guy goes to the bullpen, he's not throwing as
many pitches so his fastball or another pitch seems to gain a little
life," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "I think that's what's
happening a little bit with Gagne. Throwing 15 to 25 pitches a game
is a lot different than throwing 125."</TE>
<TE>   Hall of Famer Rollie Fingers, Mike Marshall, Rich Gossage, Bruce
Sutter and Lee Smith are among those who were much better at
finishing what others started.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Eckersley was the rare front-line starter who evolved into
one of history's best closers.</TE>
<TE>   Eckersley, who recorded 197 wins and 390 saves, began his 24-year
major league career in the bullpen thanks to Frank Robinson, who was
managing the Cleveland Indians in 1975. Eckersley had played 11/2
minor league seasons, but had performed so well in spring training
that Robinson wanted him to break camp with the major league club.
Robinson said team executives balked at the idea until he assured
them he would bring Eckersley along slowly as a reliever.</TE>
<TE>   "But he didn't last long in the bullpen," Robinson said. "By the
middle of May he was in the starting rotation."</TE>
<TE>   Eckersley saved two games in 1975, but made his name as a starter
during the first 12 years of his career, winning 20 games for the
Boston Red Sox in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   On April 3, 1987, he was acquired by the A's in a trade with the
Chicago Cubs. "He was kind of in limbo when we brought him over,"
said Sandy Alderson, the A's general manager at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Alderson said the A's were hoping that Eckersley could provide
more depth in the rotation. He pitched in a "swing" role in 1987
before Manager Tony La Russa and pitching coach Dave Duncan decided
that Eckersley's control and mental toughness could make him a
closer.</TE>
<TE>   "The rest is history," Alderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Percival, the Angels' all-time saves leader, was put on track to
become the team's closer after it quickly became apparent that he was
not going to be their catcher.</TE>
<TE>   Selected by the Angels in the sixth round of 1990 draft out of UC
Riverside, Percival batted .203 and struck out 25 times in 79 at-bats
in his first season at Class-A Boise of the Northwest League. Angel
coaches, however, noticed that Percival's rocket throws from behind
the plate were traveling faster than those he caught from most
pitchers, and he was turned into a relief pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   He saved 12 games for Boise in 1991 and was in the big leagues by
1995, where he learned at the right elbow of Lee Smith, who compiled
478 saves in more than 17 big league seasons. Percival has started
only three games as a pro, all rehabilitation work with Class-A Lake
Elsinore.</TE>
<TE>   "They groomed me for this job from Day 1," said Percival, who has
six saves this season and 216 in his career. "When you do it that
way, you learn to fail at it and come back in the minor leagues
before you get up here."</TE>
<TE>   Foulke developed into a closer after he went 1-5 with an 8.26
earned-run average for the Giants in the first half of 1997 and was
traded to the White Sox. Like many, Foulke lacked command of more
than two pitches, which led to his struggles as a starter.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a dominant changeup and a plus fastball," said Evans, who
was an assistant general manager for the White Sox at the time. "Put
him in the bullpen and have him focus on 15 to 20 pitches and you
have a different guy."</TE>
<TE>   Foulke was a long reliever in 1998 and was the setup man for Bobby
Howry in 1999. He emerged as a closer the next season and saved 34
games. Last season, he had 42 saves.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't like Mariano Rivera with the Yankees--no one ever said,
'You're the closer,'" Foulke recalled. "I just started pitching the
ninth inning more and more."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Watson was the general manager of the Yankees when Rivera
moved from setup man to closer after John Wetteland signed a
free-agent contract with the Texas Rangers after the 1996 season.
Rivera's 97-mph fastball, slider and makeup made him an easy choice.</TE>
<TE>   Watson, who also was general manager of the Houston Astros, said
Rivera's seemingly natural progression is not the only way to find a
closer.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, it's just by accident--you don't have anybody else,"
Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   Take the case of the Rangers this season. They broke from spring
training confident that their staff featured not one, but two
potential closers in Jeff Zimmerman and John Rocker. But Zimmerman
got hurt and the club attempted to send Rocker to the minor leagues
in April.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Hideki Irabu, a fringe starter who was cast into the closer
role out of desperation. Irabu, who had never saved a game in parts
of five previous major league seasons, has responded with 10 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Irabu's eventual return to the rotation is not out of the
question. Not after the startling success this season of Boston's
Derek Lowe.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe saved 42 games for the Red Sox in 2000, but faltered in 2001
and lost the closer's job. He got three starts at the end of last
season and spent the off-season building up his body to rejoin the
rotation.</TE>
<TE>   On April 27, Lowe pitched the first no-hitter at Fenway Park since
1965 when he beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 10-1. Lowe is 6-1 with a
2.16 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he had good stuff, but I didn't know he had the stuff to
go nine innings," Percival said. "But me becoming a starter? Not a
chance."</TE>
<TE>   Foulke said you can take a pitcher out of the rotation, but you
can't take starting out of his blood.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no secret, I'd like to go back to starting one day," he
said. "I've been working on developing another pitch, and Lowe is one
of the guys I'm looking at. He did it. You never know."</TE>

<HD>Dodger Offense Breaks Out</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Lo Duca has four hits, Karros, Kreuter homer and
L.A. has 15 hits in 10-1 rout of Montreal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A league-leading pitching staff burdened by poor run support is
keeping the Dodgers in contention for the National League West
championship.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, the offense finally did its part and produced its most
prolific performance of the season.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers hit three home runs and pounded a season-high 15 hits
in a 10-1 victory over the Montreal Expos before 31,816 at Dodger
Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Eric Karros hit his fourth homer, Chad Kreuter hit his first and
pitcher Andy Ashby hit the first of his career as the Dodgers scored
in each of the first six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lo Duca went four for four, Karros three for three and
struggling Shawn Green returned to the lineup and avoided going
hitless in the seven-game home stand when he laced a ground-rule
double in the eighth inning against former Dodger Matt Herges.</TE>
<TE>   The victory gave the Dodgers three wins in four games against the
Expos, helped them salvage a 4-3 home stand and improved their record
to 25-19.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been putting our staff in a situation where they've got to
be almost perfect," said Karros, whose home run capped a three-run
first inning. "This series, we swung the bats a little better and,
hopefully, it will carry over to the next series."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are off today and will begin a six-game trip Tuesday
at Milwaukee. The trip concludes with a three-game series at Phoenix
against the defending World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy, who watched the New York Mets shut out
his team last Tuesday and Wednesday, does not expect many repeats of
Sunday's offensive onslaught.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need seven and eight, nine runs a day, but the way the
offense performed today, I know we're going to score four or five,"
Tracy said. "That's a lot of runs for this pitching staff the way
they are throwing."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby (3-4) turned in his second consecutive strong
performance and characterized it as his best since returning from
off-season elbow surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Last Tuesday, Ashby gave up one earned run and six hits in six
innings against the Mets, but the Dodgers lost, 3-0. Against the
Expos, he gave up one run and four hits in seven innings and lowered
his earned-run average to 3.21 in a game that took only 2 hours 20
minutes to complete.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby struck out seven and did not walk a batter while throwing
only 78 pitches, 58 for strikes. He retired 11 Expos on ground balls.
Brian Schneider had a double in the second inning, Jose Vidro
extended his hitting streak to 15 games with a single in the third
and Brad Wilkerson and pinch-hitter Troy O'Leary had singles in the
fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "He got a lot of first-pitch strikes, worked ahead in the count
and all of his pitches were down," Expo first baseman Lee Stevens
said of Ashby.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers gave Ashby a cushion by scoring three runs in the
first, two in the second and third and one each in the fourth, fifth,
and sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Expo starter Bruce Chen (2-3), could not get out of the second
inning. Karros homered to left in the first inning. Kreuter, facing
Chen for the first time, chased him with a two-run homer in the
second.</TE>
<TE>   "[Chen] had nothing--no location, no velocity," Expo Manager Frank
Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca raised his average from .295 to .314 with a run-scoring
single in the first inning, an RBI double in the third, an infield
single in the fifth and a run-scoring single in the sixth. He also
scored three runs.</TE>
<TE>   Along with his two-run homer in the first, Karros had a
run-scoring single in the third and a single in the fifth to raise
his average from .298 to .313. Green had been benched for Saturday's
game against the Expos as Tracy tried to ease the pressure on his
slumping No. 3 hitter. Green struck out twice and grounded out before
hitting his eighth-inning double.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he had a few good at-bats as far as his approach, and
for me the icing on the cake was the double because that ball jumped
off his bat the way we're accustomed to seeing it happen when Shawn
Green is hitting it," Tracy said.</TE>

<LD>Shawn Green returned to the lineup Sunday against the Montreal Expos
after sitting out the day before.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Jim Tracy said Green approached him after Saturday night's
3-1 loss and requested that he return.</LD>
<LD>   "He came in and said he wanted to go again," Tracy said.</LD>
<TE>   Green had sat out only two previous games as a Dodger, one because
of injury and one to observe a Jewish holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Green said he thought the day off served him well, though it did
not appear that way until his final at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   He struck out looking against left-hander Bruce Chen in the first
inning, drew a walk from Masato Yoshii and scored on Paul Lo Duca's
double in the third and struck out swinging against Britt Reames in
the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, he ripped a shot into the right-field gap against
Matt Herges. The ball bounced into the right-field pavilion for a
ground-rule double.</TE>
<TE>   "When you've been struggling, you need a starting point," Tracy
said. "I think for him, it's a real good starting point."</TE>
<TE>   Green, who is batting .231, was not getting overly excited, not
after finishing the home stand one for 19.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one hit," he said. "Once I get up there and have two or
three good games, I'll feel like things are starting to click."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Herges, traded to the Expos by the Dodgers in March, said he
almost begged Expo Manager Frank Robinson for a chance to pitch
against his former teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't even imagine how glad I am to have that over with,"
Herges said. "I needed to face the fact that I'm on another team."</TE>
<TE>   Herges gave up a single to former roommate Jeff Williams, got Alex
Cora to fly out to right and Adrian Beltre to line out to center
before surrendering a ground-rule double to Green in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of my best friends in the world," Herges said of Green.
"I guarantee I didn't throw him a cookie. I was trying to get him
out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby's solo home run into the left-field pavilion in the
fourth inning was the first homer of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even think I hit one in T-ball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the Dodgers have had numerous players that posted
overwhelming statistics in triple-A but could not duplicate their
prowess in the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   That won't be a problem this season.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said the Dodgers' offensive struggles would not be fixed by
calling up a player from triple-A Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless somebody is slipping beneath the radar screen of what I've
watched very closely for two years, I don't know that there is some
prospect down there that is rocking and rolling and ready to go
that's going to uplift this entire situation offensively and have
everyone in the Los Angeles area saying, 'That's the guy we needed.'"
Tracy said. "He's not there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan did not play for the sixth consecutive game because
of a strained ribcage muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan took swings in the batting cage and will play Tuesday at
Milwaukee in the first game of a six-game trip that will also take
the Dodgers to Arizona to play the defending World Series-champion
Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek was scheduled to have a bump on
the back of his right hand drained of fluid after Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "I tweaked it awhile ago and something happened where fluid caused
a pocket that was causing pain," Grudzielanek said. "It's been going
on too long. I want to get it out of there so it can heal up right
away."</TE>

<LD>A recap of events while pondering the similarities between the words
"dumbbells" and "cowbells."</LD>
<LD>   News item: Sacramento King fans hit 128 on the decibel meter.</LD>
<LD>   Second thought: Congratulations on this record-setting
achievement. If you could cash decibels in for points, your team
would have crushed the Lakers by 22.</LD>
<TE>   News item: Shaquille O'Neal continues to be hobbled by injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: I've stood bug-eyed and transfixed during the
late-night testimonials, analyzed the infomercial literature,
listened to former Dodger Jim Levebre until I was blue in the face,
and humbly submit to Shaq these three potentially life-altering
words: "Super Blue Stuff."</TE>
<TE>   News item: USA Today letter writer complains of Shaq: "If not for
his size and strength, O'Neal would be handing out towels and cups of
water from behind the Lakers' bench."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: If not for his speed, Michael Johnson would just
be a slow guy; if not for his voice, Pavarotti would just be an
Italian.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Angels are hottest team in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: This is the season it finally comes together,
right, the year we put 40 years of misery and malaise behind
us--Mincher, Meoli, Monge, Mulliniks. This is the year Mike Scioscia
pushes the right buttons and takes his team to the pennant precipice.</TE>
<TE>   This is the season that ends ... in a strike?</TE>
<TE>   Curses!</TE>
<TE>   News item: Baseball players consider strike date in August.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: You ever get the feeling that their union is the
only union most baseball players really care about? I mean, can you
imagine these guys picketing outside a meatpacking plant in Oshkosh?</TE>
<TE>   News item: Seattle Mariner reliever Jeff Nelson attempts to
auction bone fragments removed during elbow surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: EBay says no way on body parts, so don't get any
ideas Rulon Gardner (toe), Ronnie Lott (pinkie finger), Evander
Holyfield (ear), Tommy John (elbow tendon), Dennis Rodman (brain
cells) or Gaylord Perry (spit).</TE>
<TE>   This eBay edict should officially put to rest inquiries involving
early 20th century pitching star Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Shaq uses tweezers to remove own stitches from right
index finger.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Far as we know, eBay has no policy against hawking
stitches.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Fifty-four climbers reach summit of Mt. Everest on the
same day.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: The hike to the world's highest peak has become so
congested it will soon feature a "fast lane" for two-or-more packers,
a mini-mart, "Sherpa 'N Go," and a sign at the top that reads "Next
rest stop: 29,035 feet (down)."</TE>
<TE>   Also under construction: The Sir Edmund Hilary Travel Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Jose Canseco says he's going to write a tell-all book
about womanizing and steroids in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Sounds like an autobiography to me. My book title
suggestion: "Bawl Four."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Canseco says 85% of today's players use steroids.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: I'm 85% certain Canseco has no shot of making the
Hall of Fame when he becomes eligible in the 2007 class that includes
Tony Gwynn, Cal Ripken and Mark McGwire.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Green Bay Packer running back Ahman Green faces
domestic abuse charges.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Nebraska guy? Yep.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Man receives 30-year prison sentence for selling phony
spectator badges to this year's Masters golf tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Golf really is the cruelest sport. The United
States Golf Assn. penalty for not replacing a divot is 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Allen Iverson starts his own record company, telling
the Philadelphia Inquirer: "I'm looking for all kinds of acts,
whether they be rap, R&amp;B, rock 'n' roll, gospel, whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Cut to recording studio after Iverson signs his
first group.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson: OK, fellas, there's a lot at stake here, so why don't we
rehearse a few of the numbers before we roll tape.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman for band: Practice? Oh, no, Mr. Iverson, we don't
practice.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Oscar De La Hoya says of Mike Tyson, "He's a circus
act, and he's killing boxing."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Oscar, the only difference between the circus and
boxing is the circus has two more rings.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Six teams emerge as suitors for possible NFL franchise
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Let's go right to the capsule summaries.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Vikings: Pro: We already swiped the city's basketball
team and would happily heist its hockey team if it still had one.</TE>
<TE>   Con: Never! Or, they'd first have to expunge the franchise history
books. We still suffer night tremors about Metropolitan Stadium,
heaters on the sideline, Bobby Bryant running 90 yards with a blocked
kick for a touchdown, Tom Mack getting called for illegal motion
(note: the ref was Tommy Bell); the Rams, losing at the Coliseum, in
the rain, in 1977, with Fran Tarkenton injured, to backup Bob Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Cardinals: Pro: Jake Plummer would still be the
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Con: Bill Bidwill would still be the owner. Could you imagine the
worst owner in NFL history paired with the Clippers' Donald Sterling?</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: This town isn't small enough for the two of them.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo Bills: Pro: Team cheerleaders are nicknamed "The Jills."</TE>
<TE>   Con: Clippers started off in Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis Colts: Pro: Team could relocate in a heartbeat. In
1984, in the dead of night, owner Robert Irsay packed up the trucks
and moved the team out of Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Con: Former team owner, Carroll Rosenbloom, once married a singer
named Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans Saints: Pro: In 1967, John Gilliam returned opening
kickoff in franchise history for a touchdown against the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   Con: Saints haven't done squat since.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Chargers: Pro: Easy freeway access. Can either take
Interstate 5 or go the back way up Interstate 15 through Temecula.</TE>
<TE>   Con: Can't bring their zoo.</TE>

<DH>Gagne grew up in Montreal, where saves are for goalies, but
he's icing games for Dodgers with big-time heat</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>The first time Richard Gagne saw his son, Eric, pitch for the
Dodgers, a sudden flood of memories brought him to tears.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not something I can describe," he said. "I was just thinking
of when he was a little kid playing catch, and I saw Eric's life in
baseball before my eyes.</LD>
<LD>   "One thing I remembered was that when Eric was a child, if it
rained and he couldn't play baseball, he would cry because he loved
the game so much and he wanted to play. I can still feel the love for
the game that Eric had."</LD>
<TE>   Eric, now a grown-up and burly 26, laughed at the reminder of his
long-ago sorrows. But during his childhood in Montreal, where spring
and summer can be sweet but brief, a damp day was a catastrophe for a
boy who loved baseball as much as hockey.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd only play 30 games a year, at most," he said, "and if it
rained, they don't do it again. There's no postponement. They
canceled it. You play 29 games instead. We had only 2 1/2 months of
summer, if we were lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne was lucky--and he was good. Although Montreal is better
known as a cradle of hockey players than pitchers, Gagne has
developed into a mainstay of the Dodger bullpen and one of the
National League's top closers.</TE>
<TE>   Mixing a fastball that reaches the high 90s with a sharp curve and
a changeup that freezes batters in their spikes, Gagne has earned 14
saves in 15 opportunities. He has an earned-run average of 1.17 in 21
appearances, with four walks and 29 strikeouts in 23 innings. His
success, so unlikely for a kid from hockey-mad Montreal, is a source
of delight to his father, a Montreal bus driver. "This is
impossible," Richard Gagne said in his native French. "It's like
winning the lottery."</TE>
<TE>   Eric has defied the odds all along.</TE>
<TE>   "He thrives on challenges," Dodger pitching coach Jim Colborn
said, "and that was one of the ways we tried to motivate him last
year when he was a starter. I'd try to tell him the things he
couldn't do, and if you tell him he can't do something, that will
pretty much make him do it."</TE>
<TE>   Tell him he's not likely to become a baseball player because so
few come from Montreal--only 10 Canadians were on major league
rosters when the season started, none from Quebec. Tell him he can't
make it in the English-speaking world because he speaks only French.
Tell him he's too antsy to be a starter, a fault he readily
acknowledges.</TE>
<TE>   No matter the obstacle, Gagne has overcome it.</TE>
<TE>   "He realized his dream," said his mother, Carole, a waitress in
Montreal. "It's fantastic. The important thing is he is doing what he
loves, and for that I am happy."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Gagne played softball, so it was natural for him to
introduce Eric to baseball when the boy was 3. Richard would collect
all the kids in the family's East-end neighborhood and drive them to
Expo games at Jarry Park, the bandbox the Expos called home their
first eight years in the National League.</TE>
<TE>   "I always loved baseball, but I loved hockey too," Eric said. "But
I was always a better baseball player than hockey player.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a good hockey player, but not great."</TE>
<TE>   His baseball skills got him into Polyvalente Edouard Monpetit, a
Montreal high school that combined studies with sports instruction.
His classmates included baseball and hockey players and synchronized
swimmers.</TE>
<TE>   He always had a strong and resilient arm and ample energy, but he
never expected he'd be able to carve out a career in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wanted to be an Expo," he said, "but I never really knew
how to do it.... I didn't even know there was a draft."</TE>
<TE>   His first step toward a baseball career took him to Seminole
(Okla.) Junior College, and it was a jolt. He was reared in a
French-speaking home--Richard and Carole speak no English--and he
felt adrift in a strange, new world. He had to tape his classes and
translate them to grasp the material.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated junior college," he said. "It was hard. But it was worth
it. You've got to pay a price somewhere. It was the best thing that
happened to me, to go away from home and be in a new environment and
learn how to live by myself. You become more mature when you have
more responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   He was signed by the Dodgers in 1995 and was 7-6 for Class-A
Savannah in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Major elbow surgery idled him the entire 1997 season, but he
bounced back to compile a 9-7 record with 144 strikeouts in 139 2/3
innings the next season at Class-A Vero Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne moved to double-A San Antonio in 1999, where he was voted
Texas League pitcher of the year for his 12-4 record, 2.63 ERA and
185 strikeouts in 167 2/3 innings. His wife, Valerie, also from
Montreal, was living with him then, stabilizing his life.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though you have friends, every year it's different friends
because there's so much movement in the minor leagues," Gagne said.
"Having her there made it a lot easier."</TE>
<TE>   But not for her--at least at first.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't speak any English," said Valerie, who has become fluent
in the language but speaks French at home with Eric and their
17-month-old daughter, Faye. "The worst thing was when he went on a
three-week road trip and I was by myself. All the wives helped me.
They were very nice."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne split the 2000 season between the Dodgers and triple-A
Albuquerque. All but one of his 20 Dodger appearances were as a
starter, but that balance shifted last season, when he started 24
games and made nine relief appearances.</TE>
<TE>   He was 5-6 with a 4.92 ERA as a starter but 1-1 with a 3.14 ERA as
a reliever, a role he began to enjoy because he could pitch every
day, instead of stewing between starts.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers toyed with restoring him to the rotation this season
because they were uncertain how starters Kevin Brown, Andy Ashby and
Darren Dreifort would recover from arm surgery. But it was clear
early in spring training that Gagne's stuff made him an ideal closer,
and they traded Matt Herges to Montreal to open the spot for Gagne.</TE>
<TE>   He underwent his bullpen baptism April 11 at San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   With runners on first and third with one out and Jeff Kent and
Reggie Sanders due up, Dodger Manager Jim Tracy visited the mound and
told Gagne he probably should bring Jesse Orosco in to get the last
two outs.</TE>
<TE>   "But he said he was going to let me stay in and battle through
it," Gagne said. "That showed they had belief in me that I can do the
job and that I should believe in myself. I think that was the biggest
turnaround in my career so far."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne struck out Kent and got Sanders on a fly ball. Neither Gagne
nor the Dodgers have looked back since.</TE>
<TE>   "He's courageous," Colborn said. "And the big thing that made him
come on this year is his ability to harness all the energy he has and
keep the right level of intensity, because there were times last year
he'd be overhyped, and the advantage he had would be a disadvantage."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne acknowledged he's stronger mentally than he was a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "My stuff is not any better. I'm more confident, more mature, more
experienced," he said. "I've learned so much from being around
Brownie, Ashby and Dreifort. Those guys go about their business every
day and are so professional, even though they make their money and
they don't have to work the rest of their lives....</TE>
<TE>   "I love being a closer. I love the adrenaline rush. It's a chance
to be in the game every day and it's so much fun. You don't have to
think so much. You go out and give everything you've got. You don't
have to over-think. That was my problem between starts. I was getting
myself so mentally tired because I was thinking and over-thinking. I
was going through games four, five times in my head and then you come
in the games and you're mentally exhausted, and you haven't done
anything yet.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something where you've got to be more mature. You've got to
be able to relax."</TE>
<TE>   Although Gagne is relaxed on the mound, he's nervous when it comes
to his beloved Canadiens, especially during the Stanley Cup playoffs.
Distance and his schedule left him reliant on phone calls to his
brother Dominic, who provided updates until Montreal was eliminated
in the second round by Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne will never have his name on the Cup. But his parents, though
no longer together, are united in their delight over his
accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very proud of my treasure," said Carole Gagne, who keeps a
scrapbook about her son and safeguards his trophies and awards. "Eric
has given me many, many things to be proud of. He has a lot of
ambition."</TE>
<TE>   Said Richard Gagne: "To see him in the World Series would be just
the biggest dream, but he is living a dream playing in the big
leagues now. To see him play every day, it's like the World Series to
us."</TE>

<HD>Skipping Easily Wins Murray Memorial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Besides having been the last three winners of the Jim Murray Memorial
Handicap, Kudos, Bienamado and Lazy Lode have something else in
common: All have at least one Grade I victory.</LD>
<LD>   Such an important win could be in the future of Skipping, the
winner in this year's Murray, a race named for The Times' Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist.</LD>
<LD>   A 13-10 favorite making his second start in the country for
Juddmonte Farms and trainer Bobby Frankel, Skipping blew away 7-2
second choice Startac in the final furlong to win by two lengths.</LD>
<TE>   The 5-year-old Rainbow Quest horse, ridden by Kent Desormeaux,
completed the 11/2 miles on the turf in 2:261/5.</TE>
<TE>   This was the fourth victory in 11 starts for Skipping and gave
Frankel his sixth victory in the Murray, which was run for the first
time in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   After earning his first victory in the race, Desormeaux did some
reminiscing about Murray, who died in the summer of 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was fitting the way the race unfolded because it was
named after Jim Murray," he said. "I remember reading an article by
Jim about how he was infatuated by Bill Shoemaker because Shoe was so
silky smooth.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, this horse couldn't have given me a smoother run. It was
nice and poetic like the way Jim wrote. I didn't need to do much. I
just had to aim this guy in the right direction and let him stretch
his legs. I knew he could take Startac any time I wanted. This is a
very nice horse."</TE>
<TE>   Startac, a Grade I winner himself in the Secretariat Aug. 18 at
Arlington Park, finished a length in front of 9-1 shot Our Main Man,
then came Sharbayan, Straight Flush, Poker Brad and Lasting Tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Spotting the winner four pounds (120 to 116), Startac may have
done better had he not fallen into the role of pacesetter.</TE>
<TE>   "We would rather have had something to run at, but the way things
unfolded, we found ourselves on the lead," jockey Mike Smith said.
"He focuses better when he has a target, but I didn't want to take
him back and get him rank. He ran well, but the winner ran some
race."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Azeri, a winner of two Grade I races in a row, was given
highweight of 122 pounds for the $200,000 Milady Breeders' Cup
Handicap Saturday at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   The Milady is the first of three Grade I races that will be run
during Hollywood Park's lone six-day week of the meet. The Memorial
Day card will feature the $500,000 Shoemaker Breeders' Cup Mile and
the $500,000 Gamely Breeders' Cup Handicap, along with a $1-million
guaranteed pool in the pick six.</TE>
<TE>   Azeri, a 4-year-old daughter of Jade Hunter owned by the family of
the late Allen Paulson and trained by Laura De Seroux, won the Santa
Margarita Handicap at Santa Anita on March 10, then came back four
weeks later to take the Apple Blossom Handicap at Oaklawn Park.</TE>
<TE>   A winner in five of six races in her career, Azeri is expected to
be opposed by Affluent, also a multiple-stakes winner, as well as Ask
Me No Secrets, Collect Call, Cashmina and Alexine.</TE>

<HD>No Missing the Boat at Indy</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: Driver sweats out 'Bump Day,' and, with help
from a rain shower, holds on as the race's 33rd and last qualifier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>For years, as the son of Ascot Park's legendary promoter J.C.
Agajanian, Cary Agajanian has prayed for sunshine on race day.</LD>
<LD>   For most of this past week, and especially Sunday, Cary prayed for
rain.</LD>
<LD>   "It was definitely a change to be praying for rain all week," said
the co-owner of Billy Boat's No. 98 Chevrolet, whose car may have
been saved from being bumped from the Indianapolis 500 starting field
by a late shower. "God was a little confused today, I think, but I
know my dad was up there watching over Billy.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm sure my dad was looking down at me, wondering what I was up
to, but it was necessary, and it worked," said Agajanian, whose
family has had a No. 98 in the 500 nearly every year since his father
came here in 1958 with Johnny Mantz.</TE>
<TE>   For the third year in a row, Boat was the central figure of Indy's
traditional "Bump Day," where non-qualified cars can knock one of the
33 qualifiers out of the race by posting a faster speed before the 6
p.m. gun sounds.</TE>
<TE>   Boat, who accepted a surprisingly slow 226.589 mph last Saturday,
was the driver on the bubble after George Mack bumped Billy Roe and
left Boat as the 33rd slowest qualifier at 2:35 p.m. That meant more
than three hours of sweating for Boat and his fellow team owners,
Agajanian and Mike Curb.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only were we praying and the whole team was praying, the
entire state of Arizona was praying," said Boat, a 36-year-old
Phoenix businessman. "It was probably 105 degrees [there] today, but
they were praying for rain, for us."</TE>
<TE>   Only two drivers, Oriol Servia and Jimmy Kite, made attempts at
bumping Boat before a persistent rain shut down the track at 3:40
p.m. Servia aborted his run after two laps at 226.6, while Kite
stalled three times because of clutch failure and by the time the
problem was repaired, the rain was falling.</TE>
<TE>   When track officials called it a day, Kite and Donnie Beechler
were the only cars left in the qualifying line.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go back to Pole Day, when we took that qualifying speed,
we felt that weather was going to play a factor into who would get
into this year's race," said Boat. "It looked like we were pretty
accurate until I got here this morning and I looked up and the flags
weren't moving. The sun comes out and the track gains two miles an
hour, and then I thought, 'We're in trouble.' Until I saw those
clouds coming in a little later I thought we were in serious jeopardy
of being on the outside looking in."</TE>
<TE>   After a week of bitter cold and gusty winds that made high speeds
all but impossible, Sunday turned milder and windless, an ideal day
for speed. And not what Boat and Agajanian--nor Michael
Andretti--were looking for.</TE>
<TE>   Quickly, Arie Luyendyk, rookies Alex Barron, Higeaki Hattori and
Dario Franchitti, along with veterans Paul Tracy, Airton Dare, Greg
Ray and Mark Dismore, brought the field up to 32 with speeds in
excess of 227 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Roe, gambling with a snail's-pace speed of 212.283 that it
would rain, filled the field as the No. 33 starter.</TE>
<TE>   Andretti, whose first-day speed of 226.780 was second slowest,
gambled by withdrawing his qualified car in hopes of putting his
backup car in with a safer speed. It worked, Andretti clicking off a
228.713.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were going to get bumped, and we knew we had a
pretty fast backup car, so we thought we had better go out," said
Andretti, looking for his first win in 13 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Mack was the surprise package. After never getting above 225.9 all
month in 310 Racing's G Force-Chevrolet, the rookie driver from
Inglewood strung together four solid 227 laps for a qualifying
average of 227.150. This bumped Roe and left Boat on the bubble.</TE>
<TE>   "I can sleep tonight, because I'm feeling good," an elated Mack
said. "My team stayed up all night last night, not just last night
but lots of nights, just to make this happen.... It's the best
feeling in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Agajanian said he had a special attachment to Boat because he came
up from the short-track ranks, from places like Ascot where the
Agajanian family promoted races for nearly half a century.</TE>
<TE>   "Billy is special to us because he came to our racetrack, Ascot,
with his father when he was 15 or 16 years old and we sent him home
because he was too young. He was supposed to be 18. We did the same
thing with Jeff Gordon and Little Al [Unser], but Billy came back and
made us eat our words by setting track records at Ascot that will
never be broken."</TE>
<TE>   Ascot was closed in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The 33-car field is the fastest in history with an average
qualifying speed of 228.648 mph, bettering the 1996 record of
227.807. There are nine rookies and six former champions in the
starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   For only the second time, the slowest qualifier has a faster speed
than the previous year's pole-sitter. Scott Sharp won the pole last
year with a 226.037 mph speed. In 1972, Cale Yarborough was slowest
at 178.864 mph, which was faster than Peter Revson's 1971 pole speed
of 178.696.</TE>

<HD>Serena Closing the Gap</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Is there a Betty Crocker Center for recovering gelato junkies?</LD>
<LD>   Serena Williams seemed to think so as she riffed after winning the
Italian Open Sunday, a pretty respectable prize for somebody who
hadn't won a clay-court tennis tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "I really need some gelato," she giggled impatiently. "They've got
the best ice cream in the world here. Yeah, I guess you could call me
a gelato junkie, and maybe someday I'll have to go through the
12-step program at the Betty Crocker Center."</LD>
<TE>   Serena, in closing what she calls her "Venus gap," was many tasty
flavors of tennis player during her dazzling week on the central
court at Il Foro Italico. She concluded with a double-dipping, 7-6
(8-6), 6-4, victory over the slight and stylish Belgian teenager
Justine Henin, Wimbledon finalist last year to big sister Venus.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yes, Venus and "the gap." Venus was supposed to win this
tournament for the second time and burnish her No. 1 ranking. But
something went wrong beforehand. A little heavy lifting strained her
right wrist, causing her to withdraw to a front-row seat alongside
mother Oracene Williams.</TE>
<TE>   But that idleness allowed Jennifer Capriati to jump ahead and be
designated No. 1 the WTA computer. Whereupon Serena out-bashed
Capriati, 6-2, 3-6, 7-5, in the thrilling Saturday semifinal
(probably the best match of the season), even though Capriati had
three break-point opportunities to lead 4-0 in the third set.</TE>
<TE>   After rescuing that one, Serena said, "I'm closing the Venus gap."</TE>
<TE>   Just as father Richard Williams informed the world a few years
ago, his daughters are in a tussle for the top, currently holding
their highest combined rankings: Nos. 2-3, Venus a length in front.
Though slight enough to fit in Serena's racket bag, Henin's a
slugger. But not a grinder. Her strokes, particularly the
lightning-bolt, one-handed backhand, are effortless and pure.</TE>
<TE>   But whenever Henin got too close for comfort, Serena turned on her
power, speed and grit. She went vocal, her growls as menacing as her
strokes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather stay calm and quiet," she said, "but the grunting
starts when things get intense."</TE>
<TE>   For a moment Serena was worried. And afterward she was sore from a
strained right thigh and sprained left ankle that caused her to call
an injury timeout in the seventh game. "When that happened I said to
myself, 'Oh, no, not that again!' It was the ankle that kept me out
of the Australian Open," Serena said. "But they were taped before and
re-taped during the timeout. I'll be OK for Paris," where the French
Open starts a week from today.</TE>
<TE>   It took 1 hour 40 minutes (of the 1:56 match) before serve was
cracked, then in 1-2-3 fashion. Serena's forehand sent her ahead 4-3,
but the Belgian struck back for her lone break to 4-4 only to fall
again immediately.</TE>

<LD>Upon further reflection, Coach Rick Adelman decided against removing
swingman Hedo Turkoglu from the starting lineup in favor of guard
Bobby Jackson for Game 2 tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Turkoglu was scoreless, missing all eight shots he attempted in 29
minutes Saturday in the Kings' 106-99 loss to the Lakers in Game 1.
More than one pressroom wit dubbed Turkoglu "He-Don't" afterward.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson had 21 points in 25 minutes in a reserve role.</LD>
<TE>   Turkoglu has been starting in place of Peja Stojakovic, who has
been sidelined because of a sprained right ankle since Game 3 of the
Kings' conference semifinal victory over the Dallas Mavericks.
Turkoglu vowed to drive to the basket more often tonight in Game 2.
He said he spent too much time Saturday on the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a tough game," Adelman said. "What he's got to do is play
the whole game. He got down. Maybe he felt the pressure. We're going
to give him some opportunities where he can be more aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   Adelman said he doesn't want Jackson, who is 6 feet 1, to join 6-1
point guard Mike Bibby and 6-6 shooting guard Doug Christie in the
starting lineup because it gives the Kings matchup problems.</TE>
<TE>   "They're two pretty small guards," Adelman said of Jackson and
Bibby. "How do you match up with Kobe [Bryant]? We talked about it,
but at this point, we're not going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Laker forward Rick Fox, who muzzled Turkoglu in Game 1 and
thwarted Stojakovic in last season's conference semifinal sweep of
the Kings, agreed with Adelman. Fox also brought up another issue the
Kings face if they start Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "They risk losing something off the bench if they start him," Fox
said of Jackson. "[But] if you're in a desperate situation, you do
what you have to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The King defense rested in the first quarter, which accounted for
the Lakers' 36-22 lead and 16-for-24 shooting. At least that was the
general consensus after practice Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "The first quarter was terrible," center Vlade Divac said. "We let
them have a lot of open shots. We didn't make shots. We put ourselves
in a difficult situation. It's not the way we're supposed to play.
We've been in this situation before, but not against the Lakers. It's
always tougher against the Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Asked if tonight's game was must-win, Adelman said, "We don't want
to go to L.A. down, 2-0."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if there were significant adjustments that needed to be
made, he said, "We've got to play 48 minutes. We can't have one
quarter like that first one against that team. We're not going to
suddenly become a half-court team or play a zone. The adjustments are
minor things. We have to execute better."</TE>
<TE>   Asked why he hasn't joined in the trash talking during the series,
he said, "It's 10 minutes out of your life that you'll never get
back. Why worry about it?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For all the talk about the Kings' great home-court advantage at
raucous Arco Arena, the recent facts would indicate they are better
on the visitors' home floor. The Kings' loss Saturday gave them a 3-3
playoff record at home. They are 4-0 on the road.</TE>

<HD>Horry Better Late Than Webber</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Two of the more open players on the floor in Game 1 were Robert Horry
and Chris Webber, which made sense, since they were supposed to be
guarding each other.</LD>
<LD>   Horry made shots early, Webber made them in the middle of the
game, and then Horry scored on a late dunk after the Sacramento Kings
had drawn within five points. Horry had 18 points after averaging
eight in the Lakers' first eight playoff games.</LD>
<LD>   Webber, the Kings' best player, did not score in the final 51/2
minutes. He put himself at a tremendous disadvantage in that regard
by not shooting.</LD>
<TE>   "You're happy you win the game, but you're kind of upset he got 28
points," Horry said. "He basically did what he wanted. Hopefully,
that will be different in the next game."</TE>
<TE>   The Laker defense on Webber was similar to their defense against
Tim Duncan in the last series. Duncan averaged 29 points, many on
jump shots, and the Lakers concentrated on keeping him from the rim
and the other Spurs from scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he would defend Webber closer in tonight's Game 2 and
perhaps risk allowing him a step to the basket, Horry said, "I
haven't figured it out yet. I'll sleep on that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The most quotable Laker even before he started pointing out the
flaws in Sacramento's system, Rick Fox has spent the last few days
defending his views and his right to express them.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where I stand," Fox said. "I stand on the fact I know what
we're capable of doing. I know what I've watched the Kings do the
last three years, their style of play, which I still don't understand
how, at this time of year, that style is going to be successful. I'm
not a coach. I haven't had success coaching in this league. I just
know what I've seen work. And I think it's difficult to keep a tempo
like that consistent in a playoff atmosphere and win a series. It's
something I'm sure they struggle with because it's something they've
had success to get to this point doing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Devean George watched friend Tyronn Lue turn a few strong playoff
minutes with the Lakers into a two-year contract with the Washington
Wizards.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, George can be a free agent, but he hadn't done much
offensively in the playoffs before scoring nine points in 12 minutes
Saturday. He picked up five fouls, or he would have been on the floor
longer.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't really concerned," he said. "It's a learning process.
Things are a little different when the stakes are a little higher.</TE>
<TE>   "The last series ... I was in a little shooting slump. I was
playing too tight, probably, on the offensive end. I played hard on
the defensive end. On the offensive end I wanted to make sure I was
hitting my shots. I was like, 'Forget it.' ... It's OK if I miss a
shot."</TE>
<TE>   George was kicked in the right shin in Game 1 and played the
second half with it padded and taped. He said it would not bother him
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant had his bruised right knee taped during Game 1, but
didn't even wear a sleeve for Sunday's practice. "I'm good," he
said.... Horry, banged twice in the head and once in the thigh in
Game 1, was chipper and unbruised Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Shaq Takes a Page Out of Past</HD>
<DH>Lakers: O'Neal is starting to look like his old self,
especially on defense, complicating Kings' outlook as they try to get
even in conference finals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>En route to Saturday's basketball game, somewhere on the short
stretch between downtown and Arco Arena on Interstate 5, presumably,
Shaquille O'Neal's two-way pager rang.</LD>
<LD>   From Rick Fox, a few rows ahead on the luxury bus, the message
reminded him to hurry back on defense.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal grunted and put the device back in his pocket.</LD>
<TE>   Several hours later, after the Lakers beat the Sacramento Kings,
106-99, in the first of the best-of-seven-game Western Conference
finals, Fox's pager buzzed.</TE>
<TE>   The message from O'Neal: "Don't worry about what I'm doing."</TE>
<TE>   Fox laughed.</TE>
<TE>   It was a different O'Neal who got after the Kings in Game 1. He
ran hard, he blocked four shots, he changed a handful of others,
despite only a little relief from several injuries. After the Kings
spent the week talking about pushing the tempo, and about the strain
it would put on O'Neal's feet and fitness, it was O'Neal who beat
Vlade Divac to the baseline, and O'Neal who often outran Scot Pollard
down the floor.</TE>
<TE>   He got back on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the key to this series, if you want to break it down to
its simplest form," Fox said. "If we can get Shaq back to the paint,
along with [power forwards] Samaki [Walker] and Robert [Horry] ... it
allows us perimeter players to close out on their shooters a little
quicker. It allows us to recover defensively. He can control that,
just by the focus of getting back."</TE>
<TE>   The series resumes tonight at Arco, where the Lakers will play to
take two games at the raucous and supposedly impenetrable arena in
the meadow. Fact is, the Lakers have won six of their last seven
games here, including their last three playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   "If we win the second game," Laker Coach Phil Jackson had said
Saturday evening, "we know we've got them by the throat a little
bit."</TE>
<TE>   The focus of the Lakers had not changed in eight previous playoff
games, seven of them victories, in series against Portland and San
Antonio. They played off O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, just a little more
off of Bryant than usual.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's ankles were sore and his toe was raw, and then his finger
was cut. His mediocre regular season--mediocre for him--was becoming
a mediocre postseason. Again, for him.</TE>
<TE>   Then began the conference finals, and O'Neal ran shoulder to
shoulder with the other centers, and when Jackson figured he'd rest
O'Neal for a few extra minutes at the start of the fourth quarter
Saturday, O'Neal asked back into the game. He played 42 minutes and
scored 26 points. Together, Divac and Pollard played 50 minutes and
scored 16.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I'm just pacing myself," O'Neal said. "I'm just doing
what's needed. The first year, it was all about me scoring 40 points
a game for us to win. Last year, a little bit of everybody was doing
it. This year, it's Kobe doing it, and I just got Kobe's back.</TE>
<TE>   "So, I'm just trying to play good defense on the pick-and-roll and
get back on defense. I'm just doing whatever's asked of me."</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by cameras and notepads he would have ducked last week,
O'Neal laughed easily. Teammates have noticed the same personality
shift, back to the breezy, playful moods he carried before the
injuries, before the Indocin fouled his stomach and the constant ache
fouled his game.</TE>
<TE>   It could be that O'Neal is experiencing less pain, in part because
he had three days off between series. The ankle sprains are healed or
healing, and he can feel the texture of the basketball on his right
forefinger again. The toe, of course, probably won't be right until
surgery, which he probably will have this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "He felt a little bit better," Laker guard Brian Shaw said. "I
think he felt challenged a little bit more because of all of the
talking that was being done. And the fact that this is going to be
one of the highest-rated series in a while [for television]--at least
that's what I think. When it's that kind of stage, Shaq wants to be
the star of the show."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were dominant when he was, winning 15 of 16 playoff
games last year. While the postseason hasn't been as fluid this
spring, nor as decisive, the Lakers are into their third series, up a
road game on the Kings, and O'Neal appears to be just getting
started.</TE>
<TE>   Said Horry: "I think he can see the light at the end of the
tunnel. He knows we're close to going back to the Finals. This is him
doing something that a lot of players don't get a chance to do. If he
can get back to these Finals, he's going to really be put up there as
an elite player, especially all the trouble he had this year with
feet, toes, ankles, shoes, finger, that stuff. They're going to say
he overcame all these adversities to get back."</TE>
<TE>   And he's getting much better at getting back.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Rockets Steal Knicks' Thunder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some fix that turned out to be.</LD>
<LD>   You've heard of willing the ball into the basket? Sunday all five
boroughs of New York tried to will the Knicks' pingpong ball to the
top of the NBA lottery.</LD>
<LD>   Right on time, a longshot came in, only it wasn't theirs. Instead,
it was the Houston Rockets--with the fifth-worst record and only an
8.9% chance--who hit.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Knicks' 4.4% chance went nowhere. They'll draft
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically or not, with 20 games left in the season, the Knicks
were tied with Houston and Cleveland for the No. 25 slot the Rockets
wound up with. Unfortunately for the Knicks, as it turned out, they
finished better than the Cavaliers and Rockets. Some millenniums it
goes that way for you.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how it they'll pick, with a guess on who each team in the
lottery will take:</TE>
<TE>   1. Houston--Yao Ming. No-brainer. The Rockets are a small,
rebuilding team in a conference dominated by huge ones, so how can
they pass up a 7-foot-5, 296-pound prospect? The only other player
they could consider is Duke point guard Jay Williams but as Steve
Francis, who represented them at the drawing, noted, "I know we
definitely don't need help at the point guard position." Several
teams want immediate help, but the Rockets are working toward the
2003-04 season, when they move into their new arena. So Yao fits.</TE>
<TE>   2. Chicago--Williams. The Bulls finally get a break. He's the one
they wanted in any case and, with a move by Tyson Chandler, they
could get back in the hunt for the playoffs. The Bulls just went from
wretches of the Earth to a promising young team.</TE>
<TE>   3. Golden State--Out of luck again. The Warriors were dying for
Williams and no other point guard in the draft is close. They might
have taken Yao but can't have him either. They may trade the pick for
a point guard. Otherwise, we'll say Kansas' 6-10 Drew Gooden.</TE>
<TE>   4. Memphis--Qyntel Woods of Northeast Mississippi Community
College. The Grizzlies don't know if Michael Dickerson will be back
and Jerry West loves raw talent. Woods "has a ton of baggage you have
to sort through," says a personnel man, but he also notes the
comparison to Tracy McGrady, at least on the offensive end, "is
pretty valid."</TE>
<TE>   5. Denver--Mike Dunleavy Jr. of Duke. Lots of scouts are very high
on him. The Nuggets can use help everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   6. Cleveland--Chris Wilcox of Maryland. He's 6-10 and athletic,
compared to 7-0 Chris Mihm, the No. 7 overall draft pick in 2000 who
has been a Cavalier disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   7. New York--Nikoloz Tskitishvili. We'll say they do the smart
thing, gamble on a 19-year-old who could be great, rather than grab a
second-echelon prospect because he's a 7-footer.</TE>
<TE>   8. Clippers--Curtis Borchardt, Stanford. Insurance against losing
Michael Olowokandi. He's a 7-footer who blocks shots and can shoot
too, but he's nowhere as strong or athletic as Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   9. Phoenix--Marcus Haislip, Tennessee. The Suns are another of
those overmatched Western smurfs trying to get bigger. He's 6-10 and
athletic.</TE>
<TE>   10. Miami--Dajuan Wagner, Memphis. Pat Riley has never been a
young players' coach but he's low on talent, not to mention point
guards. Wagner could have gone five picks higher so he would
represent value here.</TE>
<TE>   11. Washington--Chris Marcus, Western Kentucky. The Wizards are
jammed up with shooting guards so Caron Butler, whom scouts like a
lot, drops past them too. Marcus isn't athletic but at 7-0 and 275,
he's a Todd MacCulloch type, with a nice shooting touch.</TE>
<TE>   12. Clippers--Butler. The Clippers are jammed up with big guards
and small forwards too, but he's good. Their entire roster is jammed
so you'd think they'd be dealing but the word is both first-round
draft choices will stay. This is a franchise that appreciates
inexpensive help.</TE>
<TE>   13. Milwaukee--Melvin Ely, Fresno State. They need size and he's
6-10 and 255 pounds. Other possibilities would be Nene Hilario, a
6-10 Brazilian and Jared Jeffries, a 6-10 Indianan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Mexico Defeats Little Italy</HD>
<DH>Soccer: National team gears up for key World Cup match by
defeating team of AC Milan reserves, 2-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico wanted a taste of Italian soccer to prepare for the heavy dose
awaiting the team at the World Cup, and Sunday afternoon at the
Coliseum, a group of AC Milan reserves was only too pleased to
provide it.</LD>
<LD>   Scheduled to face Italy in its third and final group game June 13,
with a berth in the second round possibly at stake, Mexico caught a
glimpse of what lay ahead during a 2-1 victory-and-survival-test
before an estimated 42,000:</LD>
<LD>   Lots of Italian boots, studs up, aimed at Mexican body parts.</LD>
<TE>   Theatrical dives in the penalty area at the slightest flick of a
Mexican foot.</TE>
<TE>   Yellow cards, restarts, red cards, retreat and defend.</TE>
<TE>   That's Italian soccer, and that's what AC Milan played, even if
the actual squad sent on this barnstorm across America was, in truth,
closer to B Milan. With the likes of Paolo Maldini, Rui Costa and
Oliver Bierhoff already training with their respective World Cup
teams, Milan was distinctly short on star power against
Mexico--although it was clear, early on, that the second string was
fairly familiar with the basic game plan.</TE>
<TE>   Milan played with 10 men from the 14th minute on, after defender
Kakha Kaladze was ejected for an aggressive challenge on Mexico
forward Cuauhtemoc Blanco--moments after Blanco had given Mexico a
2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Milan scored its only goal on a gift from referee Ricardo
Valenzuela in the 55th minute, after Mexican defender Manuel Vidrio
clipped Dario Hubner in the 18-yard box. Hubner pulled a full gainer
and Valenzuela went for it, whistling Vidrio for the foul and
pointing to the penalty spot. Sergio Claudio Dos Santos converted to
cut the deficit to 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the aggression escalated, with Blanco getting
clattered in the box two minutes later, only to receive no foul call,
prompting Mexico midfielder Gabriel Caballero to quickly
retaliate--tackling a Milan player from behind and drawing his second
yellow card of the match, evening the sides.</TE>
<TE>   Useful World Cup lesson learned: When the going gets tough, and it
most assuredly will on June 13, return fire at your own risk.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre saw that his roster weathered the
final half-hour without serious injury by sending on substitutes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not easy to take on any Italian team," Aguirre said. "They
play hard, tough and [Milan] was a very serious team. We expect that
we will see the same thing when we play Italy."</TE>
<TE>   Italy is the prohibitive favorite to win Group G in Japan, with
Mexico, Croatia and Ecuador expected to wage a free-for-all for the
other second-round berth. Mexico plays Croatia in its World Cup
opener June 3.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday was Mexico's last North American warmup match, as the team
travels today to Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the team is on a good path," Mexico goalkeeper Oscar
Perez said. "The scores in these preparation games are not as
important as the confidence gained. And we felt we gained a lot of
confidence today."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico, which has made a habit of starting poorly in recent
matches, finally managed two first-half goals.</TE>
<TE>   The first came in the 10th minute, after a blocked shot by
Caballero fell to Salvador Carmona, whose soft chip found Braulio
Luna unmarked at the far post for a header.</TE>
<TE>   Two minutes later, Blanco made it 2-0 with a swerving 20-yard
strike--followed moments later by Kaladze's challenge and red card.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, it looked like it would be an easy day for us," Aguirre
said.</TE>
<TE>   It proved to be anything but. Aguirre complained about the team's
tendency to play in fits and starts--10 good minutes there, 15
lackluster minutes there--although he said he was pleased with the
final 15 minutes, once all the substitutes were on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "The last 15 minutes, the Mexican team dominated and showed what
it can do," he said. "This team has a great drive. We had a lot of
substitutions today--and we didn't really lose anything when we
brought different players onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have 23 players that are ready to make a great run at
it."</TE>
<TE>   Defender Rafael Marquez agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Physically, I think we're all doing well," he said. "I think we
lost a little bit of our rhythm today, but we seemed to get it back
toward the end.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it's going to be difficult [at the World Cup]. But we
just have to go after it."</TE>

<HD>Do-It-All Kidd Does In the Celtics</HD>
<DH>Game 1: Nets earn a 104-97 victory behind his 18 points, 13
rebounds and 11 assists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Get everyone involved. That's what Jason Kidd wants to do.</LD>
<LD>   The New Jersey Nets beat the Boston Celtics, 104-97, Sunday at
Continental Airlines Arena in Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference
finals. They won because seven Nets scored in double figures, because
they scored 48 points in the paint, because they outrebounded the
Celtics by 11, because they were always moving, and doing all those
things because Kidd was magic with the basketball.</LD>
<LD>   Kidd was everywhere with his 18 points, 13 rebounds and 11
assists, the first playoff triple-double by a Net and the second
postseason triple-double by Kidd (Laker fans should remember the
first because it came against them two years ago when Kidd was in
Phoenix).</LD>
<TE>   Get everyone involved. Kidd must have that tattooed on his brain.</TE>
<TE>   First Kidd fed Kerry Kittles for a layup. Then Kidd gave the ball
to Kenyon Martin, who made a 13-foot jump shot. And after that he
again hit Kittles to set up a windmill dunk. In the first quarter
Kidd also made the pass that got Lucious Harris his first basket and
generally kept the ball moving.</TE>
<TE>   If Kidd wasn't making the assist, he was grabbing a rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "When Jason gets the rebound, we get the fastbreak basket," Net
center Todd MacCulloch said.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd always seemed to be the guy in between bigger guys,
outmuscling stronger guys, grabbing the missed shot and firing the
blind pass to a running teammate.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally Kidd will take a shot. It's not as if he is desperate
to score, but sometimes Kidd has to.</TE>
<TE>   In a third-quarter stretch in which the Nets broke open a close
game, it was Kidd who did the scoring.</TE>
<TE>   First, Kidd made a crafty defensive play. Paul Pierce, who had
scored 14 points in the first quarter, thought he had a clear path to
the basket. And he did until Kidd slid into a spot in front of Pierce
and stopped. Pierce couldn't stop and got his fourth foul, a charge,
only 16 seconds after he had gotten his third foul.</TE>
<TE>   There was 7:10 left in the third quarter and Pierce had to sit. He
would have only two baskets in the second half and was left to fidget
and fume on the bench while he watched Kidd take charge of the
scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd made an 18-footer to give the Nets a 10-point lead, 73-63; he
slipped in a finger roll to make it 75-66 Nets; made two free throws
to put the score at 77-66; fed Richard Jefferson for a breathtaking
alley-oop dunk and a 79-66 lead and got Aaron Williams the ball in a
place where Williams could be fouled and make a free throw, twice in
a row. Nets, 81-66, and Pierce put his head in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   "When Kidd rebounds the basketball," Celtic Coach Jim O'Brien
said, "the Nets are as good as there is in getting from one end of
the floor to the other. Their speed and quickness then become an
issue for us and it was an issue for us the whole game."</TE>
<TE>   Boston, which had beaten the Nets three of four times during the
regular season, never led, but did cut a 17-point lead to six. But
there were less than two minutes left in the game and if the little
run gave the Celtics a bit of bravado for Game 2, they weren't really
a threat in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce, who had said last week that the Nets had no one who could
guard him after averaging 38 points against the Nets in the regular
season, seemed to have a career in fortune telling after his 14-point
first quarter. But even though he and Antoine Walker each had 27
points, it was Boston's laggard defense and inability to keep the
ball from Kidd that were the problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Pierce and Walker are going to get their points," said Kittles,
who finished with 14 points, as did Keith Van Horn and MacCulloch.
"But Pierce and Walker alone aren't going to beat us and if we get
our offense in rhythm it's going to take more than a couple of guys
to outscore us."</TE>
<TE>   The Net bench outscored the Celtic reserves, 35-15. Boston's
offense too often was Rodney Rogers or Tony Delk lofting an ill-timed
three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   Game 2 is Tuesday. Pierce had a suggestion for his team.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play a lick of defense tonight," Pierce said. "We
didn't keep an eye on things. We let Kidd do it all. That can't
happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Easier said than done.</TE>

<HD>No Doubt About It, Price Gets a Win</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nick Price no longer has to doubt himself. He can still win on the
PGA Tour, and he can do it in a big way.</LD>
<LD>   Making big shots late after looking vulnerable, Price shot a
three-under-par 67 on Sunday in the Colonial at Fort Worth for his
first victory in four years.</LD>
<LD>   "It feels like it's been 10 years. I didn't think this day was
going to come," Price said. "That self-doubt has been cast away now.
There's not pressure any more on me to win because I've proven it to
myself."</LD>
<TE>   The 45-year-old player from Zimbabwe finished at 13-under 267,
five strokes ahead of David Toms and Kenny Perry.</TE>
<TE>   Price also took a five-stroke lead into the round, but started the
back nine only two ahead of Perry and Toms. Price regained control
with birdies on Nos. 11, 12 and 14, while his closest competitors
gave up strokes.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 17th PGA Tour victory for Price, but his first since
the 1998 FedEx St. Jude Classic and the biggest career payday on the
tour at $774,000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods shot an eight-under 64 to move within one stroke of
Colin Montgomerie after three rounds of the Deutsche Bank-SAP Open at
Heidelberg, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie shot a seven-under 65 for a 17-under 199. Woods is at
16-under 200, and Justin Rose is in third place at 202 after a 66.</TE>
<TE>   Woods opened with an eagle and birdied three of the next four
holes to move into the lead before Montgomerie, playing four groups
behind, reclaimed the top spot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Isao Aoki won his first Senior PGA Tour title in four years,
shooting a seven-under 65 for a four-stroke victory in the Instinet
Classic at Princeton, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The 59-year-old Aoki, winless since the 1998 BellSouth Senior
Classic, is the 17th player 59 and older to win a senior tour event,
and the third-oldest winner in tournament history.</TE>
<TE>   Aoki finished with a 15-under 201 and earned $225,000 for his
ninth senior victory. John Jacobs closed with a 70 to finish second,
and Allen Doyle (71) and Mike Hill (70) tied for third at nine under.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Janice Moodie of Scotland shot a steady two-under 70 to make sure
no one, including Annika Sorenstam, would get in her way in the Asahi
Ryokuken International at North Augusta, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   Moodie, who earned $187,500, finished at 15-under 273, seven
strokes ahead of Laura Davies (73), and eight in front of Sorenstam
(72) and Rosie Jones (67).</TE>

<TE>   Jason Keller won the Stacker2 200 for his fourth NASCAR Busch
Series victory of the year, easily pulling away in a race marred by
serious injuries to Jeff Purvis.</TE>
<TE>   Purvis suffered head, neck and back injuries in a wreck involving
Greg Biffle on Lap 168 between the first and second turns at Nazareth
(Pa.) Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Purvis' engine blew exiting pit road, spilling oil on the track.
His car hit the outside retaining wall and came to a rest with the
nose facing the infield.</TE>
<TE>   Biffle's car slid through the oil and crashed into the driver's
side door of Purvis' car. The race was red-flagged on Lap 176 for 20
minutes while safety personnel cut the roof off the car to remove
Purvis.</TE>
<TE>   Track medical personnel said Purvis was unconscious at the scene
and was taken to the infield care center where he was alert. He was
flown to the Lehigh Valley Medical Center at Salisbury Township, just
west of Allentown.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. K. Shah, trauma surgeon at the medical center, said Purvis was
in serious but stable condition after suffering a contusion of the
left base of the brain and a fracture of the first and second
vertebrae.</TE>
<TE>   Shah said Purvis was moving all of his extremities and was
undergoing further tests.</TE>
<TE>   Biffle was briefly unconscious, but was able to climb out of his
car. He was taken to the infield care center where he was alert, and
transferred to St. Luke's Hospital at Bethlehem, where he was
evaluated and released.</TE>

<HD>It Takes Time, but Hurricanes Win</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Wallin scores 13:42 into overtime, giving Carolina
a 2-1 victory over Toronto to even series at 1-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Desperate times can create unlikely stars in the Stanley Cup
playoffs. Carolina defenseman Niclas Wallin has lived the dream
twice.</LD>
<LD>   Wallin scored 13:42 into overtime Sunday--his second overtime
game-winner of these playoffs--as the Hurricanes defeated the Toronto
Maple Leafs, 2-1, in Game 2 to tie the Eastern Conference final.</LD>
<LD>   Wallin's overtime goal in Game 4 of the semifinals at Montreal
capped one of the best comebacks in playoff history and kept Carolina
from falling behind, 3-1, in that series. This one helped the
Hurricanes avoid a two-game deficit heading to Toronto for Games 3
and 4 of the seven-game series.</LD>
<TE>   "Our secret weapon got one for us again," captain Ron Francis said
of Wallin, a healthy scratch in 29 games during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Wallin is starting in the playoffs because of an injury to regular
David Tanabe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so great for him," Francis said. "This guy has hung in
there. A lot of nights he didn't have a job in our lineup and he had
to sit on the side and work hard in practice. He's had the
opportunity here down the stretch and has done a great job for us.
He's been huge."</TE>
<TE>   Wallin's shot from 30 feet, with Bates Battaglia creating traffic
in front of Curtis Joseph, sent the Hurricanes off the bench for yet
another wild celebration. His shot appeared to hit the leg of a
Toronto defenseman before it went between Joseph's pads.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lucky goal, but in overtime, games are often decided by
a lucky goal," said Jonas Hoglund, who had the game-winner in a 2-1
Toronto victory in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Like I said in Montreal, I'm not a goal scorer," Wallin said. "In
practice I can score some goals, but in game time I never get the
shots. Now I have two overtime goals. It's just unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Alyn McCauley's game-tying goal with 7.4 seconds left in the third
deflated the Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to pick our lips up after the intermission," Glen Wesley
said. "We were a little tentative in the overtime early, but after
that we got back to our game."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina improved to 4-1 in overtime in the postseason and to 6-2
in one-goal games.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if you can ever get used to this, but it's
definitely fun celebrating," Battaglia said.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe in the end it was the right result. Maybe they worked a
little harder than us tonight," McCauley added.</TE>

<LD>After winning 16 games in 2000, Garrett Stephenson waited 20 months
for the next victory.</LD>
<LD>   Stephenson allowed one run in five innings Sunday at St. Louis and
the Cardinals defeated the Cincinnati Reds, 10-1.</LD>
<LD>   Stephenson (1-2) sat out last season after undergoing
reconstructive elbow surgery and was making his making his fifth
start this season--his second since coming off the disabled list from
a lower back strain. He overcame a rocky start in winning for the
first time since Sept. 11, 2000, giving up a home run to Barry Larkin
to lead off the game and walking three in the first two innings.</LD>
<TE>   Eli Marrero and Tino Martinez hit three-run homers for the
Cardinals, who have won eight of 10 and are 5-1 in a 10-game home
stand.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Arizona 3--After losing the first six games of a
seven-game trip, the Phillies went home a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Rollins hit a three-run homer--his third of the series--as
the Diamondback bullpen faltered, enabling the Phillies to avoid a
four-game sweep. They won away from home for only the fourth time in
22 games.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 2, Colorado 1--Julio Franco hit a tiebreaking homer in the
eighth inning at Coors Field for his first run batted in this season.
Franco, who entered the game in the seventh inning, started the day
with a .183 average and one extra-base hit in 71 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 4, San Francisco 2--Preston Wilson hit a tiebreaking
three-run homer in the top of the eighth inning to give Josh Beckett
(2-2) and the Marlins a rain-delayed victory.</TE>
<TE>   After rain delayed the start of the game for 1 hour 36 minutes,
Beckett did not give up a hit until Tom Goodwin singled with one out
in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Milwaukee 4--The Cubs ended losing streak at nine,
getting a sacrifice fly from Corey Patterson in the 11th inning at
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Hill led off with a walk and took second on a wild pitch. He
was sacrificed to third and scored on Patterson's fly.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Houston 3--At Houston, Kip Wells (6-2) allowed five
hits and one run in 62/3 innings to win for the fifth time in six
starts and help the Pirates end a losing streak at four games.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros had a winning streak end at seven.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 4, New York 3--The Padres avoided being swept in the
four-game series when Mark Kotsay hit a run-scoring single with two
out in the bottom of the ninth inning.</TE>

<LD>Chris Webber is the smiling slugger who hits 40 home runs a year,
three of which anyone remembers.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Webber is the congenial quarterback who throws for 35
touchdowns a season, two after Thanksgiving, none in the final two
minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Webber is ominous and odd enough to be classified as science
fiction, a double feature.</LD>
<TE>   At 7 p.m., he's cute, magical E.T.</TE>
<TE>   At 10 p.m., he's Hollow Man.</TE>
<TE>   Webber was supposed to be the middle of the Sacramento King attack
in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for the Lakers, he decided to tailgate instead.</TE>
<TE>   While his teammates were getting battered in the middle, Webber
hung out in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   While he recorded 28 points and 14 rebounds, those numbers draped
the box score like ugly wallpaper.</TE>
<TE>   Strip them off the Lakers' 106-99 victory and discover an entirely
different story.</TE>
<TE>   Of Webber's 14 baskets, six were launched from 18 feet or more.</TE>
<TE>   That's twice as many long shots as were taken by a bomber named
Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   During Webber's 25 attempts, not once were the Lakers charged with
a foul.</TE>
<TE>   That's because he didn't leave his Hibachi long enough to come
inside and cause one.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't work two years ago. Didn't work last year. Won't work now.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd just as soon see him out there," Laker Coach Phil Jackson
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are happy to see him, period.</TE>
<TE>   As the center of a team's playoff attack, Webber is 6 feet 10
worth of Double Stuff.</TE>
<TE>   He is being paid more than $120 million to be the Kings' heart,
yet he plays more like their elbow.</TE>
<TE>   For the Lakers to lose this championship, someone must be strong
enough and crazy enough to pry it from their fingers.</TE>
<TE>   There is only one person on the Kings who can do that.</TE>
<TE>   One game down, three years gone, and Chris Webber can't touch
them.</TE>
<TE>   "Please don't come to me with all that jump shot-inside shot
stuff," Webber said Sunday afternoon, shaking his head. "I'm just
doing what the team wants me to do."</TE>
<TE>   The topic bothers this genial sort. For the first and only time
during the interview, he looks away from the questioner.</TE>
<TE>   He has heard about this his entire career, nine years spent with
mostly losers.</TE>
<TE>   He has heard how he can't smother the life from an opponent like
Bryant or Shaquille O'Neal or Tim Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   He has heard how signing him to save your franchise is like hiring
a display window mannequin to run your store. He looks good, he
brings in the customers, but where is he when it's time to total the
books?</TE>
<TE>   The criticism was softer when he played for teams such as Golden
State and Washington, teams that didn't have a chance anyway.</TE>
<TE>   But now that he has made it to the conference finals for the first
time in his career, the questions have become a dull roar.</TE>
<TE>   Upon which you can now heap this:</TE>
<TE>   The Kings went 15-5 at the start of this season while Webber was
sidelined with injuries, then won their most important playoff game
in Dallas with Webber on the bench with fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Never one to stare anybody down, he looks away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating, yeah, but I have to ignore it," he said.
"Hopefully, if I can win a championship, it will all be like the
hazing of a rookie. We win, and it will all be over with."</TE>
<TE>   And if they don't win it all? Some are saying that as long as the
Kings are building around Webber, they will never win it all.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I guess, year after year, it's gonna be the same," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So why doesn't he stuff everyone's mouth with a little muscle?</TE>
<TE>   "This is a team, a system," he said. "I'm part of that system, and
I can't go against it."</TE>
<TE>   He said if he goes inside, the King running attack stalls.</TE>
<TE>   "I've posted up before, and I've been criticized for making us
stand still," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said if he doesn't control the ball on the perimeter, he's not
doing his job.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm our playmaker, that is my role," he said. "There's been a lot
of criticism, but I know the truth."</TE>
<TE>   The truth Saturday was that, while Webber and Vlade Divac each was
saddled with five fouls, O'Neal had only two.</TE>
<TE>   The truth was Webber's absence inside gave O'Neal and Robert Horry
and Samaki Walker great freedom to roam the court, so much that
Walker grabbed five rebounds in only 10 minutes while Horry had eight
points in the deciding first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that Webber, who has never been as tough as his Fab
Five, baggy-shorts image, may simply be too nice for the nasty work
presently required of him.</TE>
<TE>   And you know what they say, especially when talking about a Laker
team that has won seven consecutive playoff series without requiring
the maximum number of games.</TE>
<TE>   Nice guys are finished fast.</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: War Emblem's trainer stops just short of
guaranteeing a Triple Crown championship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Apropos of the status of the Triple Crown, several horses from
Saturday's Preakness were flown from Baltimore to Louisville, Ky.,
early Sunday morning. On the second plane out of Baltimore, War
Emblem was the only equine passenger.</LD>
<LD>   The ornery 3-year-old colt, who has been feasting on other horses
and handlers ever since Prince Ahmed Salman of Saudi Arabia bought a
90% interest in him for $900,000 on April 11, has been a
business-like winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, and on June
8 in New York, with a $5-million bonus and another $1-million purse
on the line, he'll try to win the Belmont Stakes and become the first
Triple Crown champion since Affirmed in 1978.</LD>
<LD>   "There's not a 3-year-old out there that can beat him," said
trainer Bob Baffert, stopping just short of predicting--or
guaranteeing--a win in the Belmont. "As long as I can keep him
healthy and at this level, he should run stronger in the Belmont than
he did in the other two races. My other Preakness winners [Silver
Charm, Real Quiet and Point Given] were tired after running in this
race, but not this guy. He gives me a better chance to sweep than the
other two times."</LD>
<TE>   In 1997-98, Silver Charm and Real Quiet both ran second in the
Belmont, depriving racing of its 12th Triple Crown champion. Baffert
will use the same schedule with War Emblem that he used with his
first two Triple Crown aspirants, training the colt at Churchill
Downs and probably not flying him to Belmont Park until June 4 or 5.</TE>
<TE>   When entries for the 11/2-mile race are taken on June 5, there may
not be many horses that will try to block War Emblem's path.
Apparently only two horses from the 13-horse Preakness--Proud Citizen
and Table Limit, both trained by Wayne Lukas--are possible for the
Belmont. Proud Citizen has been beaten twice by War Emblem, running
second, four lengths back, in the Derby, and finishing third on
Saturday, beaten by 11/2 lengths, and running him for the fifth time
in nine weeks might be a push, but this typifies Lukas'
confrontational style. Table Limit, in his first stakes race, almost
clipped the heels of another horse in a crowded run into the first
turn and finished 11th in the Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   "The Triple Crown is three rounds," said Lukas, who has won the
Belmont four times. "And we'll be answering the bell for round three.
I know a lot of people would like to see a Triple Crown champ for the
good of racing, but I'm going to be busting my tail to spoil that
dream."</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Nick Zito will not be represented in the Belmont.
His Crimson Hero did very little running in the Preakness and
finished seventh, and Straight Gin, the ninth-place finisher,
suffered a tendon injury and has been retired.</TE>
<TE>   With no horse in the Belmont, Zito is rooting for War Emblem to
complete the sweep.</TE>
<TE>   "If War Emblem has a good day, the Belmont should be easier for
him than the Preakness," Zito said. "But maybe some horse will get
good between now and the Belmont. War Emblem is definitely the best
3-year-old. None of these are as good. But who knows? They still
gotta play the game."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bailey, who rode Medaglia d'Oro, the second choice behind
War Emblem, to an eighth-place finish in the Preakness, won't concede
the Belmont to Baffert's colt.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a chink in his armor," Bailey said, "it's that they
wanted him to relax [Saturday] and he couldn't. You wouldn't want a
horse doing that when he's going a mile and a half."</TE>
<TE>   Other possibles for the Belmont are Perfect Drift, who was third
in the Derby; Essence Of Dubai, the ninth-place Derby finisher;
Sunday Break, who missed the Derby because of an earnings shortage
after a third-place finish in the Wood Memorial; and Sarava,
four-length winner of Saturday's 1 1/16-mile Sir Barton Stakes at
Pimlico. Sunday Break is expected to run next Saturday in the Peter
Pan Stakes at Belmont before trainer Neil Drysdale makes a decision
on the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   Because of War Emblem's front-running style, Baffert doesn't seem
concerned about the makeup of the opposition. All War Emblem needs in
the Belmont is a good start, Baffert said.</TE>
<TE>   "Perfect Drift is a good horse," Baffert said, "but I'm not
worried as long as I can keep my horse the way he is. I hate to wolf
it [brag] because I might jinx myself. War Emblem is a free-running
horse that keeps throwing in extra gears, and his tank's never empty.
It all started with Silver Charm, and maybe the third time in the
Belmont will be the charm. We're looking for every sign to get us
through the Belmont this time."</TE>

<KH>TENNIS LISA DILLMAN</KH>
<HD>It Takes Two to Tarango for USC Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The prospective job applicant was talking in a hushed tone on his
cell phone from the historic Il Foro Italico in Rome recently,
watching Andy Roddick's late-night match against Wayne Ferreira of
South Africa.</LD>
<LD>   Discussion of his Holy Grail was put on hold; after all, it would
be embarrassing to hear an announcement about cell phones needing to
be turned off in the legendary tennis cathedral.</LD>
<LD>   A couple of hours later, the prospective applicant was ready to
talk about the attractive job up for grabs at USC, the chance to
succeed men's tennis Coach Dick Leach, who is retiring after this
season. Well, he wasn't quite ready to chat. First, he was still
talking to Roddick about possibly playing doubles together at the
UCLA tournament in July.</LD>
<TE>   So, was the mystery candidate Rick Leach? No. Been there and done
that, as an assistant to his father.</TE>
<TE>   It was none other than Jeff Tarango.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there have been odd couples in sports, but this could
crack the top 10. Think about his interview with Athletic Director
Mike Garrett. You could probably sell tickets to that.</TE>
<TE>   But, seriously, Tarango is serious, even though he has heard that
the school is leaning toward hiring an established collegiate coach.
USC officials indicated that is the likely route, and those close to
the program had not heard his name among the possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Longest shot or not, Tarango wanted to make a case for his
candidacy. For him, a sizable income drop would not be an issue. He
has earned more than $3.5 million in his career, including $313,099
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously I have a few more years I can play on the tour," said
the 33-year-old Tarango, who grew up in Manhattan Beach. "And make a
lot more money than I would being coach there."</TE>
<TE>   Roddick had something to say, of course, chiming in: "Jeff, you're
going to play forever!"</TE>
<TE>   Come to think of it, that Tarango-Roddick doubles partnership
might be entertaining. Who gets in the last word?</TE>
<TE>   Tarango enjoys helping the Roddicks of the world on an informal
basis, viewing it as on-the-job training.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times, I help the guys who are around," Tarango said.
"How I've played on tour and in my matches, it's very obvious that I
understand the strategic part of the game, and being a student of
Robert Lansdorp, I know all about the technical side.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a kinder, gentler Robert Lansdorp."</TE>
<TE>   We'll take his word for it. Which is to say he's probably never
made any of his pupils cry.</TE>
<TE>   Though Tarango went to Stanford, turning pro after his junior
year, he has strong ties to the Trojans, established long before he
won two singles titles, 14 doubles championships and reached the 1999
French Open doubles final with Goran Ivanisevic on the tour.</TE>
<TE>   "My whole family went to USC," he said. "My dad went to the
engineering school. My uncle finished No. 1 in the law school, and I
had another uncle who went to another graduate school at 'SC. I grew
up 19 minutes away in Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "This job only opens up about once every 25 years. I would prefer
to play three or four more years on the tour, finish up my schooling
at Stanford. Do the whole conservative route. If they wanted me to
graduate from 'SC, I'd do that and then I'd be an 'SC alum."</TE>
<TE>   Going the conservative route has rarely been an option for
Tarango. He is smart, opinionated and funny. His highest career
ranking in singles was 42, and had Tarango been talented enough to
crack the top 10, the ATP probably wouldn't have needed to start the
"New Balls, Please" campaign. His postmatch news conferences would
have been standing-room-only affairs, just a notch below the musings
of Ivanisevic.</TE>
<TE>   You ask Tarango a question and the answer is rarely predictable.
If he were to be interviewed by USC, of course, there is the famous
matter of his Wimbledon default in 1995 after he walked off the court
and his wife slapped the chair umpire, Bruno Rebeuh. Tarango was
later fined $15,500 and suspended from Wimbledon for a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually I'm putting [Wimbledon referee] Alan Mills as one of my
references," Tarango said. "He was right there in the front line and
saw everything as soon as I walked off the court. I'll let the ATP
findings stand for itself. If anything, it showed I'm someone who is
very into the rules. I understand organization and tradition and how
things need to be handled.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it's better to walk away from an incident rather than
do something that will damage everyone who is there. I kind of took
the existential way out there. If I had pulled the guy out by his tie
out of the chair and beaten him senseless, that probably wouldn't
have been the better thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Tarango, Mike Garrett and Alan Mills. Just another
fascinating day in Tarango's world.</TE>
<TE>   Locally</TE>
<TE>   Italian Open finalist and Australian Open semifinalist Tommy Haas
of Germany has entered the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA, which starts
July 22. Haas, who lost to Andre Agassi in straight sets in Rome,
will likely be seeded second at the French Open behind Lleyton
Hewitt. Haas has twice reached the third round at Roland Garros.</TE>
<TE>   * French Open finalist Kim Clijsters of Belgium, Monica Seles,
Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia and Elena Dementieva of Russia have agreed
to play in the JP Morgan Chase Open at Manhattan Beach, joining
Serena Williams and Jennifer Capriati. The event is Aug. 4-11.</TE>
<TE>   * Louise Brough Clapp, Jon Douglas, Carl Earn, Allen Fox and Karen
Hantze Susman will be entering the Southern California Tennis Assn.
Hall of Fame. They will be honored July 20 with an induction dinner
and ceremony at Riviera Country Club. Call (310) 208-3838 for more
information.</TE>

<HD>King Game Plan Becomes Big Flop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sacramento Kings should have learned Saturday that flopping
doesn't work in the NBA playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   And, unless Sacramento realizes that it's going to take more heart
than acting, the Lakers may sweep the Kings for the second
consecutive year. Vlade Divac, Chris Webber and Scot Pollard should
have figured out early in Game 1 that they need to be the aggressors
against the two-time defending NBA champions.</LD>
<LD>   It also didn't help that Shaquille O'Neal didn't seem a bit
bothered by injuries as he was against San Antonio in the second
round. It's now up to Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman to make the
adjustments to make sure the Kings don't fall behind by two games. A
breakdown of Game 2:</LD>
<TE>   KINGS' MOVE--Sacramento has to understand that playing Los Angeles
is much different than playing Dallas because the Lakers know how to
play defense. Against the Mavericks, point guard Mike Bibby had his
way directing the King offense, but the Lakers' Derek Fisher and his
backup, Lindsey Hunter, were able to frustrate him at times.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings got caught up Saturday playing too much one on one and
never got into offensive rhythm. The Lakers did a great job of
beating the Kings to their favorite positions on the floor. Look for
the Kings to do more inside-outside passing early tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento's big men, especially Pollard, need to watch film of
how the Spurs' Malik Rose defended O'Neal. Rose is smaller than
Divac, Webber and Pollard, but he played O'Neal tougher because he
didn't back down as the Kings did in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman can only hope that his interior players were embarrassed
with their play Saturday. They can't rely on officials to save the
day in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS' MOVE--With O'Neal again active in the paint, the Laker
offense was more efficient in Game 1 than it was in previous playoff
games. If O'Neal is able to gain post position as he did Saturday,
don't expect that to change.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry, Rick Fox and Fisher are more effective when the
Lakers can run their offense through O'Neal. Laker perimeter players
are much better shooters when they do not have a defender in their
face. Throw in Kobe Bryant, who didn't have a problem getting his
shot off against Sacramento's Doug Christie in Game 1, and the Lakers
are capable of scoring more than 105 points every game.</TE>
<TE>   But the Lakers did turn the ball over too much Saturday. Coach
Phil Jackson was not pleased when players such as Bryant tried to
force play into the middle. If the Lakers take care of the ball and
continue to switch on defense as they did in Game 1, the Kings will
have problems.</TE>
<TE>   Something that also worked for the Lakers on Saturday was
Jackson's decision to keep Bryant at guard when the Kings used point
guards Bobby Jackson and Bibby together in the backcourt. Bryant was
able to defend Jackson and the Lakers were able to keep Fox or Devean
George at small forward.</TE>
<TE>   KEY POINT--It should not be a surprise if Sacramento's Peja
Stojakovic guts it out and plays tonight after sitting out Game 1
because of an ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   During the regular season, Stojakovic was a major force for the
Kings and his replacement, Hedu Turkoglu, did not score Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   If Stojakovic plays, he'll certainly have to deal with Fox, who
dominated Stojakovic in last season's playoffs. Stojakovic has to
prove that Fox doesn't have his number.</TE>

<LD>The instructive moment was delivered by Don Nelson, which of course
probably signals either the end of the world or something worse.
Still, there spoke Nellie--but a week ago, actually--from a
perspective that might be useful just now.</LD>
<LD>   Nelson had watched his Dallas Mavericks fold in two straight home
games against the Kings, watched the Mavs--so talented, so deep and
so full of promise--lose twice on their own floor to a banged-up,
limping Sacramento team that simply understood the drill a few points
better each time.</LD>
<LD>   He had, that is to say, caught a glimpse of a brighter future.</LD>
<TE>   He just needed to look at a different color uniform in order to do
it.</TE>
<TE>   And when it was over, when the Kings had returned to Arco Arena
and finished the job and sent themselves to the first Western
Conference finals in their California history--when all of that was
done, Don Nelson stood up and, without the slightest hint of
surrender in his voice, said this:</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of growing up to do to get to the level that the
Kings are at ... [But] what a great experience for our team to go
through."</TE>
<TE>   Lesson in a thimble: It is possible to be appreciative without
being awed.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible to admire the Lakers, just this minute, for what
they are without being asked to give up your Feel the Roar T-shirt
for all eternity.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible to look at L.A. and see, for Sacramento, the final
pieces of the championship puzzle--and sure, we're only one game in
on the conference finals. Sure, anything could happen the rest of the
way, beginning with Game 2 tonight at Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't to suggest that the Kings won't win at Arco, nor, given
the Lakers' quasi-indifferent play at home this postseason, that
Sacramento can't pick off a game at the Staples Center this coming
weekend and make the true series of this that so many observers think
it can be.</TE>
<TE>   No one who saw the Kings go against Dallas, absent Peja Stojakovic
but filled with role players swapping star turns, could seriously
argue against any possible outcome here. That team, while in Texas,
grew a half a year in three days.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, in so many of the obvious ways, are the team that other
NBA entries wish they could become.</TE>
<TE>   And so it must be all right to suggest that the Lakers, in so many
of the subtle ways, are the team the Kings still hope to be.</TE>
<TE>   It's not about players. Oh, the Lakers have players. They've got
Shaq and Kobe, a reasonably decent pair to draw to, and what you saw
in Game 1 was a whole lot of O'Neal in the third quarter and a whole
lot of Bryant in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kings have tremendous talent, even with Stojakovic in
street clothes. It isn't about players nearly so much as it is about
faith.</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento locker room, after Saturday's defeat, was full of
guys who think they can win a tough playoff against a truly elite
team.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. locker room?</TE>
<TE>   Full of guys who already know they can, and who knew it a while
ago.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible to be appreciative of that mind-set without being
awed. It is possible to understand that what the Lakers did in Game 1
was to seize the moment at precisely the point it was offered, making
no assumptions about what might come next.</TE>

<HD>Bush and Putin Must Confront Nuclear Terror</HD>
<DH>A comprehensive strategy is crucial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAM ALLISON and ANDREI KOKOSHIN</AU>
<BD>Graham Allison is director of the Belfer Center for
Science and International Affairs at Harvard's Kennedy School. Andrei
Kokoshin is director of the Institute for International Security
Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences and a former secretary of
the Russian Security Council.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The centerpiece of this week's Moscow summit will be the signing of a
treaty cutting the number of deployed strategic warheads by
two-thirds over the next decade. But as both President Bush and
Russian President Vladimir V. Putin have acknowledged, the agreement
looks more to the Cold War than to future dangers. Especially in the
aftermath of Sept. 11, their priority at this summit should be to act
now to prevent nuclear terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   If the United States or Russia finds itself the victim of a
nuclear attack next week or next year, the perpetrator will almost
certainly be a terrorist group. Rogue states such as Iraq have
serious nuclear ambitions, but Saddam Hussein knows that attacking
the U.S. would mean national suicide. The most urgent, direct nuclear
threat is that Al Qaeda or the Chechens might steal nuclear weapons
or materials from which a weapon can be constructed.</LD>
<LD>   The good news about nuclear terrorism can be summarized in one
line: No highly enriched uranium or plutonium means no nuclear
explosion.</LD>
<TE>   Although the world's stockpiles of nuclear weapons and
weapons-usable nuclear materials are vast, they are finite. The
prerequisites for manufacturing fissile material are many and require
the resources of a modern state. Technologies for locking up
super-dangerous material are also well-tested.</TE>
<TE>   But we must still have a strategy to prevent nuclear terrorism. A
decade of Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat-reduction programs has
accomplished much in safeguarding nuclear materials. Unfortunately,
bureaucratic inertia, bolstered by mistrust and misperception on both
sides, leaves these joint programs bogged down on a timetable that
extends into the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   At the summit, the two presidents can seize the moment to make
nuclear security a presidential priority by forming a new alliance
against nuclear terrorism. Each should pledge that he will direct his
government to do everything possible to minimize the risk of theft of
nuclear weapons and hold his subordinates accountable. Understanding
that each country bears responsibility for the security of its
nuclear materials, each should offer any assistance required to make
this happen and provide the other sufficient transparency to monitor
performance.</TE>
<TE>   To put this on the fastest possible timetable, both governments
should name specific individuals, reporting directly to their
president, to co-chair a group to develop an American-Russian
strategy and report back within one month. Although this is a big
demand, consider what the presidents would demand if a weapon were
stolen.</TE>
<TE>   The nuclear superpowers should establish a new "international
security standard" based on Putin's proposal at the U.N. Millennium
Summit in 2000 for new technologies that can produce electricity with
low-enriched nuclear fuel from which it is impossible to make a
nuclear weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The next phase of this effort would make the alliance global,
ensuring that weapons and materials in all nuclear-weapons states
meet this new security standard.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, the critical nation is Pakistan, from which Osama bin
Laden and Al Qaeda have sought nuclear weapons know-how and material.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen countries--such as Yugoslavia (Serbia-Montenegro) and
Ghana--hold small caches of potential nuclear weapons in settings
that are dangerously vulnerable to theft. They should be approached
immediately with a demand that the material be removed or secured,
conveyed as an offer they cannot refuse.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the U.S. and Russia should construct an aggressive,
multilayered program to prevent further proliferation of nuclear
arms, beginning with Iran and Iraq. Adopting lessons learned in
U.S.-Russia cooperation in the campaign against Bin Laden and the
Taliban, the new effort should be heavy on intelligence sharing,
preemption, disruption and active controls on the sale of materials
and know-how to nuclear wannabes.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, failure to confront the specter of nuclear
terrorism invites catastrophe. Preventing nuclear terrorism is a
finite challenge that is susceptible to a finite solution if the
presidents determine to just do it.</TE>

<HD>To Help Africa Battle AIDS, Write Off Its Debt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALIH BOOKER</AU>
<BD>Salih Booker is the executive director of Africa
Action.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill travels to Africa this
week, he will see the consequences of Africa's debt bondage. O'Neill
will spend 10 days in Ghana, South Africa, Uganda and Ethiopia,
accompanied by Irish rock star Bono for part of the trip. According
to a Treasury press release, O'Neill is "ready to listen to those on
the front lines" in the struggle against poverty. What he should hear
is an emphatic call to cancel Africa's debt.</LD>
<LD>   Last fall, O'Neill spoke to African finance officials in
Washington and downplayed the continent's debt crisis. But on this
trip, as he comes face to face with African realities, he will see
that Africa's external debt is a crippling barrier to action against
AIDS or progress against poverty on any front.</LD>
<LD>   African governments are forced to spend more money servicing their
foreign debts than they are able to spend on the health or education
of their people. Though African leaders have agreed to spend at least
15% of their budgets on health, meeting this target is impossible
while they are forced to pay nearly $15billion a year to foreign
creditors.</LD>
<TE>   What is at issue is the backlog of old debts that rich-country
creditors insist on collecting, even though these debts were largely
illegitimate to begin with. Many loans were given for strategic
purposes, to prop up repressive and corrupt regimes in the context of
the Cold War. During the 1970s, when Western banks were flush with
oil money, loans were pushed on African governments with little
thought to their purpose or to their recipients' capacity to repay.</TE>
<TE>   African governments are being held liable for the cost of failed
and often grandiose development projects pushed by creditors. Now
Africa's people are expected to repay huge debts that were largely
incurred before their time and that did not benefit them. For
example, South Africa is still paying debt over apartheid measures.
South Africa's white minority regime accumulated more than $18billion
in foreign debt in the 15 years before apartheid fell. South Africa's
neighbors incurred more than $26billion in debt during this same
period, much of it a result of Pretoria's regional war. Today,
victims of apartheid are forced to pay the costs of their own
previous repression. Interest payments on these kinds of loans are
still sucking resources out of Africa, even though the principal on
the debt has already been repaid.</TE>
<TE>   The current framework for debt relief--designed by creditors and
called the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative--has failed.
Even studies from the World Bank, one of the HIPC authors, reveal
that this plan will not provide an end to Africa's debt crisis.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill's third stop, Uganda, is often touted as a HIPC success
story, having used debt relief for poverty-reduction programs. But
because the price of coffee--Uganda's principal export--has dropped
by 60% in the past two years, the country's debt payments have gone
back through the roof.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have long said that HIPC projections were based on wildly
over-optimistic estimates of future export earnings. In guarded
language, the World Bank now admits that the critics were right.
Export growth for 2001 for HIPC countries was less than half of what
the World Bank had predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of tinkering with a failed debt relief framework, it is
time to write off the debt overhang. Details should be worked out not
by the creditor cartel but by independent debt arbitration, as
proposed almost two years ago by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
This process must also include large debt-burdened countries such as
South Africa and Nigeria, which are excluded from the HIPC
initiative.</TE>
<TE>   The failure to resolve Africa's debt crisis means thousands more
lives lost needlessly every day to  AIDS and poverty conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has the power to change this at little cost.
Most of Africa's debt is owed to the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, in which the U.S. is the dominant shareholder.</TE>
<TE>   After looking into the eyes of Africa, O'Neill should not be able
to look away. He should understand precisely how wrong he was to have
discounted the devastating impact of Africa's debt burden. His first
order of business upon his return to Washington should be to use U.S.
influence to cancel Africa's debt.</TE>

<HD>Indonesia 'Peacekeeper' Plan Sends the Wrong Message</HD>
<DH>U.S. bolstering of the military could do much more harm
than good in the region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE JENDRZEJCZYK</AU>
<BD>Mike Jendrzejczyk is Washington director for Asia
Human Rights Watch.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Indonesia may be the next front in the U.S. war against terrorism in
Southeast Asia. But terrorism is not at the root of Indonesia's most
urgent troubles. And some U.S. proposals for fighting the war may
worsen the problems they are meant to correct.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration is asking Congress to provide $8million to
train and equip a "domestic peacekeeping force" in Indonesia to
suppress sectarian violence. The State Department argues that "rapid
restoration of order will reduce tensions and weaken extremist
groups, thus serving counter-terrorism goals in Indonesia and
beyond." The funding request is buried in a special foreign aid bill
due to be voted on as early as today.</LD>
<LD>   How would such a force function? Would it promote military reform?
Or would it strengthen the power of an increasingly confident and
assertive army?</LD>
<TE>   The State Department says it would screen recruits to keep out
human rights abusers and the unit's performance would be monitored by
U.S. personnel. Yet the U.S. track record for trying to change the
Indonesian military culture is spotty at best, and prosecutions of
abusers are rare.</TE>
<TE>   During my recent trip to Jakarta, violence exploded again in the
province of Maluku. Three years of Muslim-Christian tensions,
resulting in thousands of deaths, had subsided and a peace deal was
signed in February. But the activities of a small group of Christian
separatists combined with the agitation of a radical Muslim militia
group, the Laskar Jihad, sparked renewed violence. Christian churches
and homes were burned, civilian deaths mounted and gunmen carrying
M-16s raised suspicions that Indonesian soldiers were involved.</TE>
<TE>   The roots of the conflict in Maluku are complex, including
political rivalries and economic tensions and charges of provocation
by outside groups. The U.S. suspects that Laskar Jihad has links to
Al Qaeda, but the causes of the violence are clearly domestic.</TE>
<TE>   The Indonesian security forces have been slow to respond to the
violence. The problem is not a lack of training and equipment; it's a
lack of political will and the highly political role of the army.</TE>
<TE>   None of the diplomats, business people or nongovernmental
organizations I spoke with in Jakarta could imagine how a
U.S.-trained force--outfitted with M-16s, helicopters, crowd control
equipment and other hardware--would work in a hot spot such as Maluku
or in Aceh, site of a secessionist war.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, there is little faith in Indonesia's weak civilian
institutions to exercise the kind of control needed to prevent a
peacekeeping unit from becoming another abusive force like the army's
special forces or the mobile police brigades. So why is the U.S.
promoting this idea?</TE>
<TE>   For months, senior Bush administration officials have urged
President Megawati Sukarnoputri to crack down on suspected terrorist
links. The latest initiative, combined with a second $8-million
funding request to set up a counter-terrorism unit, is part of the
same strategy.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon is eager to reestablish relations with its Indonesian
counterpart. Military cooperation with Indonesia was restricted by
the Clinton administration after a rampage by army-sponsored militias
in East Timor in 1999. Bush has lifted many restrictions, resuming
high-level military contacts and commercial sales of nonlethal arms.</TE>
<TE>   However, Congress made specific training programs and arms sales
conditional in last year's foreign aid bill, requiring steps toward
greater accountability for human rights abuses and civilian control
of the military. The counter-terrorism agenda is being used as an
excuse for subverting these conditions.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. support for changing the role of the military is critical for
the country's long-term democratic transition, but aid should be
given only when it contributes to reform. This includes removing
impunity for military personnel, putting security forces under
effective civilian control and ending their shadowy role supporting
militia groups and stimulating local and regional conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   There is no quick fix in dealing with terrorism in Southeast Asia.
A U.S.-funded "peacekeeping force" would send the wrong signal to
those promoting basic reform and, worse, there is little prospect it
would help keep the peace.</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld's Rules</HD>
<DH>Sacramento could use the Defense secretary's words of
wisdom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH RODOTA</AU>
<BD>Joseph Rodota is chief executive of a company that
studies trends in public-sector technology and management. He was
deputy chief of staff to Gov. Pete Wilson from 1993 to 1998.
Rumsfeld's Rules can be found at
http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jan2001/rumsfeldsrules.pdf.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With each new Oracle- related revelation, it is becoming clearer that
Sacramento has lost its bearings. This isn't just a contracting
scandal anymore. It is a management crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Career civil servants in two departments raised red flags and were
told by their politically appointed superiors to hush up and "think
outside the box." A top aide to Gov. Gray Davis ignored her own
instincts and signed off on the hastily drafted proposal.</LD>
<LD>   Investigations will eventually get to the bottom of the Oracle
deal. But what can be done to close the management gap in Sacramento?</LD>
<TE>   Donald Rumsfeld may have some answers.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, that Don Rumsfeld, the current U.S. secretary of Defense.</TE>
<TE>   When I was 25, I was tapped to be a White House aide and showed up
for work in the old Executive Office Building. On that first day, my
boss gave me a copy of memos and lists stapled together titled
"Rumsfeld's Rules."</TE>
<TE>   It was the best 20 pages ever compiled on how to serve the
president and the country ethically and effectively. The rules are a
must read for all government employees, perhaps especially for the
Davis administration in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Here are a few of Rumsfeld's Rules:</TE>
<TE>   If in doubt, don't. If still in doubt, do what's right.</TE>
<TE>   Doubts trailed the Oracle contract at every stage, yet no senior
executive served the governor or the taxpayers by saying no. I worked
side by side with two state directors of finance in Sacramento, and I
believe that both of them would have resigned rather than sign off on
a deal like Oracle.</TE>
<TE>   It must become acceptable again for California government
officials to say no when something doesn't pass the smell test.
What's more, the governor should fire political appointees who fail
to at least listen to concerns expressed by career professional
staff.</TE>
<TE>   Move decisions out to the Cabinet and agencies. Strengthen them by
moving responsibility, authority and accountability their direction.</TE>
<TE>   Absent pressure from the governor's personal staff, would the
Oracle proposal have fallen on deaf ears? Procurement decisions
should be made via a fair, apolitical process with the maximum amount
of competition and with full disclosure. California's current
procurement system doesn't have a role for the governor's staff, nor
should it.</TE>
<TE>   Your performance depends on people. Select the best, train them
and back them.</TE>
<TE>   Recruitment is undervalued in most administrations. There are so
many political supporters who want jobs that a governor could fill
the executive branch many times over with donors, activists,
supporters and their spouses.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Riordan was ridiculed by his Republican primary opponents
for pledging to bring "the best and the brightest" to Sacramento, but
he was right, and Gov. Davis and GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill
Simon Jr. would do well to pledge to follow Riordan's advice.</TE>
<TE>   If the staff lacks policy guidance against which to test
decisions, their decisions will be random.</TE>
<TE>   The governor and the Legislature should agree on a limited number
of strategic management initiatives. The federal government is moving
in this direction, with the Office of Management and Budget launching
initiatives designed to reduce costs or improve the quality of
government services. These goals in turn will drive the demand for
certain technology applications that are needed for the government to
become more productive.</TE>
<TE>   But federal and state managers must have better models for
evaluating proposals. For example, California needs a common
methodology for evaluating the return on investment from technology.
The current system is too vague, which was one reason why the Oracle
deal wiggled its way through the process.</TE>
<TE>   Be above suspicion. Set the right example.</TE>
<TE>   What ultimately blew the lid off Oracle was the revelation that an
Oracle lobbyist had passed a $25,000 campaign contribution to a Davis
staffer within days of the signing of the deal. The "above suspicion"
rule is important, yet it is also the easiest to follow. It harks
back to the Rumsfeld Rule, "If in doubt, don't. If still in doubt, do
what's right."</TE>

<LD>In January 2001, Ronnie Young was five years into a nine-year term
for burglary at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo when
Bud Stocking, a pipe fitter hired from outside the prison, began
choking on a piece of food. Stocking motioned to another inmate to
help him. That inmate refused, but Young performed the Heimlich
maneuver and saved Stocking's life.</LD>
<LD>   Under a 1982 California law, Young should get a year shaved off
his sentence for "perform[ing] a heroic act in a life-threatening
situation" while in prison. Young's prior felony conviction had made
his burglary conviction a second strike under California's
three-strikes sentencing law. But because Young has kept his nose
clean in prison, the Department of Corrections has already awarded
him the maximum time credit allowed under the three-strikes law. For
that reason, the department denied Young's request to be released a
year sooner because he saved Stocking's life.</LD>
<LD>   Now a Ventura appeals court has agreed with the Corrections
Department on narrow grounds. The judges were excessively timid.
Young should get his one-year reduction.</LD>
<TE>   The three-strikes law, passed in 1994, has become the electrified
third rail of California politics--judges and politicians touch it at
their peril. Intended to close the revolving prison door, the law is
stricter than similar measures in most other states, where the third
strike has to be a serious or violent crime. In California, any third
felony conviction, sometimes even for simple drug possession or
stealing a couple of videotapes, sends the defendant to prison for
life. Efforts to amend the law to reserve its harshest penalties for
the most serious crimes have failed.</TE>
<TE>   State judges also have shied away from tempering the law's
harshest effects. So the Ventura appellate court held that the
three-strikes law didn't explicitly allow the credit an inmate could
earn under the heroic act law to be added to those allowed under
three strikes. The Legislature should amend the three-strikes law, it
suggested, to allow both types.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the Legislature should explicitly allow the Corrections
Department to reward a "strike" offender who saves a life. And
lawmakers ought to muster the courage to limit third strikes to
serious or violent crimes. But the current law, by not explicitly
forbidding it, would seem to allow three-strike inmates credit for
heroism. Common sense, not to mention ordinary decency, should have
led the majority to give Ronnie Young the break he earned.</TE>

<LD>Most of the nearly 850,000 nonimmigrant foreigners who attend U.S.
colleges and universities in a given year add greatly to the
educational experience of American students. They also bolster
international relations by returning to their homelands with a better
understanding of how this nation works. Unfortunately, as Sept. 11
made clear, the system that oversees foreign students must give
priority to contending with the handful who would take advantage of
this nation's openness to attack it.</LD>
<LD>   Congress has belatedly ordered the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to develop an electronic system to keep track of foreign
students.</LD>
<LD>   The INS' Student and Exchange Visitor Information System would use
a Web-based database that would link U.S. embassies and consulates
abroad with every INS port of entry and the 70,000 schools and other
institutions eligible to admit foreign students.</LD>
<TE>   Lawmakers need to keep establishment of that system on schedule,
making sure it is up and running by the Jan. 1, 2003, deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The INS says it will hit that mark. That is easier said than done,
however, especially since the agency already is in the process of
restructuring after many high-profile failures. Just last week it was
reported that improper shredding of documents apparently had occurred
at the INS' Laguna Niguel service center.</TE>
<TE>   Major academic institutions have been reluctant to commit to
meeting the deadline. They bridle at the agency's demand that school
clerks be prepared to process thousands of records for a computer
system with technical specifications that the INS has yet to provide.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the American Council on Education is choking on the proposed
$95 fee the INS would charge each student. U.S. taxpayers should not
be asked to subsidize the lucrative arrangement that colleges have
with foreign students. But since Congress already has provided $37
million to cover the development of the database and the fee would be
used only to cover the annual operating costs, the $95 probably is
not justified.</TE>
<TE>   It should be an easy matter for Congress to mediate the proper
amount. At the same time, lawmakers should tell the INS to streamline
the way fees would be collected. The proposal would require a foreign
student in, say, Bamako, Mali, to pay a bank in Chicago, which would
issue a paper receipt and mail it to the student, who would then need
to present it when applying for a visa. U.S. schools are asking that
instead the State Department collect the fee directly at embassies or
consulates. Then the department could transfer the money to the INS.
And voila.</TE>
<TE>   Congress is preparing hearings involving INS officials and
representatives from the colleges. Lawmakers should make sure the
system is fair but not indulge excuses. The nation's safety demands
that the new student visa program be implemented on schedule.</TE>

<HD>Playing Doctor at Kaiser</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kaiser Permanente's recent attempt at cost-cutting should anger and
frighten anyone who's ever made an anxious middle-of-the-night call
to his or her HMO to determine whether a 3-year-old with a fever
needs to see a doctor.</LD>
<LD>   The Kaiser program, now canceled, rewarded telephone clerks for
spending as little time as possible handling calls from patients and
for making as few doctor appointments as possible.</LD>
<LD>   Telephone triage is a frustrating fact of life in the modern
health-care system. However, it shouldn't be wielded as a potentially
dangerous cost-cutting tool, as it was from January 2000 to last
December when telephone service representatives at three Kaiser call
centers in Northern California earned bonuses by quickly disposing of
calls.</LD>
<TE>   The bonuses, up to 10% of a clerk's salary, were based on keeping
calls short, transferring as few callers as possible to advice nurses
and limiting the percentage who received doctor appointments.</TE>
<TE>   An internal Kaiser document, titled "Talking Points for Managers,"
described the bonuses as a way to "reward and encourage performance
improvements." If saving seconds, turning clerks into medical
decision makers and pinching the last dollar are the correct measures
of HMO health-care performance, we are all in serious trouble.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Managed Health Care is right to
investigate whether Kaiser clerks are, in essence, evaluating
patients' medical conditions. That's a process rightly restricted to
licensed medical personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser contends that it was simply trying to improve customer
service by reducing the amount of time callers were spending on hold,
but word of the cost-cutting gambit is far more likely to upset
patients who figured that the friendly voices at the other end of the
line belonged to medical personnel.</TE>
<TE>   One reason the defunct program didn't work was because some
callers persisted, refusing to hang up until they got answers or
appointments.</TE>
<TE>   A Kaiser physician wrote a report to Kaiser executives about the
call centers' problems early in 2000, saying other doctors had
expressed "distrust, anger, disappointment and pessimism" about the
Vallejo call center. He called for a complete revision so that it "no
longer functions as a barrier, but an agent of communication." The
executives didn't listen then. They are being forced to listen now.</TE>

<HD>Anti-Rebel Candidate Leads in Polls in Colombia</HD>
<DH>Election: Bombs damage office of Alvaro Uribe Velez ahead
of Sunday's presidential vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>With two polls published Sunday confirming Alvaro Uribe Velez's huge
lead ahead of next week's presidential election, the anti-guerrilla
candidate canceled one of his last campaign appearances for security
reasons and bombs trashed one of his offices.</LD>
<LD>   Uribe, who has promised to take a tough hand against Colombia's
leftist rebels and to battle corruption, was within a hair of the
majority he would need to win Sunday's vote and avoid a runoff,
according to the polls.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference in Bogota, the capital, Uribe said he had
called off a planned teleconference with people in more than a third
of Colombia's towns for security reasons. Sunday was the final day
for candidates to campaign.</LD>
<TE>   Uribe did not elaborate on the threat, but he confirmed police
reports that two small bombs had ripped through his campaign office
in the northern city of Valledupar the night before. The blasts only
damaged property.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe survived an assassination attempt last month when a bomb
blamed on leftist rebels rocked his motorcade, killing four
bystanders.</TE>
<TE>   He cut back public appearances and has been using TV spots and
teleconferencing to get his message across.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certain that Colombia will not miss this chance to elect a
government that is strong against corruption, politics-as-usual and
violence," he said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe, the former governor of Antioquia state, skyrocketed into
the lead this year on the strength of his anti-guerrilla rhetoric.
The tough talk touched a chord with voters frustrated by the lack of
results in three years of peace talks between the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia and President Andres Pastrana.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana, whose four-year term ends in August, is constitutionally
barred from reelection.</TE>

<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Citing increased security, authorities in the former Taliban
stronghold of Kandahar lifted a nighttime curfew for the first time
since the Soviet invasion in 1979, a U.S. military spokesman said
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Maj. Bryan Hilferty, speaking to reporters at the allied
headquarters in Bagram, north of the capital, Kabul, said lifting the
curfew in the southern city was "an example of the continuing
progress" toward stability in Afghanistan since the U.S. bombing
campaign and offensive by Northern Alliance forces ousted the Taliban
late last year.</LD>
<LD>   Most of Afghanistan had been under a dusk-to-dawn curfew since the
Soviet invasion.</LD>

<HD>Green Berets Go to Georgia in Battle Against Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Military: U.S. soldiers will spend one year training the
former Soviet republic's army to fight Chechen rebels active in its
territory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>In the latest expansion of the U.S.-led war on terrorism to a
little-noticed corner of the globe, about 50 Green Berets landed
Sunday in the capital of the Georgian republic to help train its
impoverished and ill-equipped army to oppose Chechen guerrilla groups
active in part of its territory.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next year, the Army Special Forces who arrived in Tbilisi
are to instruct 2,000 soldiers and officers in an effort to create an
effective anti-terrorist force in the mountainous Caucasus region
that has become home to some Arab and Chechen fighters supporting
Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   Russia has long complained that Georgia's lawless Pankisi Gorge,
which adjoins Chechnya, has provided sanctuary for Islamic
separatists fighting for Chechen independence from Russia.</LD>
<TE>   Georgian President Eduard A. Shevardnadze asked for the U.S.
trainers this year.</TE>
<TE>   Shevardnadze, who was foreign minister of the Soviet Union in its
last years, has tried to tilt his country toward closer relations
with the United States. But it has been a delicate balance for
Georgia to avoid offending Russia. Georgia, whose population is about
5 million, fell under Russian dominance in the 19th century and was
part of the Soviet Union until 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of U.S. troops has offended some nationalists in
Russia, who view growing U.S. influence in former Soviet territories
in Central Asia, the Caucasus and the Baltics as part of a conspiracy
to surround Russia and curtail its regional ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   But Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, who will host President
Bush for four days this week in Moscow and St. Petersburg, has
defended the U.S. role, saying that Washington is an ally when it
comes to eradicating the terrorist threat on Russia's southern
frontier.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia's Abkhazia region, a pro-Russian enclave that has had
years of de facto independence, has also been nervous about the
arrival of U.S. trainers. Its leaders fear a strengthened Georgian
army might once again challenge Abkhazia's autonomy.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers and officers to be trained by the Americans will
represent an elite 10% of the country's armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   "You know when you have boats in the harbor and the tide comes in
and lifts them up? We are going to play the tide for the whole
Georgian army," Lt. Col. Bill Wheelehan, part of an advance team that
met the instructors at Tbilisi airport, told Reuters news agency. The
team has been in Tbilisi for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Georgian Defense Ministry representatives and U.S. Embassy
personnel were also on hand to greet the troops from Ft. Carson,
Colo., as they disembarked from a gray C-17 transport.</TE>
<TE>   After settling in for a week, the instructors are to launch into
70 days of staff training for the first group of Georgian army
officers.</TE>
<TE>   After that, the Americans will carry out four back-to-back
tactical training programs lasting about 100 days each for commando,
mountain and special-forces battalions, and for a motorized rifle
brigade. Plans call for up to 150 U.S. military instructors to be in
Georgia at any one time.</TE>
<TE>   Under the "train and equip" program, the Georgian troops will be
provided small arms and ammunition, uniforms, fuel, construction
materials, and communications and medical gear for their training.
The budget of the U.S. mission is $64 million, almost four times the
annual defense budget of Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of both countries stressed that the U.S. troops would
not travel to the Pankisi Gorge itself or engage in any combat. "They
will be staying and working in Tbilisi," said Malkhaz Radiani, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   In the eight-month war on terrorism, U.S. troops have established
bases in Central Asia. An anti-terrorist training mission has also
begun in the Philippines, and U.S. military instructors are preparing
to be sent to Yemen.</TE>

<HD>As Gunfire Shakes Kashmir, Sabers Rattle in New Delhi</HD>
<DH>Asia: Support grows in India for a military strike on
Pakistan, seen as the power behind separatist attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Fierce gunfire across the India-Pakistan border and attacks by
militants killed at least 15 people in Kashmir over the weekend, as
India considered Sunday whether to take further military action
against its rival.</LD>
<LD>   The most intense cross-border firing this year came after India
expelled Pakistan's ambassador on Saturday amid high tensions. India
accuses Pakistan of sponsoring the militants, who are battling its
forces in Kashmir, which is divided between the two nations.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan denies arming and training the militants, and has cracked
down on them since President Pervez Musharraf threw his support
behind the U.S.-led war on terrorism. Pakistan says, however, that it
supports the goal of independence for the disputed region.</LD>
<TE>   On Sunday, suspected Islamic guerrillas fired at an Indian
military camp about 95 miles north of Jammu, in Indian-ruled Kashmir,
killing four soldiers and wounding 12, state police spokesman Subhash
Raina said. One of the attackers was killed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make it clear that the Indian army will retaliate
immediately, every time there is any such assault committed by
Pakistan," Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   Indian army officials said small-arms fire across the border was
relentless Sunday, and that both sides exchanged heavy mortar fire
overnight, forcing thousands of villagers to flee their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Three Indian civilians were killed Saturday, the officials said.
In Islamabad, Pakistani Information Minister Nisar Memon said that
"unprovoked" Indian shelling had killed seven Pakistanis and wounded
41 since Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee met with
opposition leader Sonia Gandhi amid growing political support for a
military strike against Pakistan. He huddled into the night with his
key ministers and three military chiefs to map out India's next move.</TE>

<HD>Sinn Fein Lauds Gains in Ireland</HD>
<DH>Europe: 'Our day has arrived,' Gerry Adams says after party
wins five seats in lower house.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DUBLIN, Ireland</DL>
<LD>Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams pledged Sunday to end "anemic
opposition" in Ireland after elections in which his hard-line
republicans made solid gains.</LD>
<LD>   "Our day has arrived," Adams said in the wake of the balloting,
whose results cast a shadow over European Union expansion plans
despite a big win for Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.</LD>
<LD>   "Sinn Fein is now a major political force for change in this
state," Adams said.</LD>
<TE>   But Ahern, whose center-right Fianna Fail party won an
overwhelming mandate for a second five-year term, threw down the
gauntlet. He said it was time for Sinn Fein to get its military wing,
the Irish Republican Army, to disarm.</TE>
<TE>   "Sinn Fein will have to go the rest of the way," Ahern said.</TE>
<TE>   The IRA, which fought a bloody 30-year battle to end British rule
in Northern Ireland, has put portions of its vast arsenal "beyond
use," but still has huge caches of arms in reserve.</TE>
<TE>   "There cannot be ambiguity. You cannot have a position where
you've some kind of allegiance and loyalty understanding with a
paramilitary army," Ahern said.</TE>
<TE>   Sinn Fein, which sits in government in Northern Ireland and holds
seats in the British Parliament, won five seats in Ireland's 166-seat
lower house of Parliament, giving it a significant voice there for
the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Counting of paper ballots continued Sunday to decide a handful of
contests outstanding from Friday's vote.</TE>
<TE>   But the outlines of the victory for Fianna Fail, and the solid
gains for Sinn Fein and the environmental Green Party, which got six
seats, were clear.</TE>
<TE>   As counting resumed, Fianna Fail had 75 seats, while the main
opposition and second runner-up Fine Gael had 29, a huge loss that
forced its leader to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Adams, who campaigned but was not a candidate, said opposition in
Ireland "was very anemic up until now" but he predicted change, with
Sinn Fein, the Green Party and other small or mid-sized parties
working together.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the outcome was a mandate for "an alternative vision"
for those who feel left out by Ireland's booming economy, the
fastest-growing in the EU.</TE>
<TE>   The gains by Sinn Fein and the Greens have implications for EU
enlargement because both strongly oppose the Nice Treaty, which
provides a legal basis for enlargement to proceed and which must be
ratified by all members.</TE>
<TE>   Irish voters rejected the treaty in a referendum last year, but
the government intends to hold another and ask voters to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   A recent opinion poll showed opposition to the treaty in Ireland
growing.</TE>

<HD>3 Israelis Slain in Netanya Suicide Bombing</HD>
<DH>Mideast: A Palestinian attacker disguised as a soldier dies
in a market blast that hurts dozens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ and MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NETANYA, Israel</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian disguised as an Israeli soldier blew himself up Sunday
in this city's open-air market, killing three Israelis, wounding
dozens and shattering a period of quiet that had lured many back to
the public places they had shunned.</LD>
<LD>   Netanya, nine miles west of the West Bank, has been the target of
11 Palestinian attacks in two years, including the March 27 suicide
bombing at a hotel where families were gathered to celebrate
Passover. That attack killed 29 and triggered a massive Israeli
military sweep through the West Bank that ended earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   A second suicide bomber blew himself up during rush hour this
morning but no one else was injured, Israel Radio said. According to
initial reports, the man, who was on foot, detonated explosives
strapped to his body as police approached at a busy intersection near
the northern town of Afula.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday's bombing came as the Bush administration is pressuring
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to rein in militants
and restructure his security forces as a prelude to renewing talks
with Israel. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said Israel will not
negotiate unless the conditions are met.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a
left-wing faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and
Hamas, a militant Islamic group, claimed responsibility for the
bombing. The Palestinian Authority condemned it.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian leadership would like to stress its denouncement
and condemnation of the terrorist attack against Israeli civilians in
the market in Netanya," the authority said in a statement issued by
the official news agency, WAFA, Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Television reported that army intelligence believes the
PFLP carried out the bombing. The organization has been demanding the
release of its leader, Ahmad Saadat, whom Arafat agreed to
incarcerate as part of a deal that ended Israel's siege of Arafat's
Ramallah headquarters this month.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Vice President Dick Cheney said there are some
bombings Arafat cannot prevent.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there clearly is a class of bombings that he can't rein
in," Cheney said on NBC's "Meet the Press." Hezbollah, a Lebanese
Shiite group, and Hamas are two organizations "that don't come under
his purview and that have in the past indicated they're prepared to
do everything they can to destroy the peace process," Cheney said.
"On the other hand, there have in the past been bombings by elements
of Palestinian organizations that come under his control."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney warned that if suicide bombers "achieve their desired
results" in the Middle East, it would increase the chances they would
attempt such attacks in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli security forces received a warning shortly before 4 p.m.
that a suicide bomber had left the West Bank town of Tulkarm, heading
for Israel's heavily populated coastal plain on what is the first day
of the workweek for Israelis. A massive manhunt was launched in
several cities, including Netanya.</TE>
<TE>   But it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   A man wearing the olive-drab uniform of an Israeli soldier and a
belt packed with explosives and nails got out of a taxi at Netanya's
colorful produce market about 4:30 p.m., a police spokesman said. He
walked a short distance into the rows of stalls and detonated the
belt, killing himself and two others.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Miriam Feierberg heard the blast from a few blocks away and
ran toward the market.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew about an hour before" that there might be an attack,
Feierberg said. "The police tried to be in every place to prevent it,
but they didn't succeed."</TE>
<TE>   Rescue workers converged on the scene, where metal doors were
twisted and torn amid undisturbed bins of cabbage, fennel bulbs and
lettuce. Six people reportedly suffered serious injuries, and 28 were
still in hospitals late Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a loud explosion, and I saw my son was wounded," said
Zeev Holder, 49, who runs a coffee shop directly across from where
the bomber detonated his explosives. Holder said his son, 21-year-old
Motti Holder, was injured in the leg but kept telling him, "It's OK,
it's OK." Holder watched as his son was loaded into an ambulance,
then waded into the chaotic scene to help other victims.</TE>
<TE>   Amos Gilam, 28, a social worker, was in his third-floor apartment
across the street from the market when he heard a huge blast.</TE>
<TE>   "I was afraid to look outside because I knew it was a bombing,"
Gilam said. When he did peep out the window, he said, "I saw people
on the ground. People were screaming. I was in shock."</TE>
<TE>   Amos Soffer, 16, said he was walking alongside a man he thought to
be a soldier when the man suddenly blew apart. The force of the blast
knocked Soffer to the ground, and he suffered cuts on his arm and
burns on his face.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's attack was the first suicide bombing of an Israeli target
since May 7, when a Palestinian blew himself up inside a pool hall in
Rishon Le Zion, south of Tel Aviv, killing 15 Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon cut short a visit to the United States and rushed back to
Israel to prepare a retaliatory invasion of the Gaza Strip after the
Rishon bombing. The operation was called off by Defense Minister
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, who said Cabinet ministers and senior officers
had endangered the operation by leaking its details to the press.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Ben-Eliezer said the Gaza operation had merely been
"postponed," and tensions have been mounting in the narrow, crowded
strip, a stronghold of Islamic militancy. On Sunday, a convoy of
Jewish settlers came under fire from Palestinian gunmen between the
settlement of Netzarim and the Karni crossing in Gaza. Four Israeli
soldiers were injured in the gun battle that followed.</TE>
<TE>   Late Sunday, Israeli armored personnel carriers briefly entered
the West Bank city of Ramallah after shots were fired at an Israeli
driving to a nearby settlement, an army spokeswoman said. The
motorist was not hurt and the troops withdrew without any contact
with Palestinians, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians and the army said troops also entered Tulkarm late
Sunday and arrested more than a dozen Palestinians before
withdrawing. The army said the Palestinians were later released.</TE>
<TE>   Israel is under pressure from the United States and the European
Union to refrain from a wide-scale operation as diplomatic efforts to
end the fighting that has raged since September 2000 intensify.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has said CIA Director George J.
Tenet will soon start pushing Israel and the Palestinians to renew
security cooperation. President Bush has thrown his support behind
efforts to convene an international peace conference, and has joined
the governments calling on Arafat to reform his government.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's dovish foreign minister, Shimon Peres, is the latest to
unveil a peace plan. In reports published in the Israeli press
Sunday, Peres detailed understandings he reached with Palestinian
Authority negotiator Ahmed Korei months ago. The plan calls for the
myriad Palestinian security forces to become a single force, and for
the Palestinian Authority to quickly declare a state on the land
Palestinians now control in the West Bank and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   Peres acknowledged in an Israel Radio interview Sunday that
Sharon, who has said he hopes to achieve long-term interim agreements
with the Palestinians, disagrees with elements of his plan.</TE>
<TE>   Maharaj reported from Netanya and Curtius from Jerusalem.</TE>

<HD>Sierra Leone's President Sweeps First Postwar Vote</HD>
<DH>Africa: Ahmad Tejan Kabbah is reelected as party of
ex-rebels gets almost no support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone</DL>
<LD>Sierra Leone's president was declared the winner Sunday of the first
postwar vote in his conflict-scarred West African nation, as voters
sweepingly rejected the party of former rebels.</LD>
<LD>   Ahmad Tejan Kabbah won 70.6% of the vote in Tuesday's election,
the National Electoral Commission announced. That was well above the
55% he needed to avoid a runoff.</LD>
<LD>   Radio announcements of the outcome sent people of Freetown, the
capital, running out into the shell- and bullet-pocked streets for a
heartfelt, impromptu celebration.</LD>
<TE>   Waving the palm frond symbols adopted by Kabbah's supporters, they
danced and sang in the roads as taxis wove among them, honking their
horns.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens credited Kabbah with resisting the rebels during their
10-year campaign here, which killed tens of thousands of Sierra
Leone's people.</TE>
<TE>   Countless more people live today with the legacy of the rebels'
trademark atrocity: lopping off victims' arms, feet, hands and lips
with machetes.</TE>
<TE>   Kabbah's supporters also credit him with helping to bring in the
U.N. and British forces that crushed the rebels starting in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Kabbah's party also did unexpectedly well in parliament, despite
predictions that his rank-and-file politicians would bear the brunt
of voters' unhappiness over continuing corruption.</TE>
<TE>   His Sierra Leone People's Party won 83 of the 112 seats.</TE>
<TE>   Ernest Koroma, the next-closest contender in a field of nine
presidential candidates, received 22.35% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Since disarming last year, the rebels have tried to reform
themselves into a political party. But with their leader, Foday
Sankoh, in jail, the man they fielded in the race won just 1.7% of
the vote.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, rebels won no seats in parliament. Their campaign
headquarters, donated by the government, has been increasingly glum
and deserted.</TE>

<HD>American Killed in Afghan Attack</HD>
<DH>War: Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters fire on a Special Forces
unit in an eastern enclave.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon announced Sunday that a U.S. Special Forces soldier died
after his unit came under heavy fire while on patrol in eastern
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Ten-year veteran Sgt. Gene Arden Vance Jr., 38, of Morgantown,
W.Va., died after waiting for medical assistance to arrive. Vance was
a member of the National Guard's 19th Special Forces Unit in West
Viginia, spokesman Maj. Mike Cadle said.</LD>
<LD>   The firefight began when suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban forces hit
the American unit with small-arms fire. The unit, along with allied
coalition forces, was part of a patrol that has been sweeping the
area in search of enemy contingents.</LD>
<TE>   "[Vance] was killed while on patrol in eastern Afghanistan after
his unit came under enemy fire," said Marine Lt. Col. Mike Humm, a
Pentagon spokesman. "The firefight started when enemy forces engaged
the patrol."</TE>
<TE>   No other U.S. forces were reported harmed. It could not be
ascertained whether there were casualties among the enemy forces.</TE>
<TE>   Since the start of Operation Enduring Freedom last year, 22
American military personnel have been killed in action.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. patrols began Friday near the southeastern Afghan city of
Khowst, where military authorities believed a large number of enemy
soldiers were hiding after ambushing an Australian unit the day
before.</TE>
<TE>   The Australians had come under heavy fire there for five hours,
until calling in strikes by American gunships, which killed 10 people
who the coalition said were Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Ben Curry, a British military spokesman at Bagram air
base north of Kabul, said Sunday that coalition troops sweeping the
area found a small amount of ammunition, including two 120-millimeter
rockets and a few cases of 12.7-millimeter ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   The Sabari, an Afghan tribe whose fighters were killed in
Thursday's airstrikes, disputed the coalition account of the
fighting. A delegation from the tribe discussed the bombing with U.S.
officers Saturday at Khowst airport, where American Special Forces
are based.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the tribe said their fighters were skirmishing with the
Balkhiel tribe in a dispute over trees near their villages when the
coalition attacked. Sabari elders denied firing on the Australians or
the U.S. aircraft or having links to Al Qaeda or the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   However, a U.S. military spokesman, Maj. Bryan Hilferty, said
Sunday that he had "no reason to believe" the tribe's account. "They
were shooting heavy machine guns and mortars at us. That is a known
Al Qaeda and Taliban area," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition forces had observed the area for several days and
believed it was being used as a transit point by Al Qaeda and Taliban
members, Hilferty said.</TE>

<HD>Suspect Denies Ties to Body</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: Key defendant in the slaying of Daniel Pearl
maintains his innocence after remains believed to be the reporter's
are found.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HYDERABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>The chief suspect in the slaying of Daniel Pearl denied any
connection to a body found in Karachi last week that is believed to
be that of the Wall Street Journal reporter, a defense attorney said
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   British-born militant Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh said he and his
three co-defendants, charged with the kidnapping and murder of Pearl,
"have nothing to do with all that," attorney Rai Bashir said Sheikh
told him in a private message he received Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The men have pleaded not guilty to the charges. Their trial, which
began April 22, is being held under heavy security at Hyderabad's
jail.</LD>
<TE>   Bashir said Sheikh also denied that he has ties to
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, an Islamic militant group linked to Al Qaeda.
Three suspected members of the group led police to the body last
week, according to state-run Pakistan Television. The suspects remain
in police custody.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not belong to Lashkar-e-Jhangvi," Bashir quoted Sheikh as
saying. The group was banned by Pakistan earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, an American, disappeared four months ago in the port city
of Karachi while researching Islamic militants. A videotape made by
his captors showed his death.</TE>
<TE>   Early Friday, police in Karachi unearthed a dismembered body
believed to be that of Pearl. The body was found near a
blood-splattered shack where authorities believe Pearl was held.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Kamal Shah said a team of doctors from Lahore will be
traveling to Karachi today to take back blood and hair samples for
DNA testing. Results from the tests, which will be conducted in
Lahore, could take up to a week, he said.</TE>

<HD>E. Timor Celebrates Its Birth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DILI, East Timor</DL>
<LD>Formally ending more than four centuries of colonial rule, this tiny
territory became a nation just after midnight as U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan handed power to the country's new
president, Jose Alexandre Gusmao.</LD>
<LD>   Tens of thousands of jubilant East Timorese gathered at a
racetrack on the edge of Dili, the capital, to witness the hand-over
ceremony early today and join in the celebration of East Timor's
long-sought independence after being ruled by Portugal and, more
recently, nearby Indonesia.</LD>
<LD>   "Today we are a people, standing on equal footing with all other
people in the world," the charismatic Gusmao told the crowd after he
took the oath of office. "Today we rejoice as an independent nation,
governing our own destiny."</LD>
<TE>   Representatives of more than 90 nations, including former U.S.
President Clinton, Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri and
Australian Prime Minister John Howard, were on hand to observe the
transfer of power.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the biggest applause was reserved for Clinton, who
supported the territory's independence in 1999, and Megawati, whose
presence at the ceremony was taken as a sign that East Timor and
Indonesia can put their differences behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "I salute you, people of East Timor, for the courage and
perseverance you have shown," Annan said shortly before the U.N. flag
came down for the last time. "That a small nation is able to inspire
the world and be the focus of our attention is the highest tribute
that I can pay."</TE>
<TE>   East Timor, largely the eastern half of Timor island, was ruled by
the Portuguese for more than 400 years. After Portugal withdrew in
1975, Indonesia invaded and claimed the territory. East Timorese say
Indonesia killed 200,000 people during its 24-year occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Resistance fighters, including Gusmao, took refuge in the jungle
and waged a long-running guerrilla campaign against Indonesian rule.</TE>
<TE>   In early 1999, then-Indonesian President B.J. Habibie agreed to
let the U.N. conduct a referendum in East Timor, and that August, the
people voted overwhelmingly for independence.</TE>
<TE>   In response, militias organized by the Indonesian military laid
waste to the territory, killing 1,000 people, destroying 70% of the
buildings, and forcing 260,000 people to flee across the border into
Indonesian West Timor.</TE>
<TE>   A U.N. peacekeeping force led by Australia and aided by the United
States landed in September 1999 and restored order. Since then, a
U.N. transitional government has run the province, restoring basic
services, building an army and police force, and paving the way for a
new democratically elected government to take over.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. mission in East Timor has been one of the organization's
most successful efforts to help a war-ravaged nation. Some believe it
could serve as a model for attempts at nation building elsewhere in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Never before has the world united with such firm resolve to help
one small nation establish itself," Annan told the Independence Day
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   While some East Timorese have resented the strong U.N. presence,
most have welcomed the U.N.'s assistance and its effort to prepare
the people to govern themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy because we have been fighting for 500 years, and
today we got our independence," said Felix do Espirito Santo, 38,
moments after Gusmao was sworn in as president. Now a manager of a
courier company, Espirito Santo  said he fought in the late 1970s
with Falintil, the East Timorese guerrilla army.</TE>
<TE>   The Indonesian military startled many East Timorese last week by
docking a navy ship in Dili without permission. The ship ostensibly
came to help prepare for Megawati's visit. Five other Indonesian
warships waited just offshore. East Timorese officials brushed aside
the breach of protocol as unimportant but privately suggested that it
was an effort by the Indonesian military to embarrass Megawati on the
eve of her visit.</TE>
<TE>   Although Megawati kept her East Timor visit to three hours, some
of her nationalist-minded critics at home objected to her making the
trip.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing black, Megawati was met at the airport by Gusmao. They
first went to pay their respects at a cemetery in Dili where
Indonesian soldiers killed during the occupation are buried. Gusmao
then escorted her onto the Independence Day stage to the cheers of
the crowd. The Indonesian president looked slightly uncomfortable as
Gusmao held her hand in the air, but the audience applauded every
time her name was mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Annan and Clinton both praised Megawati's willingness to
attend the event as an indication that the two countries can develop
a new cooperative relationship. Annan called her participation in the
celebration "a wise and courageous decision."</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia has been widely criticized by human rights advocates for
its slowness in prosecuting top army officers and militia leaders now
in Indonesia who are believed responsible for masterminding the 1999
East Timor carnage.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the government convened a human rights tribunal
in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, and put five suspects on trial,
including the former East Timor governor, Jose Abilio Soares, but no
verdict has been reached.</TE>
<TE>   East Timor has convicted 10 militia members for their role in the
violence, but Gusmao has urged the new nation to focus on improving
the life of its people, not on revenge. East Timor begins its
independence as the poorest country in Asia and one of the poorest in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   Gusmao, who spent nearly seven years in an Indonesian prison, has
called on his fellow East Timorese to forgive lower-level militia
members involved in the 1999 destruction and accept them back into
their communities.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton, who was asked by President Bush to head the U.S.
delegation to East Timor, compared Gusmao to former South African
President Nelson Mandela, whose effort to bring together black and
white South Africans after the end of apartheid was a model of
reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   "The leaders and the people of East Timor ... have given all of us
the chance to remember that freedom is precious and your freedom has
been paid for by blood and sacrifice," Clinton said upon his arrival
earlier. After the independence ceremony, he presided over the
opening of a new U.S. Embassy in Dili.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton acknowledged to reporters that the United States provided
military aid to Indonesia at a time when Jakarta was treating
brutally the people of East Timor. "I don't think we can defend
everything we did," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gusmao, commonly known as Xanana, also has reached out to
Indonesia and sought to establish good relations with East Timor's
powerful neighbor. East Timor has a population of about 800,000 while
Indonesia has 220 million people.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we all agree that the strains in our dealings was a result
of a historical mistake, which now belongs to history and to the
past," Gusmao told the crowd. "And this past ... should not continue
to stain our spirits or to hamper our attitudes and conduct."</TE>
<TE>   With East Timor's independence, Annan said the world body will
reduce its level of commitment but has no intention of abandoning the
country. For now, 5,000 U.N. peacekeepers will remain to help protect
the border with Indonesia.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Extend Hand to Cubans</HD>
<DH>Policy: The president plans to allow some new humanitarian
aid, but he remains firm on the embargo and his demand for democracy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a significant new initiative, President Bush today plans to allow
increased humanitarian aid to Cuba but demand far-reaching political
reforms by Fidel Castro as a prerequisite for easing U.S. economic
sanctions against the island, administration officials said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In a major speech marking Cuban Independence Day, the president
intends to offer private humanitarian aid, scholarships and
U.S.-Cuban mail service.</LD>
<LD>   But in excerpts of his remarks made available Sunday night, the
president insists that the 4-decade-old trade embargo will remain
unless Cuba holds internationally monitored National Assembly
elections next year, releases political prisoners, reforms its
economy and allows a free opposition and independent trade unions.</LD>
<TE>   "Without major steps by Cuba to open up its political system and
its economic system, trade with Cuba will not help the Cuban
people--it will merely enrich Castro and his cronies and prop up
their dictatorship," according to the text.</TE>
<TE>   "Full normalization of relations with Cuba--diplomatic
recognition, open trade and a robust aid program--will only be
possible when Cuba has a new government that is fully democratic,
when the rule of law is respected and when the human rights of all
Cubans are fully protected," it said.</TE>
<TE>   The president is scheduled to deliver his speech twice today,
first at the White House this morning and then in midafternoon in
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   While Bush has long opposed any easing of sanctions against Cuba,
he came under fresh pressure to change his stance last week during a
six-day visit to Cuba by former President Carter, a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   While in Havana, Carter called for an end to the trade embargo, as
well as for political reforms. Many members of Congress are joining
the call for easing sanctions. So are some Cuban
Americans--especially the younger ones, breaking from a once-solid
united front against Castro, who overthrew the government of
Fulgencio Batista in 1959 and imposed a Communist dictatorship. When
the Cuban president began confiscating property and nationalizing
U.S. companies, the United States responded with a trade embargo.</TE>
<TE>   Among the series of steps outlined in his "Initiative for a New
Cuba," Bush intends to:</TE>
<TE>   * Call for a resumption of mail service to and from the island.</TE>
<TE>   * Establish scholarships in the United States for the families of
political prisoners and for Cuban students and professionals seeking
to build independent civil institutions.</TE>
<TE>   * Provide direct financial aid to the people of Cuba through
nongovernmental groups and make it easier for U.S. religious and
other private organizations to provide humanitarian assistance there.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush excerpts describe the new U.S. initiative as an attempt
to "mitigate the suffering" of the Cuban people and as the start of
"an ongoing, flexible and responsive campaign designed to generate
rapid and peaceful change within Cuba."</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate response from Havana, but Castro seems
unlikely to meet the multitude of demands that Bush is laying out.</TE>
<TE>   But if Castro does, the excerpts indicate, Bush will "work with
the United States Congress to ease the ban on trade and travel
between Cuba and the United States.... With real political and
economic reform, trade can benefit the Cuban people and allow them to
share in the progress of our times."</TE>
<TE>   The excerpts make no mention of imposing tougher restrictions on
travel to Cuba--a possibility that was widely rumored last week.
Current restrictions forbid travel to Cuba, though they are widely
circumnavigated.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Sunday whether Bush intends to mention the
accusations made earlier this month by a senior State Department
official that Cuba is developing biological weapons
technology--which, if true, could qualify Cuba as a new member of
what Bush has described as an "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   In his Jan. 29 State of the Union address to a joint session of
Congress, Bush used that phrase to brand Iran, Iraq and North Korea,
warning that they could make weapons of mass destruction available to
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before Carter went to Cuba, Undersecretary of State John
R. Bolton said in a speech here that the United States believes that
Cuba "has at least a limited offensive biological warfare research
and development effort" and that it has "provided dual-use
biotechnology to other rogue states."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy escalated when Carter, while still in Cuba, said
publicly that senior U.S. intelligence officials in pre-trip
briefings had told him that there was no evidence that Cuba was
aiding terrorists in such fashion.</TE>
<TE>   In his most recent public remarks about Castro, on Tuesday, Bush
called him "a dictator," adding: "My message to the Cuban people is:
'Demand freedom, and you've got a president who stands with you.'"</TE>
<TE>   According to Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American
National Foundation, who was briefed on Bush's message, the president
also is likely to express his support for a referendum in Cuba asking
voters whether they favor civil liberties, such as freedom of speech
and assembly, and amnesty for political prisoners, the Associated
Press reported.</TE>
<TE>   While in Miami, Bush is scheduled to speak at a fund-raising
dinner for his younger brother, Jeb, who is seeking a second term as
Florida's governor.</TE>
<TE>   The president's remarks are likely to be warmly received by the
politically active Cuban American community in South Florida--a
crucial base of support for Republicans in the Sunshine State.
Florida is expected to be a swing state in the 2004 presidential
election, as it was in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Russia to Pack Away Arms but Not Discontent</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Putin and Bush will mark a nuclear arms pact
this week, but public sentiment in Europe toward the U.S. is becoming
unsettled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When President Bush arrives in Moscow this week, the agreement the
United States and Russia reached to reduce their nuclear arsenals by
two-thirds will be the visit's centerpiece.</LD>
<LD>   But even as the accord is celebrated, Bush and Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin will grapple with a host of issues that loom as the
latest tests of their evolving relationship. These range from the
unresolved question of Moscow's future role in the war on terrorism
to the security of dismantled Russian nuclear weapons and the sale of
Russian nuclear technology.</LD>
<LD>   Bush leaves Washington on Wednesday on a seven-day trip that,
along with the Moscow stop, will take him to St. Petersburg, Berlin,
Paris (with a side trip to Normandy) and Rome. It will be his eighth
trip out of the country as president.</LD>
<TE>   From a private dinner with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to
a NATO summit in Rome, Bush will come face to face with a Europe
whose official ties to the U.S. government are stronger than they
have been in years, and yet, some experts say, whose citizens'
disaffection with American policies couldn't be deeper.</TE>
<TE>   German officials are increasingly concerned that anti-American
demonstrations in Berlin could turn violent, and in Russia--where
Bush's visit has so far drawn little public attention--a survey by
the Public Opinion Foundation found that 45% of those polled said
they didn't care much for the U.S. president, up from 25% just after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   'An Increasingly Negative Drift' in Europe</TE>
<TE>   Across Europe, said Germany's ambassador to the United States,
Wolfgang Ischinger, there is "a strange parallelism": From Washington
to Moscow, rarely has there been such cooperation on policy matters.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the good news," he said in an interview with a small group
of reporters. "At the same time, there is an increasingly negative
drift in the way the publics and newspapers describe the
relationship."</TE>
<TE>   This drift, he said, reflects both a European concern that the
U.S. government, at heart, favors a go-it-alone approach, and angry
complaints that the United States' Middle East policy ignores the
rights and needs of Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S.-Russian relationship continues to evolve more than a
decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the arms-control
treaty symbolizes the efforts each country is making to find grounds
for cooperation. But arms-control experts say it does little to
reduce the threat that nuclear weapons continue to pose and fails to
address the more immediate challenges to global stability.</TE>
<TE>   The treaty, which requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate and the
Russian Duma, is to last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Without an extension, arms-control experts point out, the
reductions that the agreement specifies--bringing the number of
deployed warheads on each side from the current level of
approximately 6,000 to a range of 1,700 to 2,200--could be abandoned
by 2012. Then, a new buildup could begin.</TE>
<TE>   And that is the likely high point of the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be yet another feel-good summit--an expression
of U.S.-Russian friendship and cooperation, but with little firm
commitments or new programs," said Joseph Cirincione, a senior
associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a
Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Russians' top concerns, he said, are their entry into
the World Trade Organization, cooperation with the United States in
exporting Caspian Sea oil, and Russia's integration into the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. From the U.S. perspective, the top
issue is control of Russian nuclear technology--making sure it does
not fall into the hands of terrorists or contribute to developing
nuclear weapons in Iran, Iraq or North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe the summit will substantially advance any of
these agendas," Cirincione said.</TE>
<TE>   Arms Reduction Is What Clinton, Yeltsin Wanted</TE>
<TE>   The weapons reduction is essentially what President Clinton and
Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin agreed to in 1997. But their
agreement faced too much opposition from Republicans in the Senate
and Communists in the Duma to be enacted. Unlike the 1997 pact, this
one does not include short-range nuclear weapons. Nor does it demand
the dismantling of the warheads that are removed from weapons--a key
concern, given the high degree of uncertainty about Russia's ability
to keep them secure.</TE>
<TE>   When he announced the agreement, Bush said the treaty would
liquidate the last vestiges of the Cold War. However, critics
complained that because the warheads will remain intact--2,400 of
them in what the U.S. calls "responsive storage," ready for
redeployment--it does nothing to liquidate the Cold War's weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Graham T. Allison, a former assistant secretary of Defense and a
Harvard University expert on Russia, said it matters little whether
there are 6,500 nuclear warheads or 2,000 in each country.</TE>
<TE>   "What matters," he said, is "the probability of use."</TE>
<TE>   Because the treaty does not address the amount of time that a
Russian or U.S. president would have to decide whether to use the
weapons in a crisis, he said he would grade it no higher than a "C."</TE>
<TE>   Such skepticism about the agreement's importance is echoed by
Andrei A. Piontkovsky, director of the Independent Institute for
Strategic Studies in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   "There will never be a nuclear war between Russia and the United
States at least in the foreseeable future. This is why the agreement
on the new strategic reductions has no practical importance for
either country. It is one of those detente documents of the Cold War
era, a kind of document which will be completely forgotten in a few
years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What is more important is what else the presidents will sign in
terms of alliance-forming. The big question is how far this document
will go beyond just declarations of intent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Piontkovsky singled out the benefits Russia could get from "a real
partnership" with the United States over "vital topics like Russia's
role in the world energy market"--it is the world's second-largest
oil producer and its second-largest oil exporter--and its
"potentially vulnerable sovereignty in the Far East, where China's
role is becoming more and more assertive."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander A. Konovalov, president of another Russian think tank,
the Institute for Strategic Assessment, said the summit, at its best,
would keep intact, perhaps modestly, the process of bilateral arms
negotiations, which he said is needed for world stability.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the Bush administration, Konovalov said, "it was
firmly believed that the disarmament control process would be
ultimately destroyed, that the American side wouldn't be inclined to
conclude any binding accords but go to unilateral declarations. This
could have been a catastrophe for the continuation of the nuclear
arms reduction."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting will be the fourth between Bush and Putin. They last
met in November, in Washington and in Crawford, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will visit St. Petersburg, Putin's home city, and engage in a
question-and-answer session at St. Petersburg State University.</TE>

<HD>Software Comes Back in Play as Game Industry Seeks New
Winners</HD>
<DH>Tech: At the Electronic Entertainment Expo this week in Los
Angeles, companies will be in search of the 'killer app.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once a garish sideshow for video game nerds, the Electronic
Entertainment Expo has turned into an annual party for one of the few
technology sectors yet to flash "Game Over."</LD>
<LD>   Attendance and booth space at E3, which begins Wednesday at the
Los Angeles Convention Center, are expected to rise this year, a sign
that mainstream interest in games is growing as Wall Street and
Hollywood search for solid investments.</LD>
<LD>   But as the financial and entertainment elite converge on video
games as the answer to their woes, the game industry is becoming more
like Hollywood with ballooning budgets, a reliance on sequels to fuel
sales and a focus on blockbuster titles at the expense of fledgling
franchises.</LD>
<TE>   The result: Less hype about new state-of-the-art hardware than
last year and more emphasis on finding the "killer app," a game so
irresistible that it can launch a franchise such as "Tomb Raider's"
Lara Croft.</TE>
<TE>   "This year's focus is shifting back to software--who's going to
have the great product for the holiday," said Shawn C. Milne, a game
industry analyst with Soundview Technology Group in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, sales of new consoles drove industry growth, according
to NPD Group Inc. It credited the launch of Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox,
Nintendo Co.'s GameCube and GameBoy Advance and the strong momentum
of Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 2 (introduced in 2000) for much of the
industry's 43% growth last year to $9.4 billion--$3 billion of which
came from hardware sales. Hollywood box office receipts, by
comparison, were $8.4 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Although console sales probably will be brisk this year, the star
of the show will be software.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year's E3 was about who was going to win the console war,"
said John Riccitiello, president of Electronic Arts Inc. in Redwood
City, Calif. "That's done. It's unequivocal. Sony won, and it doesn't
seem like the tide is going to turn. What's going to define the
remainder of this generation is content. It's software."</TE>
<TE>   That's good for companies such as EA, Activision Inc., THQ Inc.,
Sega Corp. and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., which put out last
year's sleeper hit "Grand Theft Auto 3." Shares of Activision have
jumped 27% this year; Take-Two's shares have risen 58%. EA's stock
has gained 6% and THQ's is up 5%.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first of the harvest years," said Activision Chief
Executive Robert Kotick, who forecast that software sales will grow
12% to 17% this year.</TE>
<TE>   With prices the same at $199.99 for the PS2 and Xbox, analysts say
games--especially exclusive titles that can be played only on a
single platform--will be more critical for Microsoft and Sony.
"There's a lot of jockeying for exclusive titles," said Simon Price,
president of LucasArts, a subsidiary of Lucasfilm Ltd. in San Rafael.</TE>
<TE>   That means software companies now can bargain for discounts on
royalties paid to console companies, which can be as much as $7 per
disc sold. They also can reap millions of dollars for each exclusive
title to help pay for marketing or development costs. For game
companies, the trade-off is potentially fewer sales but lower risk.</TE>
<TE>   Minimizing risk has been a noticeable trend. As development
budgets grow, publishers increasingly are milking existing franchises
by churning out sequels and snapping up licenses to piggyback off
well-known brands, such as "Lord of the Rings," "Harry Potter," "The
Matrix" and "Peter Pan." That's caused some to question whether
creativity will take a back seat to economic imperatives.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say innovation is the biggest challenge we face in the
industry today," said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive
Digital Software Assn. in Washington, a video game industry trade
group.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, competition among hardware companies remains brutal.
Sony and Microsoft last week declared a price war, dropping the
sticker price of their consoles by one-third to $199.99. Nintendo is
firing back by dropping GameCube prices 25% to $149.99 Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   They've also waged a war over the online games market. Nintendo
last week announced it would sell a $35 modem for its GameCube this
fall so gamers can play against each other over the Internet.
Nintendo also said it will not charge game publishers any royalties
for their online revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Sony is pursuing a similar model. The Japanese company is
releasing a $40 modem in August and offering cash incentives to
developers who build online features into their PlayStation 2 games.
Sony, however, plans to charge royalties on online revenues. Sony
scored a coup last week when it landed a deal with Electronic Arts to
build online features for future "Madden Football" games exclusively
for PlayStation 2.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's plans are the most elaborate. The Redmond, Wash.,
company is building a complete online environment run by Microsoft's
servers. Dubbed "Xbox Live," the program is designed to make it
simple for gamers to log on, find opponents, compare high scores,
compete in live tournaments and even download extra characters or
game levels.</TE>
<TE>   Although PlayStation and GameCube owners must buy modems to
connect, Xboxes have built-in high-speed Ethernet adaptors. Microsoft
also has landed a deal with LucasArts to put the highly anticipated
online game "Star Wars Galaxies" on Xbox.</TE>
<TE>   Although intriguing from a technology standpoint, online games are
far from becoming a significant part of any company's revenue, most
industry watchers say.</TE>
<TE>   "Online is a joke," said Michael Pachter, director of research for
Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Even publishers aren't relying on online revenue from consoles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take a while," said THQ CEO Brian Farrell. "The
real here and now are the core single-player products."</TE>
<TE>   That's enough for investors who are streaming to E3, where a
minister in the British Department of Trade and Industry is expected
to announce a new venture capital fund with about $45 million devoted
to funding video games.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>COUDERSPORT, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Cable television company Adelphia Communications Corp., which has
delayed its annual financial report, said James Brown has resigned as
vice president of finance, effective immediately.</LD>
<LD>   Brown worked for Adelphia for almost 18 years, the company said in
a news release Sunday. Company officials couldn't immediately be
reached for comment.</LD>
<LD>   Grand juries in New York and Pennsylvania are examining matters
related to the company, and Nasdaq may delist its shares because
Adelphia hasn't filed an annual report amid questions about its
accounting. The Securities and Exchange Commission is scrutinizing
the company for backing $2.3billion in loans to partnerships run by
the family of founder John Rigas. Rigas resigned as chairman last
week.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Coudersport-based Adelphia fell 36 cents to $5.70 on
Nasdaq on Tuesday before trading was suspended. They've fallen 72%
since March 27, when the firm acknowledged it guaranteed bank loans
to the Rigas partnerships.</TE>

<HD>Offering the High Road for File Sharing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Capitalizing on the burgeoning phenomenon of online piracy, a group
of upstarts is trying to sell copyright owners the opportunity to
compete against their own pirated material.</LD>
<LD>   The first of these services, from Altnet Inc., makes its debut
today by piggybacking on Kazaa, a powerful online network that lets
consumers make unauthorized copies of music, movies and software
freely from one another's computers.</LD>
<LD>   The service already has drawn flak from Kazaa users, who installed
Altnet software with the Kazaa program without realizing what it
could do--offer users the chance to pay for authorized copies of
material they almost certainly could download for free.</LD>
<TE>   "We feel that, fundamentally, users of any of these [file-sharing]
networks are honest people," said Kevin Bermeister, chief executive
of Brilliant Digital Entertainment, the Woodland Hills animation
company that owns 51% of Altnet. "Users want secure content; they
want content from a credible source. They don't mind paying for it,
provided that it's easy and intuitive and reasonably priced."</TE>
<TE>   Controversy aside, Altnet is just one of several emerging efforts
to use online file-sharing networks to distribute digital goods
without violating copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these efforts, such as Wippit and CenterSpan Corp.'s
Scour, are built on secure networks that don't allow consumers to
trade pirated goods. Sony Music recently put five free songs by
emerging artists on Scour, the first tentative step by a major label
toward file sharing.</TE>
<TE>   But Wippit and Scour have small audiences compared with those of
the leading file-sharing networks, which let users copy any digitized
song, movie, game or program offered by other users regardless of
copyright. Other efforts focusing on these so-called peer-to-peer
networks are hoping to inject copy-protected songs and videos into
the flood of pirated material. The copy-protected goods could be
downloaded for free, but users would have to make some kind of
payment in order to play them.</TE>
<TE>   One--by Streamcast Networks Inc., owner of the controversial
Morpheus file-sharing network--is MusicCity.com, which would let
artists offer copy-protected songs through Morpheus. A second, from
FileFreedom, lets copyright owners market their wares directly to
users of Grokster, another file-sharing network rife with pirated
goods.</TE>
<TE>   Altnet takes a hybrid approach. Its TopSearch service is
integrated into Kazaa, enabling copyright owners to offer authorized,
copy-protected files to any user who searches the Kazaa network for
their works. In a few months, Altnet plans to launch a separate
network that can distribute digital goods securely without mingling
them with unauthorized copies.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the new services is to make money directly from
copyright owners, not as file-sharing services do by selling
advertising. Streamcast, for example, plans to take a 30% cut of the
money artists make from the songs they sell through Morpheus.</TE>
<TE>   Altnet plans to sell TopSearch services to copyright holders,
promising to make their copy- protected works stand out from the
clutter on Kazaa. When Kazaa users search for works by artist or
title, Kazaa's software returns a list of links to files that can be
copied from other users' computers--with links to copy-protected
TopSearch files arriving first and staying at the top of the list.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if the band U2 wanted to distribute a copy- protected
version of the song "One," whenever a Kazaa user searched for U2 or
"One," TopSearch would ensure that links to the authorized files are
displayed first. But users still could scroll down the list and find
an unauthorized copy that they could download for free.</TE>
<TE>   Bermeister of Brilliant Digital Entertainment said companies that
have agreed to try out TopSearch include 2K Sounds, an independent
label distributed by EMI Recorded Music, and Infogrames, a major
video game developer.</TE>
<TE>   The major record companies have had little success selling digital
music files over the Internet. Analysts estimate that fewer than
100,000 consumers have signed up for any online subscription service
for music, which typically charges 99 cents to $2.50 an item.</TE>
<TE>   One of the performers using MusicCity.com is Thomas Dolby, a
former EMI artist now recording independently.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been very against the free distribution of my music
personally, or any artist's music," he said. "I looked at MusicCity's
approach, and I felt that it may not be perfect--it may just be one
more step in this whole sort of evolution--[but] ... I felt that
there was a genuine desire to try to improve the situation for
everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Oppenheim, senior vice president of business and legal
affairs for the Recording Industry Assn. of America, was more
cautious in his assessment of the new systems.</TE>
<TE>   "The concept of a secure system trading works for which permission
has been granted by the copyright owner is a great idea," he said of
Altnet. "It'd be nice to see it implemented by those whose hands are
not already dirty."</TE>
<TE>   Altnet has not just garnered global distribution for its software
from Kazaa. It also is closely tied to the engineers who developed
Kazaa's technology and the company that oversees the current network.</TE>
<TE>   Kazaa was developed by Consumer Empowerment of Amsterdam, whose
principals now own 49% of Altnet, according to securities filings.
Consumer Empowerment licensed its technology and sold the Kazaa brand
to Sharman Networks of Vanuatu, an island nation in the South
Pacific. Sharman uses Brilliant Digital Entertainment's technology to
deliver animated ads through Kazaa.</TE>
<TE>   By piggybacking on Kazaa, Altnet's TopSearch software already has
found its way into about 25 million computers, and Bermeister said
that at least 2 million more are coming online each week. Before it
activates its secure file-sharing network, Bermeister said, Altnet
will need a limited number of Kazaa users to sign up and download a
final piece of software.</TE>
<TE>   The secure Altnet Resource Network will act not only as a low-cost
distribution service for digital goods but also as a source of
computing power for rent. By sending computing tasks to thousands of
idle machines, the network can effectively act as a supercomputer.
And by storing copies of files on hard drives around the globe, the
network can deliver large quantities of digital goods for much less
than it would cost to send them from a single computer.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for Altnet will be to persuade consumers to be part
of the new network. The initial revelations about Altnet spurred
alternative file-sharing networks that don't come bundled with
Altnet, such as Kazaa Lite, a variation that Sharman Networks has
been battling with cease-and-desist letters.</TE>

<HD>Tech Drives a Hard Bargain</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Despite the sector's slump, many shares carry a
high price tag. Analysts say they are finding better buys in other
companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With technology stocks down for a third straight year, many investors
may be pondering whether the sector is--finally--becoming cheap.</LD>
<LD>   Yet despite their slump over the last two months, many tech shares
remain pricey based on basic valuation measures such as
price-to-earnings ratios.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft Corp., for example, trades for 29 times the next fiscal
year's per-share earnings estimate and Cisco Systems Inc. commands 33
times its 2003 fiscal-year consensus estimate, based on a survey of
analysts by Thomson Financial/IBES.</LD>
<TE>   By contrast, the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is priced
at about 20 times next year's estimated operating earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some portfolio managers say leading tech stocks are poised
to benefit if the economy continues to recover this year and next,
and could reward patient investors.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually demand [for tech equipment] has to pick up as the
economy improves, and we're getting closer and closer to that point,"
said Fritz Reynolds, manager of Reynolds Blue Chip Growth fund in San
Francisco. He believes the sector's drubbing of the last two years
minimizes the risk of further downside.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index bolstered investor spirits
last week by surging 8.8% to 1,741.39, its best weekly gain in more
than a year. But it remains down 10.7% in 2002 and down almost
two-thirds from its all-time peak in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Looking ahead, earnings estimates for many high-quality tech
companies could be too low, just as they were too high before the
economy fizzled two years ago, Reynolds said. Typically when earnings
are depressed, as they are now, stock valuations appear to be
daunting.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, jittery analysts and company managers scarred by two
years of pain could be reluctant to express optimism in their
outlooks, he added, and so they may be keeping the earnings bar low.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds cautioned that even with big-name tech firms there is a
risk of obsolescence--the danger that befell Digital Equipment, Data
General, Wang Labs and many others over the years.</TE>
<TE>   He recommends holding a basket of 10 or so, such as Microsoft,
Cisco, Intel Corp., AOL Time Warner Inc., IBM Corp., Hewlett-Packard
Co., EMC Corp., Oracle Corp., Dell Computer Corp. and Nokia.</TE>
<TE>   But many other fund managers say they are finding better bargains
in other stock sectors, including railroads, industrial gases,
defense and housing.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Muhlenkamp, manager of the Muhlenkamp Fund in Pittsburgh, said
he has been adding to his holdings in the home-building sector, such
as NVR Inc., Centex Corp. and Beazer Homes USA Inc. With P/E ratios
of 10 or less based on 2003 earnings estimates, the stocks remain
cheap despite a good run over the last year, Muhlenkamp said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still not finding any value in tech stocks," he said.
"People are buying them based on faith, not numbers. We don't buy
hope or hype."</TE>
<TE>   Muhlenkamp, whose fund is up 7.8% this year, uses a two-step
process to initially screen for stocks worth researching further. He
seeks companies with a return on equity above the broad market's
average, currently about 13%; second, he wants to see a P/E ratio no
higher than the ROE.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he would pay a P/E of 25 for a stock, but only if the
company were posting an ROE of at least 25%.</TE>
<TE>   "We want good companies at a reasonable price," he said.
"Cadillacs are usually too expensive, but we'll buy Buicks and
Pontiacs when they go on sale. We won't ever buy a Yugo."</TE>
<TE>   Muhlenkamp said he tweaks his definition of "fair value" as the
economy changes. Today's inflation of about 2% and longer-term
interest rates of 5% to 6% are fairly tame by historical standards;
if inflation were to rise, threatening to chip away at the value of
future corporate earnings, he would adjust his scale, demanding lower
stock P/Es than ROEs.</TE>
<TE>   Tom McKissick and John Snider, who manage the TCW Galileo Large
Cap Value Fund in Los Angeles, also have been favoring sectors other
than technology.</TE>
<TE>   The managers focus on companies whose return on invested capital
is improving, which they say steers them toward firms with improving
business fundamentals and away from value traps--stocks that are
cheap for good reason.</TE>
<TE>   Rail giant Union Pacific Corp. exemplifies the kind of stock the
managers favor. "After a period of mismanagement, the railroads are
now an improving business," McKissick said. "They've figured out the
scheduling. The boxcars are leaving 80% to 90% full, not 50%. These
are the kind of steady, grind-it-out companies we like."</TE>
<TE>   Union Pacific's return on invested capital dwindled from about 13%
in the mid-'90s to 5% by the end of decade, McKissick said. In the
last couple years it has improved to 8% to 9%, with further room to
rise, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Electronics maker ITT Industries Inc. is another example, Snider
said: "They got out of the auto parts business in the late '90s, and
now it's a smaller--but better run--business."</TE>
<TE>   In the industrial gases sector, where consolidation and
technological advances have improved fundamentals, Snider said, Air
Products &amp; Chemicals Inc. and Praxair Inc. fit the fund's bill. Their
portfolio is up 5.9% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Large-cap growth stock manager Liz Ann Sonders of the New York
firm Campbell, Cowperthwait said she has found plenty of stocks to
buy this year based on her reading of business trends in tech and
other sectors.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed Martin Corp., for example, should benefit from increased
military spending, Sonders said. Consumers' increasing shift toward
discount retailers, and the Kmart Corp. bankruptcy, should benefit
Target Corp., she said, also noting that the company is "earlier in
its life cycle" than industry leader Wal-Mart Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Medical products maker Baxter International Inc. is "making
significant inroads in biosciences," Sonders said, while consumer
products giant Johnson &amp; Johnson is having success with drug-coated
stents, among other new products.</TE>
<TE>   Sonders said she also has been finding "intriguing opportunities"
in tech, although she has been choosy and has steered clear of the
priciest names.</TE>
<TE>   She has bought Electronic Data Systems Corp. and Automatic Data
Processing Inc. With a P/E of 15 based on 2003 earnings estimates,
EDS is especially cheap, she believes.</TE>
<TE>   ADP can benefit if an improving economy means companies will need
more payroll services, Sonders said, while EDS, which provides
technology consulting and management services, should gain as
companies strive to "spend efficiently" as capital investment
revives.</TE>

<HD>Enron, Global Deal Disguised, Paper Says</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. and Global Crossing Ltd. created a transaction to
disguise a loan and to help the companies manage Wall Street
expectations, the New York Times reported, citing unidentified
executives and traders.</LD>
<LD>   In the fourth quarter of 2000, the companies reworked what was
originally a noncash agreement to swap fiber-optic access and
services into a $17-million sale of network access to Enron, the
paper said. Enron would pay upfront and Global Crossing would buy
about $17 million in services from Enron to be paid over eight years,
the paper said.</LD>
<LD>   Reliant Resources Inc. served as a middleman in the deal, which
closed in March 2001, the paper said. Enron reported a $5-million
profit from the transaction, the Times said, citing an unidentified
former Enron executive. The transaction was part of Enron's
broad-based effort to manage Wall Street expectations, the paper
reported, citing an unidentified former company executive.</LD>
<TE>   Reliant Resources was expected to receive about $300,000, and
Enron paid its share through network-access swaps, the paper said,
citing unidentified executives. An Enron spokesman declined to
comment, the paper said. Unidentified Global Crossing and Reliant
Resources officials acknowledged a transaction with Enron took place,
the Times said.</TE>

<HD>Gas Prices Steady Amid Ample Supply</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. average retail gasoline prices held steady over the last two
weeks due to robust supplies despite increasing demand as summer
approaches, according to a nationwide survey released Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The national average for self-serve regular gas rose less than 1
cent to $1.4278 a gallon in the two weeks ended May 17, 30 cents
below the level last year, according to the Lundberg survey of 8,000
gas stations.</LD>
<LD>   Gas pump prices were unchanged over the last six weeks amid heavy
scrutiny of the oil industry by U.S. lawmakers and antitrust
watchdogs after an earlier 22-cent price spike compared with last
year.</LD>
<TE>   "Gasoline supplies are sufficient, whereas last year they were in
tight supply," said Trilby Lundberg, editor of the survey.
"Production of gasoline was limited last year by refinery maintenance
turnarounds that hit just as higher seasonal demand approached."</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline prices normally rise in the late spring due to increased
consumption as well as more stringent clean-air fuel requirements
imposed during the summer.</TE>

<HD>ImClone Drug Fails in Head, Neck Cancer Study</HD>
<DH>Health: Erbitux did not benefit ailing patients. The firm
still hopes to sway the FDA with more colon cancer research.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>ImClone Systems Inc.'s Erbitux drug, stalled by regulators' refusal
to review research on its use in colon cancer, failed in a separate
study to show benefit in patients with head-and-neck cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Erbitux failed to slow the disease or prolong patients' lives in
the study of 123 patients with head-and-neck cancer. Though more
patients getting Erbitux with chemotherapy responded to treatment,
they didn't fare better over time than patients who received
chemotherapy along with a placebo drug.</LD>
<LD>   "You'd have to say this study failed," said Barbara Burtness, a
cancer specialist from the Yale University School of Medicine who
presented the research at the annual meeting of the American Society
for Clinical Oncology.</LD>
<TE>   ImClone shares have lost three-quarters of their value since the
Food and Drug Administration refused in December to consider Erbitux.
ImClone still hopes to sway the FDA with additional colon cancer
data, and strong results in the head-and-neck cancer study might have
bolstered investor confidence in the drug's prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a setback. I certainly think it is going to make
people wonder, because it appears that there has been more negative
data than positive" on Erbitux at the meeting, said Michael King, a
biotechnology analyst at Robertson Stephens.</TE>
<TE>   The disappointing results from the study, by the independent
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, represent the second setback in
less than a week for ImClone's efforts to get its drug approved.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, ImClone's partner, Merck &amp; Co., said it wouldn't
expand colon cancer studies that ImClone was counting on to help
persuade the FDA to approve Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   Merck, which holds rights to Erbitux outside the United States,
said it still plans to make its Erbitux research available to ImClone
but has decided against expanding its studies to satisfy the FDA's
request, adding to concerns about further delays. ImClone shares fell
13% on the news.</TE>

<HD>Deal Seals Star's Power</HD>
<DH>Talent agency CAA has picked up Lara Croft, a virtual
heroine who is a real revenue generator</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The signature brown boots, bobby socks and pistols of Lara Croft have
inspired fans to write thousands of letters, build Web sites in her
honor, write books about her, tattoo her image on their bodies and
even propose marriage to her.</LD>
<LD>   She's the star of five video games, a comic book series and an
eponymous Hollywood film. In all, products bearing her name have
generated close to $1.2 billion in revenue over the last six years.</LD>
<LD>   Croft, of course, isn't real--she's just a character in a video
game. But she has become such a real-world star that today she will
become the first virtual female actress to be represented by a major
Hollywood talent agency, Creative Artists Agency, which also
represents Jennifer Aniston, Beyonce Knowles, Carrie Fisher, Geena
Davis and Sally Field.</LD>
<TE>   In many eyes, the move marks Croft's emergence as the preeminent
female action heroine, even if she is only a digital illusion. It
will be up to CAA to exploit that title by spreading the Croft name
to toys, product endorsements and new movies.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the Croft franchise is through game sales, which have
generated $700 million since the character's 1996 debut in the
classic "Tomb Raider" video game for Sony Corp.'s original
PlayStation console. Her movie last year, "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"
starring Angelina Jolie, has brought in an additional $300million.</TE>
<TE>   But most celebrities would love to break into the lucrative
advertising and action figure markets, both of which have yielded a
relatively paltry $15 million for British game publisher Eidos.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about everything from TV to live events and
experiences that Lara fans can participate in, even getting into
things like adventure travel," said Elie Dekel, a CAA agent.</TE>
<TE>   The emergence of a virtual star has been long anticipated by
entertainment gurus. But it has taken decades since the coining of
the term "synthespian" for a character to emerge with just the right
star qualities to appeal to the masses.</TE>
<TE>   Croft seems to pack just the right punch with consumers,
underscoring the growing influence of computer games over the
public's imagination. That star power has allowed Croft to make the
pioneering leap from games to movies.</TE>
<TE>   The reverse has been easy, with hundreds of games spawning from
film and television shows, including "Spider-Man," "SpongeBob
SquarePants," "Shrek" and "Monsters, Inc."</TE>
<TE>   But games in the past have fallen flat transitioning from the
little screen to the big screen. Many cite "Super Mario Bros.," which
cost $42 million to make but took in only $21 million. Or "Wing
Commander," which cost $27 million but made just $12 million.</TE>
<TE>   The latest example was last year's attempt to turn the popular
"Final Fantasy" game series into a movie, starring virtual actress
Aki Ross, a hyper-realistic computer-made character. Her creators at
Square Co. in Japan talked about casting her in other movies, perhaps
even alongside live actors. But the movie, which cost $137million to
produce, foundered at the box office, taking in just $61million in
theaters and ending Ross' would-be career.</TE>
<TE>   "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider," in contrast, took in roughly four times
the amount it cost to make the film.</TE>
<TE>   Why is Croft different?</TE>
<TE>   The answer that most immediately comes to mind for gamers is sex
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's her breasts," said George Jones, editor of Gamers.com, a
Ziff-Davis Web site for game industry news. "She's ridiculously huge.
And I say that only half-jokingly. No matter what, you can't get
around her looks. She has exaggerated proportions. She's a sex
symbol. That's always the first thing anybody notices."</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Smith, a director at Eidos subsidiary Core Design Ltd.,
which created Croft, said her looks have to do with the fact that she
started as a cartoon.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why she has a tiny waist, so you notice her figure and how
she moves," Smith said. "If we drew Lara with normal-sized breasts,
no one would notice them. Mickey Mouse has big ears so you would
notice them. It's as simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   It's not just pumped-up polygons, according to Croft's handlers.
Most female video game characters have impossibly busty figures, but
none sells as many games as Croft, with 28 million copies worldwide
so far.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a complexity to her character that you don't get with
other video game characters," said Lloyd Levin, producer of the "Lara
Croft: Tomb Raider" film. "She's got a lot of attitude. She's witty
and wicked. There's something punk about her. Those are very
appealing qualities but also very specific qualities. There's nothing
generic about Lara. She's bigger than life and yet very human."</TE>
<TE>   As a modern-day action hero, Croft occupies a genre dominated by
muscle-bound men. Few females can vault to fame as a title character.</TE>
<TE>   Though the television show "Xena: Warrior Princess" has had a
loyal following, many didn't see Xena as mainstream movie material.
And some point out that the lead character of "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer" was more camp than class. Even the main character Ellen
Ripley of the "Alien" series of films took second billing to the
alien.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a widely held belief that there isn't an audience for
female action heroes," Levin said. "Our feeling was that no one had
one that was any good. We just hopped aboard the right formula with
Lara."</TE>
<TE>   That, coincidentally, was the same concern Core Design had when it
came up with a female character in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "We made this list of attributes we wanted the character to have,"
Smith said. "We wanted the character to be identifiable, be athletic,
have charisma. And we wanted people to actually feel for the
character. Everything pointed to a female character."</TE>
<TE>   Core Design ended up with "Tomb Raider," which Smith said "just
happened to have this amazing character."</TE>
<TE>   "Over time, we saw her become larger than the game," he said.
"People started asking all kinds of questions about her as if she
were a celebrity. It scared us a little. To us, she was just a
cartoon. We never thought consumers would take to her as much as they
have."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the movie may have been a one-hit wonder, and Croft may
sink back into the video game realm. Levin and Eidos are betting
otherwise. There are plans for movie and game sequels. Jolie has been
adamant about continuing her role as the big-screen Croft.</TE>
<TE>   "Angelina likes the character a great deal," Levin said. "With
Angelina, there's barely a fine line between her and Lara. She's
become so possessive of the character."</TE>

<HD>MBA Students Seek Jobs in Tight Market as Graduation Comes
Near</HD>
<DH>Employment: Many soon-to-be graduates are struggling to
find work, experiencing the effect of a weakened economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ WILLEN</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Less than two weeks before graduation, MBA student Cenzig Bayazit had
a new baby, about $60,000 in student loans and no job.</LD>
<LD>   Bayazit, 29, entered New York University's Leonard N. Stern School
of Business two years ago to seek a master's degree in business
administration and expected a future of stock options, a signing
bonus and tuition reimbursement.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought I'd be sought after and marketable, but now I'm just
frustrated," said Bayazit, a former construction engineer who has
sent out hundreds of resumes and had dozens of interviews for
corporate finance jobs. "The pressure I am feeling is intense."</LD>
<TE>   Bayazit and many other students who will receive MBAs in the next
few weeks are experiencing the effect of a weakened U.S. economy,
including Wall Street cuts totaling more than 40,000 jobs in the last
year and retrenchment at banks and securities and consulting firms,
career placement officers and recruiters said.</TE>
<TE>   "A few years ago there was such competition for top MBA talent we
had clients asking, 'Do we need to put in a cappuccino bar?'" said
Maury Hanigan, whose New York firm, Hanigan Consulting Group, assists
Fortune 500 companies with campus recruiting.</TE>
<TE>   Such perks were part of the late 1990s, when jobs were plentiful
in the dot-com sector and MBAs commanded average starting salaries of
$75,900, along with $8,400 in signing bonuses and company cars and
cell phones, according to a survey by Business Week magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "MBAs used to have six or seven different offers by graduation,
now they are delighted to receive one," Hanigan said.</TE>
<TE>   The Graduate Management Admission Council, a nonprofit group that
represents graduate schools of business, said 26% of the class of
2002 has a job offer so far, according to a survey of 113 business
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sending resumes, checking Web sites, cold calling and
checking the school listings every single day," said Uri Zarnitzky, a
29-year-old MBA student at New York University. "For me, finding a
job is my full-time job."</TE>
<TE>   At New York's Columbia University, about 30% of the 750 MBA
students don't have offers, said Regina Resnick, assistant dean for
career services. Last year, the figure was 15% to 20%, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a tough year, between the recession, Enron and job
cuts," Resnick said. "Our students have really worked hard at doing
outreach with alumni and other resources, and are looking at small to
mid-sized firms."</TE>
<TE>   Some students are landing jobs after completing summer
internships. Among them is John Bennett, 30, a former accountant who
was an intern at Lehman Bros. last summer and will become an
associate investment banker there.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked hard, and I feel absolutely fortunate to have this job
because so many of my classmates are still struggling," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is harder to find employment, MBA programs report
enrollment increases for the semester that starts in September.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-four percent of full-time MBA programs that responded to a
survey by the Graduate Management Admission Council reported
applications were up at least 21% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard Business School received 10,000 applications for 880
spots, compared with 8,893 for the class of 2001, said Maura
O'Sullivan, associate director of communications.</TE>
<TE>   At Columbia, applications for 450 spots increased 27% compared
with last year, said Maria Graham, associate director of public
affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Kwartler, editor of the MBA Newsletter in Floral Park, N.Y.,
said the master's degree "has shown to have amazing resiliency. It
has always been this magical thing, where they have layoffs on three
floors and hire MBAs for the fourth."</TE>
<TE>   Fraser of NYU said MBA students in New York have the advantage of
proximity to alumni contacts in the financial district and strong
relationships between their schools and Wall Street firms.</TE>
<TE>   None of that assuaged Bayazit's apprehension.</TE>
<TE>   "People say my experience and my degree is a great combination,
but no one has given me a job," he said.</TE>

<HD>Miramax, TF1 Co-Star in New Film Venture</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Deal gives Disney-owned producer a foothold
in one of Europe's biggest movie markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CANNES, France</DL>
<LD>The European film industry gained a new heavyweight over the weekend
as U.S. producer Miramax joined forces with French broadcaster TF1 in
a venture the U.S. company said could spark further movie marriages
across Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Walt Disney Co.-owned Miramax, which backed blockbusters such as
"Shakespeare in Love" and "Life Is Beautiful," said it would produce
and finance European films with TF1 and set up a joint company to
distribute their movies in France.</LD>
<LD>   "It's certainly possible this could lead to similar deals across
Europe. Right now we're concentrating on this venture ... it's very
important that it succeeds," said Rick Sands, Miramax's worldwide
distribution chairman.</LD>
<TE>   The venture, which will rival Vivendi Universal's French arm Canal
Plus, will kick off with a remake of last year's French hit "Tanguy."
Films slated for the first year include Italian-language drama "The
Gate of Heaven" and the war movie "Colditz."</TE>
<TE>   The distribution venture will promote films from Paris-based TF1,
New York-based Miramax, Miramax's sister company Dimension and
possible third-party producers.</TE>
<TE>   Director Steven Soderbergh's "Full Frontal" is among upcoming
releases to be promoted under the deal. However, it will not include
Miramax's big release this year, Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New
York" with Leonardo DiCaprio.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about bringing more Hollywood movies on to the French
market. This is mainly about finding new European talent and
developing that talent for international appeal," TF1 International
Chief Executive Didier Sapaut said.</TE>
<TE>   The venture takes TF1 closer to its goal of creating a major
European player along the lines of the big Hollywood studios and
filling TF1's hole in distribution.</TE>
<TE>   TF1 owns France's leading commercial TV channel as well as a film
production company.</TE>
<TE>   It also hands Miramax a foothold in one of Europe's biggest
markets. Miramax has a strong tradition in non-English-language film
and was behind the U.S. success of French film "Amelie."</TE>
<TE>   However, the new European player had several competitors running
for cover.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry executives fear it could fill French movie screens
with television-quality productions given TF1's background in
television.</TE>
<TE>   But others welcomed a strong player in distribution as the cost of
marketing films rockets.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating criticism that the venture may further Americanize
the French film industry, Miramax stressed the "Frenchness" of the
project.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be staffed by French and run by French," Sands said.</TE>

<HD>Motorola to Offer Classic Games on Cell Phones</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>If "Metal Gear Solid" is too edgy for your tastes in video games, let
Motorola Inc. take you back to a more innocent age.</LD>
<LD>   Chicago area-based Motorola, the No. 2 maker of wireless
telephones, said it has signed a global distribution deal with
Manchester, England-based IFone to add such classic Atari games as
"Pong," "Centipede" and "Asteroids" to its cell phones.</LD>
<LD>   "Atari games are known and loved by players of all ages," said
Juan Montes, vice president of technology and content solutions at
Motorola's handset unit in Europe.</LD>
<TE>   IFone's Atari game catalog can be downloaded initially to
Motorola's V60i and V66i phones starting next month in a trial launch
with some European wireless carriers, a Motorola spokesman said. The
games will be available in the fourth quarter on Motorola's color
screen handset, the A720.</TE>
<TE>   Some Motorola phones with embedded games will be available later
in the year, and the trial will be expanded to other wireless
operators around the world, including the United States, within three
months after the initial launch, the spokesman said. Terms of the
deal were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   IFone, backed by technology investment firm Marlborough Holdings,
is an entertainment content provider for mobile phones and wireless
devices. It is a partner of Infogrames Entertainment, the publisher
of Atari games.</TE>

<HD>Nintendo Set to Cut GameCube Price 25%</HD>
<DH>Tech: Console maker seeks to regain its cost advantage
after Sony and Microsoft discounted their machines last week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nintendo Co. plans to announce today that it is dropping the price of
its GameCube console, ratcheting up the stakes in the intensely
competitive $27-billion global game market.</LD>
<LD>   The 25% price cut to $149.95 to take effect Tuesday comes a week
after Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. both sliced their console prices
by one-third to $199.99.</LD>
<LD>   Had Nintendo not reacted, it would have lost the price advantage
that helped propel sales of GameCube since its U.S. launch in
November.</LD>
<TE>   "This is pricing to win," said Perrin Kaplan, a Nintendo
spokeswoman. "Consumers win, and we win. This will keep us ahead of
everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Nintendo has sold 400,000 GameCubes in Europe since introducing
the console there May 3 at 199 euros, compared with the 299-euro
retail price of Sony's PlayStation2 and Microsoft's Xbox.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft also began selling the Xbox in November before
introducing the device in Europe and Japan this year. Sony introduced
the PS2 in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Console companies typically don't make money on their hardware; in
fact, most lose money selling consoles. They make up for it by
collecting royalties on games sold for their devices, creating an
incentive to get as many consoles into consumers' hands as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Sony estimates that it has shipped 30 million PS2s worldwide;
Nintendo has shipped 4.5 million GameCubes. Microsoft estimates that
it will have shipped 3.5 million to 4 million consoles by the end of
next month.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of software are expected to take off as more consumers buy
consoles.</TE>
<TE>   "The real sweet spot for the software industry will be holiday
2002 to holiday 2004," said Brian Farrell, chief executive of game
publisher THQ Inc. in Calabasas.</TE>

<HD>Ford to Outline Management Changes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. plans to announce a new round of high-level management
changes as soon as today as part of the auto maker's turnaround
effort, according to published reports.</LD>
<LD>   Ford is expected to announce that Allan Gilmour, 67, a retired
Ford vice chairman, is returning to his former job as Ford's chief
financial officer, according to the Detroit Free Press and the
Detroit News.</LD>
<LD>   Martin Inglis, chief financial officer since July, is to shift to
a corporate strategy position and report to Gilmour, the News
reported Sunday. Ford of Europe Chairman David Thursfield, 57, will
become group vice president, international operations, and head of
global purchasing.</LD>
<TE>   Ford spokesman Nick Sharkey said the company did not have anything
to announce Sunday, and declined to confirm whether an announcement
would come today.</TE>
<TE>   The changes, four months into the company's restructuring, would
solidify Chairman William Clay Ford Jr.'s management team and place
Thursfield in line to eventually succeed Nick Scheele as president
and chief operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   Ford announced a restructuring plan in January that calls for
closing at least five plants and reducing its work force by 35,000
employees. The company is focusing on a "back-to-basics" strategy to
revitalize its business.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's management reshuffling began with the ouster in October of
Jacques Nasser as chief executive. Ford promoted Scheele, 58, to the
company's No. 2 position and coaxed Carl Reichardt, 70, out of
retirement to oversee the company's financial affairs as vice
chairman.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jump in April retail sales last week helped spark a buying spree,
but a rise in weekly jobless claims and a drop in housing starts
helped temper investor enthusiasm. This week's economic data are not
expected to move the market dramatically and may fail to answer
questions about the economy.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the economic data is going to continue to be mixed to
positive," said Gary Wedbush, head of trading at regional investment
bank Wedbush Morgan.</LD>
<LD>   The index of leading economic indicators is set for release today.
Wall Street economists expect the index to have dipped 0.2% in April
after a rise of 0.1% in March.</LD>
<TE>   A revised estimate of gross domestic product, which measures the
value of goods and services produced within U.S. borders, is expected
to show an annual growth rate of 6% in the first quarter Friday.
Advance numbers had shown that the GDP raced ahead at an annual rate
of 5.8% in the first three months of this year, marking the biggest
GDP gain since an 8.3% jump in the final quarter of 1999. Economists,
however, doubt the economy can maintain that pace through the year.</TE>
<TE>   A report on durable goods due Thursday is forecast to show April
orders rose 0.4% after declining 0.5% in March. New-home sales,
slated for release Friday, are forecast to edge up to 882,000 in
April from 878,000 in March.</TE>

<HD>Eateries to Pull Chilean Sea Bass From Menus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 90 restaurants in Los Angeles and Orange counties are
expected to pledge to yank Chilean sea bass from their menus in an
effort to save the fish from overfishing and possible extinction.</LD>
<LD>   The move, to be announced Tuesday, joins similar pledges made by
chefs in Northern California, Chicago and Houston. The "Take a Pass
on Chilean Sea Bass" campaign is expected to spread to New York,
Philadelphia and Washington in coming months.</LD>
<LD>   The fish became a darling of the seafood industry about a decade
ago, after marketers changed its name from Patagonian toothfish. Bon
Appetit magazine named it "Dish of the Year" in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   With its newfound popularity, the fish's ranks in the southern
oceans quickly shrank. The fish can take 10 years to grow to sexual
maturity and can live to 40. That makes it vulnerable to overfishing,
especially by poachers.</TE>
<TE>   The Monterey Bay Aquarium, which has the fish on its "avoid" list,
estimates the illegal catch of the fish in 1998 was 10 times the size
of the legal haul. Advocates warn current fishing levels could spell
extinction for the fish in as little as five years.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Cimarusti, executive chef at the Water Grill in downtown
Los Angeles, said once diners are educated on how imperiled the
Chilean sea bass is, they will choose other fish as substitutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Most consumers wouldn't go out and buy California condor on a
menu if they saw it," said Cimarusti, referring to the endangered
bird. "If people knew that [Chilean sea bass] was in a similar state
of peril, they would lay off it."</TE>
<TE>   Chefs will gather Tuesday at the Water Grill to announce they will
stop serving Chilean sea bass until regulations are in place to
prevent its extinction. They are expected to display substitutes for
the fish, which is praised for its white, flaky meat. Cimarusti
recommends striped bass, Alaskan halibut or mahi mahi.</TE>

<HD>Internet Radio Stations Await Royalties Ruling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a ruling that could make or break the Internet radio industry, a
federal official is expected this week to decide how much online
broadcasters must pay record labels and recording artists for the
songs they transmit over the Web.</LD>
<LD>   The Librarian of Congress has spent the last three months
reviewing a federal arbitration panel's proposed royalties, which
critics say are high enough to silence most free Web radio stations.
The panel recommended charging commercial Internet-only stations 14
cents a song and over-the-air stations 7 cents a song if they
"simulcast" their programs on the Web.</LD>
<LD>   Those fees must be paid for each person who tunes into a Webcast,
which means a Web-only station broadcasting 15 songs an hour would
owe more than $180 per listener per year. For a popular outlet such
as KNAC, the highest-rated Internet-only station in a recent survey
by MeasureCast Inc., the annual bill would be about $100,000.</LD>
<TE>   Webcasters and over-the-air stations have urged lawmakers to
pressure the librarian to reject the panel's proposal in favor of
lower royalties. In particular, they want to have the option of
paying a percentage of their Webcasting revenues in lieu of a fixed
fee per song, which would be a huge break for small stations and
hobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   The Recording Industry Assn. of America and several musicians'
groups eventually responded with their own lobbying campaign, urging
lawmakers to support the panel's proposal. They argued that
Webcasters who build their business around music have a duty to pay a
fair royalty to artists and copyright holders, without whom the
Webcasters couldn't attract an audience.</TE>
<TE>   The deadline for the librarian's ruling is Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>SoBe Takes Aim at Rivals in First TV Ads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beverage maker SoBe, trying to move the brand beyond its underground
following to the mass market, is launching its first television ad
campaign with a promise that its funky-flavored tea and juice drinks
will make you cool.</LD>
<LD>   The commercial shows a teenage "wannabe" drawn to SoBe by three
alternative sports stars. Lacking the necessary hipness, he is unable
to open the cooler where drinks are stashed.</LD>
<LD>   SoBe, founded in 1996 and now a unit of PepsiCo Inc.'s Pepsi-Cola
North America, gained an underground following through sponsorships
of sports such as mountain biking and skateboarding but now is
looking to television as it seeks to appeal to mainstream consumers.</LD>
<TE>   The first spot also takes direct aim at a much larger rival,
Snapple. The teenager forsakes the Snapple Iced Tea he holds when he
is lured by the athletes' choice of SoBe.</TE>
<TE>   Snapple, which began as a local brand in 1972 before being scooped
up by larger competitors, is owned by Cadbury Schweppes.</TE>
<TE>   Marketing experts said trying to bring an underground drink to the
masses has its risks.</TE>
<TE>   "Core users of a cult brand don't necessarily like to share it
with the world," said Mark DiMassimo of DiMassimo Brand Advertising.
"Look at Krispy Kreme and Ben &amp; Jerry's: Companies that grow from a
cult following almost never use advertising in the traditional
sense."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, one of the few success stories in bringing an
underground brand to a broader range of consumers is Snapple itself.</TE>
<TE>   Before the SoBe commercial, which debuts today and will appear on
cable networks such as MTV and ESPN, SoBe concentrated on grass-roots
and so-called guerrilla marketing efforts such as handing out samples
at sporting events.</TE>
<TE>   SoBe Chief Executive John Bello said the company will spend
$6million to $10 million over four months to air the ads.</TE>

<HD>Teamster Vote Results to Be Announced Today</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The results of a Teamster vote whether to strike if contract
negotiations fail with United Parcel Service Inc. will be announced
today.</LD>
<LD>   A two-week strike by 185,000 Teamsters in 1997 cost the company
millions of dollars, crippling the Atlanta-based package delivery
giant. The five-year contract that was reached expires July 31.</LD>
<LD>   Union members voted by secret ballot over the weekend at every
Teamsters UPS local in the country.</LD>
<TE>   "For a company that says it wants an early agreement, negotiations
sure are moving slowly," Teamsters President James P. Hoffa said. "It
is time to jump-start negotiations. It is time to get down to
business." UPS spokesman Norman Black said the company "is committed
to reaching an agreement as soon as practical to protect UPS volume,
preserve Teamster jobs and allow UPS to provide the reliable service
its customers expect."</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations resume this week in Chicago.</TE>

<HD>Minnesota Governor Weighs Internet Controls</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minnesota's Senate and House overwhelmingly approved a bill that
backers say would make the state the first to give Internet users
control over whether service providers disclose their personal
information.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Jesse Ventura will decide its fate. He has not indicated a
position on the bill.</LD>
<LD>   Under the bill, ISPs would have to tell Minnesota consumers
whenever they plan to disclose such personal information about them
as which Web sites they've visited, their e-mail or home addresses or
telephone numbers. They also would have to say how the information
would be used.</LD>
<TE>   The bill would allow consumers to sue businesses that violate the
law, with exceptions for giving information to law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Lobbyists from America Online and other Internet giants fought the
bill, saying state-by-state regulation of the Internet is unwieldy.
The bill wouldn't take effect until March 2003, and any federal law
would supersede it.</TE>

<HD>Senators to Battle Over Accounting</HD>
<DH>Reform: Industry is backing a GOP proposal for
consideration by banking committee, while critics are behind a
measure by Democrats seeking tougher changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A battle over accounting industry reform is building in the Senate
Banking Committee, which on Tuesday will consider a Democratic plan
that restricts consulting work by accounting firms and a rival
Republican measure that is backed by the industry.</LD>
<LD>   Critics of the accounting industry, which has suffered from a
series of scandals after Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy last year, are
backing legislation by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), chairman of the
Senate panel.</LD>
<LD>   Sarbanes' bill calls for creation of a Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board that would report to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and oversee auditors of public companies.</LD>
<TE>   The measure would restrict consulting work by accounting firms to
eliminate a perceived conflict of interest. Sarbanes and others fear
that lucrative consulting fees make accountants reluctant to
challenge clients over questionable financial maneuvers.</TE>
<TE>   The Sarbanes proposal also would penalize chief executives and
chief financial officers if a company reissues financial statements
because it failed to comply with securities laws. These corporate
officers would be forced to forfeit profit and bonuses earned in the
year before any restatement.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the Sarbanes measure calls for rotating lead
partners on audits every five years to help preserve the independence
of the relationship. It also makes companies wait at least a year
from the completion of their audit before hiring one of their outside
accountants for a company job.</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes' bill "could result in serious, harmful consequences for
capital markets and American business," said the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants, the industry lobbying group. "The
draft legislation would add unnecessary and nonproductive costs to
businesses and impose a duplicative regulatory burden."</TE>
<TE>   The group claimed last week that Sarbanes' legislation "would
result in a de facto government takeover of the accounting
profession" and urged members to contact their senators to oppose it.</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes and the other Democrats have a one-vote majority on the
21-member committee.</TE>
<TE>   The accountants group noted that Senate Banking members Mike Enzi
(R-Wyo.) and Phil Gramm (R-Texas) have offered an alternative plan,
which, "as currently drafted, is less intrusive on the profession and
the business community, while still providing significant and
effective oversight to prevent future business failures."</TE>
<TE>   The Enzi-Gramm measure creates a Professional Standards Board with
fewer powers than the Sarbanes bill envisions. It does not restrict
consulting work, force the rotation of lead partners on audits or
restrict companies from hiring their outside accountants.</TE>
<TE>   Calls for accounting reform were triggered by the disclosure of
Enron's accounting irregularities and its Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.
Critics say Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, failed to blow the
whistle on questionable financial maneuvers, demonstrating how
accountants had become too cozy with clients.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure for reform intensified as accounting irregularities
surfaced in other energy businesses and industries, including
telecommunications, software and cable television.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is whether you want real reform or weak reform," said
former U.S. Comptroller Gen. Charles Bowsher, who served on a panel
led by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker that attempted
to rescue Andersen and transform it into an audit-only accounting
firm.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a classic case of how the accounting profession in recent
years has wanted the least reform that they could get away with,"
said Bowsher, who also was chairman of the accounting profession's
disbanded Public Oversight Board.</TE>
<TE>   After some initial worries that a groundswell of support for
reform might overtake Congress, the chief lobbyist for the
accountants group now predicts that lawmakers will take a more
cautious approach.</TE>
<TE>   "These things don't lend themselves to simple solutions," said
John E. Hunnicutt, who heads the Washington office of the accountants
group and helped defeat an earlier attempt by former SEC Chairman
Arthur Levitt to restrict consulting work by auditing firms. "Once
the excitement and the glares fade, people really start to think
about it."</TE>
<TE>   The trade group has hired former Republican congressman Vin Weber,
now of management consulting firm Clark &amp; Weinstock, and Weiser Group
Inc. to help it lobby Capitol Hill and launch a public relations
campaign to stave off reforms it considers overly burdensome.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the group sent out thousands of "action alerts" to
members, urging them to voice their opposition to proposals to limit
consulting services.</TE>
<TE>   Bowsher said he was concerned that Sarbanes' proposal could be
derailed by Gramm, the ranking Republican on the committee and
husband of Wendy Gramm, who sat on the Enron board while the company
inflated profit through off-the-books partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Bowsher's concern was shared by Lynn Turner, former chief
accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission, who heads the
Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University.</TE>
<TE>   Turner noted that Enron's collapse caused huge losses to investors
and workers.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unfortunate that Sen. Gramm, with his close ties to Enron
and the administration, has chosen to vehemently oppose Sarbanes'
efforts to reform the markets and provide investors a reasonable
degree of protection," Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   Gramm aides did not return calls seeking comment. W. Neil
Eggleston, an attorney for Wendy Gramm, said she had not discussed
the legislation with the senator.</TE>
<TE>   "That is his business, not hers," Eggleston said.</TE>
<TE>   Bowsher believes that if Sarbanes is unable to get his legislation
out of the panel soon, the prospects for its success diminish because
Congress will become more distracted by the Nov. 5 elections.</TE>
<TE>   And anything that comes out of the Senate will have to be
reconciled in conference with legislation proposed by Rep. Michael G.
Oxley (R-Ohio) that passed earlier this year. Turner and other
critics of the accounting industry said Oxley's bill is weaker than
Sarbanes'.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Volcker and Bowsher, the Sarbanes bill has the
support of several accounting industry veterans aligned with
Volcker's failed efforts to save Andersen, including C. Michael Cook,
former chief executive of Deloitte &amp; Touche, and Russell E. Palmer,
former managing partner of Touche Ross before its merger with
Deloitte.</TE>

peer groups to share their business experiences and help one another
solve problems in a round-table session. The following question and
answer are a summary of a discussion at a recent TEC meeting in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Question: I own a small computer consulting services company that
does about $5 million in business a year and has 25 employees. After
10 years of slow but consistent growth, I want to double revenue in
the next three years. The market appears to be wide open, but I'm not
sure how to go about implementing such rapid growth. Any suggestions?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The first question that comes to mind is: Why the sudden
urge to double in size?</LD>
<TE>   Have you grown bored with the business? Has a market opportunity
suddenly presented itself? Are you looking to get big enough to
acquire a competitor? Do you intend to build sales to a certain level
and then cash out?</TE>
<TE>   These are not rhetorical questions. The reasoning behind your
desire for rapid growth will play a large role in determining how you
go about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Beware of growth for growth's sake, especially when looking at
30% to 40% a year," cautioned Bob Dabic, chief executive of
DabiCoaching in Newport Beach. "Growth is a means to an end, not a
goal unto itself. Unless you have a good reason for pursuing such a
blistering pace and a sound strategy for getting there, you can
easily cause more problems than your firm can handle."</TE>
<TE>   That said, there are many ways to go about exploring the potential
for rapid growth.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Driscol, president of Thermal-Vac Technology Inc. in Orange,
recommended starting with some in-depth market research to determine
the extent of your opportunities. In particular, take a hard look at
your closest competitors and try to identify any weaknesses that you
can take advantage of to increase sales. Once you have your arms
around the market, bring your management team together for some
serious strategic planning.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of small companies come by their growth haphazardly, which
is OK as long as the growth doesn't get out of hand," Driscol said.
However, if you intend to double your company in three years, you'd
better have a road map for how to get there. That involves sitting
down with the powers that be in your company and crafting a formal
strategic plan that has a defined marketing strategy built into it.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is your first cut at strategic planning, I'd also
recommend using an outside consultant to facilitate the process.
Either way, without a plan to guide you, your quest for rapid growth
could easily end up in disaster."</TE>
<TE>   David La Montagne, president of Vessel Assist Assn. of America
Inc. in Newport Beach, agreed that you need a strategic planning
session. He also said it should include an internal analysis of your
marketing processes.</TE>
<TE>   "Take a look at how you currently go about acquiring new
business," he said. "Who has responsibility for bringing in new
accounts and how much time do they spend doing it? Can your people
and infrastructure support twice the amount of sales? If not, what
capabilities and resources will you need to bring on board in order
to do so?</TE>
<TE>   "If your current staff is tapped out, there are several ways to
expand. You can hire an outside marketing firm to drum up new
business. Or you can hire more staff to service your existing
accounts, thereby freeing up your 'hunters' to spend more time
looking for new accounts. Another option might be to use
telemarketing to flush out [deals with] potential customers, which
your inside sales team could then close. All this assumes, of course,
that you have the capital to fund these kinds of initiatives."</TE>
<TE>   Another, riskier option involves growing through acquisition. You
also might consider forming alliances with companies that provide
ancillary products to your market.</TE>
<TE>   "There are plenty of small firms in the computer consulting
industry, some of which may be ripe for acquisition," said Karen
Good, president of Irvine-based EDP Systems Inc. "Finding one that
complements your strengths can give you a built-in employee base as
well as a new book of business."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Good said, you might consider expanding your
product offerings by allying with one of the big software companies.
"Set yourself up as a territorial reseller or tech-support facility
for them so that they not only provide leads but give you additional
products to sell to existing customers."</TE>
<TE>   When all else fails, study those that have gone before you.
Identify one or two companies that already have become the size you
would like to be and find out how they got there. Use them as role
models and sources of best practices for your own organization. If
you want to become a larger company, start thinking and acting like
one.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Russian and international music industry leaders are joining forces
to fight piracy of compact discs in Russia that is costing companies
hundreds of millions of dollars every year.</LD>
<LD>   "The piracy situation here is both frightening and daunting," said
John Kennedy, president of Universal Music International. Slack
enforcement of copyright laws, he added, has made Russia one of the
world's major music pirating centers.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy said illegal CD factories that operate in Russia crank out
millions of cheap knockoffs that are sold openly across the country.
Russia's music piracy business is worth $240 million a year, making
it second only to China, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy and other members of the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry are teaming up with a newly formed Russian
industry group to promote tougher enforcement of copyright laws.</TE>
<TE>   Both groups said the first step is to close down illegal CD
factories.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Handspring Inc., a maker of hand-held computers, lowered the price on
each of its black-and-white screen Visor models, seeking to boost
sales and compete with rivals Palm Inc. and Sony Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The computer maker cut the price of the Visor Neo, its least
expensive model, by $20 to $149, matching the price of Palm's m105
computer. Handspring dropped the price of the Visor Edge by $30 to
$169 and the Visor Pro by $30 to $199, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of hand-held computers made by Handspring and Palm dropped
last quarter as the companies cut prices and consumers scaled back
spending on the electronic organizers. Handspring earlier this month
offered $100 rebates for owners of hand-helds who purchased a Treo,
an organizer that doubles as a cellular phone.</LD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dell Computer Corp., the second-largest personal-computer maker, has
introduced a portable movie projector and an improved line of network
servers to combat falling PC sales.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Michael Dell told analysts in April that the
projector market may be valued at $6billion a year.</LD>
<LD>   The company is broadening its product mix after industrywide PC
sales fell in 2001 for the first time in 15 years.</LD>
<TE>   Projectors and servers sell for more than the average $1,675 cost
of a Dell computer.</TE>
<TE>   The $2,499 projector weighs 3.5pounds and plugs into a PC, laptop
computer, video-cassette recorder or high-definition television to
display slides or videos. The device can display an image as big as
294 inches measured diagonally, or almost five times bigger than the
biggest home TVs.</TE>
<TE>   Dell's PowerEdge 2650 server for businesses uses an Intel Corp.
Xeon processor and starts at $2,399, senior project manager Darrell
Ward said. The server, which stores and delivers data to other
computers on a network, can use several operating systems, such as
Linux or Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 2000.</TE>

<HD>Making a Digital Government</HD>
<DH>Lawrence Brandt's latest job is to get federal agencies to
share technology and information.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawrence Brandt still remembers the day, nearly a decade ago, when he
approached a team of University of Illinois students who were working
on a software project called Mosaic. The technology offered a
revolutionary idea in networked computing--the ability to surf a
collection of multimedia images and text stored on remote computers.</LD>
<LD>   Mosaic made the World Wide Web easy to use and ultimately drew
millions of people onto the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Brandt, then a manager with the National Science Foundation,
understood that government needed to get on board. Pulling together
some grant money for the young developers, Brandt helped coordinate a
consortium of government agencies to fund this and other projects
evolving out of some of the nation's super computer centers.</LD>
<TE>   Among the early recipients: Marc Andreessen, who created Mosaic
and later co-founded Netscape Communications Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "I funded Marc for $5 an hour," said Brandt, now the program
director of the Digital Government project, an NSF initiative to
forge ties between private research and public agencies. "I should
have had him pay us in stock."</TE>
<TE>   Brandt has a knack for spotting early-stage technologies that
matter. Over the years, the small cluster of grants funneled to
computer researchers has grown to a comfortable $10 million a year,
all geared toward finding new ways to bring government into the
digital age.</TE>
<TE>   This week, more than 200 information technology researchers and
software engineers involved in the program will gather in Redondo
Beach to demonstrate prototype systems that promise to streamline
government processes.</TE>
<TE>   Some will succeed. Others, acknowledged Brandt, will fail. Either
way, the dream of a truly electronic government has a long way to go.</TE>
<TE>   "A failure means you learn you can't proceed in a certain
direction," Brandt said. "In government, it's sometimes more
important to avoid making a mistake than it is to make a home run."</TE>
<TE>   Question: Why has government been so slow to get on the high-tech
bandwagon?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: It's very careful and risk averse. In business, if you
drop $500 million on a failed technology project, you don't hear
about it. In government, it lands you on the front page of the
newspapers and launches congressional hearings.</TE>
<TE>   It's also a cultural thing. People in government want to make sure
they do the right thing for the public, but there's no clear bottom
line. In business, the goal is profitability. In government, you
don't have that.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is there are so many pushes and pulls in
government. There's Congress looking over their shoulder and wanting
one thing. Then, citizens want another. Many citizens don't
appreciate what government agencies do. Most of what they do is
invisible, and that's the way it should be.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's the goal of the NSF's Digital Government initiative?</TE>
<TE>   A: The NSF focuses on long-term research and education in all
science and engineering disciplines. The goal is to increase our
understanding of subjects, even if the research may seem archaic or
"out there." Even if a project fails, there is still some sense of
success because others won't follow the same path and make the same
mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   If a project is a success, it may not be clear why the research
matters right now. But it will. In many cases, the practical uses
that result from scientific understandings were not apparent at the
time the work was being done.</TE>
<TE>   We focus on practical uses. We're funding the academic side of
this thing, so that the research community has a chance to work on
projects and deal with a scale and type of data they usually wouldn't
have access to. These are important problems, some that may not have
occurred to them before. We all need practical solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are some of the key hurdles?</TE>
<TE>   A: Privacy and confidentiality are very big issues that people in
government are talking about right now. For many agencies, there's an
inherent tension of the job between their mandate to collect data
that is considered confidential and their mandate to disseminate
some--but not all--of that data to researchers and the general
public.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, the way many of them try to maintain confidentiality is
to introduce fake data that shows the same statistical trends as the
real thing. Obviously, that drives researchers crazy.</TE>
<TE>   We are funding a few Citizen Access projects to try to spark
change. I have a person on detail from the U.S. Census who was able
to make a really good connection with all the statistical agencies
and figure out their needs.</TE>
<TE>   One part of the project with the National Institute of Statistical
Analysis is to provide agencies with the tools to better monitor this
tension.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How can so many different agencies--both state and
federal--have such different goals and restrictions yet still use the
same tools?</TE>
<TE>   A: That's the joy of technology. If you're developing mathematical
algorithms, they can be applied anywhere. It just needs to be
flexible enough for the agencies to customize it to their needs.</TE>
<TE>   We've got one project called Coplink, through the University of
Arizona, that's trying to help local law enforcement people share
information better. The result is a series of software programs that
can be sold to other police departments.</TE>
<TE>   The person in charge of the project already had connections with
local agencies. We added base-level funding from the National
Institute of Justice. Now, the university and the program manager
have created a venture capital firm to spin off the product.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why wouldn't law enforcement share their information
automatically? In light of the Sept. 11 catastrophe, it seems to make
sense.</TE>
<TE>   A: The information you hold is your power base. You saw that with
Sept. 11 and the FBI's problems. It took someone upstairs to rattle
the cage, to say, 'You will take down the barriers and share your
information,' to get anything done.</TE>
<TE>   If you talk about sharing the data from Customs and the [Federal
Aviation Administration] and the FBI and local agencies, everyone
would admit that it was a good thing. Everyone should be able to see
the full picture of the elephant, not cling to their own little piece
of it.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is that many agencies aren't allowed to share
data because of the law. It's the notion of Big Brother. That's
obviously a concern for many people. The idea of law enforcement
having a unified, composite file on a person's life is a powerful
thing. For some people, that's a horror.</TE>

<HD>New Ad Campaign Aimed at TiVo Owners</HD>
<DH>Media: Advertisers are trying new approaches to get through
to viewers who fast-forward through commercials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new breed of interactive TV commercial debuts today, aimed at the
people most likely to skip them.</LD>
<LD>   Electronics retailer Best Buy Co.'s new campaign on MTV targets
the 400,000 consumers who own TiVo Inc. personal video recorders.
Such devices make skipping television commercials as easy as changing
a channel, but they also give advertisers new ways to get their
messages through to viewers.</LD>
<LD>   In particular, Best Buy's commercials will be linked to a series
of exclusive promotional videos that TiVo is loading onto its
subscribers' recorders. Those videos also can be seen by TiVo owners
who don't watch the commercial.</LD>
<TE>   That is one of several approaches advertisers are experimenting
with as they gird for the day viewers watch what they want, when they
want. Although relatively few TV viewers have personal video
recorders or cable TV video-on-demand services that can fast-forward
through commercials, that segment is expected to mushroom in just a
few years.</TE>
<TE>   "That ceding of control to consumers, that is something that
neither networks nor advertisers have ever had to deal with before,"
said Tim Hanlon, a vice president at Starcom MediaVest Group, a
division of advertising giant Bcom3 Group.</TE>
<TE>   Personal video recorders, or PVRs, record programs onto hard
drives, not tapes, enabling viewers to pause, rewind and fast-forward
through programs as they are broadcast. They make it so simple to
record, owners quickly start watching about half of their favorite
shows "time shifted" instead of live, said Manu Mehta, chief
executive of Metabyte Networks Inc., which makes PVR software.</TE>
<TE>   PVRs and video-on-demand services, which also let viewers rewind
and fast-forward programs, threaten the existing form of advertising
by letting consumers delete or delay commercials. But they also
enable new advertising approaches that aren't sandwiched into 30- to
60-second gaps between scenes.</TE>
<TE>   For Eden Prairie, Minn.-based Best Buy, TiVo is quietly
programming its subscribers' boxes to receive and store a series of
exclusive videos that pitch gadgets or burnish the chain's image.
Those videos will be linked electronically to Best Buy commercials
that air on MTV.</TE>
<TE>   If TiVo owners click on their remote controls during the
commercial, the device will put the broadcast on hold and bring up a
menu of the Best Buy-sponsored footage. The promotions vary in length
because "they don't need to fit into 30 seconds on TiVo," said Brodie
Keast, a senior vice president at TiVo.</TE>
<TE>   Alternatively, TiVo owners can go directly to the Best Buy
material from a main on-screen menu. Either way, those who view the
extra footage will have the chance to win CDs from Best Buy, which
hopes the freebie will curry favor with viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "Advertisers today are going to be challenged to brand their
messaging in a much more entertaining, much more meaningful way,"
said Mollie Weston, manager of image advertising production for Best
Buy Advertising. The company is trying to figure out how it's going
to talk to consumers in five or 10 years, she said, because "it's not
going to be the way we do it today."</TE>
<TE>   PVRs have a more revolutionary capability that advertisers have
yet to deploy: They can deliver promotional messages targeted at
individual users.</TE>
<TE>   Each recorder could develop an electronic profile of its owner by
combining census data about the local community with any personal
information the owner was willing to submit, then use the profile to
identify the types of commercials the viewer would be most likely to
watch.</TE>
<TE>   TiVo tested this sort of targeting with General Motors Corp.,
using the profiles to determine which model of car to pitch to
different homes. If the profile called for a luxury car, for example,
the box could electronically insert a Cadillac ad in place of a Chevy
truck commercial.</TE>
<TE>   That capability hasn't made it out of the testing phase, however.
Nor have most of the other advertising-oriented features of the new
boxes, largely because few advertisers see much to be gained from
experimenting with nascent on- demand technologies.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole advertising market is crummy," said Steve Shannon, a
marketing vice president at Sonicblue Inc., maker of the ReplayTV
PVRs. "The experimental stuff gets creamed in a downturn."</TE>
<TE>   The TV industry has been conflicted about PVRs since their arrival
three years ago. Many of the major networks and studios were early
investors in TiVo and ReplayTV, but they also created a trade group
that threatened PVR manufacturers over the commercial-skipping
feature.</TE>
<TE>   They ultimately sued Sonicblue over a new version of the device
that can be set to play back recordings with all commercials removed.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 3 million homes are equipped for video on demand, and
only 1 million have PVRs. Those numbers are barely a blip on the TV
radar screen, so most advertisers "need to be cajoled or scared" into
considering what happens when those capabilities spread to most
homes, Hanlon said.</TE>
<TE>   "The first [response] is abject horror and apoplectic disbelief
that the sacrosanct 30-second spot that they've lovingly crafted, put
a significant amount of money behind ... is essentially rendered
mute," Hanlon said. "The second step is: 'How do we ensure that our
spot isn't skipped through? How do we fight this?'--that sort of
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Neither advertisers nor technology companies have figured out yet
how to proceed with each other, said Mitch Oscar, senior vice
president and director of media futures at Universal McCann, an arm
of advertising powerhouse Interpublic Group of Cos.</TE>
<TE>   His firm formed a special group to collaborate with companies like
TiVo on applications that will appeal to advertisers and consumers
alike.</TE>
<TE>   One example: a deal with TiVo to promote "Mr. Deeds," a new Sony
Pictures film starring Adam Sandler, by delivering trailers,
behind-the-scenes footage and other special fare directly to
subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   It's also exploring what to do with video-on-demand systems. Oscar
said cable network Discovery Communications, which has several
on-demand projects in development, wants to make sure viewers accept
commercials as part of the video-on-demand experience.</TE>
<TE>   "If you train people to expect no commercials, that's all people
will want to watch," Oscar said.</TE>
<TE>   TiVo users may often skip commercials, Keast said, but they don't
do it all the time.</TE>
<TE>   During this year's Super Bowl, viewers hit the "replay" button on
the Britney Spears Pepsi ad more than any segment other than the
winning field goal, Keast said.</TE>
<TE>   "It really is not that consumers don't like advertising," he said.
"They don't like advertising that is not relevant to them or, worse,
is not entertaining."</TE>

<HD>Xerox Confirms Meeting Between CEO, SEC's Pitt</HD>
<DH>Securities: Regulator has been dogged by allegations of
conflicts of interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Xerox Corp. confirmed that its chief executive met with Securities
and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt in December, at the
same time the agency was investigating the world's biggest copier
maker for accounting fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Xerox Chairwoman and CEO Anne Mulcahy requested the meeting, which
took place Dec. 7, said Xerox spokeswoman Christa Carone. She
declined to comment further.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington Post, citing unidentified people familiar with the
meeting, reported Saturday that Mulcahy brought up the probe even
after being told before the meeting by SEC staff that she and Pitt
couldn't discuss it. Pitt listened and didn't respond to her, the
paper said.</LD>
<TE>   The Xerox meeting may give more ammunition to critics calling for
Pitt's resignation because they claim he is conflicted by his legal
work for accountants, including KPMG, before taking over as SEC
chairman. KPMG was one of Pitt's clients.</TE>
<TE>   "In my judgment it is unwise for Pitt to be in such a meeting,"
said Alan Bromberg, a law professor at Southern Methodist University
in Dallas who calls himself a Pitt admirer and said Pitt is the most
capable man for the job.</TE>
<TE>   The Post reported that an SEC lawyer advised against the meeting
because it could look improper due to the probe and because the Xerox
investigation focused on financial statements audited by KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   "Every meeting [Pitt] has had has been within SEC ethical rules,"
Christi Harlan, an SEC spokeswoman told Bloomberg News, while
declining to comment on the specifics of the meeting. "There is no
rule against the chairman or commissioners meeting with parties under
investigation."</TE>
<TE>   A meeting Pitt had April 26 with KPMG Chairman Eugene O'Kelly has
raised concern among Democratic members of Congress, who have asked
Pitt to report whether ethics officials were consulted before that
encounter. Pitt, a former securities lawyer, has said Xerox came up
at the "perfectly benign" meeting.</TE>
<TE>   A May 1 e-mail to KPMG employees from O'Kelly reported that he
told Pitt the firm would fight efforts to hold it responsible for
circumstances that led the SEC to fine Stamford, Conn.- based Xerox
last month for inflating its profit.</TE>

<HD>Very Few Chiropractors Cover for Prostitution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of alleged cases of prostitution in chiropractic offices
reported upon in "Kinky Therapy for Your Back" (May 3) amounts to
involvement by roughly 0.1% of licensed chiropractors in California.
This number is of no statistical significance and should not be
delivered to the public in a way that reflects poorly upon all
chiropractors who practice ethically and legally to deliver quality
care.</LD>
<LD>   The California Chiropractic Assn. strongly supports disciplinary
action against any professional who does not conduct legal business
practices. None of the 11 chiropractors disciplined by the state
chiropractic board over the past two years for involvement in
prostitution were members of the California Chiropractic Assn.</LD>
<LD>   Massage therapy performed under the direction of a licensed
chiropractor can be beneficial, and virtually all massage therapists
who work out of chiropractic offices are well trained and supervised
appropriately.</LD>
<TE>   Should there be a future trend toward prostitution being conducted
under the guise of massage therapy, local authorities may be prompted
to perform more stringent investigations prior to issuing massage
permits. Permits for massage are issued to medical offices, massage
parlors, acupuncture clinics, health spas and other businesses, in
addition to chiropractic offices. Your story unfairly singles out the
chiropractic profession.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your May 15 editorial chastises former President Jimmy Carter for his
attempt to broker better relations between the U.S. and Cuba. I
wonder whether the U.S. would have the courage to allow Fidel Castro
to come to the U.S. and address the citizens of this country. Would
the U.S. government allow him to explain why Cubans view their system
as being more democratic than ours and how we should improve and
change ours?</LD>
<LD>   It was the U.S. that torpedoed the enforcement protocol proposed
for the Biological Weapons Convention last year because it would
allow inspections on U.S. soil--an intrusion that the Bush
administration firmly opposes. Why? Perhaps it is the U.S. and not
Cuba that has something to hide in its biotechnology production.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, it is Cuba--not the U.S.--that is developing
technologies for eradicating many dreadful diseases and that freely
offers these technologies to needy countries.</LD>
<TE>   Diana Marcus</TE>
<TE>   Encinitas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is the one that put its foot in its mouth,
not former President Carter. By giving a speech that linked Cuba to
the "axis of evil" and then admitting that it had no hard evidence to
back up its claim, only "concerns," it gave ammunition to all of our
true enemies who claim that our statements on Iran, Iraq and North
Korea are void of evidence as well.</TE>
<TE>   Mimi Nuelle</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laura Ingraham (Commentary, May 15) says that "it is appalling
that [President] Carter would criticize his government while visiting
one of the world's most abusive regimes." That Carter can freely
speak his mind and not be persecuted for it by his government is, in
fact, the most important message that he can give to the Cuban
people. Carter for president in 2004?</TE>

<TE>   What is it with ex-presidents' (Bill Clinton's and Carter's)
desperate need for attention? This is a democracy, and there is a
reason we vote for a new president every four years--it is because we
want a new leader, a new perspective. Have they no shame? There is a
place for ex-presidents, but it should be at the request of the
current president, not of their own choosing. Carter is an
embarrassment and a disgrace to America. As for Clinton, there are no
words to describe the shame.</TE>

<LD>If L.A. employed people with brains we wouldn't have to constantly
protect our pockets from the likes of these NFL schemers.</LD>
<LD>   Here's what should be happening: NFL officials should submit a
request to be allowed to place a team in Los Angeles. They should
make an offer as to what they will pay us for the use of the good
name of Los Angeles in relation to their not-so-respectable business.
In addition to the fee they should pay for the naming rights, they
must be prepared to sign a contract guaranteeing at least a 50%
won/lost record for the five-year period of the contract for naming
the team the Los Angeles "Whatevers." If at the end of the five years
they fail to meet these terms they should be evicted from the city
and their facilities put up for auction.</LD>
<LD>   Their stadium is to be built entirely with their funds on land
purchased on the open market by them with no assistance from the city
other than what the city would provide for any other enterprise. They
are to pay the same taxes as any other entertainment business.</LD>
<TE>   The people of this city do not need the NFL; in fact, a
significant majority probably would prefer it stay away, Super Bowl
or no. We hold all the cards; let's play them properly and not be
chumps again.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Even with the knowledge President Bush had that members of Osama bin
Laden's terrorist network might try to hijack airplanes, it is
doubtful that he could have prevented the 9/11 attacks. What is
disturbing, however, is that this information was kept secret from
the public even after the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   As with the secret energy meetings Vice President Dick Cheney had
with Enron officials and others and the refusal of the Bush
administration to release the Reagan papers as required by law, a
disturbing pattern is emerging of a secretive president who thinks he
cannot and will not trust the people he has sworn to serve, the
citizens of the United States.</LD>

<TE>   Re "What Did Bush Know, When Did He Know It?" letters, May 17: The
bottom line for me is, if the American people had this information
passed on to them, they may have possibly realized that when the
first plane hit it wasn't an accident, but perhaps terrorism. Those
in the second tower never would have been cleared to go back their
offices and so many lives may have been saved. Can we forget Bush's
(pre-9/11) inexperience in world affairs and national security?</TE>

<TE>   The Democratic leadership just put the president in a "damned if
you do, damned if you don't" situation. If the president had ordered
major detentions of possible terrorists based on general information,
the same Democratic leadership would accuse him of being a cowboy and
stomping on people's freedoms. So instead of showing a united front
in the ongoing war on terrorism, they are using this for their own
political gain. Shame on them.</TE>

improving the security of our airports and large public areas. All

happened.</TE>
<TE>   I am confident that if, in his daily briefing, Bush was informed,
in detail, of the upcoming attacks of 9/11, he would have handled the
situation at that time. Let's move forward and concentrate on our
task at hand: fighting terrorism.</TE>

Commentary, May 17: Thank you for publishing one of the more rational
articles on this issue. To listen to much of the media, and some
Democratic politicians, Bush and his administration are apparently
guilty of the deaths of 3,000 Americans and possibly treason as well.</TE>
<TE>   We all know that if Bush had proposed any of the post-Sept. 11
security measures prior to the attacks, his administration would have
been ridden out of town on a rail.</TE>

<HD>Disappointment With Mahony's Leadership</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Cardinal Mahony Kept Cleric's Abuse Secret for 16 Years," May 16:
As a faith-filled and dedicated 15-year-old Catholic, I would like to
express my disappointment in the leadership of Cardinal Roger Mahony.
For my entire life I have been devoted to my faith, and I have never
encountered anything that has made me doubt what I believe in.</LD>
<LD>   My 12-year-old brother has considered becoming a priest for many
years. I have known many outstanding and very respectable priests
throughout my life, and I would be thrilled for him become like them.
However, the cardinal is in no way a role model for him.</LD>
<LD>   This past summer I attended the youth leadership camp of the
archdiocese. There I learned the importance of being a leader and all
the qualities that a leader must posses. However, the cardinal has
failed to perform in the same manner in which hundreds of youth were
taught to perform at this camp. I now doubt the cardinal's ability to
lead the faithful community of Catholics in the Archdiocese of Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Andy Wilcox</TE>

<TE>   The fact that Cardinal Mahony knew of Father Michael Stephen Baker
molesting children and did nothing to report it to either law
officials or the parents of the victims is nothing short of an
abomination. Why is it that any other scumbag on the street who
molested children would be rightfully locked up in prison immediately
but because these men wear robes and claim to be pious they're just
slapped on the wrist and moved on to another group of victims?</TE>
<TE>   Mahony issued an apology to his "brothers" and signed it "His
Eminence." The dictionary defines eminence as "a position of
prominence or superiority." I would define Mahony as despicable and
his cover-up of criminal activity heinous and unforgivable.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Foyster</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Mahony offers his sincere, personal apologies for his
failure to take firm and decisive action much earlier. This
continuing disaster in lack of leadership not only points to the
moral bankruptcy of the Catholic Church but, in an odd way, parallels
Watergate, Richard Nixon's downfall and the beginning of the public's
lack of faith in our leaders.</TE>
<TE>   As far as I am concerned, Mahony's and Boston Cardinal Bernard
Law's "failures" are much worse. It's not a question of whether they
should step down. Criminal proceedings need to happen against these
Catholic leaders for aiding and abetting crimes and the obstruction
of justice. These men not only hid the truth, they explicitly allowed
these priests to continue their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   As far as "Churchgate" is concerned, these men were supposed to be
our spiritual leaders, yet it takes the media to force the truth out.
These so-called leaders are supposed to show us the way to
enlightenment, not detour us into lies and deceit.</TE>
<TE>   It's a bad day in this world when one cannot trust taking a child
to church. I, for one, will not expose my child to such poor examples
of human decency.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Neri</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I find it incredible that Cardinal Mahony could say his biggest
problem is that Father Baker wasn't found guilty of a criminal act.
After a confession in 1986, there should have come into play the
teaching of the church that the individual must avoid "occasions of
sin," that is, situations where temptation would be strongest. As a
corollary, others must refrain from placing that person where he
would be subject to extreme temptation.</TE>
<TE>   We are our brother's keepers and should keep others from occasions
of sin. Mahony was his brother's keeper, and he failed Father Baker
as much as he failed the children. Proof of a criminal act was not
necessary and should not have been a problem. To bring legality in as
an excuse for not living up to the tenets of your own religion is
inexcusable.</TE>

<HD>A Trinket or a Treasure?</HD>
<DH>Collectibles: Hundreds bring Jewish heirlooms to the
experts, curious about their worth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They trekked to Mount Sinai Memorial Park bearing family heirlooms
and oddities from musty attics, with a question on their lips: Is it
a tchotchke or a treasure?</LD>
<LD>   They came away from the Simi Valley cemetery's first Judaica Road
Show and Art Exhibit on Sunday with a few surprising appraisals and
plenty of anecdotes.</LD>
<LD>   Dolores and Marcia Abrams of North Hollywood, two of the more than
200 people who showed up to the event styled after PBS' "Antiques
Road Show," took off their jewelry and showed it to appraiser Zia
Ghahary. To Marcia's surprise, the tiny gold pendants were worth
$1,200.</LD>
<TE>   "Really?" said Marcia, 67. "You're kidding! God, I just throw them
around."</TE>
<TE>   "You should take care of them," cautioned Ghahary. "They're going
to be valuable someday."</TE>
<TE>   Dolores' peony-shaped pendant centered with a Star of David was
appraised at $800. As for the Moses pendant she recently added to the
necklace, for $20 at Farmers Market, "That one's a tchotchke,"
Dolores said.</TE>
<TE>   One couple had a small ark and torah that appraiser Joy Schonberg
valued at $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   "People are bringing in good things," said Schonberg, a New York
gallery owner who appraised for Christie's auction house. "They're
not bringing in tchotchkes."</TE>
<TE>   Treasure or tchotchke, items that survived the tragic and
turbulent Jewish history provoked mystery and reverence in their
owners.</TE>
<TE>   Ruthann Rossman of Chatsworth found out the book-shaped pendant
hiding a miniaturized torah, an heirloom from her Lithuanian
grandfather, was worth $500.</TE>
<TE>   But the battered Czech alarm clock with Hebrew lettering provoked
only polite amusement from appraiser Marcia Josephy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not beautiful in a conventional way," Josephy said. "If it
could talk, it would tell us a lot about the people who lived in that
area at that time."</TE>
<TE>   At a separate table, Schonberg and fellow appraiser Beth Weingast
debated a hand-hammered silver ceremonial basin engraved, "For the
remembrance of the soul of Esther, daughter of Rachel," with two
grammatical errors in the faint Hebrew lettering.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly several centuries old, the piece could be Middle European
in origin or a South American copy, they said. Either way, it was a
priceless museum piece that owner Janos Hamori, an exporter, wanted
to hold onto for a while longer.</TE>
<TE>   Whether for nostalgia, preservation or investment, Judaica has
become hot in the last several years, with thousands of collectors
paying top dollar for historical items from the Jewish faith, said
Weingast, of New Rochelle, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big area," she said. "It's growing all the time, and I
would say the situation in Israel has brought attention to the more
tangible items of Judaica. But now there are fewer sales, because
people are holding onto what they have rather than selling it."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ed Kamenir, a dentist and attorney from Bel-Air, will hold
onto the silver cup and mismatched saucer that his father gave him.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone's been polishing this," Weingast scolded. "It has a very
subtle engraving. The next time you bring it to me, I'll see even
less of it."</TE>
<TE>   She cradled the cup and peered at it with a magnifying glass,
turning it slowly, as if to coax its story from the cold metal.</TE>
<TE>   The maker--a non-Jew, because Jews were not allowed to work with
silver--stamped his name in it in Russian letters, along with the
date 1883 and the purity of the silver--84%, she noted.</TE>
<TE>   The family probably didn't want any overtly Jewish symbols on it,
to keep the owner safe from pogroms, Weingast suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything of value found in a Jewish home was melted down," she
said. "This obviously was smuggled out."</TE>
<TE>   It's worth maybe $1,800, she said.</TE>

<HD>Deputy's Fate Still Unknown</HD>
<DH>Search: Investigators' two-year undercover probe of
Antelope Valley drug operations fails to provide new clues to the
1998 disappearance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Law enforcement authorities thought a two-year undercover drug
operation in the Antelope Valley would almost certainly lead them to
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Jonathan Aujay.</LD>
<LD>   They were wrong.</LD>
<LD>   As the drug investigation winds down, with several suspected drug
dealers awaiting trial or sentencing in federal court, no one is
closer to knowing what happened to Aujay. He is the one deputy in the
8,000-officer department who is the subject of a missing-persons
case.</LD>
<TE>   A plaque at the Sheriff's Special Enforcement Bureau lists the day
Aujay started work there, followed by a dash and an infinity symbol.</TE>
<TE>   As the four-year anniversary of his June 11, 1998, disappearance
draws near, Aujay's family remains in the dark. His half-brother, Joe
Aujay, still checks the newspapers in hopes of finding some hint of
Aujay's whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep waiting for a story from Buenos Aires where he's lying on
the beach," Joe Aujay said recently. "I might be in denial."</TE>
<TE>   Aujay, a skilled outdoorsman and long-distance runner, was 38 when
he set off into the Devil's Punchbowl, a remote Los Angeles County
park on the north slope of the San Gabriel Mountains, according to
sheriff's authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Friends thought he was going on a trail run, but when he didn't
return home, authorities launched a manhunt. Hundreds of rescue
workers searched the steep ravines and mountain trails in and around
the park, but after two months they had found no sign of him.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the investigators working on "Operation Silent
Thunder"--one of the largest drug sweeps in north Los Angeles
County--checked a number of leads related to Aujay's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   As sheriff's deputies and the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration began infiltrating six methamphetamine-producing rings
in the area, homicide Det. Joe Holmes began following up stories
about Aujay.</TE>
<TE>   He talked to informants, Aujay's relatives and friends, and others
he hoped would reveal something that might help explain what happened
to Aujay. Some tipsters said Aujay had been killed after he came
across a meth lab, but they turned out to be untrustworthy.</TE>
<TE>   "At the beginning, I'd thought he'd met with foul play," Holmes
said. "But we went out and interviewed all of these witnesses and I
couldn't find anything to suggest [it]. All those folks we talked to
either said they'd lied about their original information, or we
caught them in lies."</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Capt. Frank Merriman said the disappearance has created
tension in the department, as some deputies have become frustrated by
their colleagues' failure to find the 15-year department veteran.
Investigators may never know what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't chase rumors indefinitely," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aujay was a member of a bureau that handles high-risk tactical
situations involving barricaded suspects, hostage situations and
warrant services. Colleagues said he seemed happy at work at the time
of his disappearance, and detectives said he was not facing any
internal disciplinary measures.</TE>
<TE>   Aujay's wife, Debbie, who declined to be interviewed, is raising
the couple's 10-year-old daughter in the L.A. area, said Aujay's
brother-in-law, Jeff Kaltenbach.</TE>
<TE>   Merriman said missing-adults cases tend to be especially vexing
for law enforcement. Every year in California, thousands of adults
disappear for a while. Of the 35,000 adults reported missing in 2001,
nearly 29,000 of them left of their own free will, according to
California Department of Justice statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Close friend Scott Griffis said that although he didn't think
Aujay was the type to just pack up and leave, he would not mind
learning that's what he did.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping he just took off."</TE>

<HD>Contest Is Theirs for the Picking</HD>
<DH>Music: Not so much a competition as a jam fest, annual
Topanga bluegrass event seems to be getting hipper.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the 42nd annual Topanga Banjo Fiddle Contest deep in the Santa
Monica Mountains on Sunday, some of the most joyful and heartfelt
bluegrass music did not come from the competition stages.</LD>
<LD>   Rather, it was heard at the impromptu jam sessions of graying,
bearded musicians in front of dusty wooden buildings. The clusters of
banjo pickers, folk guitarists, mandolin players and one-string
washtub bass pluckers came together--each staking out a spot on the
dirt at Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills--to improvise with
like-minded players.</LD>
<LD>   "That's probably the best music around," Dorian Keyser, the
76-year-old retired organizer of the festival, said of the
spontaneous melody-making.</LD>
<TE>   Thousands of musicians and fans flocked to the verdant hills. Many
were longtime fans getting up there in years, but a growing number
were younger converts.</TE>
<TE>   "I just can't get enough of it now," said Rashna Elavia, a
34-year-old Hollywood set designer. A native of Britain, she said
bluegrass recently surfaced in the London club scene, with deejays
mixing the twangy sounds with thumping techno beats.</TE>
<TE>   Marin Richards, a 20-year-old Santa Monica College student with
purple hair, said she used to hate bluegrass but changed her mind
after seeing "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" The movie's soundtrack sold
more than 4 million copies and a few months ago won a Grammy for
album of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Bluegrass is "very high-spirited. It makes me happy," Richards
said, kicking back on a grassy field with two friends as the Irish
folk band Claddagh played on stage.</TE>
<TE>   The festival began in 1961 in a Topanga backyard, where 25 banjo
pickers and five fiddlers played up a storm before a crowd of 500.
Over the years, the event grew to include folk singers, square
dancers, cowboy poets and more musicians from far and wide.</TE>
<TE>   Though touted as a contest, the festival is really not about
competition. About 100 contestants vied for 50 to 60 prizes this
year. The top beginner, intermediate and advanced musicians got
awards. So did the youngest and the oldest.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the musicians didn't even want to compete.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Spitz, a 49-year-old Van Nuys music teacher, strolled up to
two banjo-strumming guys and began harmonizing with her mandolin.

<DH>Activists: Inaugural AIDS/LifeCycle raises $4.4 million.
Suit had sought to block ride.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a week of triumph and tragedy, 670 cyclists rode into Los
Angeles on Sunday, ending a 600-mile trek to raise money for HIV and
AIDS services and educational programs.</LD>
<LD>   The inaugural AIDS/LifeCycle was born last fall out of a
falling-out between two nonprofit agencies and the promoter of the
California AIDS Ride, Los Angeles-based Pallotta TeamWorks.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Gay &amp; Lesbian Center and the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation created their own ride because they thought Pallotta
devoted too much of the funds raised to marketing and operations,
rather than to the two groups and their programs.</LD>
<TE>   Pallotta sued to block the AIDS/LifeCycle ride, but a Los Angeles
Superior Court judge in January ruled that the dueling events could
go forward. The ninth California AIDS Ride, sponsored by AIDS Project
Los Angeles and produced by Pallotta, will be June 2-8 with an
estimated 1,100 participants.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy significantly dampened participation in this
year's bicycle journey. The two rides combined will draw fewer than
1,800 participants, compared with 2,700 riders in the single event
last year. The organizers of last week's AIDS/LifeCycle ride said
their event raised more than $4.4 million in donations.</TE>
<TE>   The AIDS/LifeCycle got off to a difficult start Monday after
leaving San Francisco. Shortly after lunch, one participant died of
an apparent heart attack on a hill along the San Mateo County coast
near San Gregorio State Beach.</TE>
<TE>   But on Sunday, after traveling 65 miles from their last campsite
in Ventura, the cyclists drew cheers as they rode the final segment
together and attended a ceremony to celebrate their achievement and
pay tribute to people who have died of AIDS-related diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The event attracted people from all walks of life, ranging in age
from 18 to 71. Each participant was expected to raise at least
$2,500. A contingent of New York riders distinguished themselves by
wearing green crowns modeled after the Statue of Liberty affixed to
their bicycle helmets.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Dubler, 19, of Los Angeles rode despite being unable to hear
traffic or fellow riders along the state's highways. He hopes to
create a team of deaf riders next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm riding because I had an experience--a 'scare'--that had me
sympathize with HIV-positive people," Dubler wrote in response to a
reporter's written questions. "I know this is one of the best ways to
raise funds and promote awareness."</TE>
<TE>   Ben Goldstein, 53, rode with a group known as the Positive
Pedalers, people who have HIV or AIDS, who led the cyclists down
Santa Monica Boulevard to the closing ceremony in West Hollywood.
Goldstein has been HIV-positive with symptoms for more than 20 years
and he has had AIDS for six years.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I was going to climb over my own kind of Mt. Everest
doing this trip from San Francisco to L.A.," he said. "It was my way
of saying no to the virus."</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein said he rode to support the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation, which has helped pay for his medications, and to maintain
awareness of the health crisis. More than 47,000 people live with
AIDS in California, and an additional 94,000 to 130,500 are living
with HIV.</TE>
<TE>   Rabin participated in the ride in honor of his brother, Neil, who
died of AIDS-related complications in December.</TE>

<HD>Boyce McDaniel, 84; Worked on A-Bomb</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boyce D. McDaniel, the Manhattan Project physicist who was the last
man to check the atomic bomb before the first test of the device in
July 1945, has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   McDaniel, who also had a distinguished career at Cornell
University, died of a heart attack May 8 in Ithaca, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   He had just finished his PhD work at Cornell in 1943 when he was
invited to join the Manhattan Project team.</LD>
<TE>   McDaniel was paid $250 a month and worked 10- to 15-hour days at
the secret Los Alamos, N.M., facility.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the cyclotron research team, he played an important
role in helping to identify the amount of the isotope uranium-235
needed to create the atomic fission to detonate the world's first
nuclear bomb. By the summer of 1945, enough U-235 and sufficient
plutonium-239 had been processed to create the bomb.</TE>
<TE>   The test was scheduled for 4 a.m. on July 16, 1945, at the Trinity
site on the Alamogordo Bombing Range in the New Mexico desert.</TE>
<TE>   One of McDaniel's tasks was to check the bomb's radiation levels
every few hours. The bomb, which many of the scientists referred to
throughout its development as "the gadget," had been placed atop a
100-foot metal tower.</TE>
<TE>   Just before 1 a.m., McDaniel climbed the tower to make one of his
final checks. He recalled later that the climb was a bit dicey.</TE>
<TE>   "During the evening, a misting rain had been falling, and by the
time I started up [the tower], there were thunderstorms playing
around the site with frequent flashes of lightning followed by
rolling thunder. With considerable fear and trepidation, I made the
trip to the top and returned safely, heaving a sigh of relief."</TE>
<TE>   He was the last man to touch the bomb before it was detonated at
5:29:45 a.m., in what was then called Mountain War Time.</TE>
<TE>   McDaniel recalled that he and his colleagues "stared intently into
the darkness. Then came the last minute countdown .... Finally, the
brilliant flash of an ever-growing sphere was followed by the
billowing flame of an orange ball rising above the plain."</TE>
<TE>   Within a month of the test, bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, and Japan agreed to surrender.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, McDaniel joined the Cornell faculty and became a
full professor in 1955. He was instrumental in establishing the
university's nuclear studies laboratory, and in 1972 became director,
a post he held until he took emeritus status in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Along with his Cornell colleague Robert Walker, McDaniel invented
the pair spectrometer, a key tool in measuring gamma ray energies. He
also helped design the university's 300-megavolt electron
synchrotron, among the first such accelerators in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Well-respected in the scientific community, McDaniel took a leave
of absence from Cornell in 1972 to become acting head of the
accelerator section at the Enrico Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory. The facility, located in Batavia, Ill., had been having
severe trouble with component failure, and as a result, intermittent
operation. Under McDaniel's leadership, the accelerator problems were
solved, and in short time, the facility was running in a productive
manner.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brevard, N.C., Boyce Dawkins McDaniel grew up in
Chesterville, Ohio. He earned a bachelor's degree from Ohio Wesleyan
University in 1938, and a master's degree from what is now Case
Western Reserve in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   For his PhD from Cornell, McDaniel researched the absorption rates
of neutrons in the element indium.</TE>
<TE>   In 1953, he was a Fulbright scholar at the Australian National
University in Canberra. In 1959, he was Guggenheim Fellow at the
University of Rome and the National Laboratory in Frascati, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the governing
board of the Brookhaven National Laboratory and of the Department of
Energy High Energy Advisory Panel, a governing board member of
Fermilab and chairman of the Superconducting Supercollider Board of
Overseers.</TE>
<TE>   McDaniel is survived by his wife, Jane, a son and a daughter.</TE>

<LD>A man wielding a pair of scissors was shot and killed by Los Angeles
police on Sunday afternoon in Winnetka, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified man, believed to be in his 20s, allegedly slashed
an officer on the ear before two other officers fired several rounds
at him shortly after 4 p.m. on the corner of Madora Avenue and
Cantlay Street, said LAPD Capt. Jim Cansler.</LD>
<LD>   The man was pronounced dead at the scene. The wounded officer's
injury was not serious.</LD>
<TE>   The injured officer initially spotted the suspect stealing parts
from parked vehicles at Sherman Way and Corbin Avenue, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "He told the officer to leave him alone or he will kill the
officer," Cansler said.</TE>
<TE>   The officer pursued the suspect on foot past a church and into a
residential area, where the officer tried to subdue the man with his
baton. When more officers arrived, the suspect reportedly lunged at
the officer with the scissors.</TE>
<TE>   Cansler said the two officers who fired their weapons were being
interviewed, along with witnesses, at the West Valley police station.</TE>

<HD>Taking Budget Fight to Davis</HD>
<DH>Politics: Low-income residents board buses bound for
Sacramento to lobby against the proposed reductions in programs for
the poor.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of low-income Los Angeles County residents boarded buses
bound for Sacramento on Sunday to protest Gov. Gray Davis' plan to
cut programs for the poor in the state budget.</LD>
<LD>   In a bid to close a $23.6-billion budget gap, Davis has proposed
reducing the state's spending--including welfare and health-care
services for the poor and the infirm--by $7.6 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of the deficit would be remedied by increased taxes on
smokers and motorists, and a bevy of accounting shifts, budget
transfers and loans, according to the plan he proposed this month.</LD>
<TE>   Advocates for the disadvantaged argue that programs that help
low-income families meet basic needs should be spared.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to prevent some cuts that we think are too hard-hitting
on poor people," said Mary Ochs of the National Campaign for Jobs and
Income Support, which organized the protest.</TE>
<TE>   Lydia Ponce, 40, and her 8-year-old daughter were among nearly 100
people waiting Sunday morning to board buses at a meeting spot south
of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Venice Beach resident said she planned to lobby legislators to
preserve funding for CalWORKS, a welfare-to-work program she depends
on for child care. "The money has to come from somewhere else," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ponce said she won't be able to continue working toward her
college degree and juggling two part-time jobs if she loses public
assistance. "If it's a choice between paying child care or paying the
rent, I can't do both," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the group was Zed Null, 53, who suffers from anxiety and
post-traumatic stress disorders. The Hollywood resident said he would
be devastated if the subsidized services he has relied on for the
last 15 years are cut.</TE>
<TE>   "They already asked us to come up with a list of what we felt we
could do without," he said. "That's the equivalent of saying, 'You've
got 10 fingers and 10 toes. You can choose which ones you don't mind
losing.'"</TE>
<TE>   About 600 people such as Ponce and Null from across the state
planned to rally today at the Capitol and meet with individual
legislators throughout the day.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't expect necessarily to prevent all of the cuts ... but we
feel it's important that the voices of low-income families be heard,"
Ochs said.</TE>

<HD>Hotel Seen as Convention Center Savior</HD>
<DH>Development: Backers of city financing say visitors will
come if they have a place to sleep. Doubters fear throwing good money
after bad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite assurances a decade ago that a major expansion of the Los
Angeles Convention Center would pay for itself, the super-sized
structure has bled red ink, forcing city officials each year to dig
deeper into the treasury to keep it afloat.</LD>
<LD>   The city has been unable to pay off the debt on the $525-million
expansion with revenue the center generates and the portion of the
citywide hotel bed tax dedicated to the project. As a result, city
officials have been forced to bail out the sprawling glass and steel
structure with funds that otherwise could go to hiring more police
officers and firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   "This is really a white elephant," said Mayor James K. Hahn. "We
are not getting the conventions we need to fill the rooms there and
to fill local hotels."</LD>
<TE>   Last year, the city had to provide a general fund subsidy of $13.6
million to help pay the expansion debt, up from $11.7 million the
year before. Next year, if convention center projections come true,
the subsidy will top $15 million. Many factors contribute to the
center's poor financial health. Some say mismanagement. Others say
hard luck, an economic slump and stiff competition are to blame.</TE>
<TE>   But most everyone agrees that the convention center suffers from
the lack of quality hotel rooms within walking distance. As a result,
many city officials are eager to move ahead with a 1,200-room hotel
that would be built next to the convention center using public
subsidies available through the council's newly approved
redevelopment area.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, that proposal, though largely overshadowed by the plan for
a new football stadium in the redevelopment area, is a key reason
some council members say they backed creation of the special tax
zone.</TE>
<TE>   "A hotel will bootstrap our convention center, which has been a
drain upon this city for years," Councilman Hal Bernson told his
colleagues during the debate on redevelopment last week. "Not only
will it no longer be a drain on the public treasury, but it will pay
dividends to our city for years."</TE>
<TE>   Others, complaining that they have been misled before, remain
skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not optimistic for the taxpayers," said former City
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, a leading critic of downtown
redevelopment efforts. "The taxpayers are being taken, and on a big
scale."</TE>
<TE>   City officials promise no general fund drain by the hotel project,
but the same promise was made in the 1980s, when Los Angeles
officials were contemplating the convention center expansion,
according to officials including City Controller Laura Chick.</TE>
<TE>   When the expansion was completed in 1993, the convention center
had more than doubled in size, with 805,000 square feet of meeting
and exhibit halls.</TE>
<TE>   The expansion was launched after a consultant hired by the city
estimated that it would increase use of the convention center from
1.47 million attendees and 123 events in the 1984-85 fiscal year to
3.7 million attendees and 270 events within three years of
completion, in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   But in the fiscal year ending June 20, 1995, only 1.3 million
people attended 129 events, and the next year there were 1.83 million
people at 121 events, according to a report released this month by
Los Angeles County, which is a partner in the authority that owns the
land under the center.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of doubling attendance as predicted in the feasibility
study, actual attendance has remained at pre-expansion levels," said
the report by county Chief Administrative Officer David E. Janssen.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the convention center attracted about 1.9 million
people, still well below the 3.7 million projected before the
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The county report, based partly on research by a University of
Texas economist, was written to oppose the creation of a
redevelopment project area. County officials fear it will divert tax
dollars from county coffers to private redevelopment projects. The
report also casts serious doubts on whether a new hotel will solve
the convention center's problems.</TE>
<TE>   County officials say the market for hotels downtown is weak, that
such a hotel will have trouble filling its rooms, and that it may not
solve the convention center's problems because there is a glut of
convention center space nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Plagued by Problems</TE>
<TE>   The convention center expansion, billed at the time as the most
expensive publicly financed building in the city's history, from the
beginning has been plagued by problems.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, city officials said the expansion would cost $225
million, but construction and planning costs skyrocketed to $399
million after major alterations were made to put parking under the
new South Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The Community Redevelopment Agency spent an additional $125
million buying the land and relocating 1,400 residents and 128
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The annual debt payment on the expansion is about $41.5 million.
Most of it was supposed to be paid through a share of the citywide
hotel bed taxes and convention center operating revenue. But the
dearth of conventions and the economic slump of the 1990s have kept
that tax revenue and operating revenue below what is needed to pay on
the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, $27.8 million in hotel bed tax went toward the debt
payment, leaving a $13.6 million gap that had to be filled by the
general fund.</TE>
<TE>   Since the expansion was completed, such unanticipated general fund
subsidies have totaled $50 million. That's beyond the $5 million in
general funds the City Council agreed to pay every year to cover the
loss of money when discounts are offered to attract conventions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Discounts Failed to Deliver Revenue Stream</TE>
<TE>   The council made that commitment in 1992 after it approved a
change in the convention center's booking policy to encourage
officials to offer discounted rates to attract large "out-of-town"
conventions that would bring dollars to the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent audit, Controller Chick said those discounts have come
at the expense of convention center operating revenue.</TE>
<TE>   About $25 million in rental discounts had been given since 1994,
Chick said, and $5.8 million appeared to violate city rules limiting
the size of discounts.</TE>
<TE>   Some hotel owners and city officials have expressed
dissatisfaction with the performance of the Los Angeles Convention
and Visitors Bureau, which has a city contract to draw large
conventions that must be booked at least two years in advance.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, they have complained that the bureau appears to
have inflated bookings to meet performance goals and win bonuses,
only to have many of the conventions cancel later. Bureau officials
deny bookings were deliberately inflated, but acknowledge the center
has experienced an unprecedented number of cancellations in the last
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Chick, who has launched an audit of the bureau, said she believes
city mismanagement and poor planning are also partly to blame for the
convention center's financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   The controller faults city officials in the 1980s for approving
the convention center expansion without looking at worst-case
scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the expansion was approved based on the assumption
that several new hotels would be built nearby, providing 4,000 rooms.</TE>
<TE>   However, after the recession hit, only two of the hotels were
built. As a result, Los Angeles has just 650 hotel rooms within a
half a mile of its convention center, compared with 9,400 in Las
Vegas, 4,500 in Anaheim and 5,000 in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "The marketability of the city in attracting conventions has been
primarily hampered by the lack of hotel rooms in the downtown area,"
said George Rakis, general manager of the convention center.</TE>
<TE>   PKF Consulting issued a report for the redevelopment agency in
1999 that estimated during a three-year period, 70 groups decided
against going to Los Angeles because of the lack of a nearby hotel.</TE>
<TE>   With the council last week approving a downtown redevelopment
district, city officials say financial help may be available to get a
hotel built.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No Developer Showed Interest</TE>
<TE>   Because no private developer has shown interest in building the
hotel, Ron Deaton, the council's top advisor, proposed that the city
create a nonprofit corporation to issue tax exempt bonds to build it.
The city would contract with a hotel firm to run the business on a
day-to-day basis.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the hotel debt would be retired with hotel revenue, Deaton
proposed. Redevelopment studies indicate that up to $80 million in
subsidies would be required. Much of that could come from taxes
generated by the hotel, but studies indicate more subsidies would
likely be required to make the hotel work.</TE>
<TE>   Deaton said he will not recommend that the general fund be tapped
for subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   A report commissioned last month by the county from the private
consulting firm Sedway Group casts doubts on whether the proposed
hotel can succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Intense competition from other cities, a greatly expanded supply
of convention center space throughout the country and a leveling off
of demand because of economic factors are likely to hamper efforts to
increase use of the Los Angeles Convention Center, the study found.</TE>
<TE>   Based on current business at the center, an adjacent hotel would
be used by conventioneers only 100 days a year, with only 35% of its
demand coming from convention visitors, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   "The Los Angeles hotel market is weak," wrote Thomas R. Jirovsky,
senior managing director for Sedway. "Despite no new hotels having
been built in downtown in almost a decade, occupancy rates have
remained depressed, averaging only 60% or less."</TE>
<TE>   Deaton believes the nearby Staples Center and a $1-billion sports
and entertainment district proposed by the Staples owners, will make
the hotel more feasible.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Hahn said he wants to examine Deaton's hotel proposal before
committing to it, but believes something needs to be done to stop the
convention center drain on the city general fund.</TE>
<TE>   "If you do nothing, the bleeding will continue," Hahn said. "It's
extremely frustrating. I'd rather be hiring more police officers or
extending library hours than paying off debt."</TE>

<HD>Study Says S.F. Lags in Solving Crimes</HD>
<DH>Safety: Police rank last among the nation's 20 largest
cities, clearing less than a third of violent crimes, newspaper
finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Police Department is struggling to solve violent
crimes, and ranks last among the nation's 20 largest cities in doing
so, according to a study of crime statistics.</LD>
<LD>   From 1996 to 2000, the department solved just 28% of the city's
rapes, murders, shootings and other violent crimes, a San Francisco
Chronicle analysis published Sunday found. That is the lowest
crime-solution rate for that period among the nation's 20 largest
cities.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco has more resources and less crime than many other
large cities, but police have only managed to solve half the city's
murders and less than a third of the rapes.</LD>
<TE>   Lt. Harry Hunter said that for many violent crimes reported, an
investigation might not get off the ground. "Unless we have a named
suspect, we're not going to assign the case," he said. "The
solvability is too low."</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Fred Lau said he was unaware that inspectors
routinely declined to investigate violent crimes. "That's not the
proper attitude, that's not the proper procedure," he said. "If the
victim or a witness takes the time to report a crime, and we
encourage people to report crimes, then the Police Department should
do everything it can to assist that person."</TE>
<TE>   Narcotics detail supervisor Lt. Paul Chignell said stopping crimes
before they occur is the department's primary focus.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have done in the department over the last two years ...
is engage in a broad series of innovative approaches to attacking
violent crime," he said. "It is not just about clearing cases and
assigning cases to an investigator."</TE>
<TE>   One of those new approaches is bringing in known gang members for
meetings in which they are warned by law enforcement officers to
shape up and avoid committing crimes that might land them in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The Chronicle found that staff cuts, budget constraints and the
lack of formal performance standards in the Inspectors Bureau were
among the chief reasons for the department's poor record for solving
crimes. Budget concerns mean inspectors often go without basic tools,
such as cars, portable transceiver radios and cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard for the department to determine where the weak links
are. Inspectors are not evaluated on performance, but are instead
only required to provide a monthly account of their activities, the
newspaper's research found.</TE>
<TE>   All of these shortcomings have led to a dismal display of
crime-solving. At no time in the last decade have San Francisco
police solved or cleared more than 30% of the city's violent crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Lau said he is trying to coordinate better communications
with other city departments to address the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We have asked for on-call D.A.s, we have been asking for on-call
judges, we have been asking for night court, we have been asking for
weekend court," he said. "We need the whole criminal justice system
to work together."</TE>
<TE>   Other cities have fared better in solving violent crimes. Of
California cities with populations of 200,000 or more, Anaheim tops
the list with its Police Department solving 75% of violent crimes.
San Diego is second best, solving 63% of its crimes, and San Jose is
third, with 61% of its crimes cleared.</TE>

<HD>Probe Begun of SUV Rollover That Killed 6</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BARSTOW</DL>
<LD>An investigation was underway Sunday into what caused a deadly
rollover accident that claimed the lives of six in an SUV driving
toward Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred about 9:30 p.m. Saturday just north of
Barstow on Interstate 15, the major thoroughfare between Southern
California and Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   A Ford Expedition carrying six people swerved into a brushy area
and rolled violently after the driver apparently lost control, said
CHP Officer Matt Hunt. Four occupants were thrown from the vehicle
and two others were partially ejected. All were pronounced dead at
the scene.</LD>
<TE>   It was not clear what caused the driver to lose control or whether
another vehicle was involved, Hunt said. "It's going to take us a
couple of days to finish the investigation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities identified the passengers Sunday as Eve Rodriguez, 48,
and Jose Rodriguez, 50, of Hinkley Calif., along with Maria Lucero,
68, and Antonio Lucero, 75, of Wilmington, Calif. Authorities
withheld the names of the driver, a 48-year-old Norwalk woman, and
her 50-year-old husband, pending notification of their next of kin.</TE>
<TE>   The stretch of Interstate 15 where the accident occurred is one of
the deadliest in the state. More than 127 people have been killed in
the last three years on the highway between Barstow and Nevada.</TE>

<HD>Daily Power Call Shapes Political Life of Gray Davis</HD>
<DH>Election: If it's 8:30 a.m., he's on the phone with his
inner circle, sharing news and strategy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Every weekday morning at 8:30, members of Gray Davis' political brain
trust reach for their telephones, dial a toll-free number and link up
for a conversation that has continued nonstop for years.</LD>
<LD>   On most days the governor joins in, often while puffing away at
home on his stationary bike. For the next freewheeling hour, or more,
the discussion ranges over the morning news clips, the day ahead and
various state issues, all in service of a larger purpose: ensuring
that the Democratic incumbent wins a second term in November.</LD>
<LD>   Davis says he views politicking and the need to raise money as one
of the necessary burdens of his job, stealing time he would much
rather devote to public policy.</LD>
<TE>   But to a far greater degree than either of his recent
predecessors, Davis has thrown himself deeply and devotedly into the
day-to-day running of his reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   He designs TV ads. He dissects poll results. And the whole time he
raises huge sums of money, personally asking donors for amounts up to
$1 million--a practice that has yielded a bulging bankroll but also
exposed him to fierce criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, state legislators and others have criticized
contracts struck by the Davis administration with some of the
governor's political donors, including the state prison guards union
and Oracle Corp. Both of those deals, as well as a request for a
$1-million contribution that Davis made to the California Teachers
Assn. in his Capitol office, have deepened questions about the links
between politics and policy in his administration.</TE>
<TE>   Other governors have taken a strong interest in political parts of
the job. George Deukmejian paid close attention to his portrayal in
campaign ads. Pete Wilson called donors in search of large
contributions and did as much polling, or more, than Davis. Sometimes
Wilson even assigned specific questions to be asked, according to his
campaign pollster.</TE>
<TE>   But neither governor waded as hip-deep into his own campaign as
Davis, who effectively functions as both the candidate and chief
strategist of his reelection effort.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor's the boss," said David Doak, the Washington
consultant mainly responsible for producing Davis' TV advertising.
"It's his life. We advise him. He makes the final decision."</TE>
<TE>   The 8:30 phone call is central to the functioning of the Davis
administration, as well as his political team, which has stayed in
touch and stayed intact--with the addition of a few key
players--since March 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost every decision impacting the state of California, at least
from the perspective of the governor's office, is made on that call,"
said one participant, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It's the
only time you have in one place all the key players he listens to."</TE>
<TE>   Long-Running Part</TE>
<TE>   of Governor's Routine</TE>
<TE>   The calls--which cost the Davis campaign as much as $18,000 a
month in phone bills--are all the more remarkable for having been
held most weekdays, and some weekends, throughout the governor's
term. By comparison, Deukmejian's campaign team did not convene until
January of his reelection year.</TE>
<TE>   But Garry South, Davis' chief political aide, said there is no end
of business that requires daily discussion among the governor and his
campaign strategists. "It's totally specious to suggest that the
governor of California, one of the most prominent Democrats in
America, doesn't have ongoing political demands and responsibilities
that he has to deal with," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, South chose after Davis' election not to become
chief of staff, his job when Davis was lieutenant governor. In fact,
South said, none of Davis' campaign aides are on the public payroll,
in contrast to Karl Rove, President Bush's top political strategist
and an important advisor on a host of policy issues.</TE>
<TE>   It is not unusual for elected officials to rely on aides who play
both a political and policy role. In Sacramento, Wilson and
Deukmejian both had chiefs of staff--Bob White and Steve Merksamer,
respectively--who played a vital role in their reelection campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it plausible to expect that people who spend years in
politics will suddenly stop thinking about such things the moment
they go into government. "Obviously, if you watch 'West Wing,' you
know you don't just talk about government all the time," said Larry
Thomas, a Republican strategist who served both Wilson and
Deukmejian. "You talk about politics and who looks like they're going
to run against you and how you're doing within your own party."</TE>
<TE>   But Davis has taken those discussions to a new level by
instituting ongoing political bull sessions as an integral part of
his administration.</TE>
<TE>   The lineup on the 8:30 call changes regularly, depending on the
subject matter and availability of individuals. Some call in while
exercising, others while eating breakfast, answering e-mail or
surfing the Internet. All use a secret pass code, which changes
frequently.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Davis and South, regulars include Doak, the campaign's
ad man, and his partner, Tom O'Donnell; Paul Maslin, the governor's
pollster, and Larry Grisolano, the campaign's day-to-day overseer. On
Tuesdays and Thursdays, the conversation often expands to include
Lynn Schenk, the governor's chief of staff; Susan Kennedy, the deputy
chief of staff; and Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary.</TE>
<TE>   The three staffers joined Davis after his November 1998 election.
Grisolano signed on last summer. South and Maslin are the governor's
longest-serving campaign aides, helping steer his 1994 run for
lieutenant governor. Doak and O'Donnell were hired in March 1997; the
daily political call grew out of early getting-to-know-you sessions
between Davis' California and Washington-based strategists.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of South, Maslin and others marked a major change in
Davis' approach to politicking. For 10 years, while Davis was an
assemblyman and state controller, his campaigns had been run by
Michael Berman and Carl D'Agostino, the mechanics behind the vaunted
Berman-Waxman political machine on Los Angeles' Westside. Berman and
D'Agostino, who demanded utter obedience from their candidates,
shunned polling and focus groups and other standard campaign
practices. Their strategy was to garner endorsements and raise large
sums of money--a practice Davis has continued--then lay on a barrage
of last-minute TV advertising and direct mail.</TE>
<TE>   The tactics served Davis well for a time. But Davis and company
stumbled badly in the 1992 U.S. Senate primary when they faced former
San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein. The campaign produced an ad
comparing Feinstein with Leona Helmsley, the New York City hotelier
and tax cheat. Davis lost in a landslide and spent years living down
the spot. He severed his ties to Berman and D'Agostino and never
again wholly trusted someone else's instincts; indeed, aides say
Davis' attention to campaign detail is a direct result of that
disastrous Senate run.</TE>
<TE>   Calls Can Be</TE>
<TE>   Disagreeable</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the 8:30 sessions are robust and not always agreeable,
according to half a dozen of those who have participated. "No one is
namby-pamby," South said. "It doesn't sound like a corporate board
meeting. These are all very strong-willed people, starting with the
guy at the top." (Davis has insisted, for instance, that his positive
TV spots always include a list of his endorsements scrolling across
the screen.)</TE>
<TE>   The candor, aides say, comes from the shared-foxhole experience of
four years ago, when few gave Davis much hope of being governor prior
to his come-from-behind primary victory. They also share a basic
philosophical accord.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at politics essentially through the same prism," said
South, who described Davis as "a buffer between the right-wing
instincts of Republicans and the much more liberal instincts of many
Democrats in state government."</TE>
<TE>   The governor declined to be interviewed for this article.</TE>
<TE>   Two key additions to his team are Schenk and Kennedy. Schenk, who
served with Davis in Gov. Jerry Brown's administration, is a former
member of Congress from San Diego. Kennedy is a former abortion
rights activist and state Democratic Party official, who was also a
top advisor to Sen. Feinstein.</TE>
<TE>   The women--who declined to discuss their strategic roles in the
campaign--have brought a different set of political antenna, as
demonstrated during the recent gubernatorial primary. Davis wanted
his team to bloody GOP front-runner Richard Riordan, to check his
momentum heading into the November election. But Kennedy and Schenk
saw strength in Riordan's rival, businessman Bill Simon Jr., and that
caused Davis and other advisors to rethink their approach.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking at his mannerisms," said South, scoffing at
Simon's wooden delivery. "They were listening more to what he was
saying and saw his discipline at sticking to that message."</TE>
<TE>   Convinced by Schenk and Kennedy that Simon could win with a lift
from the Davis team, the governor's strategists poured millions of
dollars into anti-Riordan advertising, helping push Simon past the
former Los Angeles mayor and giving Davis the November opponent he
preferred.</TE>
<TE>   It is just that sort of brute calculation, along with Davis'
ravenous fund-raising, that gives the governor a reputation for
placing political preservation above all other thoughts. Republicans,
led by Simon, have made that image a central part of their assault on
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Frugal With</TE>
<TE>   Campaign Money</TE>
<TE>   Aides to the governor call the criticism unfair. For one thing,
they say, Davis does less polling than people think--and less than
some advisors would like. (Insiders gripe that Davis, notoriously
frugal in his private life, is just as tight with campaign dollars.)</TE>
<TE>   Maslin, the governor's pollster, said people underestimate the
instincts Davis has developed after nearly 30 years in politics.
"He's extremely smart about the state and its voters and what they're
willing to do and how he can shape that," Maslin said. "He rarely
needs me around, or anyone to tell him, 'You're wrong about this' or
'Didn't you realize that?' "</TE>
<TE>   He suggested those who fault Davis for being overly political fail
to grasp one of the fundamentals of successful leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "Politics is not a bad word," said Maslin, who has worked for
hundreds of campaigns over the last 20 years. "Leadership is a very
delicate balance between taking people where you think they ought to
go and making sure you can get them there."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' campaign advisors help achieve that balance, Maslin said,
adding, "What good is policy if ... you can't get anything done?"</TE>

<HD>Anaheim Doctor Freed by Israel, on Way Home</HD>
<DH>Arrest: Held two weeks in terrorism probe, he is expelled
and barred from returning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Anaheim doctor detained for two weeks by Israel on suspicion of
terrorist activity was scheduled to arrive home today after being
released, expelled and indefinitely barred from returning, family
members said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In brief phone calls from the Tel Aviv airport Sunday morning,
Riad Abdelkarim divulged few details about his detention, but
mentioned that he signed papers barring him from returning to Israel,
where he had frequently traveled on volunteer medical relief
missions, relatives said.</LD>
<LD>   During his most recent trip, Abdelkarim was sent to Israel to
assess Palestinian medical needs for the International Medical Corps,
a Los Angeles-based global humanitarian organization. Israeli
security officials detained him May 5.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't want him to go back," said Abdelkarim's wife, Wijdan,
whose parents remain in the Palestinian territories. "We just want
him here with his family. The last two weeks have just been
miserable."</TE>
<TE>   As word of Abdelkarim's release raced through the Muslim community
Sunday, overjoyed family members and friends expressed elation,
relief and gratitude for American freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   "You take so many things for granted in America until something
like this happens," said Abdelkarim's brother, Basil, a Bellflower
doctor. "Then you think, 'How lucky we are to be free in America.'"</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli consular official in Los Angeles could not provide
further details about Abdelkarim's case.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor's detention had become a national cause celebre among
American Muslims, who criticized Israeli authorities for never
producing evidence or formal charges to back their claim that the
doctor may have been involved in funneling funds to the Hamas
militant group. A second aid worker arrested and detained with
Abdelkarim, Dalell Mohmed of Dallas, was released last week.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials have largely declined to comment on the cases,
but police sources told Israeli newspapers last week that they
suspected Abdelkarim may have been trying to use charitable funds to
support Hamas "terror attacks" in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Abdelkarim and Mohmed had served on the board of the Holy Land
Foundation, a Texas-based Islamic relief organization outlawed by
Israel in 1997 and the United States in December on charges that it
provided funds for Hamas suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   But Abdelkarim was cleared of any wrongdoing by the FBI, which
questioned him about his Holy Land activities in September. The
foundation, which has denied charges of terrorist activity, is suing
the U.S. government for freezing its funds.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim activists have denounced the Israeli charges as a
"smokescreen" to mask a broad crackdown by the Jewish state against
international aid workers.</TE>
<TE>   Several organizations, from the International Red Cross to United
Nations agencies, have complained about Israeli detention, harassment
and even shooting of aid workers who have attempted to bring food and
medical supplies into the Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, several American humanitarian aid workers who had been
detained in Israel plan to hold a news conference in Washington,
D.C., on their experiences.</TE>
<TE>   "The accusations against Riad have been inconsistent and
far-fetched," said Salam Al-Marayati of the Muslim Public Affairs
Council in Los Angeles. "The only thing that has been consistent has
been the Israeli policy of preventing humanitarian aid in the
region."</TE>
<TE>   In other developments, several of Abdelkarim's supporters met with
his congressional representative, Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport
Beach) on Sunday, and shared Muslim community concerns that U.S.
officials had failed to aggressively seek the doctor's release,
Al-Marayati said.</TE>

<LD>A Dana Point man died Sunday while kayaking in the calm waters of
Dana Point Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   An autopsy is scheduled today to determine why William Boos, 46,
died.</LD>
<LD>   Boos was kayaking with a friend in the outer channel of the
harbor's west end when he apparently toppled into the water about
8:15 a.m., according to police.</LD>
<TE>   "His friend turned around to say something to him and saw him in
the water," said Lt. Greg Russell, a spokesman for the Orange County
Sheriff's Department. "He disappeared under the water before his
friend could get to him."</TE>
<TE>   The unidentified friend was paddling in another kayak about 30
yards away, Russell said. The friend jumped into the water, but could
not find Boos and called police.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said it is unclear whether Boos could swim.</TE>

<HD>Inland Empire Pays Price for Housing Crisis</HD>
<DH>Census: Home costs in L.A., Orange counties are driving
people east. U.S. data depict a region unable to keep pace with huge
population growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first blush, the numbers seemed downright humbling. The batch of
data released by the U.S. Census Bureau last week seemed to suggest
that the Inland Empire was some sort of failed experiment in mega
suburbia--27,000 square miles of plummeting incomes, limited
education, dropping real estate values and soaring poverty.</LD>
<LD>   But so far, the news has generated little chagrin in Riverside and
San Bernardino counties. Instead of soul-searching, government and
business leaders immediately looked across their borders and angrily
laid the blame on Los Angeles and Orange counties.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, they said, the region struggled with an influx of senior
citizens. Some questioned whether the Census Bureau used the
appropriate inflation indexes to compute changes in the economic
climate. But more than anything, the officials charged, the Inland
Empire's economy is falling victim to the lack of affordable housing
closer to the coast.</LD>
<TE>   "What you are seeing is the exporting of the coastal communities'
problems to the inland region," said John Husing, a prominent Inland
Empire economist, consultant and booster.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts agreed, and said the figures point to a disturbing
caste system developing in California as the cost of housing soars.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, the housing affordability index--the percentage of
people who can afford a median-price home in California--fell this
spring to 29% from 34%, according to the California Assn. of
Realtors. It was the lowest mark in two years, and many fear that the
trend will continue if mortgage rates keep climbing.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the median price for a home has risen
nearly 19% over the last year to $267,000; the price in Orange County
is up 12.3%, to $370,000.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, some fear, California's wealthy and its middle- and
low-income families will lead separate lives--the wealthy along the
coast, the others farther inland, two separate castes divided roughly
by the Golden State Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   That prospect has some in the Inland Empire insisting that
California consider dramatic changes in tax structures and other
programs to repay inland counties for shouldering the
affordable-housing load and the social problems--such as high crime
rates and increasingly crowded schools--that accompany development.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, said Max Neiman, a professor of political science at UC
Riverside who studies development policy and the effects of growth,
"this is the social sorting of the state's population."</TE>
<TE>   "This is the way it has been forever in Southern California," he
said. "Where is the plus side for having been good citizens on the
housing scene?"</TE>
<TE>   The census figures painted a dreary portrait of the Inland Empire.
Adjusted for inflation, median household income across giant swaths
of the Inland Empire fell between 1990 and 2000--by 8.3% in Riverside
County and 3.6% in San Bernardino County. Median home values dropped
markedly in many areas, and the 20.3% decline in San Bernardino
County was bigger than all but three counties in the state. Poverty
levels rose sharply in both counties.</TE>
<TE>   Few areas in the Inland Empire--home to 14 of Southern
California's 20 fastest-growing cities, a region whose booming
population of 3.2 million is expected to double in the next 25
years--escaped the gloomy findings.</TE>
<TE>   In the region's two largest cities, Riverside and San Bernardino,
the percentage of people living in poverty rose 48.6% and 37.4%,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Even the region's pockets of wealth--from Redlands, where the
median home value fell 13.4%, to Temecula, where the percentage of
people living in poverty soared--did not escape unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not bode well," Neiman said. "These are dismal figures."</TE>
<TE>   All told, the data continue to raise questions about the Inland
Empire's long-standing belief that unfettered development will foster
economic power.</TE>
<TE>   And the figures make it clear that the region, which has long
complained that it is seen as a second-class dumping ground by its
richer, coastal cousins, has become overwhelmed by a population boom
made up largely of housing refugees from the coast.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a housing crisis, and we are going to continue to be
that way," said Frank Williams, chief executive officer of the Baldy
View chapter of the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California.
The chapter represents builders in San Bernardino County and eastern
Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Many believe that the numbers point to a fundamental flaw in the
Inland Empire's struggle to build houses fast enough for new
arrivals.</TE>
<TE>   The region's focus on new communities--seen as the best hope for
high-quality development, better jobs and higher retail
sales--remains keen, largely because builders wield enormous
political clout in the region.</TE>
<TE>   But older communities are virtually ignored, many say.</TE>
<TE>   So though Murietta, which has new, gated neighborhoods in southern
Riverside County, saw its median household income rise dramatically,
income levels fell in Perris, an older city of about 35,000 southeast
of Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   "We are constantly barraged with all these challenges to keep up
with growth, which I think is happening too fast," said Riverside
County Supervisor Bob Buster. "That diverts our attention, and the
two counties become disjointed where you have this great gap between
communities."</TE>
<TE>   That gap tends to feed development in remote communities that once
never dreamed of becoming commuter bedrooms serving Los Angeles and
Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   Banning, for example, off Interstate 10 east of Beaumont, watched
its population grow by about 14% in the 1990s, or nearly 3,000. More
building is expected, said Vickie Burt, the town's economic
development and redevelopment manager, most of it in the form of
single-family houses.</TE>
<TE>   "It is this domino effect," Burt said.</TE>
<TE>   "People continue to search for value in housing. So we're seeing
new rooftops."</TE>
<TE>   Some government agencies are beginning to recognize the growing
disparity between newer and older communities.</TE>
<TE>   The San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors, for example,
recently approved a $650,000 program that will help homeowners in
Redlands and Highland rehabilitate older houses. A local subsidiary
of a national nonprofit housing organization will provide
low-interest loans for repairs.</TE>

<HD>Housing Crisis Stings Inland Empire</HD>
<DH>Census: Home costs in Orange, L.A. counties are driving
people--some bringing problems--east.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIVERSIDE</DL>
<LD>At first blush, the numbers seemed downright humbling. The batch of
data released by the U.S. Census Bureau last week seemed to suggest
that the Inland Empire was some sort of failed experiment in mega
suburbia--27,000 square miles of plummeting incomes, limited
education, dropping real estate values and soaring poverty.</LD>
<LD>   But so far, the news has generated little chagrin in Riverside and
San Bernardino counties. Instead of soul-searching, government and
business leaders immediately looked across their borders and angrily
laid the blame on Los Angeles and Orange counties.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, they said, the region struggled with an influx of senior
citizens. Some questioned whether the Census Bureau used the
appropriate inflation indexes to compute changes in the economic
climate. But more than anything, the officials charged, the Inland
Empire's economy is falling victim to the lack of affordable housing
closer to the coast.</LD>
<TE>   "What you are seeing is the exporting of the coastal communities'
problems to the inland region," said John Husing, a prominent Inland
Empire economist, consultant and booster.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts agreed, and said the figures point to a disturbing
caste system developing in California as the cost of housing soars.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, the housing affordability index--the percentage of
people who can afford a median-price home in California--fell this
spring to 29% from 34%, according to the California Assn. of
Realtors. It was the lowest mark in two years, and many fear that the
trend will continue if mortgage rates keep climbing.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the median price for a home has risen
nearly 19% over the past year to $267,000; the price in Orange County
is up 12.3%, to $370,000.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, some fear, California's wealthy and its middle- and
low-income families will lead separate lives--the wealthy along the
coast, the others farther inland, two separate castes divided roughly

<TE>   Los Angeles officials familiar with the affordable-housing
situation there did not return phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Domer, an Orange County Housing and Community Development
Department section chief, said his agency realizes that the lack of
affordable housing is a problem, and that many people are driven to
seek homes farther inland.</TE>
<TE>   Domer said Orange County is taking substantive steps to address
the problem.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors, for example, plans to allocate
$35 million in the next five years so housing officials can act as
permanent lenders to for-profit and nonprofit groups willing to build
low-income units.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to build 1,000 affordable housing units each year, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize there is a problem," Domer said. "That's why we're
doing our best to act on it."</TE>

<LD>Four people were killed and four others injured late Saturday and
early Sunday in four Orange County traffic accidents, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Randall Coffey, 18, of Norwalk was killed shortly before midnight
Saturday when his Mazda RX-7 hit a tree on Valley View Street south
of La Palma Avenue in Buena Park. Police said Coffey might have been
speeding while making an illegal lane change where the street
narrowed from three lanes to two.</LD>
<LD>   "He either was trying to pass someone or failed to make the
transition into the second lane and hit the curb," said Buena Park
Sgt. John Swisher.</LD>
<TE>   Coffey's car struck a telephone pole, swerved back across the
lanes and hit a tree in the center divider, Swisher said.</TE>
<TE>   An unnamed female passenger was thrown from the car but did not
suffer life-threatening injuries. She was hospitalized at UCI Medical
Center in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   In Huntington Beach, a 20-year-old Long Beach man was killed early
Sunday after his vehicle drifted into oncoming traffic and collided
with another car.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Matthew Rhoten was headed south on Springdale Street
between McFadden and Bolsa avenues about 12:30 a.m. when he struck a
car driven by Victor Shaw, 19, of Wildomar in Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw's car burst into flames, and firefighters used power tools to
extricate him. Shaw was reported stable with a fractured leg and
dislocated hip at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   One passenger in Shaw's car, Thomas Penaflor, 19, of Buena Park,
was hospitalized at UCI Medical Center with chest pains and head
injuries. The other passenger, Rent Horton, 18, was taken to Long
Beach Medical Center with abdominal injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Police said an autopsy and other tests will determine whether
Rhoten, who was pronounced dead at the scene, was driving under the
influence of alcohol or drugs.</TE>
<TE>   In the third accident, authorities said Jesse Lee Nixon, 20, was
killed shortly before 8 a.m. Sunday when his car veered off Portola
Parkway north of Sand Canyon Avenue in Irvine. Nixon was in the Navy
and assigned to the aircraft carrier Constellation.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said an investigation was underway and that slick
pavement might have contributed to the crash.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth accident, Brian Carrillo, 34, of Santa Ana died
Sunday afternoon after being thrown from his motorcycle into the
oncoming lanes of the Orange Freeway in Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   The Highway Patrol said it was unclear why Carrillo, who was
southbound, lost control of his motorcycle about 3:30 p.m. just north
of Yorba Linda Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of that accident was under investigation, a dispatcher
said.</TE>

<HD>Fire Officials Brace for Long, Grueling Season</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After one of the driest winters in Southern California's recorded
history, the ingredients are all here to make this a summer memorable
for wildfires. Fire crews, already dousing flare-ups in the region's
scrubby hills, are gearing up for an intense season and preaching the
commandments of brush clearance.</LD>
<LD>   Last year's fire season never really ended. It just slipped into
this year's. The parched chaparral snaps like kindling. The grass is
brittle and matted, the color of dirty straw.</LD>
<LD>   Still, predictions can be tricky. "Ask me what sort of fire season
we are going to have and I say, 'I'll tell you in November,'" said
John Craney, a state fire protection official.</LD>
<TE>   Nature can defy expectations. Consider the final year of the last
drought, when less wild land burned than had in decades. The
conditions were right for fires, but weather and man didn't start
any.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions are right again.</TE>
<TE>   The twig Ken Pimlott plucked from a chamise bush near the edge of
the Cleveland National Forest in Riverside County last week was brown
and half naked, bereft of new growth. "For me to walk up and break
this, at this time of year--that's the problem," said Pimlott, a
division chief for the state Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moisture Levels Ominously Low</TE>
<TE>   In wildfire parlance, fuel moisture levels are ominously low for
May. The chaparral normally would not be this dry until the fall. Men
who've been fighting fires for longer than the 36-year-old Pimlott
has been alive tell him they've never seen the brush so dry so early
in the season.</TE>
<TE>   In the Inyo National Forest bordering the Owens Valley, some
stations are reporting the lowest fuel moisture since they began
collecting data 17 years ago. In the Angeles National Forest
recently, stream banks were dry enough to allow flames to creep along
them.</TE>
<TE>   "In some sense, we've never left the fire season this year south
of the Tehachapis," said Paul Smith, assistant chief of fire
prevention for the state Forestry Department's southern region, which
begins south of Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The agency brought in air tankers and helicopters weeks before it
normally would and has added seasonal staff ahead of the customary
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Forest Service in Southern California, likewise, has
geared up a month early. Conditions are not so worrisome in Northern
California, where winter rainfall levels were closer to normal.</TE>
<TE>   Drought elsewhere in the West presents another potential
complication. Should a number of major wildfires break out
simultaneously across the Southwest, firefighting resources could be
spread thin, leaving fewer crews to respond to the early stages of a
blaze in any one region.</TE>
<TE>   Even with its tinder-dry landscape, Southern California could
escape a bad fire season this year if weather and people are
cooperative. "Who knows?" Pimlott said. "We could have some monsoonal
weather and summer rain."</TE>
<TE>   People are the other big variable. The vast majority of wildfires
fought by the state Department of Forestry are caused by man. Most
are accidental, but arson accounts for 10% to 12%. About half the
fires in national forests are caused by man, the other half by
nature, often lightning in the northern sectors of the state.</TE>
<TE>   As development pushes ever farther out, there are more and more
homes on the wild land fringes, which makes the job tougher for
Pimlott and his firefighting colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Near the spot where he pulled off the tip of the chamise bush,
shopping centers and housing for about 15,000 people will be built
within a few years--right on the edge of the scrub-covered Cleveland
forest. A few miles away is a 10-year-old development plopped between
the forest and another preserve.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these people just don't understand, or are not aware of
the fire problem," Pimlott said.</TE>
<TE>   County and local ordinances have helped force awareness in the
Southland's newer developments, which are required to plant
fire-resistant buffers and use fire-resistant roofing.</TE>
<TE>   Called "defensible zones" by firefighters, such buffers are a
prime reason million-dollar houses escaped damage from an 1,100-acre
suspected arson blaze near Rancho Santa Margarita in south Orange
County last week .</TE>
<TE>   "It moved very fast and threatened a tremendous number of homes in
a relatively short period," said Steve Miller, a spokesman for the
Orange County Fire Authority.</TE>
<TE>   In light of this year's fire-friendly conditions, he said, his
agency is planning a major education campaign in coming weeks to urge
homeowners to clean up dead and highly flammable vegetation.</TE>
<TE>   "We recommend 100 feet of clearance," he said. "That includes any
combustibles you may have up against your home, like sheds or
firewood."</TE>
<TE>   The message will be spread, Miller added, through media campaigns,
public service announcements, seminars and newspaper ads. The
department also is stepping up inspections in high-risk areas.</TE>
<TE>   Too often, said Smith of the state Forestry Department, residents
of outlying areas are blase about fire risk. "People become reliant
on the fire department being there for them. They need to be looking
at what they can do for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   That means not just maintaining a fire-resistant buffer, but also
preparing to flee in an instant.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Preparing to Flee at a Moment's Notice</TE>
<TE>   "If people are in a high-hazard area, they should consider what to
do with pets if there's a fire," Smith said. "Do they have a suitcase
available to grab and run with? They have to be ready to move in a
moment's notice."</TE>
<TE>   Fire is always a part of the California landscape. Even in the
mildest of fire seasons, tens of thousands of acres of wild lands
burn across the state. And when the rains are plentiful, grasses grow
thick and tall--leaving that much more to burn as they dry out over
the course of the summer.</TE>
<TE>   The extremes of the state's normal weather cycle--torrential
winter rains followed by withering summer heat and dryness--mean that
every California fire season has nasty potential.</TE>
<TE>   After years of working for the state Forestry Department, public
information officer Karen Terrill put it this way: "This state was
designed to burn."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For a Safer Fire Season</TE>
<TE>   * Remove branches within 10 feet of chimney, and dead branches
overhanging roof.</TE>
<TE>   * Remove dead leaves, needles from roof and gutters.</TE>
<TE>   * Install fire-resistant roof; contact fire department for current
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   * Cover chimney outlet and stovepipe with nonflammable screen of
half-inch or smaller mesh.</TE>
<TE>   LANDSCAPE</TE>
<TE>   * Create a ``defensible'' space by removing flammable vegetation
at least 30 feet from all structures.</TE>

<HD>University to Receive $7-Million Eisner Gift</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The family foundation of Michael D. Eisner, the chairman and chief
executive of Walt Disney Co., today will announce a $7-million gift
to Cal State Northridge to establish a national center there for
preparing teachers to cope with the vast learning differences among
their students.</LD>
<LD>   The money, to be given over five years, represents the largest
gift ever received by the campus. It will be used to infuse into
classes for prospective teachers the philosophy of Dr. Mel Levine, a
pioneering pediatrician whose North Carolina clinic for diagnosing
learning difficulties draws children from around the globe.</LD>
<LD>   In Eisner's honor, the university intends to recommend to the CSU
Board of Trustees that Northridge's college of education be named the
Michael D. Eisner School of Education.</LD>
<TE>   Eisner, whose company was built on firing the imaginations of
youngsters, said Levine's theory that all children's minds work
differently is common-sensical. Yet, he said, Levine's approach has
an almost magical power to explain why some children struggle within
the orderly confines of classrooms. Children who, for example, have
to be moving to concentrate or who have trouble listening and writing
simultaneously often are misunderstood and humiliated.</TE>
<TE>   "To be humiliated because your mind is wired slightly differently
and the teacher doesn't understand that or hasn't been taught that,
to me is destroying a human being, and it's like child abuse," Eisner
said. "Teachers recognizing the problem is half the solution."</TE>
<TE>   Levine's work draws on more than 20 years as a clinician as well
as the work of cognitive scientists. He said that every person has a
neuro-developmental profile that combines strengths and weaknesses.
One student might have memory deficits that make rapid recall
impossible; another might memorize words to compensate for reading
difficulties. But schools, especially these days, are being pressured
to reduce every child to test scores.</TE>
<TE>   "Testing should be used to figure out who we need to help and how
we're going to help," Levine said. "We have to be careful so that
we're not discriminating against kids and trampling on certain kinds
of minds by the nature of the test."</TE>
<TE>   The gift from the Eisner Foundation will be used to set up the
Center for Teaching and Learning. In addition to its work with
prospective teachers, the center will offer training to instructors
already on the job and will house a student assessment center where
parents whose children experience learning difficulties can come for
help. The gift also will pay for research to evaluate the
effectiveness of Levine's approach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge Gaining More Notice</TE>
<TE>   Last year nearly 900 graduates of Cal State Northridge's education
school obtained teaching credentials, the most of any public
university in the state. Yet, until recently, the university had
gained little notice beyond the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the donation from Eisner, Cal State Northridge
recently was one of four education schools in the nation to win
$5-million matching grants from the Carnegie Corp. The four
schools--including the University of Virginia, Michigan State
University and Bank Street College of Education in New York--will
redesign how teachers are prepared.</TE>
<TE>   Coming so close together, the gift and grant are "a wonderful
confirmation of our excellence," said Cal State Northridge President
Jolene Koester. "We believe it gives us national exposure and
prestige and, while we'll continue to serve the region, it'll allow
us to have a national impact."</TE>
<TE>   Levine was recently featured on ABC's "Oprah" show, in a PBS
documentary and on NBC, all of which helped vault his new book, "A
Mind at a Time," onto the New York Times Book Review's bestseller
list. ABC is owned by Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner and his wife Jane, who is president of the family
foundation, said they do not have personal experience with the often
devastating effects of learning struggles. But in a joint interview
each said they had come to realize that millions of people are
affected. "I haven't met a person who doesn't relate to this in some
way," Jane Eisner said. "It's just extraordinary."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Eisner said that in his 30 years in television and movies
he'd often told stories about classrooms, including television series
such as "Welcome Back, Kotter," "Room 222" and the movie "Dangerous
Minds." And in all, he said, "you always put in the screw-up kid" for
comic relief.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Eisner said Cal State Northridge representatives approached
the foundation with the plan to introduce Levine's work. The
foundation previously donated $1 million to the Etta Israel Center to
train teachers in Levine's "Schools Attuned" methods. As part of that
grant, she met professor Michael Spagna, who will head the new Cal
State Northridge center.</TE>
<TE>   Spagna said prospective teachers at most universities, including
Cal State Northridge, are required to take a class in special
education, which teaches them to look for symptoms of learning
disabilities and to label those who don't fit in.</TE>
<TE>   He said Levine's ideas are "extremely radical" because while
teachers "are taught to be sensitive to the needs of individuals"
they are taught to be "even more sensitive to the needs of the whole
class."</TE>
<TE>   Schools where teachers have been trained in Levine's approach
report that they see fewer discipline problems, fewer children are
held back, and fewer children wind up in special education.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Levine's Approach Making Inroads</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, more than 9,000 teachers have received the "Schools
Attuned" training. But, until the association with Cal State
Northridge, Levine's approach hadn't gained a foothold in schools of
education.</TE>
<TE>   "It's partly that the world of academia is very territorial and
the idea of a pediatrician moving into education is not welcomed by
people in education," Levine said.</TE>
<TE>   Levine was a Rhodes scholar and then attended medical school at
Harvard. During duty in the Philippines with the U.S. Air Force,
Levine became interested in the intricacies of how children learn.
Back in Boston, he was a pediatrician at Children's Hospital Boston.
While there, he helped write the special education law for
Massachusetts.</TE>

<HD>Clinton Still Presides at the Westwood Wing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Clinton, not yet a regular host of a TV show or anything else,
is making frequent guest appearances in the Entertainment Capital,
where he recently had a gabfest with the gaggle of ex-Clinton aides
who came west to work.</LD>
<LD>   At the W hotel in Westwood, it was old home week--actually, old
White House week. Clinton let it be known that he thinks those in his
ex-coterie are still nostalgic for Pennsylvania Avenue even though
(like him) they're making more money and enjoying more free time.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton is putting together a Web site so they can all keep in
touch, and he spent a good bit of time chatting up a book he'd
obviously read and reread: "Blinded by the Right, the Conscience of
an Ex-Conservative." That's the mea culpa bestseller by David Brock,
who spent much of the 1990s hammering on the Clintons for fun and
profit on behalf of various conservative outfits, and now says he was
wrong, wrong, wrong.</LD>
<TE>   Clinton, who seems to have practically committed passages to
memory, told his former aides that whenever they feel down, they
should read Brock's book to illuminate anew what they were all
fighting against for eight years, and as a reminder of what "unhappy"
people their counterparts on the right truly are.</TE>

<TE>   Merry-Go-Round Stops for the O.C. Fair Board</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's Republican stronghold is peeved enough at the
Democratic hegemony in Sacramento, but now it's serious--the county
fair could be taken over by Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the plummiest political appointment in the
once-agricultural county has been a seat on the Orange County Fair
and Exposition Board, which oversees the fair's run every July.</TE>
<TE>   Three seats expire this year: those of former Assemblyman Curt
Pringle, local GOP maven Emily Sanford and lobbyist Randy Smith. All
were put there by Gov. Gray Davis' Republican predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   Pringle's chance at another term is lower than circus sawdust, but
he wants to hang on for one last fling at this year's fair. The three
openings mean Davis can put a Democratic majority on the fair board
for the first time in two decades; this is no trifling matter. A
majority of baby boomer Democrats, says one fair fan, could mean "we
get better rock 'n' roll bands."</TE>
<TE>   The fair board doesn't get paid, but the job is worth its weight
in corndogs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the Record, Brulte Gets a Big Idea</TE>
<TE>   Big Jim Brulte may be bigger than he thinks.</TE>
<TE>   The state Senate's tall and wide GOP leader was saying his piece
about Gov. Gray Davis' proposed budget in a Capitol hallway not far
from Davis' office. Suddenly, there in the scrum of reporters was
Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary, hoisting his tape recorder
toward Brulte like everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   As the lawmaker recognized Maviglio, he interrupted himself to
cheerily declare, "You know when you've made it when the governor's
press secretary wants to record everything you say."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just the Player to Tackle the Problem</TE>
<TE>   With the Chargers thinking about divorcing San Diego unless they
get a new stadium, the pro football team has added a veteran all-pro
political left guard, Mark Fabiani, a first-round draft pick out of
Harvard, who's played on the teams of Tom Bradley, Bill Clinton and
Al Gore.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Fabiani quit his $30,000-a-month energy-crisis
consulting job with Gov. Gray Davis after it was learned that Fabiani
also did consulting work for Southern California Edison.</TE>
<TE>   Fabiani's real sport is hardball. As deputy mayor in L.A., he kept
hammering at Police Chief Daryl Gates, and he infuriated Council
President John Ferraro when he tried to pull an Al Haig "I'm in
charge here" and act as mayor when Bradley left town. So watch out,
Charger quarterback Doug Flutie--Purdue rookie Drew Brees may not be
the only one wanting to call the signals in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just Color Him Out the Door Already</TE>
<TE>   That's gratitude for you.</TE>
<TE>   Just when Los Angeles' Community Redevelopment Agency was over the
hump, out of the red, in the pink--name your metaphor for getting
better--the agency is looking to hire a new administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Scharlin was a corporate turnaround artist with zero
experience in redevelopment when he was hired in 1999 to reorganize
the agency. But his contract expires at the end of July, so in spite
of the city having green-lighted one of its largest-ever urban
renewal projects, City Hall sources say chances are there will be a
new name on the administrator's door.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * The Freudian question "What do women want?" gets a California
twist on Friday at a Women's TownHall event in Los Angeles featuring
both Gray Davis and Bill Simon speaking on "What Women Want For
California."</TE>
<TE>   * Last week's Kennedy Center event sponsored by Vital Voices
Global Partnership honored women around the world who have labored
for women's rights. Among the women honoring such women was actress
Julia Ormond, who flew in from California and who is working on a
film about profiteer-trafficking of Russian women.</TE>
<TE>   * A big grant from mega-media-mogul Haim Saban, he of the Power
Rangers, has founded the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the
Brookings Institution, which was inaugurated last week with a speech
by the king of Jordan. Saban already has planted a big footprint in
D.C. with Democratic donations, most stunningly his recent $7-million
contribution to building a new headquarters for the party whose HQ
was once, famously, in the Watergate complex.</TE>
<TE>   * The long-suffering Southern California Assn. of
Governments--SCAG being, among other things, a homonym of a synonym
for both heroin and hookers--has begun referring to itself as the
"association of governments," hoping that everybody else will take
the hint and follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   * Gerry Schipske, the Democratic nurse practitioner and lawyer, is
running for Congress in the South Bay-Long Beach district again, and
trying to take her ideas to the streets with issue-specific,
downloadable bumper stickers bearing messages about teaching, the
environment, Social Security and health care.</TE>
<TE>   * A retired Lafayette ironworker who registered his toy poodle,
Barnabas, as a Republican voter has been charged with misdemeanor
vote fraud, even though Barnabas has never voted and Donald Miller
said he did it to show how flabby voter registration checks are.</TE>
<TE>   * In a job move that should come with combat pay, Carolina
Guevara--former second-in-command spokeswoman for former L.A. Mayor
Richard Riordan--will be the new second-in-command spokeswoman for
the Los Angeles Roman Catholic Archdiocese.</TE>

<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you know, I must admit I'd like to see it. It doesn't sound
good to me. I'd like to know a little bit more about it, but I think
that to commercialize September the 11th is something that is not a
good idea."</TE>
<TE>   --Bill Simon, on the Larry Elder radio show, answering a question
about the propriety of including a Sept. 11 photo of President Bush
as part of a three-picture deal--a $150 premium for a fund-raising
dinner next month for Republican congressional candidates. Through a
spokesman, Simon later amended his answer, saying that once he found
out the picture was of Bush discussing the attack, and not the attack
itself, he saw no problem.</TE>

<HD>Secession May Leave Hilly Area Isolated</HD>
<DH>Resources: Residents above Sunset Strip are concerned about
police and fire services if Valley and Hollywood break away from Los
Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what's been described as an "unintended consequence" of the
secession movement, an expanse of hillsides and canyons above
Hollywood, home to about 20,000 people, may be virtually cut off from
the rest of Los Angeles if the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood
secede from the city.</LD>
<LD>   The odd situation has produced, at least in this corner of Los
Angeles, a lot of believers in what the 17th-century author John
Donne once sermonized: "No man is an island."</LD>
<LD>   The area is bounded by the cities of West Hollywood and Beverly
Hills to the south and west.</LD>
<TE>   If the two secession movements succeed, the area of mostly opulent
homes will be cut off on the north and the east from the city
agencies that serve the area. Among them are the Los Angeles Police
Department's Hollywood Division, and the Los Angeles Fire Department,
which has stations in Hollywood's core and near Mulholland Drive in
the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The area's only physical connection to the city would be through
the rugged Santa Monica Mountains to the west.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the possible secession fallout is slowly spreading in the
hills and canyons.</TE>
<TE>   "There hasn't been much talk about it, but we're acutely aware of
it because of the isolation of this area," said attorney Daniel
Clivner, a board member of the Sunset Doheny Homes Assn., a residents
group above the Sunset Strip. Clivner offers an arresting visual
image for how the area could be flanked by two new cities:</TE>
<TE>   "[Secession] won't be very good for us because we would be a
hamburger with a bun."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Kim Sudhalter, a Hollywood publicist who has lived in Laurel
Canyon for five years: "We don't want to be an island. We need
adequate access to city services, including police and fire. We had a
fire here last year, and it could have been very bad. But because of
a speedy response by the L.A. Fire Department, it was contained
quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The scenario of being walled off from the rest of Los Angeles has
raised a series of questions, for which city officials and others
involved in secession acknowledge they currently don't have
definitive answers.</TE>
<TE>   Chief among them: whether a portion of a city legally can be
separated from the rest of it because of secession.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, a municipality must have a contiguous boundary
with territory it wants to annex. Gone are the days when cities, such
as San Diego, drew imaginary lines to annex territory physically
separated from them. In the early 1960s, city officials drew a
boundary line under San Diego Bay to the border community of San
Ysidro, nearly 20 miles from downtown San Diego, in order to annex
it.</TE>
<TE>   But that law concerns annexation, not incorporating a new city. In
this case, officials say, there's nothing--apparently--to prevent the
creation of an enclave of one city by the formation of a new city
through secession.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Local Agency Formation Commission of Los Angeles
County, which is in charge of setting the terms, conditions and
boundaries for new cities, say they are aware of the possibility that
an isolated pocket of L.A. could be created if secessionists succeed.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO Executive Officer Larry Calemine points out that the
situation could have been avoided easily if, for example, Hollywood
secession proponents had sought to include the area within the new
city.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who circulated the [secession petitions] can draw the
boundaries any way they see it," Calemine said.</TE>
<TE>   But those efforts were rebuffed by some in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a pro-L.A. person," said Cassandra Barrere, president of the
Laurel Canyon Assn., which counts among its members the residents of
about 500 homes. "I'm a native. I think about it as an entire city.
For me, [secession] is just a time-consuming political machination."</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO hasn't acted on the "island" possibility because its main
focus has been to analyze whether secession proposals for the Valley,
Hollywood and the harbor area are viable and will be placed on an
election ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But some residents in the hills are worried, and unhappy.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been talking about Valley secession for decades,"
said attorney Paul Titcher, who lives above the Sunset Strip. "The
Hollywood proposal came from out of nowhere and surprised a lot of
people. As it turns out, secession by the Valley and Hollywood would
have a tremendously drastic effect on the safety of our neighborhood
and our quality of life."</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Denny, a leader in the Sunset Doheny group, echoes that
view, adding that many people probably aren't aware of what might
happen if secession prevails.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most people are apathetic," said Denny, who moved into
the area 41 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Los Angeles City Councilman Jack Weiss, who
represents the area, reported that his office is beginning to hear
concerns from nervous residents.</TE>
<TE>   The first-term lawmaker, who is an ardent secession opponent, says
the possible formation of an isolated enclave demonstrates that
secession may have impacts no one can anticipate.</TE>
<TE>   "You could argue that people in this area are fortunate to see and
understand the impact of secession on their lives. Most people
through the city have no way of knowing the unintended consequences
of secession."</TE>
<TE>   Weiss' staff and other officials are trying to figure out how to
ensure the continuation of municipal services in the affected area.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if both Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley break
away, which LAPD division would provide police protection?</TE>
<TE>   Weiss says it's unclear whether the Hollywood Division can
continue to serve the enclave if Hollywood becomes a separate city.</TE>
<TE>   "People are justifiably worried about it," the lawmaker says.
"Maybe the rest of us can look at this as a cautionary tale of what
secession means for the whole city."</TE>
<TE>   Others take another view.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine says it's not unusual for law-enforcement units in one
city to cross through another city to respond to an emergency in
their jurisdiction. "It happens all the time," he says.</TE>

<HD>J. Chichester-Clark, 79; Led N. Ireland for 2 Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>James Chichester-Clark, whose 1969-71 tenure as prime minister of
Northern Ireland was marked by escalating sectarian violence that
brought more British troops, has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Chichester-Clark, who was given the title Lord Moyola in 1971,
died May 17 after a short illness, his family said.</LD>
<LD>   He was prime minister in the British province when rioting in
Belfast and Londonderry forced him to ask British Prime Minister
Harold Wilson's government to send in troops. The situation
deteriorated, however, and Chichester-Clark faced a Protestant
backlash when the British government urged reforms to make public
housing allocation fairer for Catholics.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout 1970, the ranks of Protestant paramilitaries grew, and
there were increasing gun battles between the British army and the
Irish Republican Army.</TE>
<TE>   The killings of three British soldiers in Belfast in March 1971
sparked a new Protestant campaign demanding that Chichester-Clark
resign.</TE>
<TE>   He flew to London to ask Prime Minister Edward Heath for a
dramatic security response, but was given only 1,300 more soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, Chichester-Clark resigned, saying that he saw no
other way of "bringing home to all concerned the realities of the
present constitutional, political and security situation."</TE>
<TE>   He became an active member of the House of Lords, speaking
regularly on Northern Ireland issues and rural affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Britain now rules Northern Ireland directly.</TE>
<TE>   Chichester-Clark was born Feb. 12, 1923. He joined the army and
during World War II was an officer in the Irish Guards. He was
wounded during fighting in Italy in 1944 and retired in 1960 as a
major.</TE>
<TE>   He was a member of the Northern Ireland Parliament at Stormont
from 1960 to 1972. He represented South Derry before becoming leader
of the house and minister of agriculture. He was named prime minister
in May 1969 after Terence O'Neill stepped down.</TE>
<TE>   One of Chichester-Clark's first acts was to order an amnesty for
those convicted of, or accused of, political offenses in the previous
seven months. However, that gesture generated little response, as did
his appeal to opposition lawmakers to jointly declare that Northern
Ireland was at peace and would remain so.</TE>

<HD>A Larger Role Model for Fitness</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>At 240 pounds, Jennifer Portnick might seem to be someone who would
stay at the back of the aerobics class, hoping not to attract too
much attention among her fitness-obsessed counterparts at the gym.</LD>
<LD>   But when Portnick takes the stage in a coral crop top and black
bicycle shorts to lead her followers in a high-energy, 75-minute
workout, she leaves no doubt that she is calling the shots.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps she settled that question when she reached an agreement
late last month with Jazzercise, the dance-fitness firm that had
denied her a franchise because she didn't look the part. Or maybe it
was when she appeared on a morning talk show in a bra top to discuss
the agreement--in which Jazzercise reversed its policy--before a
national audience.</LD>
<TE>   Portnick decided not to teach for Jazzercise, although the company
no longer prevents a person of her size from becoming an instructor.
In exchange for that concession, she dropped a complaint she had
filed against the company with the San Francisco Human Rights
Commission. She now leads her own aerobics classes in San Francisco
and the East Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be possible for people of varying weights to be fit," the
Carlsbad-based company affirmed in a written statement May 6.
"Jazzercise has determined that the value of 'fit appearance' as a
standard is debatable, and has therefore eliminated this as a means
of evaluating franchise applicants."</TE>
<TE>   Portnick said her newfound celebrity, and her status as hero in
the burgeoning size-acceptance movement, "is entirely accidental.
I've always been a private person. But it's been such an opportunity
for education, and it has also struck a nerve with a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   She certainly didn't start out proud of her ample proportions. A
38-year-old computer systems training manager, Portnick said she
began dieting when she was 5 and has taken diet drugs such as the
fen-phen combination, Meridia and Dexatrim.</TE>
<TE>   "After 25 years of dieting, I decided this is not healthy," Portnick
said.  "The first time I went to an aerobics class, I could not keep up,
but I loved moving to music.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not athletic as a kid. I thought physical activity was
punishment. I always thought you couldn't be fit if you were my
size," she said. "Eventually, I realized that not only could you be
fit, but you could have a ball doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Portnick took Jazzercise classes for 15 years. Last year, her
instructor, Kristi Howard, suggested that she train to be an
instructor herself.</TE>
<TE>   "She's always been in the front of my class, and she was doing a
good, high-energy workout," Howard said. "My plan was to have her
teach the low-impact classes with me because I know there's
definitely a market for people who want to exercise and don't
necessarily want to see me up there.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tall, so it's easier for me to stay thinner than a lot of
people," Howard added. "I thought having Jennifer on board would be
great for my business."</TE>
<TE>   Portnick upped her workouts from three days a week to six, and
studied and trained intensively for the evaluations that could
eventually lead to her certification as a Jazzercise instructor. But
after the district manager saw her work out, Portnick was told she
had to lose weight before she could advance to the next round of
evaluations.</TE>
<TE>   "Jazzercise sells fitness," Maureen Brown, the company's director
of franchise programs and services, wrote to Portnick last July.
"Consequently, a Jazzercise applicant must have a higher
muscle-to-fat ratio and look leaner than the public. People must
believe Jazzercise will help them improve, not just maintain their
level of fitness."</TE>
<TE>   Portnick said she took the rejection personally.</TE>
<TE>   "No one ever questioned whether I could jump or kick or keep
up with the steps," she said. "I was quite devastated, because I
thought I was not being judged fairly."</TE>
<TE>   Portnick met Sondra Solovay, her attorney, at a meeting of
professionals in the size-acceptance movement. That's when Portnick
realized that what had happened to her might be against the law. San
Francisco is one of the few places in the country that prohibits
discrimination based on height or weight. Other jurisdictions with
similar rules are Santa Cruz, Michigan and Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   She filed her complaint in September. After weeks of mediation,
the two parties came to their agreement. It was the first case to be
settled under San Francisco's year-old "fat and short" law.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't looking for a lawyer," Portnick said. "But based on the
fact that there is this law and I do live in San Francisco, I felt
this was an opportunity for positive change. I'm thrilled about it,
and my hope has been fulfilled."</TE>
<TE>   Portnick's victory has catapulted her into a national symbol of
the active, happy fat person who won't be intimidated.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Jennifer is a real role model in terms of the fitness
industry, and she's a role model in terms of civil rights," said
Solovay, a weight-discrimination attorney and author of the book
"Tipping the Scales of Justice."</TE>
<TE>   "Your civil rights aren't going to find you on the couch. You have
to go out and get them," Solovay said.</TE>
<TE>   Portnick's three weekly classes at Miraloma Community Church in
San Francisco attract people with a wide range of sizes and fitness
levels. She knows all of her students by name, and shouts
encouragement from the stage as she dances and sings along to the
music.</TE>
<TE>   "No pain," Portnick reminds her classes, leaving out the exercise
cliche "no gain." She rejects the notion that exercise has to hurt to
be good for you.</TE>
<TE>   Portnick said she advocates a healthy, balanced diet. "A lot of
people misconstrue the notion of size acceptance. The opposite of
dieting is not gluttony," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, she promotes the notion that "it is possible to be active
and healthy at any size."</TE>

<HD>Paradise Found in a Trailer Park</HD>
<DH>Housing: For some Southland residents, living at the beach
is a dream, even in a mobile home. But that life won't last much
longer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doug Harmon just plunked down $225,000 for a little piece of paradise
overlooking the pounding surf of Laguna Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The place is a dinky singlewide, but the whitewashed mobile
home--with its Sub-Zero refrigerator, fireplace and marble
countertops--is definitely more Laguna chic than Dixie Chick.</LD>
<LD>   It sounds like a bargain, but there's a catch.</LD>
<TE>   Harmon's dream vacation house is scheduled to be dismantled in
21/2 years along with the rest of the El Morro Mobile Home Park. The
oceanfront homes are perched on a sliver of Crystal Cove State Park,
and the state has ordered them out by December 2004 to make room for
a campground and RV park.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't buy it as an investment," said Harmon, kicking back on
his sun-bleached deck with his wife and two kids. "I bought it
because it was worth spending part of your life here--a place your
kids will never forget."</TE>
<TE>   El Morro and other trailer parks along the Southern California
coast once offered the dime-store version of the American Dream: a
place where a Buick-driving pensioner could afford the same
million-dollar view as someone in a gated Malibu mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Those patches of beachfront nirvana are disappearing, washed away
by the tide of park owners cashing in to make way for posh,
$500-a-night resorts, million-dollar estates and other "higher and
better uses" of the land.</TE>
<TE>   Along the Orange County coast alone, nearly a third of the trailer
parks that existed in the mid-1980s have disappeared or will soon be
closed. Between Malibu and Dana Point, fewer than two dozen
oceanfront parks remain, and many that have survived are priced way
out of reach for the average homeowner.</TE>
<TE>   At the Paradise Cove mobile home park in Malibu--the surfside spot
where TV private eye Jim Rockford lived in the 1970s hit series "The
Rockford Files"--an ocean-view doublewide recently sold for $690,000.
And that doesn't include the $1,500 monthly rent.</TE>
<TE>   Paradise Cove is a neighbor to Barbra Streisand's cliff-top
mansion just off Pacific Coast Highway and is such prime real estate
that its owners ultimately plan to transform half the park into a
small, exclusive oceanfront hotel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Last Remnants of Working-Class Culture</TE>
<TE>   The gentrification troubles some longtime beach residents, who
have already watched as real estate prices along the coast soared
beyond the reach of all but the well-to-do. When the trailer parks
disappear, they say, so will the last remnants of working-class
culture in many beach towns.</TE>
<TE>   "I hardly recognize the place anymore," said Christopher
Goldblatt, a seafood importer who grew up in Paradise Cove when
commercial fishing boats still docked at the pier down below. "You
had surfers, cooks, people who loved the water.... You're not going
to see people like Streisand out here snorkeling with a spear gun."</TE>
<TE>   Tustin businessman Richard Hall, whose partnership closed down a
Laguna Beach trailer park to make way for a seaside resort, says
coastal trailer parks occupy some of the most coveted land in
Southern California. Something's got to give.</TE>
<TE>   "They're on a path to extinction. It's all a matter of economics,"
Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows that better than the 500 people who lived at the
Treasure Island Mobile Home Park in Laguna Beach. The park was razed
a few years ago to make way for the Laguna Beach Colony, a
$150-million development that includes a 275-room hotel and pricey
homes and condominiums.</TE>
<TE>   With its secluded beach and panoramic views, Treasure Island
attracted working-class mobile home dwellers from across the county.
The spot was a featured backdrop in Disney's "The Love Bug," Lucille
Ball's "The Long, Long Trailer" and a few other films.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a little village like in the olden days. We'd have
these great beach parties, all dress up for Halloween, you name it,"
said Connie Vlasis, who lived at Treasure Island for 15 years with
her husband. "You'd be living next door to Pilar Wayne--John Wayne's
wife--and the next person over was a nurse, then two gay guys and
then a lady who's a kick and sells Avon."</TE>
<TE>   Treasure Island closed in 1997, 10 years after it was snapped up
by a real estate partnership Hall had formed with Merrill Lynch
Hubbard, the investment giant's real estate subsidiary. After the
purchase, Vlasis said her monthly rent jumped from $900 to close to
$2,000, and that didn't include the $600 monthly payment on her
trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "They raised the rents so high, a lot of people just couldn't
afford it," said Vlasis, who moved to another park before buying a
bed-and-breakfast inn near Palomar Mountain. "Don't even go into a
park unless you own the land, because you have no rights."</TE>
<TE>   Hall agrees that trailer park living can be risky. In the vast
majority of trailer parks, residents lease a plot of land but must
buy the actual mobile home. The problem is, most mobile homes aren't
"mobile." So residents live at the mercy of park owners and are out
of luck if the park closes.</TE>
<TE>   Hall's company, RHC Communities, owns about a dozen trailer parks
in California. He said coastal mobile home parks can be a great
investment because many are undervalued and can be turned around for
a tidy profit.</TE>
<TE>   Residents can also cash in on the booming housing market--but
there's always the chance of going bust.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened in Huntington Beach. In the late 1990s, the
city hoped to revitalize coastal business district by closing down
the sleepy Driftwood Beach Club Mobile Home Park on PCH, which was on
city land, to make room for what will soon be a Hyatt Regency resort.</TE>
<TE>   The city offered to relocate residents to another city-owned park,
Ocean View Estates, which was built on the edge of an old mushroom
farm and is nowhere near the ocean. When their 20-year leases expire,
they're on their own.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never have what we had at the Driftwood," said Robert
Conger, who grew up in Huntington Beach and lived at Driftwood for 17
years. "Even though our mobile home was kind of a dump, I lived
across from the beach, next to a golf course. I mean, it was
paradise."</TE>
<TE>   That paradise will soon belong to free-wheeling, mimosa-sipping
tourists. And it won't be the only one.</TE>
<TE>   The Dana Strand Beach and Tennis Club in Dana Point, a bluff-top
trailer park with a priceless view of the water, was closed in the
late 1980s and is set to become part of a $500-million village of
seaside homes, shops and a posh inn.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 15 years, Newport Beach has been trying to close
Marinapark Mobile Home Park, home to 56 mobile homes on some of the
choicest city-owned property on the exclusive Balboa Peninsula.
Residents live there on year-to-year leases and pay below-market
rent. When it comes time to move, they get nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our days are numbered," said Herb Williams, who has lived off and
on at the Marinapark for the last 43 years. "If I can squeeze out
another three or five years, that's not bad, because the truth of the
matter is we're living like millionaires for a hell of a lot less
money."</TE>
<TE>   In some Southern California coastal cities, trailer parks are the
only affordable housing--and that might be their salvation.</TE>
<TE>   Malibu Councilwoman Joan House said people may laugh at the idea
of paying a couple of hundred thousand dollars for a trailer, but in
her city and neighboring Pacific Palisades, finding an ocean-view
house for that much is an even bigger joke.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were to buy their own house on the beach, they'd be
putting in 2- to 3 million at least," House said.</TE>
<TE>   "You like to have economic diversity within the community if
possible. No one likes economic cleansing, just having millionaires
or billionaires."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the Seal Beach Trailer Park has long been on the
threatened list. But because it offers some of the only low-income
housing in the city's upscale Old Town district, the City Council
last year put together a deal in which redevelopment funds would be
used to help preserve it. Now, the park is owned by a nonprofit
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Hecht paid $34,000 for his Paradise Cove trailer back in 1974
and still pays only $680 a month rent. At daybreak, the 82-year-old
former nightclub owner takes a dip in the ocean, and Friday nights
joins neighbors for a round of cocktails.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real neighborhood--and Malibu doesn't have many
neighborhoods," said Hecht, whose wife, actress Jane Keane, played
Trixie Norton in the 1960s TV revival of "The Honeymooners."</TE>

<TE>   Some of the Best Deals in Southland Real Estate</TE>
<TE>   The wealthy are now flocking to these places, and biting their lip
when asked how they like trailer life, because it's one of the best
real estate deals in Southern California, said Sheila Dey, executive
director of the Western Manufactured Housing Communities Assn., which
represents park owners.</TE>
<TE>   "They're living in the nicest places in the state," Dey said. "The
rent is cheap. The homes themselves are not, but the rent is."</TE>
<TE>   Just off El Camino Real in San Clemente, squeezed on a spit of
land between the railroad tracks and Pacific Ocean, sits Stephanie
Leuthesser's trailer--one of about 90 waterfront homes at the private
Capistrano Shores Mobile Home Park. Most are empty vacation
hideaways.</TE>
<TE>   Leuthesser has no problem with that. That means plenty of peace
and quiet, and more waves for her surf-addicted husband, a professor
at Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like vacationland. We walk out onto the deck, then bow down
saying, 'We're not worthy,'" said Leuthesser, a Web site designer and
native Texan.</TE>
<TE>   The Leuthessers don't own a lawn mower. The backyard consists of a
tiny deck, a 10-foot strip of sand and then--the Pacific. Since
moving in three years ago, they've rescued three injured seals, a
handful of pelicans and countless gulls.</TE>
<TE>   There is a downside: sweeping the sand off the living room floor.
An El Nino-fueled storm also nearly flooded them out a couple of
years back. And, 17 times a day, the ground quakes under a passing
train.</TE>
<TE>   "You kind of have to be an odd sort to be here," Leuthesser said
with a laugh. "Sometimes I tell people we live in a trailer park next
to the railroad tracks. Some people we tell we live in a gated
community in Orange County right on the water."</TE>

<HD>Older County Parks to Receive Needed Face Lift</HD>
<DH>Cleanup: Neglected campground is among those to be updated
in an effort to boost revenue with user fees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tucked against the jagged mountains of Ojai Valley lies a dusty
campground with warped picnic tables and ragged barbecue pits.
Red-feathered orioles sing and flutter among the ancient oak trees
that grace the nearly deserted county park.</LD>
<LD>   Camp Comfort has remained this way for some 20 years, its fraying
edges offset by the beauty of its surroundings, but change is coming
as the Ventura County Parks Department places the campground at the
top of its cleanup list.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to redo some of the barbecue areas, tables, grass areas
and playgrounds and bring folks back to the parks," said department
manager Andy O'Shita.</LD>
<TE>   Cleanup efforts have paid off for the county's three beach parks,
which are attracting more users, O'Shita said. Now the agency is
turning its attention to its aging inland parks as a way to boost
revenue through increased user fees, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Improvements such as those planned at Camp Comfort are designed to
attract more families, clubs and recreational vehicle users to the
oldest of the county's 23 parks.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many county-run parks in California, those in Ventura
County are nearly self-sufficient, surviving on camping, day use and
leasing fees.</TE>
<TE>   Since an independent "enterprise" model was introduced four years
ago, the Parks Department has struggled to make ends meet, O'Shita
said. Under the enterprise structure, an agency receives little or no
funding from the county and is expected to become largely
self-sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Camping fees, which range from $2 to $35 a night, make up 45% of
the Parks Department's $3-million annual budget. Leases on the three
county-owned golf courses and other sites generate 43%, and day-use
fees ranging from $1 to $100 account for 12%, O'Shita said.</TE>
<TE>   The department also receives about $300,000 from the county's
general fund each year to operate six neighborhood parks in
unincorporated areas. It expects to operate in the black for the
first time next year, erasing its remaining $150,000 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "Parks are luxuries, unfortunately," said County Executive Officer
Johnny Johnston, who ran the Parks Department for years. "They don't
generate much revenue. We've done as much as we can to make them
self-sufficient."</TE>
<TE>   But Adrain Whitehead, who travels the county and state campground
circuit with his wife, Juanita, in their recreational vehicle, said
he thinks the county charges too much and that too many people drive
in after hours without paying to camp and throw parties.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had better supervision around here, they'd bring in more
money," said Whitehead, who was staying at Foster Park in Ventura
last week. Shaded by a canopy of live oaks along San Antonio Creek,
the Camp Comfort site once served as a resting place for travelers on
a buggy route from Ventura to Ojai, said county park ranger Drew
Mashburn.</TE>
<TE>   Long-neglected by the private operator that managed it until last
year, Camp Comfort is being readied for new bathrooms, a shower
house, sprinklers and grass in the main area and water, sanitation
and upgraded electrical hookups at the campsites.</TE>
<TE>   Even with those changes, not everyone will be happy.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish the campsites were larger and there were hookups down by
the creek," said camper Felicia Cadena, who was spending the weekend
at Camp Comfort with her husband and four children in their 33-foot
recreational vehicle.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sir Kenneth Fung Ping-fan, 92, a prominent politician and businessman
who brought the first McDonald's restaurant to Hong Kong, died
Thursday in a Hong Kong hospital of unspecified causes.</LD>
<LD>   Fung was one of three sons of Fung Ping-shan, a co-founder of the
Bank of East Asia. The younger Fung became chief manager and a
director of the bank in Hong Kong. He also was a lawmaker, an advisor
to Hong Kong's government and an economic consultant for the
government of Chongqing, a booming city in southwestern mainland
China.</LD>
<LD>   At 28, Fung established Fung Ping Fan Group, which in 1975 bought
a McDonald's franchise and introduced the fast-food chain to what was
then British-controlled Hong Kong.</LD>
<TE>   Fung was the founder and president of Hong Kong's World Wide Fund
for Nature and was district governor of Rotary International. In
1971, Britain knighted him for business and charitable endeavors.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sharon Sheeley, 62, who in her teens wrote the 1950s hit "Poor Little
Fool," died Friday at Sherman Oaks Hospital Medical Center of
complications after a cerebral hemorrhage.</LD>
<LD>   Sheeley was still in high school in Newport Beach when she wrote
the song. In 1958 and 1959, a recording of "Poor Little Fool" by Rick
Nelson--a teen idol who grew up on his parents' "Ozzie and Harriet"
show--soared on the charts and sold more than 1 million copies.</LD>
<LD>   Although Sheeley wrote no more hits, she remained an influential
figure in rock circles in England and the United States in the 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   She was the girlfriend of guitarist Eddie Cochran, and was with
him in a taxi crash near Bath, England, on April 16, 1960. Sheeley,
who lived in London for several years, escaped with a fractured
pelvis, but Cochran, 21, died.</TE>
<TE>   Sheeley later returned to Los Angeles, where she helped start the
mid-1960s ABC-TV rock 'n' roll series "Shindig!" hosted by her
then-husband, Jimmy O'Neill.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert M. Sloane, 69, former administrator of three major Southern
California hospitals and a respected textbook author, died Thursday
in Arcadia of liver and kidney failure.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Boston and educated at Brown and Columbia universities,
Sloane served in the Navy during the Korean War. He worked at Yale
New Haven Hospital and Monmouth Medical Center in New Jersey before
moving to California in 1969 to become administrator of the City of
Hope Medical Center in Duarte. From 1980 until 1986, Sloane was
president and chief executive officer of Los Angeles Orthopaedic
Hospital, and from 1994 until his retirement in 1998, he headed
Anaheim Memorial Hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout his career as an administrator, he taught at several
universities, including Caltech, UCLA and USC, where he directed the
health services administration department.</LD>
<TE>   Sloane served as chairman of the Hospital Council of Southern
California and Volunteer Hospitals of America. With his wife, Beverly
LeBov Sloane, he wrote the textbook "An Introduction to Healthcare
Delivery Organizations: Function and Management."</TE>

<LD>   He was planning to return to Alabama to lead a church congregation
where he had served as pastor and mentor to troubled teens. He said
he'd learned from his mistakes.</LD>
<LD>   But just moments after the 30-year-old left an Orange County
courtroom, INS agents moved in and took him into custody. Burgos, a
native of Mexico, was in the country illegally, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Burgos was deported to Mexico, said INS spokesman
Francisco Arcaute.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County prosecutors said they fear the Immigration and
Naturalization Service action could hamper plans to prosecute others
involved in the 1993 shooting death of 18-year-old Christian Madera.
As part of his probation sentence, Burgos promised to testify against
anyone else prosecuted in the case. Madera's killer remains at large.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have any knowledge the INS was going to do this. It
certainly makes it more difficult if we do catch the shooter," said
Tori Richards, a spokeswoman for the Orange County district
attorney's office. "However, Mr. Burgos did enter this country
illegally, which is against the law. So we can't fault the INS for
what they did. This is just a no-win situation."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Burgos was in the car when a drive-by shooting
occurred but maintain he did not fire the shots that killed a rival
gang member.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Vincent Oliver said Burgos' family is devastated. Burgos
had married and was raising a family in Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   "They're absolutely distraught. This is somebody who's led a clean
life since 1993. He has small children, a congregation," Oliver said.</TE>
<TE>   Burgos moved to the United States as a child and was raised in
Orange County. He was deported after a robbery conviction in the
early 1990s and reentered the country illegally, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "The family is in complete shock. [This was] totally unexpected,"
said Burgos' aunt, Alma Rendon. "This is terrible. What about his
children?"</TE>
<TE>   Arcaute said the INS follows strict procedures in deportation
cases.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time anyone reaches the state of deportation, they have
had their chance to argue their case to a judge. We take deportations
very seriously. It's not something we just perform lightly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Arcaute said that he was able to determine from INS records that
Burgos had been deported, but was not able on short notice to find
out whether he had had a hearing.</TE>

<LD>A regional aviation group will begin studying how to move Orange
County passengers and cargo to inland airports as it becomes
increasingly unlikely an airfield will be built at the former El Toro
Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   The Southern California Regional Airport Authority is the first
agency outside Orange County to acknowledge that a commercial airport
at El Toro may not be built. Orange County supervisors voted last
month to allow Irvine to annex the property for residential,
commercial and parkland development after voters overturned airport
zoning in March. The Navy is preparing to sell the property.</LD>
<LD>   Authority members representing three of the group's four counties
stopped short, however, of declaring El Toro dead. They said a
lawsuit over the vote rezoning the base could prevail and revive
airport planning efforts.</LD>
<TE>   Another regional transportation agency, the Southern California
Assn. of Governments, has refused to remove El Toro from its forecast
for airport service in the next 20 years. Officials from cities in
Los Angeles County successfully argued that such a move should wait
until legal actions were exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the authority asked Executive Director Peggy Ducey to begin
talking to airports and cities in Riverside and San Bernardino
counties about the impact of handling more Orange County passengers
and cargo. Orange County once planned that El Toro would handle about
19 million of Southern California's 158 million airline passengers by
2025. Those passengers will have to be accommodated elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   What happens in coming months will determine whether the authority
can carve a niche in the debate over regional air travel. The group,
which has been meeting for more than a year, has focused on promoting
El Toro as an alternative to expanding LAX, whose growth has been
capped.Last month, the authority hoped to go through the Legislature
to establish a role for itself as a watchdog of counties' compliance
with regional transportation plans. But the bill by State Rep. George
Nakano (D-Torrance) was rewritten two weeks ago with the Southern
California Assn. of Governments, not the authority, in the watchdog
role. The bill, which also sought to punish counties by withholding
federal funds, was changed to give priority in transportation funding
to counties complying with regional plans.</TE>
<TE>   Ducey suggested the authority focus on how passengers and cargo
would get to airports in the Inland Empire. High-speed and
conventional rail might play a role.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California Assn. of Governments forecasts that
without El Toro, as many as 30 million Orange County passengers a
year would have to use other airports, Ducey said.</TE>
<TE>   Meg Waters of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority opposes any
role for the authority in transportation planning and called SCAG's
demand forecasts "laughable."</TE>
<TE>   There hasn't been a city of Los Angeles representative at
authority meetings since Los Angeles City Council President Alex
Padilla resigned from the authority in November. Los Angeles County
Supervisor Don Knabe, an El Toro supporter, missed last week's
meeting. Riverside County Supervisor James Venable has complained
that neither Orange County nor Los Angeles County has paid its
$50,000 annual dues for the five-seat board.</TE>

<TE>   "I don't want it perceived that we've thrown in the towel to give
the anti-El Toro [airport] folks any ammunition," Riverside County
Supervisor James Venable said at the group's meeting last week.
"[But] we need to be addressing ways to help Orange County to [move]
these passengers. It should be studied if an airport is not viable."</TE>
<TE>   Another regional transportation agency, the Southern California

said.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly since the March vote, Venable and San Bernardino
County Supervisor Jon D. Mikels have warned that roads must be
improved.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to build the road infrastructure to support growth before
the growth occurs," Mikels said. "Putting transportation money for
roads is what we really need to do here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forecasts of Airport Use Too High, Some Argue</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for anti-El Toro airport forces opposes any role for
the authority in transportation planning and called SCAG's demand
forecasts "laughable."</TE>
<TE>   An environmental review of LAX's abandoned expansion project
showed air-travel demand from Orange County, including passengers
using John Wayne Airport, at half of SCAG's estimate, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You may be looking at spending a lot of money on infrastructure
that you don't need," said Meg Waters with the El Toro Reuse Planning
Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the region's growth will be in the Inland Empire, she
said, which has four major airports--Ontario International, and three
former military bases--and room to grow.</TE>
<TE>   The hangover from the hard-fought El Toro debate has lingered in
other ways. Anti-El Toro airport forces remain suspicious of Ducey, a
former assistant city manager of Newport Beach, the city pushing
hardest to build an airport at El Toro. An emphasis on inland
airports was dismissed by a consultant for El Segundo, which next
week will decide whether to join the lawsuit challenging Orange
County's March vote.</TE>
<TE>   There hasn't been a city of Los Angeles representative at
authority meetings since Los Angeles City Council President Alex
Padilla resigned from the authority in November. Los Angeles County
Supervisor Don Knabe, an El Toro supporter, missed last week's
meeting. Riverside County Supervisor Venable has complained that
neither Orange County nor Los Angeles County has paid its $50,000
annual dues for the five-seat board, an issue Orange County
supervisors will discuss June 4.</TE>
<TE>   Seal Beach Councilwoman Patty Campbell applauded the authority for
beginning the process of planning how people and cargo will get to
airports in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   It will be important to link planning for ground transportation
and airport expansion, she said--an attractive possibility because
airport funds can be used to pay for transportation systems that lead
to them.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to plan for the future or we're going to end up with a
society that can't go anywhere," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   "[Traffic] is becoming a horrible way of life for Southern
California. It's a comprehensive problem that requires a
comprehensive solution."</TE>

<HD>Pechangas Delay Pact With L.A. Museum</HD>
<DH>Art: The tribe wants more information before allying with
the struggling Southwest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pechanga Indians of Temecula on Sunday hesitated on the brink of
a pioneering deal to provide up to $1.3 million yearly to the
cash-strapped Southwest Museum in exchange for the loan of thousands
of artifacts.</LD>
<LD>   That decision represents the first setback for a museum building
plan that was assembled over a year of negotiations between tribal
leaders and museum officials, an alliance that museum authorities say
would be the first of its kind. The proposed contract, which was
approved Friday by Southwest Museum trustees, is intended as the
initial step in a plan to build a Pechanga museum and cultural center
near the tribe's casino.</LD>
<LD>   "The general membership wants more information," tribal spokesman
Butch Murphy said Sunday. The concept might need "another approach"
and until then, "we're in a holding pattern," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Heumann, president of the Southwest Museum's board of
trustees, called the decision "understandable. We spent lots of time
getting comfortable with this agreement, and they should have a
chance to do the same," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the talks said the 20-year loan agreement would
allow the Pechangas to build a museum larger than the Southwest's,
the most important museum showcase for Indian art and artifacts west
of the Mississippi River.</TE>
<TE>   The Pechangas would pay the museum $750,000 yearly until
completion of the new museum's opening--an estimated five-year
project--and $1.3 million annually after that.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 tribal members were at the meeting, which included about
three hours of discussion, Murphy said. He said he was unsure when
the proposal would be revisited.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders at the Southwest, whose budget last year was $2.3 million,
welcomed the deal as a chance to free the 95-year-old institution
from chronic funding shortages and find a wider audience for its
350,000-piece collection, about 98% of which is in storage.</TE>
<TE>   Though some Southwest supporters warned that the proposal could
undercut the museum's control of its collection, trustees approved it
on a 15-1 vote, with one abstention and eight trustees absent.</TE>
<TE>   Pechanga leaders, who have run a prosperous casino since 1995,
have described the proposal as a chance to celebrate their
heritage--and bolster their reservation's list of visitor
attractions.</TE>
<TE>   But after questions persisted at Sunday's meeting, leaders decided
to table the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see it as a problem. We're under no firm deadline," said
Duane King, executive director of the Southwest Museum. "I think that
they simply want to make sure that they can afford this, given all of
the other things they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Next month, the tribe will open a hotel-casino at an estimated
cost of $270 million. Pechanga leaders haven't made any public
estimates yet on the cost of building the museum.</TE>
<TE>   In previous votes, the Pechanga membership has approved the
concept of building a museum and the idea of approaching the
Southwest Museum about a collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said the proposed contract between the museum and tribe
leaves unspecified the number of artifacts the Pechangas might
borrow, but acknowledges that prior agreements with donors will keep
many pieces from ever leaving the Southwest Museum.</TE>
<TE>   The Southwest Museum, headquartered in Mount Washington, is the
oldest museum in Los Angeles and its collection of Native American
artifacts from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries is considered the
largest of its kind outside a government institution.</TE>

<HD>Students Get a Lift on Road to College</HD>
<DH>Education: Upward Bound program at Cal Lutheran helps
children from low-income homes gain acceptance to universities.
Eighty percent earn degrees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michelle Munoz was just hoping for a taste of the college experience
when she enrolled last year in Upward Bound, a college readiness
program at Cal Lutheran University in Thousands Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   What she got instead was a five-star meal.</LD>
<LD>   During tutoring sessions and at Saturday school, the 17-year-old
senior at Channel Islands High School in Oxnard received help filling
out college applications, applying for financial aid and even writing
a personal essay outlining why she deserved university admission.</LD>
<TE>   The result was offers from seven schools, including UC Berkeley,
Loyola Marymount and USC. She'll start at UCLA this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Upward Bound offered so much support," said Munoz, who will
graduate from Channel Islands in June, 11th in her class and with a
grade point average several ticks above 4.0.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, she was among two dozen Ventura County high school
students--most the sons and daughters of immigrants--who participated
in Upward Bound's graduation before dozens of family members and
friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be the first in my family to go to college," she said. "I
feel like I've accomplished a big task and I feel like a role model,
too."</TE>
<TE>   It's a familiar story for Upward Bound.</TE>
<TE>   For more than two decades, the federally funded program has been
taking low-income high school students who have the potential to be
the first in their families to earn a college degree and giving them
the skills they need to get one.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning when they are sophomores, students sharpen their
academic abilities during weekly tutoring sessions, twice-a-month
Saturday school and an intensive five-week summer session where they
attend college-level courses such as calculus, modular biology and
English literature.</TE>
<TE>   There are 550 Upward Bound programs nationwide. The one in Ventura
County is open to 60 students at high schools in Santa Paula, Oxnard
and Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 100% of Upward Bound graduates have gone to college and 80%
earn degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really proud of these kids every year," said program director
Oscar Cobian. "I love seeing the way they interact with each other.
They become like a family during the academic year, and they
influence each other in achieving their goals of going to college."</TE>
<TE>   Students who go through the program often get into some of the
best universities in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Upward Bound graduates earned admission to Harvard,
MIT, Stanford and Duke--not to mention a range of top-caliber UC and
Cal State schools.</TE>
<TE>   The tradition continues this year. Santa Paula High School senior
Michael Flores is headed to Pepperdine University, while Camarillo
High's Erica Ultreras is going to UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Five Upward Bound graduates will attend Cal Lutheran this fall,
the largest number to commit to the Thousand Oaks university since it
began hosting the program 22 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   That number reflects an increased emphasis on recruiting some of
Cal Lutheran's home-grown talent, said Darryl Calkins, dean of
undergraduate enrollment. But it also reflects the university's
growing commitment to attracting a diverse student population.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always tried to peg Upward Bound as an important source of
really excellent students, not just because they are academically
prepared but because of the perspective they bring to the classroom,"
Calkins said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what you're seeing is a reinvigorated commitment to this
program," he said. "It's a symbiotic relationship. We support it and
it supports us."</TE>
<TE>   Cal Lutheran is putting its money behind its commitment.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the university is providing $1,500
scholarships this year to Upward Bound graduates who enroll there.
The campus is also providing an additional $2,000 multicultural grant
to Upward Bound graduates and other students who come from
backgrounds that historically have been underrepresented on college
campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo High School senior Anna Lopez fared even better.</TE>
<TE>   The 17-year-old will attend Cal Lutheran next year on a $10,000
academic merit scholarship, thanks to her nearly straight-A school
record and her connection with Upward Bound.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a great program," Anna said. "I only wish it could
serve more people. I thought it would be helpful getting me through
my stressful senior year, and it did exactly that."</TE>
<TE>   Cobian said he has applied for a U.S. Department of Education
grant that would extend a stripped-down version of the program to
1,000 Ventura County high school students.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Cobian continues preparing his current crop of students
for higher education.</TE>
<TE>   Just last month, he took some on a Northern California college
tour, visiting Cal State Monterey Bay and Stanford University, where
Upward Bound grads abound.</TE>
<TE>   They also stopped by San Francisco State University, where Upward
Bound alumna Mayra Jimenez provided a campus tour. Jimenez started
this school year with the program, but graduated from Oxnard High at
the semester break and enrolled at the university.</TE>
<TE>   She was able to do so in part because of the extra high school
credits she earned each summer through Upward Bound's sessions at Cal
Lutheran, where students take college-level courses.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for Upward Bound I wouldn't be here," said Jimenez,
a criminal justice major.</TE>
<TE>   "It provides an opportunity for people who wouldn't usually hear
about college," she said. "Without that program, a lot of students
would be lost trying to figure it out on their own."</TE>

<HD>Abortion Rule Snags Bankruptcy Bill</HD>
<DH>Law: An amendment, aimed at clinic protesters looking to
avoid fines, links the divergent issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Back when Congress first began talking about tightening federal
bankruptcy rules, Bill Clinton was in his first presidential term,
Newt Gingrich was just a troublemaker in a Democratic-controlled
Congress and the stock market had yet to break 10,000.</LD>
<LD>   Now, after a tortuous legislative journey, a bill to overhaul the
bankruptcy code is on the brink of becoming law. Yet it still may
stall, despite bipartisan agreement on its key provisions and backing
from a powerful armada of lobbyists.</LD>
<LD>   The measure would make it harder for people to unload debts by
filing for bankruptcy if they could afford partial repayment. But it
has hit an eleventh-hour snag over an issue far removed from its
core: the use of bankruptcy law by abortion clinic protesters.</LD>
<TE>   Lobbyists for the banks and credit card companies that stand to
gain financially from the bankruptcy overhaul are fuming. After
spending years lobbying for the bill--and funneling millions of
dollars in contributions to the politicians considering it--they are
seeing their legislative priority ensnared by one of the nation's
most emotional, divisive social issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Trying to forge an agreement on abortion is like trying to solve
the problems in the Middle East: It's timeless," said Thomas Lehner,
vice president for government affairs at the American Financial
Services Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy bill's saga is a rich case study in how Congress
works--and doesn't work. Its progress, despite repeated setbacks over
the years, is a testament to the clout wielded by a well-connected,
moneyed lobby. But the last-minute impasse underscores how hot-button
issues can derail broad consensus and contribute to legislative
gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been down on the 1-yard line before, and now we're on the
1-inch line," said Ed Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American
Bankers Assn. "We're not going to get worked up until it's called a
touchdown."</TE>
<TE>   The abortion-related dispute stems from different versions of the
bill passed by the House and Senate. The Senate added a provision
sponsored by Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) aimed at preventing
abortion opponents from declaring bankruptcy to avoid paying fines
imposed as a result of violent protests at abortion clinics. That
tactic has been used by several abortion protesters in recent years,
including Randall Terry of Operation Rescue.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting the Schumer amendment is Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), a
leading abortion foe. The conflict could come to a head Wednesday, at
a meeting of the conference committee trying to reconcile the bill's
two versions.</TE>
<TE>   Schumer has warned that if a compromise on the abortion issue is
not reached by then, he might try to sidetrack the entire bill.</TE>
<TE>   Almost forgotten in the jockeying has been the primary thrust of
the bill, which is an effort to stem a steep rise in individual
bankruptcy filings over the last decade. According to the financial
services association, a record 1.43 million bankruptcies were filed
in 2001--up 14% over 2000. In 1985, the filings totaled only 298,000.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts attribute the increase in part to the proliferation of
credit cards and a reduction in the social stigma attached to
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   But the bill's proponents say another factor is growing abuse of
the bankruptcy code by people who have the means to make partial
repayment.</TE>
<TE>   To crack down on that, the bill would force more people to file
under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code, which requires debtors to
work out repayment plans for at least part of their debts, rather
than under Chapter 7, which wipes out debts entirely. The bill would
establish a "means test" to determine who qualifies to file under
Chapter 7.</TE>
<TE>   The measure's critics, including consumer advocates, say it would
impose unfair burdens on legitimate bankruptcy filers. They also
complain it does not address an important cause of the spike in
bankruptcies: the aggressive marketing of credit cards to people ill
equipped to take on debt, such as college students.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Consumer Federation of America, which opposes the
bill, credit card companies sent out a record 5 billion solicitations
in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Such objections did not deter the House-Senate conference
committee from reaching agreement on the final wording for the bill's
main elements. That, in turn, has increased pressure on Hyde and
Schumer to strike a deal on their dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The financial services association has stepped up its lobbying,
sending New York bankers to urge Schumer to back down. The
association also recently ran newspaper advertisements targeted to
Capitol Hill that called for an end to the deadlock.</TE>
<TE>   The ad said, "306 congressmen and 83 senators can't be wrong,"
referring to the number of lawmakers who voted for the bankruptcy
bill in the House and Senate last year.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's roots can be traced to 1994, the last time Congress
enacted any change in the bankruptcy code. That measure was designed
mostly to speed up, not deter, bankruptcy cases. And it included a
time-honored tool for resolving the thorniest legislative disputes:
It set up a blue-ribbon commission to recommend additional changes in
bankruptcy law.</TE>
<TE>   That commission issued recommendations in 1997, but the nation's
banks and credit card companies opposed them, saying they were tilted
against creditors. The industries formed a lobbying coalition that
pressed the case to make it harder for people to discharge their
debts in bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The lobbyists showered Congress with letters, visits and telephone
calls. They enjoyed access to lawmakers in part because they
represented business interests that are among the nation's top
campaign contributors. Since 1990, the Center for Responsive Politics
reports, the financial services industry contributed about $27
million to the campaigns of members of Congress in both parties.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, according to the center, the biggest single source of
donations to George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign was MBNA
America Bank, a credit card company. Its executives and their
families gave more than $240,000 to Bush. Over the years, the
bankruptcy bill advanced in fits and starts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, differing measures were passed by the House and
Senate--each with strong support. But lawmakers failed to agree on a
compromise version.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, a bill cleared Congress. But President Clinton, siding
with consumer advocates, refused to sign it.</TE>
<TE>   In early 2001, it looked like smooth sailing for the measure, with
Bush in the White House and Republicans controlling the House and
Senate. By mid-March, each chamber had passed its version of the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   But in early June, Democrats seized control of the Senate and sent
the bill into limbo. It was not a priority for the Senate's
Democratic leaders. And it took them weeks to reconfigure the
chamber's operations, including the makeup of House-Senate conference
committees.</TE>
<TE>   When that detail was worked out, the bankruptcy panel finally set
a date for its first meeting: Sept. 12. That was canceled after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the bill was again shunted aside.</TE>
<TE>   Behind-the-scenes talks resumed early this year, and quiet
progress was made. One of the last major hurdles was cleared this
spring, in part because of the collapse of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   That scandal spotlighted a controversial loophole in current law
that allows bankruptcy filers in several states--including Texas,
where Enron is based--to keep expensive homes. The bill's prospects
abruptly improved in April when negotiators agreed to a compromise
that would limit this so-called homestead exemption for felons and
others convicted of financial misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   Schumer views his abortion-related amendment as an effort to give
teeth to a 1994 law he wrote making it a crime to bar access to
abortion clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Senate approved his provision, he made one change to
answer criticism that it singled out a particular type of protester
for special punishment. He reworded it to apply more broadly to
anyone who is fined for obstructing access to any lawful services,
not just abortion clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Hyde's objections, though, focus on the amendment's potential
effect on abortion protesters. His main concern is that the provision
could penalize nonviolent demonstrators.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators for the lawmakers have spent weeks trading
proposals--and mutual accusations that each side would rather kill
the whole bill than be seen as compromising on abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Schumer said he is growing increasingly pessimistic that an
agreement can be reached by Wednesday's conference committee meeting.
"If we don't resolve it then, I don't see how it will be resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Others who have been following the bill's path over the years find
the prospect of it collapsing over the abortion dispute hard to
imagine.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Holt, spokesman for House Majority Leader Dick Armey
(R-Texas), said: "Too many lobbyists have too much on the line."</TE>

<HD>A Cultural Struggle in the Trenches</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Drought and development are threats to
northern New Mexico's acequia system of irrigation, which keeps a way
of life alive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VALDEZ, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Ralph Garcia's pickup crunched to a stop in the dust at the side of
the gravel road. Hanging a leathery arm out his truck window, he
gazed at a ribbon of water gurgling through the nearby ditch.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia grunted in disgust. What should have been a torrent of
spring runoff water was instead a modest flow. Not enough, Garcia
knew, not nearly enough, to sate the thirst of the farmers and
ranchers in the Valdez Valley. Not this summer.</LD>
<LD>   "It's so bad, I've never seen it like this," Garcia said, not able
to take his eyes off the weak stream of water. "I don't know what we
are going to do without the water. Summer is not even here."</LD>
<TE>   Garcia is the mayordomo in this narrow valley, and irrigation
water is his intense concern. For 25 years he has been the man who
decides who gets how much water and when. Garcia and this ditch, the
San Antonio, and the 40 families who use it, are part of northern New
Mexico's ancient irrigation system--known as acequias
(ah-SEC-key-ahs)--which has been moving water here since the Spanish
rule of the 17th century.</TE>
<TE>   Still governed by Spanish law, acequias siphon river water
hundreds of miles through earthen ditches of various widths and
depths. The mayordomo controls the head-gates of his ditch and
diverts water to each member of the acequia.</TE>
<TE>   But the persistent drought choking New Mexico threatens to dry up
the acequias and a part of northern New Mexico's way of life. Without
water for their crops and cattle, few small farms or ranches here can
survive.</TE>
<TE>   The drought also imperils the centuries-old culture that's
centered on the beloved acequias and defines the northern part of the
state. If water is the lifeblood of this semiarid landscape, then
acequias are the silvery arteries that bring families and communities
together.</TE>
<TE>   And drought is not the only threat. Development is overtaking
agriculture as the economic force in the region and the fast-growing
cities may soon try to acquire the acequias' water.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is that we are at a crucial point in the history of
acequias: Is the drought going to last and affect our future or not?"
asked Paula Garcia, director of the nonprofit New Mexico Acequia
Assn. "Acequias are a touchstone for people in the community. Maybe
this will be the crisis that precipitates a renewal."</TE>
<TE>   Because the region has been dominated by agriculture for 400
years, water--and the acequias--became the center of each community's
concern.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, there is nothing else in the social fabric in this
part of New Mexico, El Norte, that comes close to the significance of
the acequias. In most communities here, the annual ditch-cleaning
occasions a full-scale party, a harbinger of spring. As local boys
labor alongside their elders in scraping and mending the ditch, the
new responsibility signals their transition to manhood.</TE>
<TE>   The sharing of the water--and the squabbling over it--have bound
neighbors by allegiance or by feud for hundreds of years.</TE>
<TE>   Water in New Mexico used to be more plentiful. In fact, the state
is blessed with snow-covered mountains that feed a web of rivers and
streams. Or they used to. Like most of its neighbors in the
Southwest, New Mexico is in a state of drought emergency. Its rivers
are not living up to their names: Rio Hondo is not deep and the Rio
Grande is no longer big.</TE>
<TE>   Only the Rio Seco, dry river, is appropriately named.</TE>
<TE>   In impoverished northern New Mexico, where 90% of the state's
acequias operate, there has been a resurgence of interest in
preserving the acequia culture in the last decade, as younger people
have been encouraged to embrace their history.</TE>
<TE>   "Your acequia is your tie to your land and your community," said
Geoff Bryce, the executive director of the Taos Valley Acequia Assn.,
as he gave a recent tour of Taos Valley ditches.</TE>
<TE>   Bryce is also a parciante or member of the San Antonio acequia.
Members take a share of water according to how much land they have.
The mayordomo sets the priorities: In dry years such as this, the
mayordomo may decide that members with livestock have priority for
water over squash or chile farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "The animal must come first," Ralph Garcia said. He also has
decreed that small kitchen gardens that feed families will be watered
before commercial fields.</TE>
<TE>   Members receive their water on the day and at the time set by the
mayordomo. But some along the ditch get impatient for their allotted
time and open their head-gates to allow a neighbor's water to green
their fields.</TE>
<TE>   Disputes are common, and the drought has made relations even more
tense. Many mayordomos, who must resolve any disputes, can tell
stories of water-poaching arguments that resulted in fistfights or
drawn guns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost unbearable to watch the water flow by when the fruit
on your trees is dying," said Priscilla Rael, whose family has grown
apples and plums in the Valdez Valley for generations. "People do
desperate things. To say that water is life is not saying too much."</TE>
<TE>   It's not just the drought that threatens acequias, it's increasing
demand for water; 70% to 80% of New Mexico's surface water is
controlled by acequia associations. And with the state's water
resources about 21/2 times over-apportioned, it is likely that
thirsty cities in northern New Mexico will look to the acequias this
summer as a water source for municipal needs.</TE>
<TE>   So-called "water farming," in which cities buy water rights from
beleaguered farmers, is a controversial practice in the Southwest,
where thousands of acres a year of formerly farmed land lies fallow
while its allotment of water flows to encroaching subdivisions.</TE>
<TE>   The New Mexico Acequia Assn., aware of the increasing pressure for
water, recently issued a statement of principle: Water belongs to the
community and is not an economic commodity to be sold.</TE>
<TE>   But everyone on the ditch knows the value of the water, and
everyone knows what a developer would be willing to pay for it. In a
drought year, the financial stress on families is enormous, as is the
pressure to hold out.</TE>
<TE>   In the curious economics of water, acequia members may be assessed
only $1.25 per acre-foot (about 325,640 gallons) per year to draw
water from the ditch. A local water broker might offer a member as
much as $40,000 for one-time rights to the same amount of water.</TE>
<TE>   "This is northern New Mexico, the poorest region of the country,
and people are vulnerable," said David Benavides, a water lawyer who
works with acequia groups. "Developers come in and try to buy out the
farmers. How can that be good for the community?"</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, making his rounds in his battered pickup, will not allow
his acequia to dry up, one way or the other. Like the others along
the ditch, his fields need water. He's not doing it for the $300 he's
paid a year. "That's not even gas money," he said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "The acequia is for the people, that's why I do it. To continue
the tradition. Let's hope we can keep our water."</TE>

<LD>   A teenager who needed a car to take his girlfriend to the prom
held up a teacher at gunpoint and rode away in her sport-utility
vehicle, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't have credit, so I couldn't ... [rent] a car. I wasn't
thinking straight," Brian Njau, 18, said from the Berks County
Prison, where he was being held on suspicion of robbery and
aggravated assault.</LD>
<TE>   Njau allegedly used a friend's unloaded BB gun to coerce a teacher
to surrender her SUV Friday as she left school in Reading. Police
found the car Saturday morning at a hotel where Njau and friends had
gone after the prom.</TE>

<LD>   A small plane crashed in the frontyard of a rural Virginia home,
killing the pilot and two passengers, including a child.</LD>
<TE>   A Virginia State Police spokeswoman said the airplane, a 1962
Beechcraft Musketeer 23, left Fredericksburg on a pleasure trip that
did not require a flight plan.</TE>
<TE>   It crashed about 18 miles away. Pilot Benjamin C. Butler, 45,
often flew over a co-worker's home and wagged the airplane's wings as
a greeting. On Sunday, the plane began to circle, but then crashed.</TE>

<HD>Old Cancer Drug Gets Panel's OK</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>An expert panel recommended Sunday that doctors stick with tamoxifen
as the time-tested treatment for early-stage breast cancer, despite
evidence that newer drugs may do a better job of preventing
recurrence.</LD>
<LD>   The decision affects the care of about 700,000 women in the U.S.
who take tamoxifen to prevent their breast cancer from coming back.</LD>
<LD>   Cancer physicians fielded many calls from patients in December
after reports that a newer class of drugs, called aromatase
inhibitors, appear slightly more effective. Some quickly switched
their patients, while many others wondered whether they should.</LD>
<TE>   To help them decide, the American Society of Clinical Oncology,
the world's largest organization of cancer doctors, convened an
expert panel to review the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Its decision: It's too soon to change. In the end, the new drugs
may prove superior, but it will take a few more years of study before
doctors can be certain of their advantages as well as their possible
risks.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, if the difference was very, very dramatic, that would
color one's thinking, but the difference was small," said Dr. Eric
Winer, a physician at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who
chaired the 18-member panel.</TE>

<HD>A House, a Nation Rebuilt</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan and its Washington embassy suffered as one.
Now, the mansion with unusable toilets and rotting stairs gets a
renovation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A top embassy posting here is a job of privilege that typically comes
with a chauffeured limousine, a generous salary, a staff of servants
and guaranteed entree to the grand soirees of Embassy Row. So it was
all the more discouraging when Yar M. Mohabbat found himself crouched
in the bathroom of the Afghan Embassy one night, trying to fix a
broken toilet.</LD>
<LD>   It was 1997 and he was the acting ambassador assigned to a
four-story mansion in a Washington neighborhood where gardeners preen
and maids polish. But to him, it felt more like a 4,000-square-foot
shack.</LD>
<LD>   Seven thousand miles away, his beloved Afghanistan was sinking
under the burden of famine, drought and political havoc. And the
$4-million embassy--which once played host to a president and a
king--seemed to be falling apart along with it.</LD>
<TE>   The roof leaked, the electrical wiring was shot and the pipes
burst. There was no money for heat, so Mohabbat put a blanket over
his aching knees and learned to type with gloves on. And when the
Afghan government finally did battle with the Taliban, the wealthy
neighbors on Wyoming Avenue could look out their windows and see the
conflict writ small, as Mohabbat and a diplomat-turned-Talib fought
over which flag would fly above the decrepit house.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government settled the dispute promptly, virtually
turning its back on the country and shutting the embassy down.</TE>
<TE>   Now, five years later, Afghanistan has a new government and its
official American headquarters a second chance. And as the Bush
administration works to rebuild relations with a country in ruins, it
also must help restore the most important symbol of Afghan
sovereignty on U.S. soil.</TE>
<TE>   "My embassy was very poor and totally ignored," said Mohabbat, who
was there watching in 1997 when the State Department locked the
gates. "I tried to do the work myself. I laid the tiles in the
bathroom. I was trimming the trees, mowing the lawn. Even the
lowest-ranking person from the State Department never did anything,
never came to visit."</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore. For weeks, federal contractors have been wiring,
plastering and roofing to make the mansion livable again. Next month,
the new interim government is set to reclaim the keys. And the
brick-and-concrete metaphor of a nation's downfall is today a symbol
of its hard climb back to international respectability.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration has accepted the cost of making it safe,
but making it presentable and decent, that is up to us," said Haron
Amin, currently the top Afghan diplomat here. "And I have every
intention of making it a gemstone."</TE>
<TE>   For many of the estimated 200,000 Afghan Americans living in the
U.S., this is more than a building; it is a national symbol. And they
would no more countenance its ragged state than Americans would
tolerate a shabby White House.</TE>
<TE>   Calls have poured in from around the country with volunteers
offering their services. A landscaper wants to replant the tired
grounds. Art collectors have offered antiques, Persian rugs,
furniture. There is talk of a painting party with pizza.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan diplomacy here has struggled on a shoestring budget and
borrowed supplies since it was abruptly reborn after Sept. 11, when
the tiny nation captured the attention of a superpower that had
ignored it for years. Leaders of the Afghan community seized the
moment, converging in Washington to establish relations between the
Bush administration and the rebel Northern Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   They had no place to land. With the embassy's more than 40 rooms
unusable, they squeezed into a borrowed one-bedroom condominium in
suburban Virginia, practicing cell-phone diplomacy until nervous
neighbors complained and they were evicted.</TE>
<TE>   They wound up in a suite of offices a few blocks from the White
House. The staff of 14 is mostly volunteer, the computers borrowed,
the pens donated and the $8,000 monthly rent paid by a generous donor
in California.</TE>
<TE>   Soon the embassy will be theirs again--impoverished, but theirs.
Amin, who worked there as a young diplomat, walked through last
winter and found a place frozen in time. The calendars said 1997, the
in-boxes were still full. Dead termites carpeted the floors and the
winding staircase appeared to sway from rot. The upstairs library had
no books.</TE>
<TE>   The writings of Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar were taped to
the walls. Amin tore them down, a new beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "There had been a total abandonment of the building, and a total
abandonment of Afghanistan," he said. "Now the embassy needs help.
Many here work on a promise more than a paycheck. We are accepting
all donations."</TE>
<TE>   Once the embassy was a lovely place, home for a time to a chief
justice of the United States. Its purchase by the Kingdom of
Afghanistan in 1943 was a milestone for a bellicose country rent by
tribal wars. According to the lore, A. Hussain Aziz--the man who
would become Afghanistan's first ambassador to the U.S.--traveled to
Washington in the midst of a world war with two suitcases full of
money and bought an embassy.</TE>
<TE>   The 1950s and '60s were the glory days. Then, the Afghan capital
of Kabul was the Paris of Central Asia, its women dressed smartly in
heels and pillbox hats. And the embassy was its sophisticated
reflection, where statesmen regularly rode up the circular driveway
in black limousines.</TE>
<TE>   President Kennedy lunched there a month before he was killed. They
served him Afghan ravioli with green onions. The king gave him
melons. "President Kennedy liked it very much. The melons were round
and very tasty and this was very much appreciated by the president,"
said Ravan Farhadi, currently the Afghan ambassador to the United
Nations, recalling the momentous day with great clarity.</TE>
<TE>   But when Afghanistan fell to the Communists in 1978, life
deteriorated; the house and the nation suffered as one, their fates
linked.</TE>
<TE>   The money from Kabul dwindled and there was hardly enough for
diplomatic salaries, much less simple maintenance. But Afghans are
known as much for their pride as for their hardship, and neighbors on
the block could see Mohabbat struggling to preserve the mansion's
dignity, trimming the shrubs with a pair of scissors.</TE>
<TE>   He drove himself to Washington's stylish cocktail parties, parked
around the corner and saved face by pretending his chauffeur was
waiting down the street. Little did his peers suspect that his
embassy's toilets were so unreliable, he and his small staff had to
use the local McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1997, the Taliban gained ground in Kabul. Mohabbat
returned from a Memorial Day holiday to find his second-in-command,
Wardak Jamal, had joined the zealous regime. The Taliban's white flag
was flying over the embassy.</TE>
<TE>   Outraged, Mohabbat brought it down and raised the republic's
colors. And all that day the neighbors could watch the flags go up
and down as the two men hollered at each other, dragging their
banners from the pole to the window and back again.</TE>
<TE>   "I called the State Department and they said leave the flag
there," Mohabbat recalled, his voice rising anxiously at the mere
memory. "I said, 'Even if someone kills me, I will bring that flag
down.'" That night, the Taliban threatened to shoot him.</TE>
<TE>   When the U.S. government finally did respond, it was to vacate the
place and change the locks. Mohabbat fled with his family to St.
Louis, where he lives today, seeking work as an architect.</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, the neighbors watched as the grass died, the
paint peeled and poison ivy crept over the wall. Transients camped
out near the reflecting pool in what used to be the backyard gardens.</TE>
<TE>   The degeneration was all the more striking given the regal facade
most countries seek to put on their outposts in this most important
of world capitals. The more than 170 embassies here are the grand
dames of international diplomacy: Plans for the Japanese mansion were
approved by the emperor himself; the grounds include an antique tea
house moved piece by piece from Japan. The British Embassy is an
adaptation of an English country house with Art Deco lanterns capped
by royal crowns designed by Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens, known as one
of the greatest British architects of his generation.</TE>
<TE>   So Afghanistan's sorry presence was not overlooked on the posh
street where Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld lives around the
corner and the director of the Washington Chamber Symphony is right
next door.</TE>
<TE>   The road back poses its challenges. Even the most modest show of
patriotism can be taxing for a country so ruined its gross domestic
product is not measurable.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul approved a new national flag in January, the day before
Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, head of the interim government, arrived
in Washington for his first meeting with President Bush. Protocol
officers panicked. The aunts of an embassy worker went to G Street
Fabrics, bought red, black and green material and sewed all night.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a Betsy Ross moment," Tom Lauria, the embassy's spokesman,
likes to say.</TE>
<TE>   Amin leads a staff of more than a dozen Afghan nationals--some old
enough to have fought with the rebel Northern Alliance, some young
graduates of American universities who want to serve their first
country.</TE>
<TE>   And others, like 28-year-old Homeyra Mokhtarzada, a former CNN
producer who left to work for the embassy and recently was named its
second secretary. She is the first woman appointed to the diplomatic
corps since the defeat of the misogynistic Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "Afghanistan is ready to join the modern world," she said, herself
a sign of a new time.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, a big green Dumpster sits near the embassy's
front door and construction trucks park on the lawn, still something
of an eyesore on a block where chauffeurs stand in waiting.</TE>
<TE>   But when Amin and the rest of the embassy staff drive past, they
envision a humanitarian salon where people can meet to discuss the
country's future and help reestablish education and the arts. A place
that speaks of possibility rather than waste.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to measure my words," Amin says, struggling to articulate
the significance of the building's rebirth. "It is a symbol of pride.
Moving in and making sure it represents the Afghans in the best
possible sense will be truly a momentous occasion."</TE>

<LD>Is America ready to find terrorism entertaining again?</LD>
<LD>   "The Sum of All Fears," a political thriller in which the nation
and its leaders are caught off guard by a terrorist attack, opens
this month, the first film to be released since Sept. 11 to deal so
explicitly with the sort of national trauma experienced that day.</LD>
<LD>   Paramount Pictures made the $68-million movie before the attacks,
but now it must sell it to the public, and the studio is trying to
establish the film's patriotic credibility by using Washington as a
launching pad.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday night, many of the same worried lawmakers who eight
months ago stood on the Capitol steps singing "God Bless America"
will walk up the red carpet at the Warner Theater for the premiere of
a film that shows massive destruction, scenes of widespread panic and
images of a president flying aboard the National Airborne Command
Center in the midst of an international crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount, mindful to avoid the impression that it is capitalizing
on the Sept. 11 tragedy, has taken pains to publicize the high level
of support it received from the Pentagon, which supplied Marines and
helicopters for the production. The studio is marketing the film,
based on the best-selling 1991 Tom Clancy novel, as a race against
the clock to prevent a nuclear disaster, with patriotic overtones.</TE>
<TE>   As a sign of how much has changed since Sept. 11, the Motion
Picture Assn. of America applied new standards it established for its
"disaster images" category to the PG-13-rated film. Jack Valenti, the
MPAA head who serves as an industry lobbyist in Washington, said TV
news footage of hijacked passenger planes flying into the World Trade
Center's twin towers in New York altered the industry's rating
standards: "Ten-year-olds must have seen those planes hitting the
towers a hundred times, and bombs and violence are all over the news
from the Middle East. The movies can't be tougher than television."</TE>
<TE>   Paramount is not the only studio rolling the dice this summer and
placing a big bet that moviegoers will flock to terrorism-themed
films. A week after "The Sum of All Fears" makes its bow, Disney will
release "Bad Company," starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock. That
plot revolves around terrorists planting a nuclear device in New York
City's Grand Central Station. This fall, viewers of Fox TV's "24"
will see a real-time story line about terrorism. "We won't shy away
from the idea that something like 9/11 might happen," said Joel
Surnow, who produces the action drama.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, studios postponed the release of movies like Arnold
Schwarzenegger's "Collateral Damage," which depicted a firefighter
hunting down South American terrorists who had killed his family in a
bomb blast, and the comedy "Big Trouble," whose story line centered
on smuggling an atomic bomb onto a passenger jet.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, initial post-Sept. 11 concerns about public
reaction to those films were overblown; if viewers stayed away from
"Collateral Damage" (and they did, generally), it was attributed to
the movie itself and not to any shift in the national tolerance for
big-screen violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sum of All Fears" may be different. It goes far more directly
to the events, fears and images of the attacks, and it does so within
the context of an extremely profitable series of adaptations of
Clancy books. This time around, Ben Affleck plays CIA analyst Jack
Ryan. When Harrison Ford played the part of an older Jack Ryan,
1992's "Patriot Games" grossed more than $173 million worldwide, and
1994's "Clear and Present Danger" pulled in more than $212 million.
When "The Sum of All Fears" is released nationwide May 31, what
moviegoers may find most disturbing are images of hospital windows
being blown out, Marines pulling a bleeding president from his
motorcade, fans at the Super Bowl cheering only moments before coming
under deadly attack and a U.S. city being nearly devastated.</TE>
<TE>   The movie's villains are European-based neo-Nazis who try to
ignite a nuclear war between the United States and Russia by planting
an atomic bomb in Baltimore. Affleck's character tries to alert the
president as the commander in chief prepares to launch nuclear
missiles at Russia. Studio executives say they have removed most of
the gore and violence that was in early drafts, but the film clearly
is meant to rattle audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat ... in a panic, arms outreached toward the screen, mouth
wide open," one amateur online reviewer wrote after seeing the film
recently.</TE>
<TE>   Others already know they don't want to put themselves in the
position of watching fictionalized violence. Paula Pluta watched
United Airlines Flight 93 drop out of the sky Sept. 11 and crash into
trees about 1,000 yards from her home near Shanksville, Pa. The 40
passengers and crew aboard died along with the four hijackers, and
though Pluta knows some people might find a film about terrorism
entertaining, she will take a pass on "The Sum of All Fears" or any
movie in the near future that focuses on violence against civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't go to a theater and watch a movie on terrorism because
of the effect the crash had on me," she said. "I don't want to go
through it again, in real life or in the movies."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has a long and contradictory history of dealing with
current events, sometimes mirroring them closely and at other times
offering escape by "cranking out musicals and comedies, anything but
war films," said film historian Jan-Christopher Horak, curator of the
Hollywood Entertainment Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be interesting to see what happens to this film," Horak
said. "We may just be too close to it still."</TE>
<TE>   Martin Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center at USC's
Annenberg School for Communication, believes that "people are walking
on eggs in the creative community, and they're trying to be
sensitive, but I don't think there's a blanket prohibition on
portraying terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Bernard F. Dick, a professor of communications and English at
Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey and the author of a 1985
book about Hollywood's World War II films, thinks "The Sum of All
Fears" could be a tough sell.</TE>
<TE>   "The scars on the collective psyche are never going to heal," he
said. "I've been down to ground zero [the World Trade Center site].
It's a very sobering sight."</TE>
<TE>   Yet instead of shying away from the Washington area, where 189
people died in the attack on the Pentagon, Paramount chose to turn
the capital into a showcase for the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's premiere, which will be attended by members of both
major political parties, takes place against a backdrop of executive
branch intrigue, with revelations that President Bush received
warnings in August about airliners possibly being hijacked by
operatives of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network. Democrats
have criticized the White House for not alerting the public, and
their words are the first crack in the facade of political
bipartisanship over the terrorism issue in Washington since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's not uncommon for films deemed to have Beltway appeal
to premiere there--1995's "The American President" and last year's
"Black Hawk Down" among them--this movie has an unusually disturbing
story line for a Washington audience.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount studio chief Sherry Lansing, who took a key role in
mustering a group devoted to Hollywood-Washington collaboration after
Sept. 11, has assembled a bipartisan political and military audience
to view the film Wednesday. It first will screen today for a small
gathering of the national press corps at MPAA headquarters, where it
will be introduced by Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.).</TE>
<TE>   "He sees the movie as entertainment," Lugar spokesman Andy Fisher
said. "But as things work their way into the culture of American
life, Americans need to be continually aware of the possibilities of
new attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Wednesday, an audience including the vice chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and the secretaries of the Navy and Air Force
is confirmed for the Washington premiere. Also attending will be
Lansing, who, along with Valenti, led a coalition after Sept. 11 that
sought to brainstorm about what pro-U.S. movie and TV projects
Hollywood could develop.</TE>
<TE>   The group included the heads of every major television network and
movie studio, as well as Karl Rove, Bush's chief political advisor.
Some raised concerns that a cozy relationship between Hollywood and
the White House would foster a climate of propaganda, but the
coalition's mission has amounted to distributing pro-U.S. films to
troops overseas and their families, and presenting USO shows.</TE>
<TE>   Lansing said "The Sum of All Fears" would have been provocative
even before the terrorist strikes of last fall. "I think the film
would have been upsetting at any time," she said. "It was relevant
before 9/11, and I think now it has even more relevance."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Alden Robinson said he exercised restraint in directing the
picture, favoring "implied" violence rather than straight-on gore,
and had the script changed to allow the character of the president to
survive. "There are no bodies in this movie. This movie is not about
an act of violence; it was about a response to it."</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers say they haven't had walkouts in test screenings,
where they claim an "overwhelmingly positive" response from viewers.</TE>
<TE>   But producer Mace Neufeld, who also produced the earlier Clancy
films, said the Washington crowd could be another matter. "I think it
will be our toughest audience."</TE>
<TE>   "What we are trying not to do is sensationalize," added studio
vice chairman Robert Friedman. "We are not trying to exploit in any
way, shape or form the sad events of 9/11."</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Law Writes Catholics of Damage From Scandal</HD>
<DH>Religion: Boston prelate denies knowledge of accused
priest's history as early as reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>In a remarkable letter distributed Sunday to Roman Catholic parishes
here, Cardinal Bernard Law insisted he knew nothing of the
questionable history of a Boston priest charged with child rape.</LD>
<LD>   The cardinal said he had "absolutely no memory" of anyone
personally informing him as early as 1984 that Father Paul Shanley
had molested a child.</LD>
<LD>   Law also acknowledged the damage the massive sexual abuse scandal
has caused him personally. "Bewilderment has given rise to anger and
distrust," Law wrote. "In the process, my credibility has been
publicly questioned and I have become for some an object of
contempt."</LD>
<TE>   The debate over whether Law protected an alleged pedophile priest
at the expense of parishioners has prompted mounting calls for the
cardinal's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   The three-page missive, faxed to news organizations Sunday
evening, represents the first time the Boston Archdiocese has issued
such an aggressive public relations defense in the face of civil
suits filed against Law regarding claims involving Shanley as well as
a former priest from the nation's fourth largest archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal's statement follows Tuesday's release of archdiocese
records sought by Gregory Ford and his family. Ford, 24, claims to
have been abused by Shanley.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, the archdiocese has released more than 1,600 pages of
records from Shanley's personnel file, also in conjunction with the
Fords' lawsuit. The records show the archdiocese knew as far back as
1967 that there were abuse claims against Shanley and that he had
spoken out in favor of sex between men and boys.</TE>
<TE>   "Because only selected passages of many documents have been made
public, I would like to give again an account of my stewardship in
handling these cases," Law wrote Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Law asserted in the letter that he did not know about sexual abuse
allegations against Shanley until 1993, when the former "street
priest" had been transferred to a parish in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the allegations were made, Law wrote, "the
authorization for him to serve as a priest in California was
rescinded."</TE>
<TE>   Further, Law said, "I was not aware until these recent months of
the allegations against [Shanley] from as early as 1966."</TE>
<TE>   Law's letter contends that Shanley left Boston for California on
sick leave. His transfer "had nothing to do with an issue of sexual
abuse," according to the cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley, 71, is being held on $300,000 bail in Cambridge, Mass. He
has pleaded not guilty to three counts of child rape.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley, a flamboyant figure in Boston known for his outreach work
on the streets, was recommended in an archdiocese letter as "a priest
in good standing" when he moved to San Bernardino in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "The attestation that he was a priest in good standing at the time
was in accord with the facts as I knew them," Law said in his Sunday
letter.</TE>
<TE>   Admitting that documents recently released by the archdiocese
might suggest otherwise, Law added: "Before God, I assure that my
first knowledge of an allegation of sexual abuse against this priest
was in 1993."</TE>
<TE>   Calls on Sunday night to the Ford family were not returned.
Attorney Roderick MacLeish Jr., who represents Ford and several other
alleged Shanley victims, also was unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   There was no answer Sunday night at the Boston Archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Law's letter took issue with reports that a member of St. Jean the
Evangelist Church approached him after Mass in 1984 to tell him that
Shanley was abusing children.</TE>
<TE>   "I have absolutely no memory of such a conversation, and those who
have worked most closely with me can attest that such a report would
have been acted upon," Law said.</TE>

<HD>Outsiders May Have the Best Seats to Spot Pre-9/11 Failures</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As Washington fast-forwards to frenzy over the accumulating evidence
of missed clues in the weeks before Sept. 11, the odds are growing
that a much broader investigation will be launched into the
attacks--and what else, if anything, the government could have done
to prevent them.</LD>
<LD>   But it's an open question what sort of investigation has the
greatest chance of excavating the truth, designing useful reforms and
generating enough momentum to force those changes into law without
devolving into a political shoot-out.</LD>
<LD>   So far, only the House and Senate Intelligence committees are
investigating the government's performance. And that inquiry has been
relatively narrow--probably too narrow to resolve the questions about
possible missteps not only under President Bush but President
Clinton, and even other administrations.</LD>
<TE>   The White House is understandably leery of an open-ended, highly
partisan investigation that could distract and demoralize the very
officials charged with preventing another attack; after the bitter
experiences of the Clinton years, when Republicans used the
congressional investigative power more like a bludgeon than a
searchlight, Democrats should also be hesitant about entangling
another president, Gulliver-like, in subpoenas and depositions.</TE>
<TE>   But Vice President Dick Cheney has gone too far in suggesting that
this new wave of questions is "thoroughly irresponsible ... in time
of war," as he put it last week. When the FBI fails to connect
warnings from its Phoenix office that terrorists might be training at
U.S. flight schools with the arrest of a possible terrorist at a
Minnesota flight school-- and when no one connects either of those
red flags with CIA warnings to Bush last August about Al Qaeda
interest in plane hijackings--surely someone needs to be asking what
went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   In an echo of Watergate, some were already asking last week: What
did the president know and when did he know it? But that's a silly
question: Does anyone doubt that Bush--or any other American
president--wouldn't have taken every conceivable step to prevent the
Sept. 11 attacks if he was presented a clear picture of the danger?
The more relevant issue is why didn't the president receive such a
picture: In other words, what didn't the president know and why
didn't he know it?</TE>
<TE>   Broadly speaking, precedent offers three ways the White House and
Congress might answer that question.</TE>
<TE>   One is an administration self-examination. After the Marine
barracks bombing in Lebanon in 1983, President Reagan convened an
internal panel to unearth what went wrong; Clinton officials used the
same model after several terrorist attacks during his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Bush hasn't established anything comparable after Sept. 11, but
this approach has its merits. These internal commissions work quietly
and privately, usually free of political grandstanding. But in this
case such a commission is unlikely to produce intelligence and law
enforcement reforms as bold as many are now seeking.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Kettl, an expert on government performance at the
University of Wisconsin, notes the risk isn't only that an internal
task force will be too defensive in assessing blame, but that it
would be too invested "in the existing system" to see the gaps
terrorists can exploit. That, he says, may take the fresh eyes "an
outside perspective" brings.</TE>
<TE>   Nor would an internal commission attract the public attention that
would be focused on an outside investigation. And if the public isn't
engaged, the intelligence and law enforcement agencies are more
likely to fight off big changes.</TE>
<TE>   The surest way to generate public pressure would be a high-profile
congressional investigation, presumably much broader in scope than
the intelligence committees' focus on the CIA and FBI. Senate
Democrats are mulling that idea now. Such congressional hearings
would probably rivet public attention and create momentum for serious
reform. Congressional investigations also have the advantage of
involving legislators who have the direct authority to translate
their findings into law.</TE>
<TE>   But this approach has potentially crippling drawbacks. It would
increase the risk of leaks of sensitive information. And it would
virtually assure political warfare over every step of the process.
"In the current climate of Congress, it is almost certain to be
highly charged," says former Rep. Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, who
served on the congressional committee that investigated Iran-Contra
under Reagan. That conflict could not only complicate the
investigation, but fatally discredit its findings by branding them as
partisan--which is exactly what happened to most congressional GOP
investigations of Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton prefers the third option: an independent commission of
outsiders. At their best, independent commissions can combine the key
assets of the other two alternatives. Like congressional
investigations, they bring a skeptical outside eye to the problem;
but like the internal studies, they usually reduce partisanship.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last half century, some of these independent commissions
have generated real results. Two commissions chaired by former
President Herbert Hoover inspired significant government
restructurings under the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. In
1983, an Alan Greenspan-led commission pushed into law sweeping
changes in Social Security. More often, though, these commission
reports sit unopened, like the farsighted study on terrorism that
former Sens. Gary Hart and Warren B. Rudman (along with Hamilton and
a panel of other notables) produced to little notice last winter.</TE>
<TE>   This history suggests--somewhat paradoxically--that outside
commissions usually matter only when the insiders (primarily the
president and congressional leadership) are invested in them. Which
is why Bush might want to ask for one now. An internal investigation
is too unlikely to resolve all the questions swirling around him (or
give him the leverage he needs for major change); a congressional
inquiry is too likely to degenerate into political warfare.</TE>
<TE>   There's no guarantee that a bipartisan independent commission--of
the sort Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman
(D-Conn.) are pushing--will generate more light than heat. But amid a
series of imperfect alternatives, an independent commission may offer
the most answers with the least acrimony--especially if Bush comes to
see it as a tool, not a threat.</TE>

<HD>Cheney Says Bush Handled Hijack Warning Correctly</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Senator says White House overreacted to debate.
Vice president warns of another attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney mounted a spirited defense Sunday of the
way President Bush handled an August warning about possible airliner
hijackings, while a key Democrat accused the administration of
overreacting to questions about whether more could have been done to
anticipate the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't have any problem with a legitimate debate over the
performance of our intelligence agencies," Cheney said on "Fox News
Sunday." "I've got a real problem with the suggestion that somehow my
president had information and failed to act upon it to prevent the
attack of Sept. 11."</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) said the administration was too
defensive. "I don't believe any Democrat did suggest that the
president had specific information that led to Sept. 11 that he
didn't act on," he said on ABC's "This Week." "But I think it's just
as wrong for the administration to say that any one of us who's
raising questions about whether something could have been done to
prevent Sept. 11 is somehow unpatriotic."</LD>
<TE>   As debate continued over what was known--and what actions should
have been taken--before Sept. 11, Cheney warned that a new attack on
the United States is "almost a certainty."</TE>
<TE>   "Not a matter of if, but when," he told NBC's "Meet the Press."
Officials could not say when or where an attack might occur, and the
Office of Homeland Security's alert system remained on yellow, or
elevated alert, where it has been since the system was put in place
in March. A yellow alert means a significant risk of attack without
word of a specific target.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence, said on CBS' "Face the Nation" that the new threat
was "nonspecific, didn't lead you to a particular course of action
that you could take, other than a general increase in our level of
sensitivity to possible terrorist activities."</TE>
<TE>   In another development Sunday, government officials were eager to
analyze a video of Osama bin Laden that was said to include sections
filmed in March. If genuine, it would be the first sign that the Al
Qaeda leader survived allied attacks on the Tora Bora mountain
complex in Afghanistan, according to the Sunday Times of London,
which obtained the video.</TE>
<TE>   The clash continued Sunday between the administration and some
members of Congress over who should investigate what intelligence and
law enforcement agencies knew before Sept. 11 and what actions they
took.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman is among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who want an
independent commission to investigate, contending that such a probe
would be the least susceptible to politics. But the administration
favors an inquiry by the House and Senate intelligence committees,
arguing that they have the expertise in dealing with security
matters.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a member of the Senate panel,
told CNN's "Late Edition" that she favors a review by the
intelligence committees. "We're in the middle of a war on terror. We
need to be together," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers want to see the Aug. 6 presidential briefing paper
that warned Bush that the Al Qaeda network might have plans to hijack
airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney said Sunday that he reviewed the memo and found nothing in
it that would have hinted that airplanes might be used as missiles.
"It was more a matter of Al Qaeda has a desire to strike us, and one
possibility is they might hijack an aircraft," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you going to shut down the nation's aviation system based on
that report?" Cheney added. "You wouldn't."</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers also want to see a July memo written by an FBI
agent in Phoenix, urging his superiors to investigate Middle
Easterners enrolled in U.S. flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney said that the administration has turned over 180,000 pages
of documents to the intelligence committees--and that he would
consider releasing the agent's memo as long as it was kept
confidential.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he would resist turning over the memo from the
president's Aug. 6 briefing, contending that the risk of leaks was
too great. Any revelation of the memo's contents would damage
intelligence gathering, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about trying to protect the interests of Republicans
in the White House," Cheney said. "It is very real about protecting
our capacity to deal with these threats in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, who as chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee has threatened to subpoena the White House for documents
related to his probe of Enron Corp.'s collapse, complained about the
administration's "penchant for secrecy."</TE>
<TE>   "People are wondering today why it took eight months for us to
learn about the briefing that the president had ...," Lieberman said.
"The truth is we don't know what information was given before Sept.
11....Was he given enough information?"</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that there were failures," Cheney said. " ...
But I can't say at this point that even if we had all those pieces
together that it would have led to the conclusion that they were
going to hit the Trade Center [and] the Pentagon." Cheney said it was
virtually impossible to create an indestructible defense against
attacks, noting that Israel--with its highly regarded intelligence
network--has still been hit by suicide bombings.</TE>

<HD>Asteroid May Have Given Rise to Dinosaurs</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An asteroid may have wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago,
but an earlier one probably allowed the rise of the giant creatures,
which dominated the planet for 135 million years, says a team from
Rutgers University in New Jersey.</LD>
<LD>   Piecing together evidence from footprints, fossils and a dusting
of a rare metal found in asteroids, the researchers reported in the
May 17 issue of Science that a huge impact wiped out most of the
plants and crocodilian creatures that ruled the world during the
Triassic era.</LD>
<LD>   That opened the way for the age of the dinosaurs in the Jurassic
era, just as the later asteroid allowed mammals to evolve. Looking at
footprints and fossilized bones from nearly 80 sites, the team
concluded that it only took about 50,000 years for dinosaurs to start
growing really big.</LD>
<TE>   Before the Jurassic, the biggest dinosaur around was probably
something like plateosaurus, a long-necked, two-legged plant-eater 20
feet long. Afterward, giant carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus rex and
gigantosaurus reached lengths of 41 feet and more.</TE>

<HD>Grave Near Stonehenge Yields Trove of Artifacts</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 4,000-year-old grave found near Stonehenge contains the remains of
an archer and a trove of artifacts that make it one of the richest
early Bronze Age sites in Europe, archeologists said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a fantastically important discovery both for the number of
artifacts found in that grave and the range of artifacts. It's
absolutely unique," said Gillian Varndell, a curator of the British
Museum's prehistory department.</LD>
<LD>   About 100 objects, including a pair of rare gold earrings, were
found three miles east of Stonehenge with the bones of a man who died
about the time the monolithic stone circle was taking the form we see
today.</LD>
<TE>   "It is the single richest burial from the British Isles" at about
this date, said Andrew Fitzpatrick, the Wessex Archeology project
manager in charge of the site at Amesbury, 75 miles southwest of
London.</TE>
<TE>   The man has been identified as an archer because the objects
buried with him included stone arrowheads and stone wrist guards that
protected the arm from the recoil of the bow. There also were stone
tools for butchering carcasses and for making more arrowheads.</TE>

<HD>Facial Recognition Skills Said to Peak as Infants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Never underestimate the intelligence of an infant. Six-month-old
babies can distinguish the faces of two monkeys better than adults or
older children, which suggests babies have some early capabilities
that do not increase, but lessen, with age, a research team says.</LD>
<LD>   "Babies already have certain abilities, and the environment they
are presented with could help them retain some of these abilities,"
said Michelle de Haan of University College London.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than starting out as a clean slate and adding on more
skills as they get older, babies seem to have a peak time between six
and nine months, when their brains take in and process visual
information to hone their perception skills, the team reported in the
May 17 issue of Science.</LD>
<TE>   "Something important is going on for setting up the way we
recognize faces as adults," De Haan said.</TE>
<TE>   As they get older, she said, the infants' brains filter out
information and their perception narrows so that by the time they are
9 months old they have a more difficult time or can no longer
distinguish the differences between the two monkeys.</TE>

<HD>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider</HD>
<DH>The public is asked to collect city-dwelling arachnids in a
survey for the Natural History Museum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling all Southern California spiders: The Natural History Museum
wants you.</LD>
<LD>   The museum is launching its first spider survey--one of only a
handful in the world to concentrate on city-dwelling spiders.</LD>
<LD>   "Most people, when they make spider collections, go to natural
areas where they expect to find huge spider diversity," said Brian
Brown, an associate curator of entomology at the L.A. County museum
and lead researcher of the Los Angeles Spider Survey. "This is
intended to be an urban spider survey. We want to see the spiders
that interact with people."</LD>
<TE>   Some 35,000 species of spiders have been identified. No one knows
how many may exist in the greater Los Angeles area. One estimate is
about 200, but that's a very rough guess, Brown said. He and his
colleagues want to find out.</TE>
<TE>   "Spiders, like most small animals, are poorly known," Brown said.
"Even in well-known parts of the world like L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Since just three people are conducting the survey, the museum is
asking the public to carefully collect spiders and bring them in to
be counted.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't go into everyone's house in the L.A. Basin--as much as
we would like to--so we're asking them to collect spiders from their
own homes and yards," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope we are going to get a lot of spiders," Brown said. "To do
the job right, we need thousands."</TE>
<TE>   They should not be hard to find. Although one study on the East
Coast found 2 million spiders per acre, an average Los Angeles yard
contains more than 100 spiders, said Brown. These include the common
jumping spider, an especially cute arachnid hunter with huge,
wandering eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll sit and look at you," said Jan Kempf, a volunteer with
the survey. "You can watch them watching you."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the biggest and most colorful spiders of the region are
the golden orb weaver, an inch-long yellow-and-black spider that
spins a web that's 3 feet across, and the green lynx spider, with a
big green-and-white abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   Survey team members said they would not be surprised if their work
turns up new species that have not been described before.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all local spiders are harmless to people: They don't tend
to bite and usually can't even pierce skin. But many spiders are
excellent hunters.</TE>
<TE>   The crab spider, which comes in bright yellow and pink, lies
camouflaged within flowers, waiting to ambush nectar-seeking insects.
Other spiders spit out silk to ensnare their prey or hold web between
their legs and throw it over prey like a net. Still others prey on
fellow spiders by pretending to be looking for a mate. And some small
spiders live unnoticed in the webs of larger spiders, feeding off
crumbs and leftovers.</TE>
<TE>   Spiders use venom to immobilize and liquefy the insides of their
prey. They then slurp up this "insect milkshake."</TE>
<TE>   The venom from most spiders is harmless to humans. The only two
spiders in our area that are known to be dangerous are the black
widow and the violin spider, a half-inch-long brown spider that is
very rare and has so far been found only in some parts of Sierra
Madre.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their portrayal in the new "Spider-Man" movie, "a spider
is not aggressive and doesn't seek to bite you," said Vygandas Relys,
a spider expert from Lithuania and visiting curator at the museum who
is helping to run the survey.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not a good food source," added Kempf. "They don't want to
waste their venom on you."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the confusion about the state of the local spider
population exists because spiders have not been collected extensively
here for several decades. In that same time, the human population has
boomed.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what the situation [for spiders] is now," Relys
said. While spiders are mostly harmless to people, the reverse is not
true. Urban sprawl has taken away much of the habitat used by local
spiders. One reason for the survey is to assess how urban spiders are
faring compared to their relatives in areas protected from
development.</TE>
<TE>   One species particularly hard hit is the California trapdoor
spider--an arachnid engineer that digs out a 6- to 10-inch burrow
using sharp spines on its legs and caps it with a tight-fitting
hinged lid, or trapdoor. The spiders, once common in Southern
California, are now a rarity. They favor the same locales favored by
developers: sunny, south-facing hillside slopes.</TE>
<TE>   Ubiquitous sprinkler systems also are a problem. "Native spiders
aren't used to all that water," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Well-kept yards are also to blame. "If you have aggressive
gardening, if you're raking up leaf litter, cleaning up under pots,
trimming hedges, you're taking away habitat for spiders," Kempf said.</TE>
<TE>   The region's noise pollution--from cars, helicopters and leaf
blowers--also takes a toll. "Spiders use vibrations to catch
information about prey and predators," Relys said. "A lot of traffic
and noise makes it very difficult for them to survive."</TE>
<TE>   Spiders are not so different from humans when it comes to
immigrating and taking up life in a new country. If they are like
other insects who take advantage of populated and disturbed
environments, a number of new species have invaded and possibly
displaced, or even eaten, native spiders.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is an international port with goods and people coming in
from all over the world," Brown said. "We have a constant stream of
spiders being introduced."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If you want to help with the museum's spider survey, collect spiders
from your house or yard. Do not capture animals from state or public
lands, where collecting may not be permitted.</LD>
<LD>   Carefully coax the spider into a jar, pill bottle or clear film
canister using a piece of paper or other object. Although spider
bites are rare, museum experts say spiders should not be touched. The
museum says it cannot be responsible for any bites or medical
treatment.</LD>
<LD>   You can bring the museum as many spiders as you would like.</LD>
<TE>   The spiders can be preserved in rubbing alcohol, which can be
purchased in drugstores. Or, if you bring the spiders to the museum
alive, place only one in each container, because multiple spiders in
one container might try to eat each other.</TE>
<TE>   Include a data sheet, which can be found at the survey Web site
below, or list your name, address, telephone number or e-mail, date
and time of day the spider was collected, as well as details on the
location and habitat where the spider was found.</TE>
<TE>   The museum will be accepting spiders for up to one year but would
especially like people to bring in spiders during the 16th Annual
Insect Fair this Saturday and Sunday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Behind a stellar pitching performance by sophomore Keira Goerl, UCLA
defeated South Carolina, 1-0, to avenge a stunning loss earlier in
the day and win the NCAA softball regional Sunday at Columbia, S.C.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins (54-7) advanced to the Women's College World Series for
the fourth consecutive year. UCLA was one of four Pacific 10
Conference teams to advance from the eight regionals.</LD>
<LD>   South Carolina (46-20) forced the winner-take-all game with a
dramatic 2-1 victory.</LD>
<TE>   The Gamecocks scored two runs in the bottom of the seventh inning,
the game-winner coming when Meghan Cornett scored on a wild pitch by
Amanda Freed.</TE>
<TE>   In the second game, Tairia Mims drove in Natasha Watley with a
double to center field.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of the way we bounced back after the first game," UCLA
Coach Sue Enquist said. "It's pretty tricky emotionally to recover in
such a short time and I felt like we did that. We weren't real
impressive either offensively and defensively, but when we had to get
it done, we got it done."</TE>
<TE>   Goerl made the run stand up by giving up only three hits, walking
none and striking out 10.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh inning, left fielder Erin Rahn made a running catch
with the tying and winning runs on base to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   At Fresno, California ended Cal State Fullerton's season with a
1-0 victory behind Jocelyn Forest's four-hit shutout.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans (53-13) threatened in the first inning when Gina Oaks
was hit by a pitch and Jodie Cox reached on a bunt single. With one
out, Forest walked Monica Lucatero to load the bases, but got Yasmin
Mossadeghi to pop out and Amy LaRocque on a strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Bears (52-19) managed only three hits against Oaks, but
one was Veronica Nelson's infield single that scored Kristen Bayless
in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were as good a team as anybody in this tournament,"
Fullerton Coach Michelle Gromacki said. "I tip my cap to Cal because
they are a heck of a team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA men's tennis semifinals have a decidedly Southern
California flavor as USC and UCLA advanced with victories.</TE>
<TE>   USC advanced to its first semifinal in eight years by defeating
Illinois, 4-2, at College Station, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans (23-5), who will play Tennessee today, lost the
doubles point, but got singles victories from Prakash Amitraj, Nick
Rainey, Daniel Langre and Ruben Torres, Nos. 3-6 in their lineup.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (22-4) routed Auburn, 4-0, getting singles victories from
Marcin Matkowski, Jean-Julien Rojer and Erfan Djahangiri.</TE>
<TE>   Matkowski and Rojer teamed to help the Bruins win the doubles
point.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Georgia, which plays UCLA, got singles
victories from Brandon Wagner, Lesley Joseph and Nicolas Boeker to
defeat Pepperdine, 4-1. The Waves finished 25-5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the strength of Brandon Boesch's five-hitter, Pepperdine
(29-30, 17-12) clinched the West Coast Conference's Coast Division
title Saturday with a 4-1 victory over Gonzaga.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves will play West Division champion San Diego in a
three-game series beginning Friday at Pepperdine to determine the
conference champion.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a 17-8 loss to Arizona State on Sunday and losing two of
three games to the Sun Devils, first-place USC (31-22, 14-7) remained
one game ahead of Washington and Stanford in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State helped boost its chances for a postseason berth
with a three-game sweep of Pacific at Blair Field.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers (34-19, 14-7) finished the sweep with a 5-0 victory
Sunday. Freshman Jered Weaver threw a four-hitter for Long Beach's
first complete game since March 17, 2000.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Defending world champion France set off for South Korea on Sunday
with Roger Lemerre just one of many World Cup coaches with plenty to
ponder during the long flight.</LD>
<LD>   In its final warmup game at home, France was beaten, 2-1, by
Belgium in Paris on Saturday, just as Italy was beaten, 1-0, by the
Czech Republic in Prague that same day.</LD>
<LD>   "This result throws shadows and questions," Italy Coach Giovanni
Trapattoni said. "To put it in a nutshell, this was not the team I
know."</LD>
<TE>   Trapattoni refused to accept that the absence of injured playmaker
Francesco Totti alone was responsible for what is only his second
loss in two years as Italy's coach.</TE>
<TE>   "We must learn how to live without Totti," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lemerre, meanwhile, was without his star because Zinedine Zidane
skipped the Belgium match and the flight to South Korea in order to
be with his wife, who gave birth to the couple's third son Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Germany Coach Rudi Voeller will decide today whether Sebastian
Deisler, 22, will be fit enough to risk taking him to the World Cup.
The midfielder reinjured his right knee in Germany's 6-2 rout of
Austria in Leverkusen on Saturday, but preliminary tests showed no
ligament tear. He will be reexamined in Munich today.</TE>
<TE>   Voeller already has lost defenders Christian Woerns and Jens
Nowotny to injury, as well as midfielder Mehmet Scholl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   England might not win the World Cup but it has made certain
hotelkeepers in Dubai a lot richer. The Sunday Mirror reported that
the bar bill for the 121-strong English delegation's three-day stay
at the luxury hotel--a stop-off point en route to Japan--came to
$54,000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spain's starting goalkeeper, Santiago Canizares of Valencia,
underwent an operation on his right toe Sunday and will be sidelined
for two months, the Spanish daily Marca reported. Canizares dropped a
bottle of after-shave on his foot Friday, severing both a tendon and
his chance of going to Korea/Japan '02.</TE>
<TE>   His starting spot will go to Real Madrid's Iker Casillas.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America</TE>
<TE>   Uruguay Coach Victor Pua on Sunday named his World Cup roster of
23 players, with the only newsworthy occurrence being that he dropped
injured forward Daniel Fonseca, the 32-year-old former Napoli and
Juventus player whose inclusion in the squad of 27 had brought Pua
nothing but media criticism.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador striker Augustin Delgado apparently has aggravated an
injury in his left knee and is complaining of pain, according to
Coach Hernan Dario Gomez.</TE>
<TE>   Africa</TE>
<TE>   Tunisia midfielder Oussama Sallami, 22, has been ruled out of the
World Cup after twisting his knee during a warmup game in Japan on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Asia</TE>
<TE>   China was shut out for the third game in a row when the Dutch club
PSV Eindhoven defeated it, 1-0, in Shanghai on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bora Milutinovic's team last week was blanked, 2-0, by
Uruguay and before that was held to a 0-0 tie by South Korea.</TE>

<HD>Cherundolo Is Able to Grin and Bear U.S. Loss</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Defender added to American team, which falls to
Netherlands, 2-0, in final warmup game before World Cup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>It's not common to find an American player smiling after a loss, but
try as he might, Steve Cherundolo wasn't able to get rid of the grin.</LD>
<LD>   That's because of the phone call he got while watching TV at home
in San Diego on Saturday evening, telling him to hop on a red-eye and
fly here to join the rest of the U.S. World Cup team.</LD>
<LD>   It's also because Cherundolo, a defender, spent Sunday afternoon
watching from the bench and was in no way responsible for the two
glaring defensive blunders that caused the U.S. to lose, 2-0, to the
Netherlands in front of 36,778 at CMGI Field in the team's final
warmup game before leaving Thursday for Korea/Japan '02.</LD>
<TE>   So Cherundolo--called in as a replacement for injured Greg Vanney
after Vanney had been called in as a replacement for injured Chris
Armas--was still grinning when he got back on a plane Sunday night
and flew back to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   From out of nowhere, he suddenly was going to the World Cup. Heady
stuff for a 23-year-old who this season helped his club team,
Hannover '96, win promotion to the German Bundesliga's first
division.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve can certainly help the team," veteran defender Jeff Agoos
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need some cover in the back, and especially in the
outside back positions," Coach Bruce Arena said. "He gives us other
options."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. was certainly in need of those Sunday. In patches, it
played well, but there were the usual breakdowns that even four years
under Arena have not been able to erase.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans outshot the Dutch, 18-14, but came up blank because
too many shots went high or wide, and those that were well aimed were
handled by goalkeeper Ronald Waterreus.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have easily walked in at halftime with a goal or two,"
said Arena, who had watched Brian McBride, Claudio Reyna and Eddie
Pope all have on-target shots turned away by Waterreus.</TE>
<TE>   Four minutes after Agoos had left the game because of a tight calf
muscle and only seconds before halftime, the Netherlands grabbed the
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Pope, who earlier had cleared a shot by Roy Makaay off the line,
again got in a tussle with the Dutch midfielder inside the box, and
this time Makaay regained his feet before Pope and in time to steer
the ball beneath goalkeeper Brad Friedel from the right side of the
net.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bad goal to give up in the 45th minute," Arena said. "It
was a bad second goal [to give up in the 76th], but having said that,
[there were] a lot of good things, some good individual
performances."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. plays Portugal, South Korea and Poland in the first round
of the World Cup, and the fact that the Americans are 0-4 against
European opposition this year was dismissed by Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Portuguese, the Koreans and the Poles will take some
comfort from the almost farcical miscommunication between defender
David Regis and goalkeeper Kasey Keller (who replaced Friedel for the
second half) that allowed Andy van der Meyde to sneak in, steal the
ball and tap it into the empty net to make it 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Those sort of mistakes can mean the difference between going to
the second round and going home.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, we played very well defensively for large segments of the
game, but we broke down obviously on a couple of plays that made a
difference," Arena said.</TE>
<TE>   Is the U.S. ready for the World Cup?</TE>
<TE>   "Not today," Arena said. "We're not supposed to be ready today.
We're supposed to be ready June 5, that's when we'll find out if
we're ready. But I think we've made good progress in these two and a
half weeks."</TE>

<HD>Universal Studios Set for U.S., Overseas Expansion</HD>
<DH>Theme parks: Parent firm Vivendi is confident after
business rebounds sooner than expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Diller, in one of his first strategic moves since taking the
helm of Vivendi Universal Entertainment this month, has green-lighted
an unexpected expansion of the company's theme park business.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a severe downturn in tourism and theme park attendance
after Sept. 11, Universal Studios soon will announce plans to develop
three major new attractions at its theme parks in Hollywood and
Orlando, Fla. The attractions, representing an investment of more
than $60 million, will be based on the hit animated movies "Shrek"
and "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius."</LD>
<LD>   Diller also has given the theme park group the go-ahead to
aggressively scout for new locales for additional theme parks
overseas, including possible sites in Germany and mainland China.</LD>
<TE>   The developments reflect a vote of confidence in Vivendi
Universal's theme parks, which have bounced back sooner than expected
from a slump that accelerated after Sept. 11 and sparked layoffs and
cutbacks. Universal Studios Hollywood reported record attendance in
this year's first quarter, driven mostly by a popular discount on
annual passes. Its two parks in Orlando--Universal Studios and
Islands of Adventure--are running at last year's levels, executives
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rival Walt Disney Co. also has seen significant gains in
attendance in recent months, though its theme parks have been more
affected by a continued slump in international travel.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi also has been encouraged by the strong results from its
theme park in Osaka, Japan, which in its first year of operation drew
11 million visitors--2 million more than the company
projected--despite a recession in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The gains in Japan and Hollywood brought a 69% jump in the group's
cash flow in the first quarter, more than any other segment of
Vivendi.</TE>
<TE>   "In the post 9/11 period we came out swinging," said Tom Williams,
chairman of Universal Studios Recreation Group.</TE>
<TE>   Williams attributes the turnaround largely to an aggressive
marketing campaign after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to counter
the steep travel falloff. Universal doubled its advertising budget,
hired a new advertising agency and launched a national advertising
campaign aimed at drawing out-of-state visitors to its two Orlando
theme parks. The promotions included a 60-second TV commercial during
the Super Bowl in January.</TE>
<TE>   The performance of the parks, however, has been overshadowed by
the steep declines in Vivendi's stock price amid doubts from
investors about Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier's overall strategy
for building a rival to AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi shares closed Friday at 30.22, up 52 cents on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Theme parks also get overlooked because they account for only
about 5% of Vivendi's operating income. Yet they are an important
symbol of Messier's drive to create a global entertainment giant and
another outlet for promoting Vivendi's diverse holdings, including
movies, music, television and children's books.</TE>
<TE>   The mandate to expand the theme park business marks a strategic
shift from a year ago, when Universal Studios' new French parent put
theme park expansion on hold until the company's two newest parks in
Orlando and Japan could prove their worth.</TE>
<TE>   Diller is helping to bring new momentum to the division. He is a
legendary figure in Hollywood who chairs Vivendi Universal
Entertainment, which was recently created after Vivendi's $11-billion
acquisition of Diller's film and television businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Reached in Cannes on Friday, Diller affirmed his support of
expanding the theme park business and his passion for rides.</TE>
<TE>   "I like roller coasters," he said. " I went to the Universal park
in Orlando before it opened just because I wanted to see the
rides.... I rode Spider-Man so many times it's embarrassing. I took
my family at Christmas on the back-lot tour here [in Hollywood]. It's
genuinely fun."</TE>
<TE>   Diller also is interested in finding ways to promote ties between
the film and television business of USA Networks and Universal
Studios. Among the possibilities, Williams said, are staging
television shows such as Home Shopping Network at the theme parks, or
developing children's programs that could be spun off into theme park
attractions.</TE>
<TE>   The new expansions, however, will be on a more modest scale than
past projects, such as the $75-million Amazing Adventures of
Spider-Man ride in Orlando. The Shrek attraction will be a 10-minute
show, blending 3-D film, motion simulators and other effects based on
the movie. The Oscar-winning DreamWorks film was distributed through
Universal Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   The attraction will open simultaneously in Orlando and Hollywood
in the summer of 2003--a first for Universal Studios--in an effort to
create more cohesion between the properties.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Studios Florida in spring 2003 will add the Jimmy
Neutron Adventure, inspired by the animated hit movie by Paramount
Pictures and Viacom Inc.'s Nickelodeon. A motion-based attraction, it
will take visitors on a ride in Jimmy's rocket ship and include such
popular children's TV characters as SpongeBob SquarePants and those
on "Rugrats."</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts said these kinds of additions are necessary to
keep theme parks healthy and competitive. Walt Disney World, for
example, will open its much-heralded Mission Space attraction at
Epcot next year.</TE>
<TE>   "If they don't get out in front and add new things, they have a
real chance of falling back," said Steve Baker, a theme park
consultant in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Studios also is looking to expand internationally, but
only with the help of local partners who can finance most of the
cost.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to grow judiciously," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Universal Studios owns 24% of Universal Studios Japan
and has a lucrative management deal but invested only $90million in
the $1.7-billion facility.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan has been such an enormous success, it just reinforced the
confidence that Vivendi had in the recreation business," said
Universal Studios President Ron Meyer.</TE>
<TE>   New theme parks probably won't be on that same scale or that of
the company's Islands of Adventure theme park, which opened in 1999
adjacent to the existing Universal Studios in Orlando. Islands of
Adventure cost more than $2billion to open.</TE>
<TE>   The company has not said how many parks it will build, the cost,
or how they might be financed.</TE>
<TE>   A string of deals in the last four years has brought Vivendi's
debt to about $17 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Universal also operates a resort near Barcelona, Spain, called
Universal Mediterranea, which is adding a second 500-room hotel and a
water park to the existing Port Aventura theme park.</TE>
<TE>   The studio is studying sites in Germany and China, including
Shanghai and Beijing. Disney, which just opened a second theme park
in Paris, also is building a park in Hong Kong and studying sites on
the mainland as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, there are many great opportunities to grow," Meyer said.</TE>
