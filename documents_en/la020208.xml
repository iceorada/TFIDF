<HD>Which Chef's Food Will Rock on Grammy Night?</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GINA PICCALO AND LOUISE ROUG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The music industry is filled with artists known for their appetites,
and among those charged with satisfying them are the chefs who will
fill the plates at this month's Grammy party. At a tasting Wednesday
afternoon, sous chefs at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown
Los Angeles offered a preview of what the musical elite will eat.</LD>
<LD>   On every plate sat a little work of art: a tiny piece of asparagus
wrapped in steak decorated with a swirl of creme fraiche and a sprig
of parsley. This little perfect mouthful, times many hundred, will be
among the offerings served to the estimated 4,500 people--rock stars,
music industry folks and fans--who will crowd into the hotel for the
Recording Academy's mammoth after-party. This delicacy, created by
the hotel's executive chef, Samuel Sanchez, will compete with those
from 10 of the best chefs in Los Angeles, who are invited nearly
every year to share their bite-size best at the event.</LD>
<LD>   The party, which consumes several of the hotel's ballrooms, begins
at the conclusion of the ceremony at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   To keep some semblance of order in his 125,000-square-foot
kitchen, Sanchez assigns each chef 500 square feet of cooking space
and some shelves in a walk-in refrigerator. Signs are posted to alert
waiters of the different restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Chef John Sola of the Grill on the Alley will take a station at
the far end of the kitchen. A few feet away, chef Yujean Kang will be
managing his woks on a grill that reaches 750 degrees. And "there is
one guy who uses a lot of burners," Sanchez said, referring to chef
Hans Rockenwagner.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks before the big night, Sanchez said, he is kept up at
night worrying over the details. "You have butterflies the whole
month," he said. "But you get used to it."</TE>
<TE>   Actors have to eat on awards nights, too. The day previous, across
town, in a small auditorium at the Screen Actors Guild on Wilshire,
president Melissa Gilbert glanced over a table decorated with
succulents and orchids. Roasted vegetables and mozzarella formed
small towers along the baby sea bass on square blue glass plates. A
board member joked, "This looks like just another board meeting."
"Yeah, right," Gilbert replied.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of chefs hovered in the background as Gilbert chatted
with a couple of members of the SAG board. The occasion: the
unveiling of the menu for the March 10 SAG Awards at the Shrine
Auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome to my home away from home," Gilbert joked as she took the
microphone. "I'm ready to set up a cot here."</TE>
<TE>   (Gilbert has had more than food on her mind lately as SAG prepares
to rerun the election she thought she won from Valerie Harper in
November.)</TE>
<TE>   Patina founder Joachim Splichal stepped up to the podium and
described the food that will be served to 1,100 guests attending the
awards dinner. (The meal will require 1,100 Japanese eggplants, 180
pounds of Mozzarella cheese, 275 pounds of baby sea bass and 687
pounds of chicken breasts, among other ingredients, and the talents
of Splichal and 40 other chefs.)</TE>
<TE>   One challenge is cooking to a particularly health-conscious
crowd--hence the mountains of vegetables, said Splichal. Another
challenge is speed: Everyone is supposed to be served within an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Sipchal, like his counterpart Sanchez at the Biltmore, admits to
jitters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like you're on stage," said Splichal. "It's a theater."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's Got a</TE>
<TE>   Call on the Vine</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood and wine!," exclaimed Richard Frank, the former head of
Disney Television, talking about Hollywood's passionate foray into
Napa Valley. David Gerber, producer and former head of MGM, and AOL's
Barry Schuler are among the entertainment executives who have joined
Francis Ford Coppola in the wine business.</TE>
<TE>   "I find giant similarities between the entertainment business and
winemaking," said Frank. "You look at the grapes as you would a
script. You can't make a good movie without a good script, and you
can't make good wine without good grapes."</TE>
<TE>   Those similarities may help explain why Napa is becoming a
Hollywood suburb. And, said Frank, "it's the closest to Southern
France you're going to get."</TE>
<TE>   Frank bought a house in Rutherford 10 years ago, and soon became
friends with winemaker Koerner Rombauer. "I didn't know anything
about wine other than I liked to drink it," said Frank. Still,
Rombauer persuaded him to buy a vinery.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I think even Robin Williams has a property up here."
And Coppola is just a grape's throw away.</TE>
<TE>   Frank produces almost 5,000 cases of Cabernet Sauvignon and
regular Cabernet, and about 5,000 cases of sparkling wine every year.
(He has no qualms about calling the bubbles "Champagne," he said,
since the international treaty to protect the name was not signed by
the U.S.)</TE>
<TE>   Takers of his wines include restaurants Valentino and the Water
Grill in downtown L.A., Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   "What started as a hobby turned into a nice family business," he
said. "We sell every bottle we make."</TE>
<TE>   A Date With Fleiss,</TE>
<TE>   for Charity's Sake</TE>
<TE>   In an unorthodox attempt to raise money, a Catholic high school in
the Los Angeles area will auction off dinner with Heidi Fleiss and
boyfriend Tom Sizemore.</TE>
<TE>   The highest bidder claims a limo ride, dinner for 10 at Halie in
Pasadena, a pair of Fleiss signature underwear from her lingerie line
and a copy of her new book, "A Hooker Book," to be published later
this year.</TE>
<TE>   A school volunteer was introduced to Fleiss (a former Catholic
school student herself) through a mutual friend and asked her to
participate after KCET's public television host Huell Howser
declined. Last year, lunch with Howser raised $1,700 of the total
$150,000 raised for the school.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteer (who asked to remain anonymous) said she considered
Fleiss' notoriety--the former Hollywood madam served 21 months in
federal prison for money laundering and tax evasion--an obvious
selling point and not a question of taste. "She's a pretty savvy
lady," the volunteer said of Fleiss. "People are interested in her
and what she's been through and how she's progressed."</TE>
<TE>   But, the volunteer begged us to keep secret the name of the
school. Fleiss is still a bit controversial.</TE>
<TE>   Slugger to Wed</TE>
<TE>   Former home run record-holder Mark McGwire announced his
engagement Thursday to longtime girlfriend Stephanie Slemer. The
couple are planning a summer wedding.</TE>

<LD>HOTEL WORLD</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Ali Smith</LD>
<TE>   Anchor Books</TE>
<TE>   238 Pages, $12 paper</TE>
<TE>   "Hotel World," the much-hyped novel by Scottish writer Ali Smith,
short-listed for England's Booker Prize last year and just now making
its American debut, is a five-voice ghost story. Though the work
features only one authentic ghost, the remaining characters might as
well be apparitions, so deadened and dispirited are their tales. The
result leaves one wondering what all the fuss in England was about.</TE>
<TE>   In this neo-Gothic tale, the interconnecting stories are linked by
the hotel of the title--the thoroughly generic Global Hotel in an
equally generic English city--where 19-year-old Sara Wilby worked for
a brief time and died. Having made a bet with a co-worker that she
could fit into the dumbwaiter, Sara plummeted to her death in less
than four seconds when the supporting cable broke. The quintet of
narrators that carries the story forward have all been affected,
directly or indirectly, by this death and take turns bending the
reader's ear with their own tangential tales.</TE>
<TE>   The ghost of Sara is the first narrator, floating in the gap
between life and death. The colors she can see are fading, and her
grasp of common words is leaving. "I will miss smell," she tells us.
"My feet.... The bright packaging round foods. Small coins that are
not worth much, the weight of them in a pocket or hand."</TE>
<TE>   A distinct entity from Sara the corpse, the ghost cajoles the
corpse into letting out hints of information by torturing her with
songs from popular West End musicals ("All I want is a room
somewhere/far away from the cold night air"), and Smith sometimes too
hits a few high notes.</TE>
<TE>   But unfortunately, the promise--that Smith's writing skill and
pointed humor will consider the transitory nature of life--is never
kept. Like Sara's drop, it's all downhill from there.</TE>
<TE>   The next narrator is Elspeth, a homeless woman who sits near the
entrance of the hotel asking passersby for spare change; she tells
her story of the hardships of homeless life juxtaposed against her
childhood. Elspeth has lost most of her ability to carry on a
conversation having, like Sara's ghost, misplaced common words. But
her thoughts, at least, are deep: "Poetic darkness," she ponders,
"has an extra E, as if a longer kind of darkness than the ordinary
kind, and a capital D. Darknesse. Essence of Dark."</TE>
<TE>   Lise, the hotel's receptionist, takes pity on Elspeth and offers
her a room for the night. This act is less out of compassion than to
get back at the faceless corporation that employs her. Lise's story,
which vaults into the future, tells of how she will soon be so
incapacitated that she'll be unable to do anything but wait for her
mother to show up and care for her. This jump in chronology is
jarring because the narrative never catches up with that future; it
serves, however, to remind readers that no one can escape fate. In
"Hotel World," each character is given a short burst of
contentment--as brief, say, as a hotel stay--before the bitter nature
of life resumes.</TE>
<TE>   Then we have Penny, a self-obsessed journalist staying at the
hotel who spends an evening traipsing the countryside with Elspeth.
Penny is a shallow, utterly unlikable character--at one point, she
tries breaking her laptop for the fun of it--who adds little more
than insipid details to the story.</TE>
<TE>   As part of her evening's entertainment, Penny meets up with Sara's
younger sister Clare, the bereft sibling. Clare narrates a section of
the novel, written without punctuation or paragraph breaks, that
relies monotonously on the ampersand to carry the weight of
transition. Clare's whining about the death of her sister, instead of
earning her the reader's empathy, serves to distance us even further
from the tragic loss.</TE>
<TE>   "Hotel World" frustrates and disappoints. Throughout, Smith plays
with postmodern techniques, as if she needs to prove to readers that
she's on the edge when it comes to narrative style. The effect,
however, is anything but welcoming. Like the hotel chain that
features a huge spray of stargazer lilies in its lobby and boasts
countless sister hotels with identical lobbies and identical sprays,
the touches Smith employs are neither original nor interesting. Her
narrators, after a few pages, sound the same. They snivel. They
complain. They fret over their own personal concerns, as Sara's
spirit attempts--perhaps as the novel's most notable ambitions--to
understand the meaning of death.</TE>

<HD>It's a Double-Edged Scalpel</HD>
<DH>Newswoman Greta Van Susteren gets a youthful new look but
faces criticism for going under the knife.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She's confessed, but America is busily assessing her guilt. "The jury
is out," Greta Van Susteren observed in her usual wry manner. The
former CNN anchor wasn't talking about a trial or even her new show,
"On the Record," which premiered on Fox News Channel on Monday. She
was referring to her plastic surgery, which was making headlines even
before her first new broadcast.</LD>
<LD>   The blond 47-year-old looks less wrinkled and, to use that popular
euphemism, "fresher."</LD>
<LD>   "I'm afraid that when the swelling goes down, people will say
something about me spending money and not getting a result," Van
Susteren said in an interview Wednesday about the eye job she had on
Jan. 11. The bags below her eyes, even the forehead lines and the
scruffy eyebrows that had given her face character were erased by
either the cosmetic surgeon's scalpel or clever makeup.</LD>
<TE>   What is perhaps most shocking about Van Susteren's eye tuck is not
how it made her look, but how it immediately made her a pioneer, even
though she's far from the first celebrity to admit, willingly or not,
to cosmetic surgery. Actress Pamela Anderson Lee was cheered for
discussing why she had her breast implants removed nearly three years
ago, while Linda Tripp and Paula Jones became as talked about for
their plastic surgery transformations as for their part in the
Clinton scandals. With each admission or revelation, vanity--not
candor--becomes the center of discussion.</TE>
<TE>   As a network news anchor who admitted to surgery, Van Susteren
broke a code of not-so-secret secrecy among her colleagues and
illuminated society's conflicted feelings about our emphasis on
appearance, the nature of news and women's place in it. Evidently, as
a journalist she is supposed to be immune to vanity--and to the
effects of aging. She's been surprised by the reactions, some of
which seem more fitting for a criminal.</TE>
<TE>   "The strangest question was, am I worried about affecting my
credibility?" she said. "The doctor didn't remove my education and
experience. The second thing is, how come when I'm open and honest,
there is a question about my credibility? But if I keep it quiet,
hide and lie, my credibility is supposed to be better?"</TE>
<TE>   She has found it odd that her new look has caused observers to
conclude that she had Botox injections (she says she hasn't), changed
her hair, her brows and even the kinds of clothes she wears. For the
record, she says her haircut, highlights and suit aren't new. Though
Van Susteren says the media have treated her decision kindly, she's
now earned a new identity.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the poster child," she said. "Any time there is an article on
plastic surgery, my name will appear. Having plastic surgery is not
shoplifting. People have treated it like, 'Oh, my God! She got
plastic surgery!' But I say, if people don't notice it, you are
wasting your money."</TE>
<TE>   Cosmetic surgery may, indeed, obliterate wrinkles and bags, but
the result almost always creates an odd juxtaposition of 25-year-old
parts peering out from a frozen expression on a decades-older body.
Even as surgeons are better able to cover their tracks with less
invasive techniques, the increased awareness of cosmetic surgery has
made it easier to spot. We don't buy the old white lies and excuses
for swelling, bruises and, weeks later, a strangely different
countenance.</TE>
<TE>   So perhaps Van Susteren was forced to show her hand--or rather,
the handiwork of her doctor. The anchor looks startlingly different
than she did at her previous job at CNN, partly because her face is
still quite swollen. Since her surgery has "become the public
spectacle," she has mostly given up trying to mitigate the swelling.</TE>
<TE>   She denies that having, or admitting to, the surgery was a
publicity ploy. "I'm not that clever," she said. And while it's
tempting to paint the anchor as another aging woman desperate to stay
competitive in the ageist and sexist world of TV news, Van Susteren
insists she had the surgery on a whim while waiting to start her new
show.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not this thing that I sat around debating," she said. "Had
CNN or Fox told me to do it, I would never have done it." She added
that her decision didn't derive from insecurity. "At 47, I've been
happily married for 15 years. I intend to spend the rest of my life
with my husband. I have another career I can fall back on," said the
former defense attorney, who earned credibility as an analyst during
the O.J. Simpson trial. "And I'm not out looking for men."</TE>
<TE>   Though Van Susteren may have been free of the typical pressures to
have surgery, some observers said her actions add to the incentive
for other women.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bad indicator," said Dana Adams, a former network
correspondent who coached other newscasters through her Adams
Broadcast Consulting business. "I think it's kind of sad that women
continue to have to prostitute ourselves and share our innermost
secrets." Cosmetic surgery has become a fact of life in television
news. "You not only have to get it,'' Adams said, "you have to admit
it. As we age, women become hags and men become seasoned."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it is done for good reasons or bad, plastic surgery plays
into the entertainment values and emphasis on looks that have
infiltrated the most strict and serious levels of TV journalism, said
former network reporter Cynthia Kennard, who is now an assistant
professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all blurred now," Kennard said. "It's so difficult to teach
in an environment like that. Here you are in a classroom, and you try
to talk to students about ethics and standards and covering your
community, your police department and your legislature, and instead,
the nation is talking about Greta Van Susteren's eye job. And she's
talking about it, too."</TE>
<TE>   In the new era of high-definition TV that shows all, surgery may
become more commonplace. And now that the Food and Drug
Administration is expected to approve Botox for cosmetic uses, more
frozen faces may appear on TV as traditional cosmetics fail to rise
to the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   (Botox is a toxin that, when injected into the skin, temporarily
paralyzes some facial muscles, thus reducing the appearance of
wrinkles.)</TE>
<TE>   "The medium of television doesn't hide anything," said Jeff Wald,
news director at KTLA and a former consultant to newscasters. "If the
lighting isn't right or someone had a bad day, you can put on as much
makeup as you want, but the camera sees that stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "Now with all the new digital equipment out there, you see
everything."</TE>

<LD>Did you ever have a dream that you knew you could make into a
reality? Maybe an idea for a play you could write or a law you could
ask your representatives to pass?</LD>
<LD>   Martin Luther King Jr. had a dream that all people would be
treated as equals, regardless of the color of their skin or the
amount of money they had. That people would be valued just because
they are people. He wanted to win civil rights and voting rights for
people of all colors.</LD>
<LD>   Although he did not live to see his entire dream come true, his
work helped create a new era in America. People of all colors and
levels of wealth could vote, and the laws limiting racial integration
were lifted.</LD>
<TE>   At Atlanta's Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, you
can learn about King and other leaders of America's civil rights
movement. And you can learn about historic events like the
Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott, the 1963 march on Washington, and the
march from Selma, Ala., to Montgomery in 1965, all of which helped
change the way Americans live.</TE>
<TE>   You can also take a tour of the house where King was born, learn

<HD>Fashion Gets Its Feelings Back</HD>
<DH>Sobered by Sept. 11, designers put shoppers front and
center, stressing simple beauty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--Catherine Malandrino is busy pinning a cascading,
floor-length skirt onto a mannequin at her Midtown studio. She pauses
for a few moments and looks out at the skyline from her 12th-floor
window on West 39th Street on a cold and rainy Thursday. "It's a
different world now, and as a designer I feel like a pioneer in a new
world," she says in her French-accented English, then returns to her
wool jersey creation. She is surrounded by racks of the
cowboy-inspired fall collection called Wanted that she will show
during Fashion Week, which begins today. "This season it's all about
the customer, what the customer wants," she says.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, at the 7th Avenue offices of Michael Kors, the
designer--in khaki trousers, long-sleeve T-shirt and
sneakers--couldn't agree more. "This will be the most
consumer-friendly collection week we've seen in years." He also
predicts that many, if not most, of the collections will be
all-American in theme.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, Carolina Herrera is calling her collection American Woman.
Donna Karan says her is "all about Manhattan." Jeremy Scott has
planned a finale that salutes New York.</LD>
<TE>   Five months after this city's last Fashion Week was cut short
because of the attacks on the World Trade Center, designers return
for their biannual ritual of unveiling new creations in a chastened
mood--subdued, reflective and newly attuned to shoppers. Gone for
now, many say, are the days of the lavish, over-the-top runway shows
and such parties as the one hosted by Marc Jacobs and attended by
celebrities at Pier 54 the night before the attacks. Several
designers, including Herrera and Karan, will present their fall
collections in their showrooms, opting for a more intimate,
old-fashioned setting.</TE>
<TE>   Kors says the mood within the fashion community is "quieter" than
in the past. "It's time we've stopped tap-dancing with people. This
week is not about the high jinks involved with shows, not about the
500 celebrities in the audience. It's going to be about wearable
clothes,'' Kors says. Though his business has been solid, "it's going
to be a difficult year."</TE>
<TE>   At Bryant Park, where most shows will be staged, there are only
two tents instead of the usual four. Other shows will be held at
SoHo's Puck Building, which is a less expensive venue for designers.
Audiences will be smaller, but about 1,500 have officially registered
to be part of Fashion Week.</TE>
<TE>   "Fashion had become so much more about spectacle," says Jaqui
Lividini, Saks Fifth Avenue's senior vice president of fashion
merchandising and communications. "We had lost fashion's simplicity
and sense of beauty. I think that's coming back. This season, beauty
will be the core response to the aftermath of Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   That could well mean less avant-gardism and less
ostentatiousness--"less" being the operative word.</TE>
<TE>   "Less this, less that, it's all about a certain rebirth in the
fashion industry that has emerged from the disaster," Karan says. "I
think fashion is in an interim period right now. People will still
shop. But the time right now is not about telling women or men that
you must wear this or that to be in fashion.... Let's face it, people
have tons of clothes in their closets. They don't need anything,
really, which is why my desire at this moment is to connect with the
consumer the way a good meal at a restaurant does, the way a good
movie does."</TE>
<TE>   The designer, who is optimistic about the week ahead, says, "I
want to touch people emotionally with my work. But fashion also has
to have a purpose and a reason. It can't just be another piece of
whatever. We have to give the customer a reason to buy. And after the
pain of Sept. 11, the only way we are going to get through this is by
talking to one another and not going into our separate worlds."</TE>
<TE>   That new sense of connecting appears to be spreading. Fern Mallis,
executive director of 7th on Sixth, producer of Fashion Week, says,
"There has been a kinder, gentler and more sensitive industry. But
the fashion industry also is a little leery because business has not
been great." (Even the animal-rights group PETA, which stages
anti-fur demonstrations, has called a truce on crashing shows to
protest.)</TE>
<TE>   Designers, mindful that sales are what count, are spending more
time building relationships with both business contacts and clients.</TE>
<TE>   Since fall, Malandrino, who moved her Paris-based business to West
39th Street four years ago, has been working directly with buyers and
others who normally deal with her business staff. She says the
industry "has changed from a cold, hard business to one that is much
more human. Everyone is much more open to feelings now--who they are,
what they do and what they're going to do--and it doesn't always have
to be about fashion."</TE>
<TE>   For Herrera, fashion more than ever is about connecting with
customers. She recently traveled throughout the country hosting
luncheons and other gatherings to meet shoppers in stores. She was
inspired to present her collection at her Madison Avenue showroom for
the first time--"it's essentially my office"--after watching 10 young
designers use the space last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a personal way to show clothes, for buyers and the
press to see the details of a garment, to chat with the designers.
The showroom venue was perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Designer Ralph Rucci will create a showroom atmosphere at Bryant
Park to give each of his 350 guests a front-row seat "so they can see
the clothes up front." That's if he finishes his collection, Chado
Ralph Rucci, in time, he jokes, adding that fabric deliveries from
Europe, as usual, are late.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm stressed. I don't see an end in sight to the work," he says.
"But my mood is optimistic because there is a clear degree of
camaraderie among those of us in fashion, and that's an emotion that
is always almost nonexistent."</TE>
<TE>   To take advantage of the friendly ambience, several designers will
be showing here for the first time, including L.A.'s Rick Owens, new
L.A. transplant Jeremy Scott, London's Matthew Williamson and
Balenciaga's Paris-based designer Nicolas Ghesquiere.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like everyone got robbed last season and that's why people
are feeling strong about this season," says Scott. "Fashion Week is
gonna be a real kick in the pants."</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Klein, formerly of Paris, who will show here, says, "This is
the place where you have to show right now. New York has soul."</TE>
<TE>   New designers think so too. Gary Graham, who will present his
first show as part of the Gen Art collective, says the tragedy has
propelled young designers to move ahead, not retreat. "A lot of young
designers that were reluctant to go on or even get started in the
business are, like, 'I should do it now'--that's across the board.
And if you're in New York, fashion is part of the lifeblood of the
city. I don't ever want to move to Paris. New York is where it's at."</TE>
<TE>   He has plenty of company, including fellow designer Oliver
Christian Herold, who also runs a small operation. By day, Herold is
a full-time stockbroker who works for Quick &amp; Reilly/Fleet Securities
Inc., three blocks from where the World Trade Center once stood. He
saw the towers go down and recalls "the smell of death" when he
returned to Wall Street weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a sign to quit my dream," he says about his off-hours
designing career. He'll take vacation days to stage his show Tuesday
that will pay homage to the military nurse with a collection called
Loose Lips Sink Ships.</TE>
<TE>   There's less whimsy, however, among veteran designers such as
BCBG's Max Azria, who admits to being in a "skeptical mood" with the
economy in a recession and America at war.</TE>
<TE>   "Retailers are concerned. They, like us, have taken a big hit in
the last four months. Everyone is trying to recover, trying to
reorganize their operations, but I think a lot of the smaller
companies will disappear," says Azria, whose global operations are
based in L.A. "Only the big companies will get stronger. You have to
be a fighter in this climate."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Dente of the New York advertising and public relations
agency Dente &amp; Cristina, which handles several fashion clients, says
many fashion businesses "are very timid about committing to financial
situations right now. No one knows where the market is going. We cut
back on our salaries, on our expenses. But you have to keep a
positive attitude about things like New York's Fashion Week. To turn
our backs on the week is really the wrong message to send."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, construction crews worked in the rain at Bryant Park
to complete the set up of the tents. Passersby often stopped to watch
the construction and the plastic fliers posted on the park's ornate,
wrought-iron fence. "Please pardon our appearance and sorry for any
inconvenience. We are in the process of turning New York City into
the fashion capital of the world again!" Flags around the park,
decorated with a drawing of a woman in red striking a Lady Liberty
pose, also proclaimed the city as the premier place for world
fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially opens Fashion Week today with a
ribbon-cutting ceremony at Bryant Park, where the tents are painted
with the American flag as interpreted by designer Stephen Sprouse.</TE>
<TE>   "Fashion Week will be a rebirth of sorts for us," says Peter
Arnold, executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of
America. "A lot of attention will be paid to what happens in the next
several days. The world's eyes will be on American fashion."</TE>

<HD>At Olympics, the Race Is to the Swiftest Outfits Science
Can Sew</HD>
<DH>New fabrics and competitive designers give some skaters and
skiers a slick advantage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Olympic speedskaters move to the starting line Saturday for the
first of their races, they will be wearing the best that science can
offer.</LD>
<LD>   Ditto for the other winter sports that will be showcased in the
coming weeks. Even the clunky sport of curling (a kind of
shuffleboard on ice) has its innovations.</LD>
<LD>   But the most persistent buzz in Salt Lake City has been about the
speedskaters' skintight racing suits, with sports apparel giant Nike
leading the way.</LD>
<TE>   At first glance, the Nike suit doesn't look much different from
any other of the one-piece stretch garments that cover racers from
head to skate. But the Nike Swift Skin, as it has been christened, is
made up of six kinds of fabric, each designed to enhance a skater's
speeds by cutting drag and friction. For instance, a fabric with a
slick finish covers the fastest-moving body parts--hands and skates.
A mesh fabric on the arms creates a dimpled effect, similar to that
of a golf ball, to aid in cutting through the air. All this, so that
skaters using the suits can cut mere milliseconds off their times.
Those fractions of time, though, could mean the difference between
winning and finishing far back in the pack.</TE>
<TE>   "The skaters have been very, very pleased," said Rick McDonald,
Nike's director of innovation, who is also quick not to give the
suits complete credit for recent fast times around the Olympic oval.
"You can't attribute the good times to any one particular thing
because so many factors enter into going fast."</TE>
<TE>   Nike, of course, is not alone in developing skating suits. In
fact, the company is a relatively recent entry into the sport, which
Japan-based rival Descente is quick to point out.</TE>
<TE>   Descente spokeswoman Kathryn Johnson said her company spent an
estimated 3,000 hours since the Nagano Winter Olympics improving the
speed suits used by the always-competitive Canadian team. The
Descente suits, which use tiny ribs to channel airflow over the body,
weigh in at a scant 185 grams.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a constant work in progress," Johnson said. "What is a
wonderful suit today could be obsolete in six months. What was good
for Nagano may not be the best suit for Salt Lake City."</TE>
<TE>   The Descente line made for some humorous headlines last January
when the Canadian team was racing at the world sprint championships
in Norway. Happy-face underwear was clearly visible through
speedskater Krisy Myers' skintight yellow suit. Johnson said the
Olympic uniform will be darker and less revealing.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the racing suits, Descente is also making the team's
warmup apparel, described unabashedly by the company as "shaped to
wrap the athlete in tranquil security. A molded garment that
comfortably wraps around the body to provide a cocoon of peace and
tranquillity."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes winter racing clothing is too fast. In the mid-1990s,
the sports outfitter Spyder introduced a ski racing suit called the
Speedwyre, whose users promptly began winning an inordinate number of
races. Racers under contract to other clothing manufacturers
complained they couldn't compete against the new design and in 1997,
the International Ski Federation banned the Speedwyre's use. Spyder,
which equips the U.S. ski team, still chafes at the ban, especially
because of the technological advances in other aspects of winter
sports.</TE>
<TE>   "New technology is embraced for hard goods like ski poles and
boots," said Laura Orlowski, Spyder's promotions and media manager.
"Other sports are embracing new technology, such as swimming and
speedskating. Their athletes are allowed to wear aerodynamic race
wear."</TE>
<TE>   Nike, not wanting to chance any quick reproduction of its racing
suits by other manufacturers, kept a tight security lid on them until
last month. Small wonder, given the amount of testing the company
did, including wind tunnel experiments in Washington and British
Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Athletes finally got a look at them last fall, but only in strict
secrecy behind the locked doors of the Olympic oval in Salt Lake
City. Nike officials made sure they were present on the track and in
the locker rooms to keep security tight and prying eyes out.</TE>
<TE>   As the Olympics are about to start, McDonald said most of the work
involves last-minute changes, using a cadre of pattern makers and
seamstresses imported for the occasion to make last-minute
alterations. The suits are so tight that it's impossible to make
standard sizes.</TE>
<TE>   "You can make the fastest suit in the world, but if you can't
skate in it, it doesn't mean much," McDonald said.</TE>
<TE>   Skaters from the United States, the Netherlands and Australia will
wear the Nike speed suits while only the Canadians will don
Descente's. Olympic federations from other countries have entered
into agreements with other companies to provide racing suits, which
come under the heading of team uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   Nike and Descente have invested major funding for a sport that is
hardly overflowing with participants. But both companies say the
investment is worth it because of products that might evolve from
their research.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like a Formula One race car," McDonald said. "It
provides us with a technology platform."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Johnson put it, "it's not speedskating for us, per se. It
gives us a reputation for excellence."</TE>

<HD>Reunion Wear That's Most Likely to Succeed</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: Blessed by good genes and a youthful attitude, I
usually can dress for the occasion. But my 30-year high school
reunion is in March, and I don't know what to wear. I'm a size 10 and
would like to look classy and trendy, but sexy at the same time. Any
suggestions?</LD>
<LD>   --GOING BACK</LD>
<LD>   Dear Going: Finding the Perfect High School Reunion Outfit is
every reunion-goer's goal, but it's a task usually taken on with much
fear and loathing. Why? So much emphasis is placed on one outfit that
it's as if wearing the wrong pantyhose or shoes will be the deciding
factor in having a great versus a lousy time.</LD>
<TE>   Now, isn't that silly? Think back to some of the memorable events
of your life--a wedding, a big family get-together, an anniversary
celebration. Do you recall what anyone was wearing? Do you recall
what you wore? Hopefully you're remembering instead who was there,
the conversations you had, the people you flirted with, the
reconnections you made with friends.</TE>
<TE>   We realize the high school reunion is an event unlike any other,
since most people go hoping to impress. The nerds, the jocks, the
brainiacs--they all want to show off their passel of brilliant,
stunning children, their $50,000 sports car, their six-figure job,
their trim physique or their summer home in the Hamptons.</TE>
<TE>   Some also use the reunion as an opportunity to show they've
changed. The nerd who's now ultra-cool wants people to know it, and
he wants his clothes to announce his new status. What we wear is a
reflection of who we are or who we want to be, hence the heightened
importance we place on The Outfit. But unless you show up in a clown
costume, chances are no one's going to pay that much attention to
what you're wearing. They'll also be paying attention to you--your
attitude toward life, your smile, what you have to say.</TE>
<TE>   Keep that last thought in mind as you shop. In fact, make it your
mantra.</TE>
<TE>   Since we know little about you other than your size and the fact
that you want to look classy, trendy and sexy, we suggest you put
together an outfit based on your best features. Are your legs
shapely? Try a short skirt and high heels. That's sexy; a skirt with
a little flounce at the hem makes it trendy, and if it's not too
short, it'll be classy.</TE>
<TE>   If you have a trim, toned upper body, try a sleeveless mock
turtleneck little black dress--better yet, make it a little white
dress and you'll really stand out. Keep the jewelry low-key to
emphasize the sophisticated, minimalistic look.</TE>
<TE>   Pants are also an option; try a slim style with a romantic wrap
top and pearls with a cameo pendant.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some tips for you and others bound for reunions:</TE>
<TE>   * Above all, be yourself. Don't assume another personality, such
as The Vamp, The Wall Street Guy or The Artiste if that's not you. If
that is you, go for it. But if it isn't, you won't feel comfortable
in your own skin, much less those clothes, and people can sense the
ruse.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't spend a ton of money. Unless you have bucks to burn, don't
invest a lot on one outfit. Start shopping early, and take advantage
of sales if you can. Remember the mantra.</TE>
<TE>   * Get a second opinion. Even if you're certain you've bagged the
perfect ensemble, ask a friend whose taste you admire to give you the
once-over to make sure everything checks out.</TE>
<TE>   * Remember good grooming habits. People may not remember your
clothes, but they will remember an unpleasant odor.</TE>
<TE>   * If you're traveling to your reunion, pack some backup items. An
extra shirt or pair of hose are good to take along in case of spills
or runs.</TE>

<HD>Meet Venus, Serena Williams</HD>
<DH>Part 5 The story so far: The dream of becoming the world's
best female tennis players is coming true for Venus and Serena.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLORIA D. MIKLOWITZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard and Oracene Williams had a dream that they could turn their
two youngest daughters into champion tennis players. That dream came
true in September 2001 at New York's Arthur Ashe Stadium, named after
the black tennis champion. That's when Venus and Serena Williams met
across a tennis court to decide who would win the 2001 U.S. Open
championship.</LD>
<LD>   The sisters had played together since they were tots. They had
competed in singles matches against each other. Each knew the other's
strengths and weaknesses. Each wanted to win but didn't want the
other sister to lose.</LD>
<LD>   It took 21-year-old Venus an hour and nine minutes to beat
19-year-old Serena, 6-2, 6-4. The crowd adored both women, so the
applause was subdued. Venus put an arm around Serena and said, "We
still love each other, right?" Afterward she said, "I don't exactly
feel like I've won. If I was playing a different opponent I'd be a
lot more joyful."</LD>
<TE>   The sisters have shown young women everywhere what it takes to be
winners. What it takes, besides skill, is the willingness to practice
hard and the belief that success is possible.</TE>
<TE>   What now for the sisters?</TE>
<TE>   Venus says she will continue to strive to be the world's top
player but expects to end her career by the time she is 26. She loves
to shop and thinks she might become a clothing designer or an
architect. Meanwhile, she takes college classes that will lead her in
those directions.</TE>
<TE>   Richard and Oracene Williams believe Serena may be the better
player. She learns from her sister's mistakes and improves all the
time. Like her older sister, she's very bright, and her parents would
like to see her go to college. "Education is power," her father says,
"not chasing around some ball."</TE>
<TE>   This is Gloria D. Miklowitz's 10th biography for the Kids' Reading
Room. Her story will be on The Times' Web site at
www.latimes.comkids. A new, five-part story begins Monday.</TE>

<HD>The Missing Link to Mideast Peace: Arab Pressure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID MAKOVSKY</AU>
<BD>David Makovsky is a senior fellow at the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy and a contributing editor of US News
and World Report. He is working on his second book on the Middle East
peace process.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How to deal with Yasser Arafat is a serious issue, one that Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and President Bush once again discussed
in their meeting at the White House on Thursday. Sharon has publicly
declared that he wants the U.S. to boycott Arafat because of the
Palestinian leader's failure to halt suicide bombings and other
terrorist attacks against Israel over the last 18 months.</LD>
<LD>   All the initiatives tried up until now--sticks, carrots and a
combination of the two--have failed because they lacked one key
ingredient: the political influence of the Arab states that also have
a stake in the Palestinian issue.</LD>
<LD>   But these countries' leaders appear too afraid of their own
populations to step forward. In a recent meeting with a visiting
dignitary, Arafat was unimpressed when the visitor presented a letter
from Egypt's Hosni Mubarak privately calling on Arafat to crack down
on Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Arafat said he will take such a letter
seriously when Mubarak says the same things publicly to his own
people.</LD>
<TE>   Arafat has reason not to worry. Arab leaders have rarely--if
ever--criticized him in public since the start of the Oslo process in
1993. He is confident that these Arab leaders need him for their
legitimacy more than he needs them. U.S. officials say that Mubarak
was furious with Arafat for inviting Iran to gain a foothold in the
eastern Mediterranean by smuggling a boatload of weapons through the
Suez Canal to the Gaza Strip and that the Egyptian has barely spoken
with him since. There is no sign that Arafat is concerned. He
apparently does not believe that Mubarak will do anything more than
stew.</TE>
<TE>   Autocratic Arab regimes have convinced themselves that public
criticism of Arafat will hurt them domestically. So therefore, when
President Clinton put forward a plan for Israel yielding 97% of the
West Bank, the Arabs would not nudge the Palestinians toward a
compromise on the remaining 3%.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Arabs bear responsibility. It was the Arab League--the
group of 22 Arab states--that created the Palestine Liberation
Organization in 1964 and then crowned the PLO as the "sole legitimate
representative" of the Palestinian people 10 years later. Now, 27
years later, the Arab countries must come together, with Egypt and
Saudi Arabia at the core. They must publicly say that there will be
no realization of Palestinian rights so long as the current
Palestinian leadership stands idle as Hamas and Islamic Jihad explode
any prospects for peace, or they forfeit their moral standing on this
issue.</TE>
<TE>   This inaction exacts a high price from the Palestinians. Without
candid advice from Arab friends, the net effect of the current
violence is hundreds of dead, a ruined economy and no political
achievements except vaporized support from the Israeli center and
left.</TE>
<TE>   In a post-Sept. 11 world, failure to combat terrorism has cost the
Palestinians dearly with the Bush administration. For the first time
two weeks ago, it publicly considered suspending ties with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have made clear that, if Palestinians tamp down
violence, the U.S. will focus on making demands on Sharon. The last
five Israeli prime ministers who came to office rose and fell on one
issue: the Palestinian conflict. When there is no terrorism, Israelis
lean toward moderates such as Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak, but when
people are getting blown up, voting goes the other way, as fear gains
and hope recedes.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis move toward peace when they feel more secure, not when
they feel more vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Arab regimes are also losers in the current crisis. With Arafat
inviting Iran into military collusion, Islamic radicalism, including
anti-Americanism, would only grow at home if violence continues
unabated. Peace and stability serve best. The Arab leaders are
complicit in the Israeli-Palestinian impasse. They are prone to blame
the United States, yet when Washington has needed their help, they
have been mute and have provided no ideas of their own. If Arafat
spurns an explicit public appeal by Arab leaders to end this
self-destructive violence, there should be clear consequences.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab leaders should work with people around Arafat and help
usher in the post-Arafat period. The Arabs can no longer continue to
complain from the sidelines. For the sake of the Palestinians and
themselves, they need--for a change--to be part of the solution.</TE>

<HD>Riordan Ducks Davis' Left Jab</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN SCHNUR</AU>
<BD>Dan Schnur was the communications director for former
Gov. Pete Wilson and the presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. John
McCain. Last summer, he served as an advisor to Riordan's
gubernatorial exploratory committee.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gray Davis opposes abortion. So does Richard Riordan. So do most
Californians.</LD>
<LD>   Davis supports abortion rights. So does Riordan. So do most
Californians.</LD>
<LD>   So why did Davis choose abortion as the weapon with which to
lambaste GOP challenger Riordan?</LD>
<TE>   And why would Davis pick abortion as the first topic of his
campaign when Californians are telling pollsters that their most
pressing concerns are education, energy and the economy?</TE>
<TE>   If Social Security has been viewed historically as the third rail
of American politics, then the abortion debate is a minefield with
machine gun crossfire. Although a relatively small percentage of
voters base their support for a candidate solely on this one issue,
those who do are among the most passionate and committed activists in
U.S. politics.</TE>
<TE>   More important, for the great swath of voters who decide statewide
elections in California, a politician's stance on abortion rights
becomes a handy stereotype with which to pigeonhole that candidate on
a broader range of issues.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, a pro-choice voter who hears the term "pro-life
Republican" tends to assume that the politician in question holds
views that are hostile to mainstream opinion on health care,
environmental and education issues. Similarly, a pro-life voter who
hears that a candidate is a "pro-choice Democrat" takes for granted
that this politician is a tax-and-spend, save-the-whales,
fund-the-Vietcong, old-time liberal.</TE>
<TE>   Successful politicians of both parties are those who are able to
break out of this broader stereotype by adopting positions on other
issues that destroy this ideological construct for voters suspicious
of extremes. In the 1998 election, for example, Davis himself coupled
his stands on abortion, gun control and gay rights with more centrist
positions on economic and public safety issues.</TE>
<TE>   But in Davis' case, his first campaign for governor was won by
using the abortion issue to paint his opponent into a narrow
ideological corner. The overwhelming majority of advertising that he
aired during the campaign's pivotal months centered on this line of
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into reelection this fall, the governor and his advisors
have been visibly uncomfortable at the prospect of not having the
abortion issue as a weapon to use against a pro-choice Republican
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   So Davis' solution has been to hammer Riordan for not being
sufficiently pro-choice.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, there are abortion-related issues on which the two
candidates differ. Riordan supports a ban on late-term abortion and a
parental consent requirement for pregnant teenagers. Davis opposes
both positions.</TE>
<TE>   But the majority of voters stand with Riordan on both points,
leaving Davis to question the depth of Riordan's commitment to the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has attacked Riordan for contributing to pro-life
organizations and for the strength of the language he uses to oppose
the abortion procedure. But Riordan's struggle to reconcile his
personal opposition to abortion with his support for abortion rights
is an internal conflict that most Californians have yet to resolve.
If Davis believes that the emotionally grueling debate over abortion
is as open and shut as his commercials imply, he is in a small
minority of voters for whom the issue requires no serious
consideration or equilibrium.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, Riordan has been largely silent in his own defense. This
may be an effort to avoid antagonizing conservative voters in the
weeks leading up to a Republican primary. But Riordan himself decided
to direct his message to the political middle: He regularly
volunteers his position on abortion rights to audiences of all
political persuasions. Yet after initially responding to Davis with a
generic criticism of the governor's tactics, Riordan has allowed
Davis to continue his assault unanswered.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, Riordan will be forced to confront Davis'
broadsides directly. When that time comes, it should not be difficult
for him to respond with a challenge of his own for Davis. "I am
opposed to abortion," Riordan should say. "But I believe in a women's
right to choose. Which one of those two points, Governor, do you
think is so wrong?"</TE>

<HD>A Playbook for GOP Contenders</HD>

<AU>ARNOLD STEINBERG</AU>
<BD>Arnold Steinberg is a political strategist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The three Republican candidates for governor debate for the second
time on Saturday. What difference will it make?</LD>
<LD>   That depends to a large degree on how the two men challenging GOP
front-runner Richard Riordan--Secretary of State Bill Jones and
businessman Bill Simon--use this debate to confront Riordan.</LD>
<LD>   How can they put him on the spot? And how can Riordan fend them
off and make himself the guy to take on Gov. Gray Davis next fall?</LD>
<TE>   Advice to Bill Simon: You say you're serious but you don't seem to
have the fire in the belly. Besides, why are you still hugging
Riordan? And where's your big ad buy?</TE>
<TE>   If you show us the money, it could be a Riordan-Simon race.</TE>
<TE>   People will listen to what you say. Don't be a policy wonk. Say
Riordan is soft on Proposition 13 and that he would tax the Internet.
Act tough enough to defeat Davis.</TE>
<TE>   For Bill Jones:</TE>
<TE>   OK, so you didn't go to charm school. But you can remember to
smile when you attack Riordan. And don't act like you're running for
party chairman--be a big picture guy.</TE>
<TE>   Go for the sound bite. Hit both Davis and Riordan on energy,
Enron, Ken Lay. Argue not that Riordan is too liberal but that he is
too inconsistent to oppose Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Advice to both Bills:</TE>
<TE>   Say that Riordan cannot win. Say it again.</TE>
<TE>   Advice for Riordan:</TE>
<TE>   Remember last year's runoff election for mayor, when you endorsed
Antonio Villaraigosa? You went with your heart over your head. That
was 10 months ago and you've been moving left ever since. You've
tried to pretend that the Republican primary does not exist. It does.</TE>

<AU>MAXINE WATERS</AU>
<BD>Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) represents the 35th
Congressional District.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once again Los Angeles is shaken by decisions made by a mayor
pertaining to the Police Department. This time, it is an unnecessary
announcement by Mayor James K. Hahn of his decision to not support
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks for a second five-year term.</LD>
<LD>   A chorus of outraged voices is denouncing the mayor's action.</LD>
<LD>   Most of these voices are coming from the African American
community. However, leaders and businesses representing downtown and
other areas of the city also are speaking out against the mayor and
in support of the chief.</LD>
<TE>   The mayor cannot credibly justify why he has chosen to publicly
preempt the Police Commission when the commission is charged with the
responsibility to do a performance review and decide whether Parks
should be reappointed. The commission's decision can only be
overturned by 10 votes of the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's announcement is not only an attempt to influence the
Police Commission but a bold, in-your-face statement to the chief and
the chief's supporters.</TE>
<TE>   The feelings of betrayal from the black community are not simply
based on race but are rather because the mayor, during his campaign,
promised an honest process that would allow the chief the opportunity
to be considered. The mayor did not declare his opposition to Parks,
as did some of the other mayoral candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Many of us are angered because we believe, even if there are
differences between the mayor and the chief, that the mayor did not
work seriously to resolve the differences.</TE>
<TE>   Parks is a man of impeccable integrity. He has been
straightforward in his opinions about the best way for the LAPD to
protect and serve this city. He has not made insensitive remarks to
inflame any sector of our city. He has not pitted communities against
each other. He is the most visible and accessible chief we have had.</TE>
<TE>   Why then did the mayor choose to create this public confrontation?</TE>
<TE>   The African American community supported the mayor not because we
wanted special treatment but rather because we trusted him to be fair
and to afford us the opportunity to be heard and to be at the
negotiating table on city issues.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, whom I strongly supported, has failed to be fair and
open with the African American community. His political advisors and
kitchen cabinet are all white. He has two inexperienced, unconnected
African American aides who are not consulted on important decisions
and lack the experience to represent African American affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor made his first round of appointments to the most
important commissions and came up with the same tired formula of one
African American on the Police Commission, one African American on
the Airport Commission, no blacks on the Harbor Commission, one black
for the Department of Water and Power. This is no more than the
representation we had under former Mayor Richard Riordan. And sadly,
most commissioners live in the San Fernando Valley or on the
Westside. The mayor was given recommendations that have languished
since June.</TE>
<TE>   One cannot help but wonder what he is really trying to do. Is he
trying to prove that he is not controlled by the African American
community? Is he trying to prove his strength with a very public hard
line against African American advice?</TE>
<TE>   The mayor was welcomed in our churches as a candidate and as an
elected official. He wooed and solicited the African American
community, and he was grateful for invitations to our socials and
celebrations. The mayor smiled and accepted the praise heaped on him
about his father's service to the African American community.</TE>
<TE>   Now the mayor's smile is gone. It is a struggle to get him to
accept invitations, and he does not ask for advice. He has made a few
commission appointments at my urging. However, I get the feeling he
wishes I would just go away.</TE>
<TE>   Well, I am going away.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor believes the anger will subside. He believes the rallies
cannot be sustained. He believes he has enough resources to quiet
community groups.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, he believes he has the upper hand and that not a lot
can be done about it.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles deserves better leadership than he has
shown. His father would not be proud of that. He must answer to the
people of this city for promises unkept, not only in the African
American community but throughout this city.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Mayor, it is you--not Chief Parks--who has failed to earn the
right to serve a second term.</TE>

<HD>Tripped by Its Clumsy Lines</HD>
<DH>Despite the high-flying action, 'Rollerball' crashes with
dialogue that inspires laughs. Too bad. This remake could have been a
contender.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To watch the new "Rollerball" is to understand why John McTiernan
would be tempted to rework the 1975 Norman Jewison original. The
earlier film was set in a future in which an ultra-violent sport
served as an outlet for a world in which other violence had been
banned. Since the day of extreme sports has arrived--in a world more
violent than ever--there was no need to set it in the future.</LD>
<LD>   By setting the story in an unnamed former Soviet republic in
central Asia that seems to be Kazakhstan, McTiernan and his writers
could comment on how violence and corruption flourish in post-Soviet
chaos and at the same time turn out high-voltage action
entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way.</LD>
<TE>   The central Asian context for the plot was either smudged in the
film's well-publicized reworking or was never defined in the first
place. What is clear is that too much of the dialogue is laughably
awful, which is a shame because it undercuts the bravura
accomplishment in the staging and photographing of the rollerball
sequences.</TE>
<TE>   The sport takes place on a figure-eight slope-sided track, and its
participants, on skates, attempt to toss small hard balls into a
basketball-like hoop. It's not enough that the competing teams try to
block each other, hockey-style: A motorcyclist also keeps whizzing
by--sometimes overhead. It wouldn't have hurt to have had a simple
explanation of how rollerball works, enabling the viewer to get
caught up in the not inconsiderable visceral thrill of the sport
without having to worry about what exactly is going on--an
observation that lamentably applies to the film as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   Rollerball is the invention of a man known only as Petrovich (Jean
Reno), a guy so scary behind a hearty, affable facade that it is said
that in the old days, KGB colonels crossed streets to avoid him when
they saw him coming. With the promise of big bucks and perks like
sports cars and beautiful women, Petrovich has attracted players from
around the world, among them a pair of likable but reckless San
Francisco daredevils, Jon Cross (Chris Klein) and Marcus Ridley (LL
Cool J). No sooner has Jon become involved with teammate Aurora
(Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), a local girl with a penchant for lifting
weights topless, than he realizes that a bloody on-track accident was
in fact deliberately set up.</TE>
<TE>   Petrovich has made the crucial discovery that the more blood
that's spilled, the higher TV ratings spike. Petrovich therefore sees
his dream of an all-important North American cable deal within his
grasp. Meanwhile, outside the stadium, locals are rioting in the
streets, apparently protesting the demolition of a tract of
affordable housing, a sequence epitomizing the vague, disconnected
quality of the entire film.</TE>
<TE>   Jon turns out to be an all-American innocent who, in his stunning
naivete, goes with evidence of the on-track sabotage to the avuncular
Petrovich, who of course expresses dismay and assures him he will
investigate. Reflection is not Jon's long suit, so it never occurs to
him that Petrovich could have ordered the sabotage.</TE>
<TE>   After Aurora, who at least has the smarts to be aghast at Jon's
lack of perception, clues him in about Petrovich, the situation
worsens. There is more on-track sabotage and more poking about by
Jon, which naturally does not go unobserved by Petrovich. Ultimately
Jon and Marcus realize they have become virtual gladiators and must
escape the country if they are to save their lives.</TE>
<TE>   A film that worked on several levels could have emerged from the
basic plot had it been fully developed with sharply drawn characters.
The film's stars are well cast and make good impressions, but their
roles lack dimension.</TE>
<TE>   Reno is a wonderful actor with tremendous presence, but the
weighty combination of his thick French accent and trite dialogue
reduces him much of the time to no more than a standard melodrama
villain. "Rollerball" has smart high-tech production and costume
design, and roars along at a fortunately breakneck pace, accompanied
by a growling, hard-driving score.</TE>
<TE>   The film's major accomplishment, no small matter, is Steve Mason's
camera work, which places us smack in the midst of the on-track
action. A tip of the hat is also in order to stunt coordinator Jamie
Jones and his large and expert teams of stunt performers and skaters.</TE>
<TE>   It's too bad this "Rollerball" veered off-track so swiftly,
derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive
post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the
throes of their first full flush of testosterone.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for violence, extreme sports action, language
and some drug references. Times guidelines: Some fairly brutal
action; too intense for young audiences.</TE>

<HD>Device That Creates More Ad Time Even Troubles Advertisers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It's called a Time Machine, and the television industry only wishes
it was as benign as the device that sent Michael J. Fox back to the
future. Instead, the new box that can warp TV time is making many
people grumble, while others see only dollar signs.</LD>
<LD>   Invented by Bill Hendershot, an engineer from San Jose, the Time
Machine enables television stations to compress their programs to fit
in more commercials.</LD>
<LD>   It works by going through these programs frame by frame, and when
two identical frames appear side-by-side, one is removed. Usually,
this can be done enough in a 22-minute program (the actual length of
most sitcoms without commercials) to add 30 seconds of time.</LD>
<TE>   Viewers are none the wiser, said Hendershot, president of Prime
Image Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "It is so good that you can take the original artists and
directors who made the piece and they cannot tell the difference," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He's sold about 100 Time Machines to television stations across
the United States. They cost $93,000 each. If a station uses it two
or three times a day--Hendershot warns against overuse--the machine
would pay for itself through additional advertising revenue in two
months, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never, ever been a single unit returned, not for any
reason," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Time Machine's existence might have gone unnoticed by the
public if it hadn't been for a reporter who was covering a Pittsburgh
Steelers football game in October. He noticed that the game in front
of him on the field didn't match the game being broadcast on KDKA,
the CBS-owned television station.</TE>
<TE>   KDKA got in trouble with CBS network executives, because the
National Football League limits the number of commercials that can be
shown during its games.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the Time Machine has so troubled the American Assn.
of Advertising Agencies that it has started an investigation into how
widely it's being used.</TE>
<TE>   If stations can use the Time Machine to compress the programs,
they could shorten the commercials too, said Kathy Crawford,
executive vice president of the ad firm Initiative Media. Advertisers
that pay for a 30-second commercial had better be getting 30 seconds,
not 29, she said. Hendershot said stations don't use the machine to
cut commercials.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers are also concerned that the Time Machine adds to the
clutter on television. They're already worried about additional
commercial time added over the past decade by networks; the more
commercials there are, the smaller the chance that one will stand
out.</TE>
<TE>   "It may mean that there is going to be less use of television and
more use of other media" by advertisers, Crawford said. "What
television has done to itself suggests it is losing value."</TE>
<TE>   CBS has been quietly discouraging its stations from using the Time
Machine.</TE>
<TE>   The machine has other uses that have not been fully explored,
Hendershot says.</TE>
<TE>   For example, major advertisers have long sought to be able to run
a commercial simultaneously on all of a TV market's broadcast
outlets, so viewers would see the same thing if they tried to click
away from an ad. Advertisers have tried this before, but stations
have never been able to coordinate the time precisely to make the ads
effective.</TE>
<TE>   Use the Time Machine, and that would be no problem.  "This is a
commercial industry," Hendershot said. "The reason you get to see
free television in this country is because somebody is paying for
it."</TE>

<HD>Most Stations to Warn Fans, Then Give Results</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The start of the Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City this weekend
marks the kickoff of another game locally: the peekaboo match between
TV stations who want to report the results and viewers who are trying
to avoid them until they watch NBC's tape-delayed coverage in prime
time.</LD>
<LD>   Some local stations, including KNBC, which is owned and operated
by NBC, said they will report the results of daily competition during
their regular newscasts but will warn viewers who don't want the
suspense spoiled to turn away from their sets.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll have an audio and visual cue to warn our audience," said
KNBC news director Kim Godwin. "We'll make sure viewers will have a
chance to turn down the volume or turn away from the TV."</LD>
<TE>   KCBS and KABC will also warn viewers before reporting results
during their evening newscasts.</TE>
<TE>   But executives at KTLA (which is owned by Tribune Co., owner of
the Los Angeles Times) say they will not warn "News at 10" viewers
before giving results. KCAL news director Nancy Bauer Gonzales said
Thursday she had not yet determined a results strategy for her
prime-time news.</TE>

<HD>Those Who Lived It Recall the Oppressive Era of Jim Crow</HD>
<DH>Southerners tell their stories in one of two KPCC programs
that explore segregation in the years before civil rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Black and white--that's how many people view the segregated Jim Crow
era of American history, both in terms of race and the experiences
for those who lived through it, according to the producer of a pair
of upcoming radio documentaries examining the period.</LD>
<LD>   But those eight decades before the civil rights movement were not
just a time when blacks and whites had their places, and
laws--written and unwritten--kept them there. It was also a time that
nurtured the discontent and rebellion that flowered in the 1950s and
'60s. The stories from the years between Reconstruction and the civil
rights movement are far more varied and nuanced than many people
realize, according to Stephen Smith, producer of "Remembering Jim
Crow" and "Radio Fights Jim Crow," airing Feb. 18 on KPCC-FM (89.3)
at 7 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   "I was familiar with the conventional thinking of the Jim Crow
period, that it was a monolithically oppressive period," said Smith,
who has a master's degree in African American studies from the
University of Chicago. Upon embarking on this project, "one of the
things that stood out from the beginning was the complexity that
added to this simplistic vision."</LD>
<TE>   "Remembering Jim Crow" arose from a decade-long oral history
project at Duke University's Center for Documentary Studies. Graduate
students from around the country fanned out across the South with
tape recorders, interviewing aging people, both black and white,
about their memories of the Jim Crow era. As most of the subjects
were in their 60s, 70s and 80s, the researchers wanted to capture
those voices before they were gone. Smith built on those 1,200
interviews to create an hourlong program, produced by American Radio
Works, the documentary arm of Minnesota Public Radio and National
Public Radio News.</TE>
<TE>   Shows Surprise Younger Listeners</TE>
<TE>   For those whose perspective of the Jim Crow South comes from
Faulkner or "To Kill a Mockingbird," Smith said the program will add
complexity and sophistication to that view.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who are most often surprised are the people in their
teens or early 20s," he said, noting that youths "find these stories
sort of breathtaking" in their cruelty and in the realization that
such racism and segregation flourished so late in the century.</TE>
<TE>   "So many people view it as part of a bygone era, for which there's
no connection today," Smith said. But "a lot of the problems we face
today are rooted more in the Jim Crow period than in the slavery
period. This is really the period in which the relationship between
whites and blacks in an emancipated country was really defined."</TE>
<TE>   During this time, the South was ruled by a Byzantine code derived
from laws, courts and custom. It was a time of lynchings and other
atrocities, and one in which black parents advised their children how
to act to avoid confrontation: stepping off the sidewalk to allow
whites to pass, entering a store through the back door. It was a time
of continual stress, waiting for the next daily indignity or
injustice, when not adding a "sir" to your "thank you" would warrant
a slap across the face from an insulted pharmacist.</TE>
<TE>   As Ann Pointer, of Tuskegee, Ala., told her interviewer, "I want
to tell you how horrible it is when everything you do, the [white]
man's got to approve it."</TE>
<TE>   African American men--except teachers and pastors--were eyed
suspiciously if they wore a tie on any day except Sunday. Blacks were
not supposed to refer to other blacks as "Mr." or "Mrs." when talking
to whites, instead using their first names. Blacks were
disenfranchised from the political process by arcane voting tests, in
which illiterate voting registrars would disqualify African American
college professors for missing a period or not staying within the
lines. A store sold Coca-Cola to whites, giving blacks Pepsi even if
they asked for Coke.</TE>
<TE>   In Albany, Ga., a popular Sidney Poitier film filled the local
movie theater to overflowing, so the manager evicted several black
youths from the balcony--the "colored section"--so whites could sit
there when the floor seats ran out.</TE>
<TE>   And it was a time when white employers used generic forms of
address such as "Uncle" or "Auntie," "Jim" or "Susie," regardless of
a black employee's real name, out of condescension or disdain or
laziness.</TE>
<TE>   One interviewee, Olivia Cherry of Chesapeake, Va., said she was "a
spunky kid" who simply ignored bosses who wouldn't address her
correctly, such as a farmer whose raspberries she was picking.</TE>
<TE>   "I just kept on working. He said, 'Susie, don't you hear me
talking to you?' I said, 'I told you before, my name is Olivia.
Olivia. Can you say that?'"</TE>
<TE>   Such stories show that, even in the smallest of ways, African
Americans were rebelling against their oppression long before the
civil rights movement, said William H. Chafe, one of the directors of
Duke's oral history project, as well as the university's dean of arts
and sciences and vice provost for undergraduate education.</TE>
<TE>   "The radio show certainly shows the fire and the anger and the
horror of these experiences," Chafe said. "It brings home the
daily-ness of what this reality was. That needs to penetrate people's
historical sensibilities."</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, he added, the program may help people understand the
indignity and injustice of racial profiling, or illuminate the gulf
between the Muslim and Judeo-Christian worlds--one generally more
affluent and powerful than the other, and the other feeling resentful
or oppressed.</TE>
<TE>   A Way to Bring History to Life</TE>
<TE>   "Hearing the voices of the folks who actually lived the history
brings the history to life the way nothing else can. This makes this
really compelling radio," said Paul Glickman, KPCC news director, who
said the station aired the programs when they debuted last fall and
decided to re-run them for Black History Month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's crucial that these young people hear these stories before
they're gone," added Joseph E. Holloway, professor of pan-African
studies at Cal State Northridge. "Most of the young people now were
born after the civil rights movement. They don't have a clue."</TE>
<TE>   In 1960, as a teen driving with his family from Los Angeles to
visit relatives in Louisiana, Holloway saw a vivid image of the
period's savagery. They pulled into Waco, Texas, just as a mob was
burning a black man to death, then turned and chased them.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't know about the struggles, the sacrifices. They weren't
born at a time when segregation was here. They could not believe
these things could have happened at one time," Holloway said.
"There's a disconnect. They've got to see those who struggled before
them, and made it possible for them to come to integrated schools."</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasts Attempted to Heal Tensions</TE>
<TE>   The second hourlong program, "Radio Fights Jim Crow," focuses on
broadcast programs from the World War II era that tried to heal
racial and ethnic tensions of the time and counteract the "Amos 'n'
Andy" stereotypes common in the media.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fascinating example of how the civil rights movement
started long before the 1950s," producer Smith said, when activists
realized they needed to get their message out via the mass
media--first radio, and later television.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government supported the programs because officials
knew the war effort required that blacks and whites work in harmony
at defense plants, he said. They also wanted to counteract Axis
propaganda about racial inequality, which they feared would turn
minorities into a fifth column of enemy sympathizers.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the shows were "basically explaining to white Americans
that African Americans are not just human, but they are Americans.
They were conveying a message that was critical, that blacks were the
moral and intellectual equals of whites."</TE>
<TE>   "People say, 'It's so far behind us, what's the point?'" Chafe
said. "It's not so far behind us, and that's the point."</TE>

<HD>Ronnie Laws' Ensemble Fuses Acoustic and Electric Sounds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The group Ronnie Laws is fronting at the Jazz Bakery this week is
billed as his acoustic quartet. In his opening set Wednesday night,
he announced that the audience could expect to experience a "warm,
pleasant acoustic evening."</LD>
<LD>   But both the billing and the announcement were somewhat off
target. The "quartet" was actually a "quintet," with pianist Vernell
Brown, Jr., bassist Larry Antonino, drummer William Bryant and vibist
Onaje Murray. And anyone walking into the venue in the middle of the
opening number had good reason to wonder how the torrent of sound
pouring through the room could ever possibly be described as
"acoustic."</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the set was only intermittently acoustic, with Antonino's
alternate use of electric and stand-up basses the deciding factor.</LD>
<TE>   And, of course, even acoustic music can be cranked up to
ear-piercing levels via amplification, as it was for a portion of
Laws' performance.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, there were more moderate moments, as well. The
juxtaposition of those moments with the more aggressively dynamic
passages was essentially what the evening was all about. Hard-edged
tunes such as "You Knew" from Laws' "Dream a Little" CD alternated
with straight-ahead jazz such as Thelonious Monk's "Well You Needn't"
and Wayne Shorter's "Footprints."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the contrasts in material, Laws soloed in similar fashion
throughout, on tenor and soprano saxophones. His style reflected a
Coleman Hawkins approach to melody, filling his lines with vividly
fluid ornamentation, occasionally tossing in gushing cascades of
McCoy Tyner-like arpeggios. At times, his choruses came across as too
note-heavy, in direct contrast to the engaging blends of rhythm and
melody he has displayed in the past. When his musical focus was more
direct and to the point--as in his soprano saxophone work on "Well
You Needn't"--Laws' unquestioned skills were more felicitously
displayed.</TE>
<TE>   His supporting musicians--especially Brown's adventurous piano
excursions and Murray's gentle efforts on the vibes--added attractive
musical coloration to a program that, despite its billing, managed to
bring acoustic and electric jazz together in surprisingly friendly
fashion.</TE>
<TE>   *The Ronnie Laws Acoustic Quintet at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms
Ave. Tonight and Saturday at 8 and 9:30 p.m., $25. Sunday at 8 and
9:30 p.m., $22. (310) 271-9039.</TE>

<LD>You'll get the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and chorales of emotion in
the TV booth, when the U.S. flag found in the rubble and ash of
ground zero is hoisted for the cameras, as it was for the World
Series and Super Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Very nice.</LD>
<LD>   With the NBC-televised Winter Olympics beginning in Salt Lake City
tonight, though, here's another thought for the opening ceremony.
Strap former Enron Corp. Chairman Ken Lay to a luge and send him on
his way.</LD>
<TE>   Better yet, have him be the luge.</TE>
<TE>   That would give the Winter Games a spritz of reality beyond
tonight's scheduled performances by LeAnn Rimes, the Dixie Chicks,
Yo-Yo Ma and other musical stars, an element that NBC's
high-adrenalin sports mongers could really embrace.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of the luge--which we're told every four years is
something we adore--no backslider on this side of the Atlantic has
won a medal since the sport was introduced as an Olympic event in
1964.  When the two-day men's singles event begins Sunday, Germany's
Georg Hackl will be trying to become the only competitor to win four
consecutive Olympic luge titles.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you bet against him?" American luger Tony Benshoof has
been quoted as saying. "Hackl has the unique ability to rise to any
occasion."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, rising for any reason, while traveling near 90 mph on
your back, can be hazardous. Not that it would make any difference.</TE>
<TE>   Benshoof will beat the favored Hackl and earn the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   That's because God, whose favorite colors we all know are red,
white and blue, has been deluged with post-Sept. 11 pleas to bless
America. This message is being sent via mass-produced "God Bless
America" signs and banners that have surfaced among the multitudes.</TE>
<TE>   As if God had to be asked. As if we weren't always God's
favorites. As if God, at this very moment, weren't chanting, "USA,
USA, USA"</TE>
<TE>   Among the beneficiaries of this God-inclusive patriotism are
America's Olympic athletes, who would naturally be covered by any
blanket blessing from above, because God is surely as much a sports
fanatic as the Old Glories from NBC who will be covering these Winter
Games with their famous jingoistic zeal.</TE>
<TE>   And as bullish about America too, from the mountains, to the
prairies, to the ocean white with foam.</TE>
<TE>   If everyone gets blessed, the result is a tie. Which means, of
course, that God will play favorites in Salt Lake City by blessing
America but not the athletes of the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada,
Switzerland, Austria or any other nation, including Germany.</TE>
<TE>   So, so long Hackl.</TE>
<TE>   Unless, of course, God has found the luge as inexplicable and
uninteresting as we who would rather watch even curling than people
in bodysuits zoom down a track on their backs while NBC's hysterical
announcers inform viewers how exciting it is.</TE>
<TE>   In which case, God would have the option of excluding America's
lugers from the blessing and granting a divine glow exclusively to
our deserving figure skaters, Alpine skiers, ice dancers and
whomever.</TE>
<TE>   Now you may be thinking that God, who has had an emotional week in
athletics after blessing the New England Patriots in that squeaker of
a Super Bowl just last Sunday, may be taking the 2002 Winter Olympics
off, leaving the United States in the lurch. If true, bummer. Yet
even so, U.S. athletes would still be getting help from high places.</TE>
<TE>   Even if God doesn't bless Team USA in Salt Lake City, be assured
that NBC and its stations will.</TE>
<TE>   As they have U.S. athletes when previously telecasting Olympics
(and as ABC did before them), all but digitally erasing teams from
other nations, as if they did not exist.</TE>
<TE>   You'll see some of this 2002 crowd during tonight's opening
ceremony, but afterward even the best of the foreign athletes mostly
will vanish faster than you can say Yo-Yo, unless they earn their way
back on NBC by doing something spectacular.</TE>
<TE>   Like applying for U.S. citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Although some call it xenophobic, other countries, including our
good friends the Brits, also bask in their own Olympians, as their
own chauvinistic TV and newspaper coverage affirms.</TE>
<TE>   This is shrewd policy for NBC, moreover. No sense stirring up the
natives. Should the network and its stations begin dwelling on
athletes from other nations, viewers would become confused and wonder
why some of these with odd-sounding names such as Finland (Is that
near Fiji?) never get air time on newscasts. What's going on here? Do
these other lands hibernate between Olympics?</TE>
<TE>   I mean, China we've heard of, because of chow mein and everything,
and Afghanistan and Pakistan too, in the aftermath of Sept. 11. But
who knew there were creatures on Earth called Latvians? Or that there
was such a place as Slovakia? I mean, if it were worth a peek,
wouldn't it be in Vegas with Wayne Newton and the Eiffel Tower?</TE>
<TE>   In other words, as TV coverage of all Olympic venues becomes
increasingly myopic and isolationist--even as Americans are warned of
terrorist dangers lurking everywhere globally--God bless ignorance.</TE>

<HD>'Shiri' Captures Political Intrigue's Toll</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kang Je-Gyu's "Shiri" is a superior political thriller in which
jolting action strikes a balance with serious reflection and genuine
emotion. A blockbuster hit in South Korea, the release of "Shiri" in
the U.S. now is even more timely and universal in the wake of Sept.
11 than upon its initial release in late 1999. It has all the
ingredients for an international success, but as good as the English
subtitles are, there needs to be more of them to make the film as
fully accessible as intended. This, however, should not deter fans of
Asian cinema used to trusting that convoluted plots will become clear
in the final reel.</LD>
<LD>   "Shiri" takes its title from a freshwater fish that can survive
only in the clearest seas and, during spawning season, swims upstream
against the swiftest currents. It is therefore symbolic of the Korean
longing for reunification and the uphill struggle to see it come to
pass. This dynamic, visually stunning film is set against a 1998
soccer match between North and South Korea that takes place in a
Seoul stadium in the presence of the presidents of both Koreas.
Inevitably, "Shiri," in setting and plot, recalls Larry Peerce's "Two
Minute Warning" (1976) and John Frankenheimer's "Black Sunday"
(1977).</LD>
<TE>   As this event--so crucial in the tense relations between the two
nations--approaches, South Korea's intelligence agency is confronted
with disturbing evidence that the elusive Hee, a ruthless and daring
North Korean female terrorist, has renewed her activities after a
long dormant period. Ryu (Han Suk-Gyu) and his younger partner, Lee
(Song Kang-Ho), are assigned to track her down. It quickly becomes
clear that Hee is not acting alone, and a cohort, Park (Choi
Min-Sik), soon manages to hijack a gallon of CTX--a new and ferocious
liquid weapon almost indistinguishable from water--that could easily
wipe out the city of Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Amid mounting tension and suspense "Shiri" manages to raise a
plethora of questions and implications. Why would anyone want to
thwart the first steps toward rapprochement between South Korea and
North Korea since the war ended in 1953? How is it that Hee and her
associates seem always to be a few steps ahead of Ryu and Lee?
Digging deeper, "Shiri" deals with conflicts between the political
and the personal--between love and duty--while evoking an atmosphere
of fear much like America has experienced since the Sept. 11
terrorists attacks.</TE>
<TE>   On the personal level, Lee has broken up with his girlfriend,
while Ryu has fallen in love with Hyun (Kim Yun-Jin), a recovering
alcoholic. Hyun sells tropical fish from her elegant, aquarium-filled
shop, which is connected to an apartment she shares with Ryu. They
are deeply in love, but it's impossible not to wonder how the
appealing and clearly vulnerable Hyun will hold up married to a
secret agent, especially when of necessity she will be kept in the
dark about his demanding and dangerous assignments.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, South Korean cinema has fully flowered, producing
both uncompromising highly personal films and crisp, intelligent
genre movies, with "Shiri" the most spectacular example of the latter
to date. Clearly, South Korea is poised to fill the void left by the
largely dormant Hong Kong film industry; it is hoped that American
distributors will take note.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong violence and some language. Times
guidelines: The film's violence is standard for the action-thriller
genre.</TE>

<HD>Next Stop: Honoring Rod Serling</HD>
<DH>Celebration*  Museum of Television &amp; Radio offers eerie
adventure from the man behind 'The Twilight Zone' and 'Night
Gallery.'</DH>

<LD>You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of
sight and sound but of mind; a journey into a wondrous land whose
boundaries are that of imagination. Next stop: "Rod Serling: The
Twilight Zone and Beyond," a two-month celebration of the
award-winning writer's television work, which kicks off today at the
Museum of Television &amp; Radio in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Although Serling is best known as the creator and host of the
classic 1959-'64 CBS sci-fi anthology series, "The Twilight Zone," he
was also one of the most prolific writers during the era of live
television drama of the '50s. In fact, beginning in 1955, Serling was
awarded three consecutive best teleplay Emmys for "Patterns,"
"Requiem for a Heavyweight" and "The Comedian." All three will be
screened as part of the tribute.</LD>
<LD>   Other dramas featured in the festival include the autobiographical
1959 "Playhouse 90: The Velvet Alley," starring Art Carney; "A Long
Time Til Dawn" (1953), a "Kraft Television Theatre," starring James
Dean; and "Knife in the Dark" (1954), directed by his frequent
collaborator John Frankenheimer, featuring a young Paul Newman.</LD>
<TE>   Also on display will be "A Town Has Turned to Dust" (1958), a
"Playhouse 90" that ran afoul of the censors. Originally an
examination about the lynching of African American teenager Emmett
Till, the script was changed to be a western allegory about a Latino
boy. "By the time the censors had gotten to it, my script had turned
to dust," Serling, who died in 1975, said of the experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the one thing that set Rod apart was his sense of irony
and macabre," said William Shat- ner, who appeared in two episodes of
"The Twilight Zone": cult favorite "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet" and "A
Town Has Turned to Dust."</TE>
<TE>   Carol Serling, who was married to the writer from 1948 until his
untimely death at age 50, maintains her husband would be shocked by
the longevity of his projects. "He would be absolutely amazed,
especially with 'Twilight Zone.' It's never been off the air."</TE>
<TE>   Martin Landau, who starred in two episodes of "Twilight
Zone"--including the first one, "Mr. Denton on Doomsday"--recalled a
change in Serling when returned to do another installment in 1964. "I
think he was getting a little more pressure from people, where he had
it easier prior to that."</TE>
<TE>   Though the festival opens with a weekend marathon of "Twilight
Zone" episodes, curator Allen Glover said the tribute's goal is to
shift the focus from the series and follow Serling's career as a
writer.</TE>
<TE>   One of Serling's most controversial TV movies, "Doomsday Flight,"
from 1966, is featured in the festival. The thriller deals with a
bomb hidden on a passenger plane that will detonate if the plane dips
below 4,000 feet. "Copycat crimes happened almost immediately,"
Glover said. "In fact, the first [threat] was phoned in ... while the
show was on the air that night. It was taken out of circulation."</TE>
<TE>   The tribute also will screen four episodes of his 1965 CBS western
series "The Loner," starring Lloyd Bridges, about a Union veteran in
search of himself.</TE>
<TE>   A critic of the Vietnam War, Serling was able to express his views
in the guise of science fiction on "The Twilight Zone."</TE>
<TE>   "Rod never felt he was a master of science fiction," said Carol
Serling. "There were so many others who had been writing science
fiction for years and still are, but Rod thought it was the right
time and a good vehicle. That was the beauty of it. Through
anthologies, he could confront these issues, and the sponsor really
never understood him. I think that is part of the reason it is still
on, because it's still timely. These issues have never really gone
away."</TE>
<TE>   After his anthology series, "Night Gallery," was canceled in 1973,
Serling taught at Antioch College and lectured on college campuses.
Though some documentaries and books have stated that he turned his
back on writing for television, Carol Serling said that wasn't the
case but acknowledged that her husband became somewhat discouraged
with TV.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the 'Twilight Zone' years ... were very heady for him,"
she said. "He did have complete creative control, which he did not
have on 'Night Gallery.' He was a writer and the narrator, but
someone else was really in charge, which was also true of the other
work that he did after 'Twilight Zone.' And he wasn't an angry young
man anymore. He was getting older. But he still cared about
television. He was still typing away."</TE>
<TE>   "Rod Serling: The Twilight Zone and Beyond" begins today and
continues through April 21 at the Museum of Television &amp; Radio, 465
N. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills. Screenings are Wednesdays to Sundays
at 3 p.m. and Thursdays at 7 p.m. The Twilight Zone Marathon Weekend,
today through Sunday, will screen from 12:15 to 5 p.m. each day.
Admission is free. Information: (310) 786-1000 or www.mtr.org.</TE>

<CX>   Rod Serling--A story in Friday's Calendar section about a tribute
to Rod Serling at the Museum of Television &amp; Radio correctly identified
on first reference his "A Town Has Turned to Dust" as an episode of
"Playhouse 90" but on second reference mistakenly indicated that it was
an episode of "The Twilight Zone." In addition, the story incorrectly
suggested that "Mr. Denton on Doomsday" was the first episode of "The
Twilight Zone" to be broadcast. It was the third.</CX>

<HD>Gestures of Love in 'We Laughed'</HD>
<DH>With more emotion than narrative, director Gianni Amelio
follows a man's sacrifices for his brother in a tumultuous Italy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To watch Gianni Amelio's luminous "The Way We Laughed" is to
reconnect with Italian cinema in all its richness of emotion and
command of expressive gesture.</LD>
<LD>   In such widely acclaimed films as "Stolen Children" (1992) and
"Lamerica" (1994), Amelio revealed that he was a superb artist who
harkened back to the openhearted, socially conscious yet exquisitely
subtle neo-Realist tradition of Vittorio De Sica, but here his style
is elliptical as never before.</LD>
<LD>   He deliberately leaves out sizable chunks of narrative, which
emphasizes what is important to him while inviting us to fill in the
blanks with our own conjectures. The ultimate effect is of a
cumulative, heightened impact from a filmmaker who already was master
at telling a wrenching tale.</LD>
<TE>   Amelio, his superb cinematographer Luca Bigazzi and evocative
composer Franco Piersanti plunge us into a world in which darkness is
as richly textured as light.</TE>
<TE>   In the darkness the radiant face of Enrico Lo Verso comes into
view. It is a face familiar to those who've seen "Stolen Children,"
in which he played a military man charged with transporting two small
children to a distant orphanage only to develop a paternal love for
them. In "Lamerica," he was a ruthless capitalist eager to exploit
the fall of communism in Albania.</TE>
<TE>   He's a little too gaunt to be truly handsome, which is a plus, for
this makes it easier to identify with him as an ordinary guy who gets
caught up in extraordinary circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "The Way We Laughed" unfolds in six sequences set between 1958 and
1964, a time of profound change as Italy was shifting, often
painfully, from a society with a large agrarian population to one
with an urban, industrialized base.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Verso's Giovanni is a Sicilian peasant who has come to Turin to
ensure that his younger brother Pietro (Francesco Giuffrida, an actor
equal to the formidable Lo Verso), a student, gets the education that
the illiterate Giovanni considers all-important in these changing
times.</TE>
<TE>   Giovanni, 12 years older than Pietro, has a paternal love that
borders on obsessive.</TE>
<TE>   No sacrifice is too great, no work too lowly; what Giovanni can't
see is that Pietro, while bright, is indolent. Even when Giovanni
realizes how poor a student Pietro has been, he is willing to help
him at any cost.</TE>
<TE>   Pietro is not, however, unmoved by his older brother's
self-sacrificing love, but it threatens to suffocate him.</TE>
<TE>   When Pietro disappears from Giovanni's life for awhile, we see
Giovanni's survival skills. He all but unconsciously develops
leadership and organizing skills that serve him well through various
political upheavals. He has the stuff to succeed in a burgeoning
economy and to develop the confidence to learn to read and write,
while Pietro's destiny remains a question mark.</TE>
<TE>   All the while Amelio is unobtrusively building "The Way We
Laughed" toward a conclusion that evokes themes of corruption and
redemption. The film's impact is shocking and charged with the
full-bodied emotion seemingly so intrinsic to the Italian nature.
This sweeping, confounding conclusion therefore unfolds with a beauty
and an ease that seem truly organic. "The Way We Laughed" has that
feeling of being a work of art.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: The film has complex adult themes, some
language and violence.</TE>

<HD>A Moving but Simplistic Take on the Perils of Globalization</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stephanie Black's "Life and Debt," a documentary investigation into
how Jamaica came to be second only to South Africa in the having the
worst internal distribution of wealth of any country, goes a long way
toward explaining why meetings of the World Bank draw such stormy
protest.</LD>
<LD>   Black shows how the Draconian lending terms of the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund have steadily destroyed whatever
infrastructure Jamaica managed to establish in the wake of its
independence from the United Kingdom in 1962. Now $7 billion in debt,
Jamaica has seen its agricultural industries laid to waste by the
impossibility of competing with imported fruit, vegetables, meat and
poultry.</LD>
<LD>   One after another, a dairy farmer, a vegetable grower, a banana
planter and on down the line eloquently attest to how their incomes
have evaporated. Then there's the phenomenon of the free market zone
in Kingston, where free means that Jamaican seamstresses can turn out
clothing for the American market for a pittance while their employers
are free from local taxes.</LD>
<TE>   Black contrasts the hard lot of the Jamaicans with the luxurious
tropical fantasy paradise experienced by tourists who arrive in posh
Montego Bay and never see the grim shantytown realities of Kingston.
The contrast is, of course, razor sharp and important to make, but
Black seriously overdoes it when she underlines the tourist sequences
with narration drawn from Jamaica Kincaid's 1987 "A Small Place,"
which bitterly reiterates what the tourist will never see. The use of
Kincaid's text in this context has the effect of holding up to
ridicule, intentionally or otherwise, one of the few economic
resources the island nation has. Would Black, for all her contempt
for tourists, who inevitably are easy targets for satire, really want
them to stop coming?</TE>
<TE>   Black could also have brought more clarity to her project. A
number of the technicalities that would be immediately grasped by
experts on world economy could have been made more easily
comprehensible for the layman--the occasional diagram could have
shown how the various unjust systems function and interconnect. Even
so, the damning commentary and revelations about the perils of
globalization, not just for Jamaica but developing countries the
world over, do come across loud and clear.</TE>

<HD>A Korean Detente</HD>
<DH>For Kang Je-Gyu and his nation's film industry, 'Shiri's'
bold look at the north-south divide has been a box office and
artistic breakthrough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON MATSUMOTO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the height of the Cold War between North and South Korea,
South Korean filmmakers risked imprisonment if they dared to cast
their Communist neighbors in a sympathetic light. So it's not
surprising that 39-year-old South Korean writer-director Kang Je-Gyu
expressed gratitude at having come of age as a filmmaker during a
much more tolerant era in his country's politics.</LD>
<LD>   "There was one South Korean filmmaker who went to jail in the
1960s for positively depicting North Korean people," Kang recalled
through an interpreter last week during a visit to Los Angeles. "But
after the Seoul Olympics in 1988, the government became more open to
a democratic system and free expression. So I didn't feel any
pressure [to toe a certain political line] when I started making
movies [in the 1990s]."</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, Kang's 1999 film, "Shiri," which opens in Los Angeles
today, is a landmark work because it's a popular film that actually
portrays North Koreans in a humanistic manner. The high-octane action
thriller/romantic drama was a blockbuster in its native country and
broke the box office record in South Korea previously held by
"Titanic." (It's a record that has since been surpassed.) About one
out of seven South Koreans viewed "Shiri" in 1999. It was even
embraced by the South Korean government, which arranged a free
screening of the movie for all foreign diplomats stationed in the
country.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the first Korean movie to get any significant
distribution in the United States," observes David E. James, who
teaches East Asian film at the USC School of Cinema-Television and
who recently was host of several festivals of Korean films at USC.
"Other films, like Im Kwon Taek's 'Chunhyang' [which briefly screened
in the U.S. in 2000-01], have played for a week here and there, but
never with any kind of commercial distribution on this scale."
"Shiri," which has already been released in Europe and Asia, is now
playing in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and
Washington,D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "Shiri" is about a renegade group of North Korean commandos
infiltrating South Korea in order to steal newly developed and highly
potent liquid explosives. The aim is to use these bombs to terrorize
the South and instigate another war between the two countries. The
group's hope is that an armed conflict will lead to reunification in
the divided Korean peninsula. Two crack South Korean
counterintelligence agents attempt to hunt down these zealots, who
are willing to die for their cause and whose ranks includes an elite
assassin who happens to be a beautiful woman.</TE>
<TE>   The North Korean commandos are clearly wearing the black hats in
the film. But Kang also sympathetically expresses the desperation and
righteousness that drive these militants, whose overarching goal is
to ease the suffering and starvation back in their home country. When
the film was being conceived, serious food shortages were occurring
in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a chance to talk to some North Korean students when I was
making my first film, [1996's] 'The Gingko Bed,'" Kang says. "Most
South Korean people don't have much of a chance to talk to North
Koreans. So I had my own prejudices against them as well. But after
talking with these students, I realized that even though we are
living in two different political systems, we're the same human
beings."</TE>
<TE>   But politically, North Korea remains a pariah, at least to
President Bush, who in recent speeches has referred to that country
as part of what he calls "the axis of evil" and a terrorist state.</TE>
<TE>   Meaningful Issues Cloaked in Action-Thriller</TE>
<TE>   These discussions prompted Kang to explore making a movie about
the division between the two Koreas and the idea of reunification.
But after surveying numerous South Koreans, he realized that there
was limited interest in a film with this type of overt political
orientation.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of abandoning the project, Kang wrote a script that he
thought was commercial as well as socially meaningful. It's not hard
to understand why "Shiri" appealed to so many South Koreans. The film
has plenty of galvanic action sequences to satisfy testosterone-laden
guys, a number of surprising twists and turns, and a heart-tugging
love story to satisfy most romantics.</TE>
<TE>   Kang is also happy that "Shiri" has brought a greater awareness of
the humanity and plight of North Koreans to his fellow countrymen.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of Kang's fantasy-drama "The Gingko Bed" helped to
persuade South Korean conglomerate Samsung to support "Shiri"
financially. Although it only cost $5 million to make--a relatively
small sum compared with the budgets of most commercial movies made in
the West--"Shiri" was the most expensive Korean film and one of its
most ambitious.</TE>
<TE>   Kang admits that trying to make a Hollywood-style action-drama
with $5 million required careful budgeting. "I had to be really
organized in spending money for the film," he says. "For example, I
had to check the number of extras we had and see if it was within our
budget. Even [for] some of the shooting scenes, I would think that we
can only use two bullets for a particular scene and no more than
that."</TE>
<TE>   Korean Films Grow More Popular at Home</TE>
<TE>   "Shiri" had a revolutionary effect on the South Korean film
industry. Before the film's release, American-made movies accounted
for about 60% of the box-office receipts in South Korea. Korean
movies pulled in about 20% of the audience and non-American foreign
films accounted for the remaining 20%. Now South Korean films account
for more than 48% of the movie-theater business in his home country
while the audience share for American-made movies has shrunk to about
35%.</TE>
<TE>   After "Shiri's" popular success at home and in other parts of Asia
(it was also a No. 1 box-office hit in Japan and Hong Kong), more
entrepreneurs began to view South Korean films as attractive business
ventures, Kang says.</TE>
<TE>   "'Shiri' was a real turning point because it showed the potential
to the Korean film industry that Korean movie-makers could make
Hollywood-type movies," Kang says. "The movie's success in Japan and
Hong Kong also made people think that Korean movies could [be
successful] in foreign [markets]. Before, people thought that Korean
movies were just for Korean people."</TE>
<TE>   With the relaxation of government censorship, South Korean cinema
has flourished in recent years with first-rate mainstream genre
movies, such as Kang Woo-Suk's gritty and exciting "Two Cops," and
intensely personal films exemplified by the work of the veteran Im
Kwon Taek, whose most recent film was the exquisite period fable
"Chunhyang." Along with Iran and Taiwan, Korea is now considered to
be on the cutting edge of world cinema.</TE>
<TE>   Since "Shiri" set box office records in its homeland, it has been
surpassed by another South Korean film. Currently, the record holder
for the country's highest-grossing film is a male-bonding movie
called "Friend." South Korea's new generation of filmmakers is
starting to explore other themes such as homosexuality that were once
deemed too sensitive for Korean audiences.</TE>
<TE>   The Korean film industry is watching with significant interest to
see how American audiences respond to "Shiri," Kang says. But the
film would appear to be an underdog in the United States. The project
lacks names recognizable in the U.S., although Han Suk-Gyu (who plays
counterintelligence agent Ryu) is one of South Korea's most popular
actors. Plus, it's a foreign-language movie that in spirit is more of
a commercial rather than an art-house film.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have that many expectations that it's going to be a No. 1
hit at the box office in America because Korean films haven't really
been introduced here before," says Kang, who operates his own film
production company. "We hope to provide a positive image to American
viewers about what Korean movies are like. Hopefully, it will be a
steppingstone for other Korean films and more will be introduced here
in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Kang is writing a script for a "Shiri" sequel, which he says will
be set in Russia and elsewhere in Europe. However, he is enlisting
someone else to direct in an attempt to bring freshness to the
sequel. He is also planning to write and direct three other films: a
movie about the Korean War, a science-fiction project and a
fantasy-love story involving Genghis Khan and his relationship with a
Korean woman.</TE>

<LD>   Artisan, FX Collaborate on Enron Project</LD>
<LD>   If a major scandal is in the news, can a TV movie be far behind?
The FX cable channel and Artisan Television are developing one, with
the help of Lowell Bergman, the award-winning journalist whose "60
Minutes" expose of the tobacco industry was chronicled in the 1999
film "The Insider."</LD>
<TE>   The project had its genesis a month ago when Artisan Pictures CEO
Bob Cooper met with Bergman, a longtime friend and collaborator who
had recently produced a "Frontline" documentary on Enron and the
energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper approached FX, with whom Artisan has a TV deal. Their last
outing resulted in last month's civil rights drama "Sins of Our
Fathers."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper will executive produce the project, which he hopes will
start shooting within a year. In his mind, it has the same power as
such TV movies as "Barbarians at the Gate" and "And the Band Played
On," both of which he oversaw when he was president of HBO Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "The major challenge is cutting through the messiness and clutter
of real life--finding a way to tell a story that's accessible,
compelling and true, " he told The Times on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "An interesting prototype is 'All the President's Men,' which
dramatized the machinations and cover-up of a government. As we move
from layer to layer, people will see that things aren't what they
appear. Viewers are jaded and want to be surprised."</TE>

<TE>   MSNBC Apologizes for Slur in Graphic</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC has apologized for an error in an on-screen graphic that
turned the name of an interview subject into a racial slur. In an
Enron case segment that was broadcast Monday, Republican consultant
Niger Innis, an African American, had an extra g added to his first
name.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after it appeared, correspondent Gregg Jarrett offered
Innis a "profuse apology."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, God, I thought you guys thought I was a rapper or something,"
Innis replied. "Media bias continues. Just kidding. It's not the
first time it's happened, but hopefully it's the last."</TE>
<TE>   It was strictly a typographical mistake, network spokesman Mark
O'Connor said Thursday. He wouldn't say whether any disciplinary
action was taken against the person who made the blunder.</TE>

<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Rockwell Show Tops the 2001 Museum Pack</TE>
<TE>   The most popular art museum exhibition in Southern California last
year was the touring Norman Rockwell retrospective at the San Diego
Museum of Art, according to a worldwide survey of exhibition
attendance figures in 2001 released by the Art Newspaper in London.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockwell show, No. 25 on a list of 650 exhibitions, averaged
2,910 daily visitors. The world's most popular show was "Vermeer and
the School of Delft" at New York's Metropolitan Museum (8,033 daily),
one of only two exhibitions to garner more than 5,000 daily visitors
(the other was the Met's show of Jackie Kennedy memorabilia).</TE>
<TE>   In L.A., an Old Master drawing show at the Getty Museum, "Raphael
and His Circle," was the most well-attended at No. 34 (2,648 daily).
Like the Rockwell show, the Raphael exhibition opened in 2000 but ran
briefly into the following year. "Winslow Homer and the Critics"
topped LACMA's roster, at No. 98 (1,449 daily), while MOCA's biggest
draw was last summer's David Hockney photography retrospective at No.
157 (1,073 daily).</TE>
<TE>   Least popular: "Queen of Sheba" at the Palazzo Bricherasio, Turin,
Italy (103 daily).</TE>
<TE>   The survey rates shows by average daily attendance, rather than
final tallies, because shows run for different lengths of time.</TE>

<TE>   MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Adams to Compose 9/11 Commemoration</TE>
<TE>   When the New York Philharmonic recently announced its 2002-03
season, the first under its new music director, Lorin Maazel, it also
announced a special program: "September 11, 2001--In Memoriam." The
concert would consist of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and a newly
commissioned work to commemorate the World Trade Center attacks.</TE>
<TE>   What the orchestra didn't say was who would compose the piece. The
Times has learned that the commission has gone to John Adams, for a
substantial work for chorus and orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   The world premiere is scheduled for Sept. 19 at Lincoln Center's
Avery Fisher Hall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   Weber to Join Cast of 'The Producers'</TE>
<TE>   Steven Weber, best known as one of the stars of the 1990-97 TV
series "Wings," has been chosen to replace Matthew Broderick as the
hapless Leo Bloom, the timid accountant-turned-felonious producer, in
the Broadway hit "The Producers." He will join Henry Goodman, who
replaces Nathan Lane as Max Bialystock, beginning March 19 at the St.
James Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Weber, who has a recurring role on the ABC series "Once and
Again," is no stranger to the stage. The actor made his Broadway
debut in the 1980s in Mike Nichols' production of "The Real Thing"
and last year starred in a concert version of the 1960s iconic
musical, "Hair," at L.A.'s Wadsworth Theatre.</TE>

<HD>Santiago Creates Visceral Works With Own Blood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The work of Paula Santiago has an uneasy beauty. It's intimate beyond
the level of comfort--viscerally intimate. For the last few years,
she has been making images and objects using her own blood and hair.
Her previous show at Iturralde Gallery featured tiny, tragic garments
fashioned of blood-soaked rice paper, trimmed and embroidered with
hair. In her current show, she continues to draw upon her own body
for source material, though in different ways, some more sober and
medically-oriented, some more abstract.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after her 1999 show here, Santiago, who lives in
Guadalajara, was diagnosed with melanoma. Blood, already a potent
element in her work, takes on new meaning now, not just as a carrier
of life, but also of danger, disease. Microscopic photographs of her
tumor cells line the walls of one room in the gallery, whose
centerpiece is a glass-enclosed reliquary containing the artist's own
lab samples, bloodied dabs embedded in wax.</LD>
<LD>   A lovely series of drawings based on the shape of the cells takes
a refreshing step back from scientific scrutiny toward more aesthetic
interpretation. Using beeswax on paper, blood and charcoal on silk,
Santiago literally visualizes her own internal structure, her
biomorphic doodles corresponding profoundly to a personal, lived
condition.</LD>
<TE>   Santiago's cellular drawings are uncharacteristically subdued,
inward-looking without fetishizing the visceral. Elsewhere, the
intensely autobiographical strain in her work can verge on the
self-indulgent, as in a group of shadowboxes here. A series of
relic-like sculptures is more engaging, though also somewhat
overwrought. Made of wax on rice paper, augmented by blood, crystal,
silk, seeds, stone and cinnamon, they read as bone or cartilage,
fragments excerpted from bodies human, animal or perhaps vegetable.
Santiago coaxes a marvelous range of textures from the wax; its
translucence, sometimes tinted with blood, suggests something like
bodily memory, a retention of prior action and form.</TE>
<TE>   Iturralde Gallery, 116 S. La Brea Ave., L.A., (323) 937-4267,
through Feb. 23. Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>

<TE>   Exquisite Portraits</TE>
<TE>   on 20-Franc Notes</TE>
<TE>   Peggy Preheim's stunning show at Works on Paper, Inc. is a
whispered elegy, a tender, exacting tribute to things past. For each
of the dozen pieces on view, Preheim has taken a 20-franc note as her
drawing surface. Most of the bill she leaves untouched: the elegant
script, the repeated serial number, the muted color portrait of
Claude Debussy before a tempestuous sea. Along the left side of the
note, sandwiched between the words "Banque de France" above and
"Vingt Francs" below, is a watermark, atop which Preheim has drawn an
exquisitely precise portrait.</TE>
<TE>   The first shows a full-cheeked infant, pushing up on meaty little
arms. The next is a toddler with sandy, tousled hair and a bright,
direct gaze. The sequencing suggests that we are witnessing a life's
progression, for the child evolves in the course of the drawings into
an adolescent with bobbed hair, a string of pearls and a slightly
sardonic smile, and onward into young womanhood, growing ever more
mature and refined. It becomes clear through styles of dress and hair
that these are not contemporary subjects, but faces from an earlier
era.</TE>
<TE>   Preheim, who lives in Paris, drew these faces based on old
photographs she scavenged from flea markets. She's kept the feel of
the formal, black-and-white portraits in her pencil renderings, so
delicate and convincing that the gallery makes a magnifying glass
available for closer scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Poignant enough in themselves, these youthful faces from the
remote past become doubly charged when paired with the franc notes,
crisp bills no longer in circulation because of the recent
introduction of the euro. Both the faces and the bills are fresh, yet
obsolete. Preheim has fused their fates as objects of nostalgia.
Relics of material culture personalized with ghosts of the deceased,
these drawings are powerful odes to a kind of currency beyond
exchange rates and chronology--a currency of the soul, the hand and
individual memory.</TE>
<TE>   Works on Paper, Inc., 6150 Wilshire Blvd., (323) 964-9675, through
Feb 23. Closed Sunday through Tuesday.</TE>

<TE>   Memorable Images</TE>
<TE>   of Emerging Japan</TE>
<TE>   Shigeichi Nagano chronicled Japan during the postwar years the way
Robert Frank captured his adopted United States in the 1950s--with an
acute balance of tenderness and criticality, born of an intense
concern for the condition of the nation's soul. Nagano has worked
since the 1940s as a photojournalist and freelance documentary
photographer, primarily in his native Japan. For his first U.S. show,
White Room is featuring a selection of his incisive photographs
dating from Japan's surrender in World War II through the beginnings
of the country's economic boom in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Like nearly a century before, when Commodore Perry opened Japan to
the West after a long period of isolation, the years following
Japan's defeat in the war were defined by radical change and the
assimilation of foreign influence. American occupation forces spread
themselves, their language and their influence across the
battle-scarred landscape, infiltrating everything from popular
culture to politics. A new constitution, written by Americans, took
force, and the emperor's status dropped from divine to fallibly
human.</TE>
<TE>   In Nagano's photographs, inauspicious moments summarize the tenor
of the day. Small incidents read as broad prognoses. In one stark
image, graffiti adds insult to injury as the words "Joan {heart}
Frenchy" are scraped into the raw wall of Hiroshima's atomic bomb
dome. In another, an English-language street sign planted at a busy
Tokyo intersection reads like a territorial flag, a claim as palpable
as the huge American car gliding like a cruise ship alongside a
humble pushcart. Intersections, layers and disjunctions season these
photographs with pungent social commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Nagano's humanistic vision blossomed during fertile years for
documentary photography. Illustrated magazines enjoyed a golden age
in postwar Japan, and internationally, such landmark events as the
publication of Henri Cartier-Bresson's "The Decisive Moment," the
Museum of Modern Art's "The Family of Man" exhibition, and the
publication of Frank's "The Americans" (all in the 1950s) affirmed
the centrality--and poetry--of everyday human experience.</TE>
<TE>   Nagano's photographs, while less mannered and less dark than the
work of Daido Moriyama, Eiko Hosoe and the generation of Japanese
photographers breaking out in the late 1950s and 1960s, nevertheless
rarely feel simple or benign. They are edgy, while quiet; searing and
yet straightforward. Nagano tells us through the title of one image
that a child, bound in rope and glancing over his shoulder at us as
if in appeal, is actually playing. Yet standing alone on a street
crusted with snow, his arms roped to his sides, the boy looks
trapped, his face an icon of victimhood.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's economic recovery surfaces in Nagano's work, but so does
its social, physical and environmental costs. He shows public housing
in all its pathetic splendor; he shows the anonymous, numbed faces of
salary men on a street corner, waiting en masse for the light to
change; and, most disarmingly, he shows two young men, stripped to
underclothes, luxuriating in a sandbank that borders a debris-strewn
landfill. Frame by frame, Nagano shows us his country struggling to
redefine itself, to expand beyond its traditional parameters. So does
his work compel us to expand, by one, the pantheon of great
humanistic photographers.</TE>

<TE>   Slawson's Vital Work</TE>
<TE>   Is in the Back Room</TE>
<TE>   Persist past the photographs and a set of totemic white sculptures
to the back of Gallery 2211 and the real treasures of Dunnieghe
Slawson's expansive imagination. The work up front is hers as well,
but it feels flaccid, in spite of its larger size and splashier
format. The photographs show groves of tendril forms that the
Venice-based Slawson has fashioned from wax and dressed up with beads
and netting. The free-standing sculptures sprout clusters of lumpy
tubers off of supporting poles. Neither group of work has the formal
integrity and emotional concentration that make the smaller
sculptures and drawings in the back so intriguing.</TE>
<TE>   Like all of Slawson's work, they are odd amalgamations of the
biological and the botanical. They extrapolate from familiar
forms--shells, snails, plants, breasts and phalluses--to occupy a
realm of insistently physical fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   One wax and fiberglass piece (all are an eggshell white) rises in
an arch like a thick slug inching forward. Breast-like mounds, some
with pearl bead nipples, ridge across its back, flattening and
spreading as they progress down the slope until coming under the
wraps of a honeycomb wax sheath that seals up the creature's tapered
end. It's an exuberant gesture--naked, voluptuous and slightly
grotesque.</TE>
<TE>   The other small sculptures have a similar charm. They oscillate
between the recognizable and the pulpy, fleshy, vaguely deviant.
Their mix of playfulness and latent sexuality hints at the influence
of Louise Bourgeois.Slawson's drawings, which sometimes incorporate
photographic fragments, also feel accretive, ripe, metamorphic. Drawn
in blacks, whites and grays on vellum, they articulate an evolving
dynamism, a consortium of energies, a process more than a set of
fixed forms. Their uncontainable vitality is irresistible.</TE>

<HD>MOCA Sampler Is a Mixed Treat</HD>
<DH>Showcasing a portion of the museum's 2001 acquisitions,
'L.A. on My Mind' gathers together ambitious works that have little
in common.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The show "L.A. on My Mind: Recent Acquisitions From MOCA's
Collection" presents 10% of the paintings, drawings, sculptures,
photographs and videos the Museum of Contemporary Art acquired in
2001, by either gift or purchase.</LD>
<LD>   Straightforwardly installed in an inhospitable gallery at the
Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood, the 14-work exhibition
features works by 11 artists. Most are young. All live in Los
Angeles. And other than a consistently high level of ambition and
accomplishment that runs through the majority of their works, not
much unites them in terms of genre, style or materials.</LD>
<LD>   The centerpiece of the show is Liz Craft's "The Living Edge," a
fantastic diorama in which a gigantic snake made of colorful fabric
circles around on itself; two love-struck, nearly life-size Styrofoam
deer rub noses; and three plastic hummingbirds press the tips of
their beaks together, forming an impossible ornament. Artificial
hyacinths, carnations and ivy as well as smaller-than-life-size pine,
palm and cypress trees fill out the magical landscape.</LD>
<TE>   Craft has composed its mix-and-match components in the shape of a
figure-eight roller-coaster ride or a topsy-turvy version of the
infinity symbol. Either way, your eye speeds along a loopy circuit,
which includes a pond, miniature golf course, flimsy stairway, wooden
freeway, box kite, papier-mache cave and five backyard fences, all
higher than they are wide. Devoid of people, it's an Edenic
dreamscape crisscrossed by scale shifts that make your head spin with
seemingly endless narrative possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Other works are less theatrical but, equally indebted to Pop art,
play out similar dramas. One of Andrea Bowers' meticulous drawings
depicts a football fan with a grocery bag over his head. Another
isolates Madonna and drummer Palmolive (from the Slits) against a
messy silver background. Both works on paper use the power of mass
entertainment to draw viewers into a spirited argument about art's
place in life and our place in art.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Dave Muller's "Substitute (Celebrity)" is a poster-size
watercolor of a nude figure with a realistic portrait drawing of Mike
Kelley pasted over its head. A tongue-in-cheek hommage to the
influential artist (who has also donated art to the museum), Muller's
picture picks up where Kelley's last hometown solo show left off,
suggesting that it's high time Kelley dealt with his own status as an
art superstar.</TE>
<TE>   Images of movie stars and models, cartoon characters and consumer
products form the basis of works by Jason Rhoades and Richard
Hawkins. Rhoades' collage of pictures clipped from magazines
resembles a small rug, complete with cut-paper fringes. Made in 1992,
it functions as a symbolic doormat for the young artist's career,
which was just beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins' "City Underground" is an ordinary card table to whose
underside are glued empty cereal boxes, paper cups, a cigarette pack
and ads from fashion magazines. Recalling wads of gum, these
throwaway items form artificial stalactites that tell upside-down
stories. Another Hawkins work, a small abstract painting, brings the
casual elegance of his collage sensibility to oil on canvas. It makes
you wonder why the museum acquired so few paintings when so many
artists are working in that medium today.</TE>
<TE>   Two short DVD projections by Hirsch Perlman delight in the mystery
of simple things. Set to a melancholic work by Samuel Barber and a
jaunty instrumental piece by Thelonious Monk, Perlman's simple films
turn cigarette smoke, rubber bands and a tape measure into low-budget
actors whose performances evoke bittersweet sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Jorge Pardo's lovely wool rug and streamlined glass
lamp would look a lot better in a home, where they could be used.
Stuck to the wall (like a painting) and plopped on the floor (like a
sculpture), they make the museum look like it doesn't understand the
artist's desire to integrate art into life. That's probably Pardo's
point, but his works aren't serious about competing in the retail
design market. They're priced too high to be anything but art.</TE>
<TE>   A dopey drawing by Mark Grotjahn and four bland photographs by
Dean Sameshima are the show's only real missteps. In contrast, 12
abstract landscape drawings by Adam Ross (from a series of 24) and 24
photographic portraits by Amy Adler are worth contemplating. Both
bodies of work entice viewers to pay attention to the way they pay
attention, to watch themselves watching, as seemingly slight
differences ripple through the mind's eye.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 14 works here, five were purchased and nine were donated by
Los Angeles collectors. In the old days, museums weren't so open
about where the art they displayed came from. Today, after decades of
increased operating costs have left many museums of contemporary art
with disproportionately low acquisition budgets, their courtship of
collectors has grown increasingly open.</TE>
<TE>   In part an advertisement to attract more gifts this year, "L.A. on
My Mind" also recalls what most of us do when we return from
successful shopping trips: lay out the goods and invite friends and
family to see what we got. That's where viewers come in, as
discerning observers whose judgments, positive and negative, lead to
discussions of taste and meaning.</TE>

<HD>A Scaled-Down but Classic 'Spartacus'</HD>
<DH>Though short on star power, the skilled Grigorovich
ensemble displays technical flash and no shortage of spirit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's in a name? Fliers for the performance of "Spartacus" at the
Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza on Tuesday identified the company as
the Moscow Grigorovich Ballet, a trainee ensemble or farm team
founded in 1990 by Yuri Grigorovich, at that time the artistic
director of Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet.</LD>
<LD>   The Thousand Oaks house program, however, used a vastly more
inflated moniker: The Grigorovich Ballet of the Russian Federation
Ballet.</LD>
<LD>   Call it what you like, this is a skilled, motivated young ensemble
that brings to Grigorovich's familiar full-length 1968 historical
epic all the virtues of Soviet-era classicism--technical flash,
unanimity of impulse, generosity of spirit.</LD>
<TE>   Reduced in scale and abridged to just under two hours, the ballet
is danced to a tape of its bombastic Khachaturian score and features
crudely painted approximations of the original Simon Virsaladze sets.
But the dancing is the real thing, and in the biggest battle and orgy
scenes it reminds you of the fabulous full-company prowess that
existed during Grigorovich's 30-year tenure at the Bolshoi and exists
there no longer.</TE>
<TE>   What this "Spartacus" lacked on Tuesday was stars--and "Spartacus"
requires no fewer than four stellar, charismatic principals.</TE>
<TE>   A master of spectacular pirouettes, Denis Vladimirov proved an
attractive, expressive Spartacus. However, his arsenal did not
include the role's heroic attacks or gymnastic partnering feats, and
he generated no heat or majesty as a leader of a mass uprising.</TE>
<TE>   As Spartacus' beloved Phrygia, the refined Tatiana Liabina could
act and also execute steps strongly--but not both at the same time.
So her performance amounted to a collection of disconnected effects.</TE>
<TE>   A dancing actor of great energy and dramatic force, Mikhail
Zinoviev savored every nasty facet in the psychology of the
crypto-Nazi leader Crassus. He even managed to look dangerous in the
choreographed sword fights. But his unreliable technique left his
portrayal only fitfully satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the dancing of Alexandra Sivtsova as his scheming
consort Aegina proved drop-dead perfect in its control, with the
highest extensions and most extreme contortions imaginable. But no
dramatic fire or even interpretive choices intruded on her
single-minded exhibition of technique.</TE>
<TE>   "Spartacus" connoisseurs will note that the cuts on Tuesday
included the "Appian Way" scene of Spartacus recruiting a rebel
army--a forceful male showpiece that the Bolshoi continues to excerpt
for highlights programs.</TE>

<HD>At His 'Worst,' Bogosian at His Best</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Bogosian has indicated that "The Worst of Eric Bogosian" may be
his swan song as a solo performer. Let's hope that such statements
are simply part of his act, that he is beginning a decades-long spoof
of those performers who conduct 10 or 12 "farewell tours." It sounds
like something he might do, for he knows the vacuity of show-biz
cliches as well as any other satirist in sight.</LD>
<LD>   The production, at UCLA's Freud Playhouse through Saturday and at
UC Santa Barbara on May 9, offers some brilliant riffs on
show-biz-related topics, as well as excerpts from Bogosian's
repertoire of other kinds of characters.</LD>
<LD>   The "Worst" in the title is appropriate only in that all of
Bogosian's men are extremely tarnished. But as for the quality of the
show itself, it's almost a "best of" compilation.</LD>
<TE>   Hardly anything will be brand-new to his most fervent fans. But
his last major solo, "Wake Up and Smell the Coffee," didn't play L.A.
(though it was briefly in Irvine), and "The Worst of" includes a lot
of material from "Coffee."</TE>
<TE>   He begins as a hunched-up neurotic, seated and with his back to
the audience, muttering about "normalcy." He gradually turns to face
the audience, as his thesis about the importance and the difficulty
of achieving both fame and wealth--at the same time, please--acquires
momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Soon he's appearing as himself, moving into a glowing but
tongue-in-cheek analysis of the power of his own show to transform
the audience and, by extension, the world. Or, he finally concedes,
his show might become just "a vague memory flushed away" the next
morning. He points out that his performance might be truly memorable
only if he were to die on stage--not such a far-fetched observation
in the era of "Fear Factor."</TE>
<TE>   Bogosian is busy assailing Hollywood platitudes from the likes of
"Forrest Gump" and "Sling Blade" when he suddenly stops the show and
portrays an audience member who wants more "catharsis" from Bogosian
or "a little positivity." So he becomes one of his more upbeat
characters, a New Age preacher who's as venal as any of the others.</TE>
<TE>   A few other characters from Bogosian's gallery take their turns. A
homeless man, who subsists on egg salad sandwiches and can recycling,
comes as close to recent headlines as Bogosian will allow when he
reflects that at least he's not living in Afghanistan. He begins
singing "God Bless America." No, it's not an inspirational moment.</TE>
<TE>   Bogosian becomes a drug dealer who describes his greatest sexual
pleasures in detail, followed by the antithesis--"Eric, recovering
male," who's attempting to rid himself of his lust. Next, after
embodying an obsequious actor at an audition, Bogosian observes that
he hears more "actual groans of pain" when he performs this bit in
L.A. than he does at most of his stops. This leads into a scathingly
funny attack on celebrity worship.</TE>
<TE>   Three more characters conclude the evening: a wealthy liberal at
the barbecue of his country estate, a half-mad man who describes the
cycle of water in revoltingly graphic terms (note to Heal the Bay: a
possible fund-raiser here?) and a paranoid Luddite who fears that DSL
may help machines take over the world.</TE>
<TE>   Bogosian is smart to avoid anything ripped from the headlines, for
very little of his material has dated. His performance, staged by Jo
Bonney, makes his script sound edgier than it is, and he leaves his
audience wanting more. A farewell tour? Say it ain't so.</TE>

<HD>Romance Gets Complicated in 'The Proof of the Promise'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking for a 17th century Spanish play with a translation so
up-to-date that it includes a pun on the name of the modern
anti-baldness drug Propecia?</LD>
<LD>   Try "The Proof of the Promise" ("La Prueba de las Promesas"), a
comedy from 1618 by the Mexican-born Juan Ruiz de Alarcon, in a
sprightly new English translation by Dakin Matthews.</LD>
<LD>   This is the second Antaeus Company production of an
Alarcon-Matthews project. The first, "The Liar" in 2000, was at the
same theater, North Hollywood's Secret Rose.</LD>
<TE>   Like its predecessor, Anne McNaughton's staging of "The Proof of
the Promise" is a very modest affair. The theater is tiny and the set
only barely three-dimensional, with hardly any attempt to distinguish
Toledo from Madrid. Seven actors play far more than seven roles,
donning masks for the smaller parts to clarify who's who.</TE>
<TE>   The story is complicated but clear enough. Don Illan (Bert
Rosario, who alternates with Matthews) wants his daughter (Karen
Stone, alternating with Jennifer Gatti) to marry the scion (Scott
Allegrucci) of a rival clan, but she prefers the smoother Don Juan de
Ribera (Bill Mendieta).</TE>
<TE>   Don Illan, who practices magic on the side, conjures up a way for
each man to reveal his true colors. Not surprisingly, the sassy
servants and assistants (Rhonda Aldrich alternating with Amy Tolsky,
John Apicella, Terry Evans) play large and vocal roles in the
intrigues.</TE>
<TE>   Apicella does justice to many of the play's wittiest lines and
gestures. The two suitors remain in sharp--and funny--contrast;
Mendieta spouts Eddie Haskell-like eloquence, while Allegrucci is
more authentically fervent and sometimes flustered.</TE>
<TE>   The rhyming translation is replete with Americanisms, making it
fairly easy on the ear.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Proof of the Promise," Secret Rose Theatre, 11246 Magnolia
Blvd., North Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m.
Ends March 1. $16-$20. Running time: 2 hours, 15 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   'Smash' Rewrites Shaw, Studies Social Graces</TE>
<TE>   While trying to contact George Bernard Shaw in the great beyond,
playwright Jeffrey Hatcher seems to have picked up some vibrations
from Oscar Wilde. How else to explain all of the epigrams peppering
the speeches on socialism in his stage adaptation of the early Shaw
novel "An Unsocial Socialist"?</TE>
<TE>   It's a happy mixing of signals. The resulting comedy, which
Hatcher calls "Smash," has a lighter spirit than the Shaw original,
published as a serialized novel in a socialist journal in 1884. Yet
Shaw's thinking remains very much at the core of Hatcher's extensive
rewrite--especially in allusions to the "life force" of women, which
Shaw wrote about so passionately in his later play "Man and
Superman."</TE>
<TE>   Presented in Long Beach Playhouse's Studio Theatre, "Smash" traces
the complications that ensue from a millionaire's decision to abandon
his bride so that he can fully devote himself to the spread of
socialism. But for all of his grandiose plans, Sidney Trefusis
(Michael Carr) is a silly goose who will more than meet his match in
his bride, Henrietta (Nicole Ann Mohr), and in the young rebel Agatha
Wylie (Amanda Karr) he encounters at the finishing school where he
tries to foment revolution.</TE>
<TE>   All it takes from Mohr or Karr is a tilt of the head, a clench of
the jaw or a twinkle in the eyes to indicate that Trefusis is toast.
Also delightful: a Margaret Hamilton-esque turn by Ann Ross as the
finishing school's wicked headmistress.</TE>
<TE>   Director Russell St. Clair has the right ideas about making the
action seem breezily frantic. But he has been only partially
successful in assembling actors who can make a characterization seem
larger than life yet believable, and the stage is too cramped for the
physical comedy, which involves all manner of wheeled conveyances.</TE>

<TE>   Serious Subtext to Parody of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'</TE>
<TE>   To put it in show-biz vernacular, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" has legs.
"Drama Dept.'s Uncle Tom's Cabin; Or the Preservation of Favored
Races in the Struggle for Life," at the Sacred Fools Theater, uses
Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 novel as the starting point for a fast,
furious and funny parody dealing with the nature of racism.</TE>
<TE>   Notice the possessory title. Created by Floraine Kay and Randolph
Curtis Rand, the show was first produced in 1997 at New York's Drama
Dept. Whatever its inception, director Alexander Yannis Stephano and
a gifted ensemble make the piece distinctly their own.</TE>
<TE>   And take particular note of the subtitle, from Charles Darwin's
"The Origin of the Species." The emphasis is evident. Comically
expressed, the scientific reasons for racial diversity are a primary
subtext here, with two wacky, ersatz professors (Stan Freitag and
Fred Shahadi) interrupting the action at intervals to "lecture" on
the subject, in broad Italian accents a la Chico Marx.</TE>
<TE>   It's all part of the heightened hilarity and rattling comic pace.
But don't let the slapstick fool you. Belly laughs segue into pained
grimaces, as the full and nasty import of slavery is hammered home.
The eclectic source material includes quotes from literary
luminaries, political figure, even harrowing first-hand accounts from
former slaves. However loose the adaptation may be, it is still a
surprisingly faithful recapitulation of Stowe's book, with all the
dramatic tension and cliff-hanging suspense of the original.</TE>
<TE>   The tone varies wildly, from melodrama to minstrel show to
political polemic. The core ensemble--Carolyn Hennesy, Jon Huertas,
Yvans Joudain, Edgar Allan Poe IV, and J. Karen Thomas--is well
equipped to handle any contingency. Gender-bending and color-blind
casting are the rule, with women playing men, blacks playing whites
and young playing old seamlessly.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Francis' lighting and set are praiseworthy, and the ensemble
contributes sprightly original music to the mix. A tad long-winded
and overwrought, the piece could have used a little trimming, but
that's a quibble in an otherwise impressive production.</TE>

Drive, Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends Feb. 23. $15.

<TE>   Is It a Dream State or, 'Perchance,' a Nightmare?</TE>
<TE>   What if you lived under a government so intrusive, not even your
dreams were your own?</TE>
<TE>   Such is the plight of Gerard B. (Robert Fileta), a prominent stage
and television actor who finds himself on trial for a murder
committed in his dreams. Currently in rehearsals for "Hamlet," Gerard
has been having sanguinary Shakespearean nightmares, which he is
shocked to learn have been recorded in precise detail by government
agents. Gerard's lawyer (Joseph Hulser) cautions him to have only
wholesome, politically correct dreams. But Gerard's subconscious is
not so easily subdued.</TE>
<TE>   The line between reality and nightmare blurs early on in
"Perchance to Dream" at the Open Fist. French playwright Jean-Claude
Grumberg raises timely issues of censorship, government surveillance
and paternal abandonment, but the play succeeds chiefly as absurdist
vaudeville in Adrian Mitchell's lively and funny adaptation,
translated by Sasha Mitchell. Director Florinel Fatulescu and his
comically gifted cast approach their material with tongues planted
firmly in cheek, right up until the play's wrenching final scenes.
They aim to disorient, and they do--with plenty of chuckles along the
way.</TE>
<TE>   A huge, canopied bed dominates Don Llewellyn's versatile set,
lighted to genuinely creepy effect by R. Robert DeCew. Drew Dalzell's
sound design is also an essential part of Fatulescu's shifting,
dreamscape staging.</TE>
<TE>   The plot is as illogical as a nightmare, but overall, the
performances are precise, particularly Patrick Tuttle as a
hilariously revisionist director who apparently thinks Shakespeare
needs a script doctor, and Rod Sell as a buffoonish judge who is out
to get Gerard. The courtroom scene, in which the lawyer and the judge
hurl insults at one another with childish abandon, plays like a
vintage burlesque sketch as rewritten by Kafka.</TE>

<TE>   A Streamlined Staging Clarifies 'Richard III'</TE>
<TE>   If you've ever left one of Shakespeare's history plays feeling
befuddled by the sheer flow of events, you must see "Richard III,"
presented by Circus Theatricals and the Odyssey Theatre Ensemble at
the Odyssey Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Whether you're a Shakespearean scholar or think the War of the
Roses is a Valentine's cost-cutting promotion, you will find Casey
Biggs' streamlined staging of Shakespeare's mustache-twirling history
richly comprehensible on every level.</TE>
<TE>   The artistic director of Circus Theatricals, Jack Stehlin has
played a lot of leads in his company's plays. But don't call him
overexposed. That's a modern Hollywood notion, one that the great
actor-managers of theater's heyday would have scorned. Stehlin was
born to play Richard, and he goes about the task with a lethal
twinkle and a craftsman's assurance, never overplaying a single
snarl.</TE>
<TE>   Alfred Molina is a bang-up Buckingham, wisely content to bask in
the periphery of Stehlin's simmering, shimmering nastiness. Molina's
Buckingham feasts fastidiously with the panther Richard before he
himself is eaten, undone by the rumblings of his own vestigial
conscience.</TE>
<TE>   When Richard orders Buckingham to butcher the child princes in the
tower, Buckingham hesitates, fatally. In Richard's cruel order,
charity is folly, punishable by death.</TE>
<TE>   Seasoned actors, many playing multiple roles, round out the
accomplished cast. The acting is always solid and often inspired,
although Biggs' decision to cast a man--Shakespearean stalwart Neil
Vipond--as Queen Margaret seems an odd tack, considering the
otherwise straightforward tone.</TE>
<TE>   Simplicity is key throughout. Jaret Sacrey's scenic design is a
marvel of stripped-down functionalism. Paul Taylor Robertson's sound
is unobtrusively detailed, right down to the dripping water in a dank
prison cell.</TE>
<TE>   Lighting designer Tim Kiley contributes essential video segments,
especially effective in the play's penultimate nightmare sequence,
always a challenge to stage. The videos are just one more inspired
element in the smooth and rewarding whole.</TE>

<HD>He'll Go a Long Way to Try to Get Even</HD>
<DH>In the wiseacre comedy 'Big Fat Liar,' sassy Frankie Muniz
plots against the Hollywood producer who stole his idea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN STUART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frankie Muniz, of the small mouth that moves mountains, may not wear
well as he inches into adulthood.</LD>
<LD>   The shelf life for the brand of heroic incorrigibility he sells on
the Fox network's "Malcolm in the Middle"--cocky, calculating,
strutting with a sense of middle-class entitlement--tends to expire
the day after adolescence. By his 20s, he could be sidelined to
playing smart-aleck flash-in-the-pans like Romeo's self-destructive
cousin Mercutio (or Riff, his 1950s variant in "West Side Story"). By
his 40s, he could be reduced to courtroom cameos as corporate fall
guys in "Enron: The Miniseries."</LD>
<LD>   For now, he gets to play quick-witted superdudes like Jason
Shepherd, the eponymous tale-spinner of "Big Fat Liar." This
14-year-old operator from anytown, Michigan, has raised pathological
lying into a lifestyle, if not an art. Putting his surfeit of
imagination to practical use, young Jason devises a self-referential
English composition that is apparently so engaging and original that
is stolen by ruthless Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti),
whom he accidentally encounters en route to school.</LD>
<TE>   When Jason sees an advance trailer for a movie that was obviously
ripped off from his paper, he does what any enterprising 14-year-old
with a supplementary Visa card would do: He grabs his perky best
friend (Amanda Bynes from Nickelodeon's "The Amanda Show") and
absconds to Los Angeles to confront the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   The better part of "Big Fat Liar" is a succession of humiliating
traps that Jason sets for his Wolf, played by Giamatti with a
carnivorous cartoonishness that sets the tone for the whole picture.
It's a sugared-up Hollywood revenge fantasy, "The Player" by way of
"Willy Wonka." The true measure of the film's innocence (and
contradictory signals) is that the conniving Jason is ultimately too
green and naive to demand royalties: All he wants is for Wolf to call
his dad and verify the legitimacy of his stolen composition.</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't prevent Jason from marshaling everyone that Wolf has
ever wronged and launching an offensive worthy of Gen. Patton. Would
that the picture's sass were half as fun as Jason's brass. But
screenwriter Dan Schneider and director Shawn Levy substitute volume
and primary colors for humor and bite. Granted, it's a kids' flick,
but kids today have enough savvy about the movie industry to report
for Variety.</TE>
<TE>   In place of toothy industry satire, we get a lifetime supply of
Giamatti in screeching overdrive and a quaint notion of studio back
lots, in which extras dressed as aliens, cowboys and spear-carriers
can be found milling about between takes in the same dusty alley.</TE>
<TE>   Muniz and Bynes give the impression that they're actually enjoying
themselves, which helps a lot. One would love to see what they do
with real characters, instead of two more movie kids stricken with a
case of terminal vivacity.</TE>

<HD>Finally, a Camera Focuses on Them</HD>
<DH>A photography exhibit at the motion picture academy
documents the women who work behind the scenes on movies, rarely
getting the glory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When you think of the kinds of jobs women have in the movie business,
special effects may not immediately spring to mind. Nor, probably,
does it occur to many people, even in these enlightened times, that
the tasks of composer or editor are also talents women contribute to
the filmmaking process.</LD>
<LD>   Actresses are important, and there are a handful of major
directors who happen to be women, but producers of a new exhibit felt
the less obvious roles women play in filmmaking were overdue some
high-profile credit.</LD>
<LD>   "Great Women in Film: Photographs by Helena Lumme and Mika
Manninen," a new large-format photography exhibit opening today in
the Grand Lobby of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences,
shines the spotlight on 30 women from all aspects of the film
industry, including animation, sound and visual effects, music,
production and costume design, makeup and casting. The only actresses
in the exhibition are Jodie Foster, Susan Sarandon and Joan Allen.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, Billboard Books will release a companion book next
month that features all of Manninen's photographs and Lumme's
interviews. In April, the Sundance Channel will show excerpts from
their documentary chronicling the photo shoots and interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "In any of the books on Hollywood or who's whos in Hollywood, they
present actors and directors and never anybody behind the scenes,"
Lumme says. "Our goal is to make them the big legends for future
researchers."</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, Lumme produced the exhibition "Screenwriters:
America's Storytellers in Portrait," for which Manninen photographed
50 screenwriters. The touring exhibit visited the academy and the
Cannes International Film Festival. A companion book accompanied that
exhibition as well.</TE>
<TE>   "We had such good feedback from screenwriters--the Writers Guild
helped us make that happen--and we started to notice stories about
screenwriters and stories featuring a screenwriter's point of view
more than before" the exhibition, says Lumme.</TE>
<TE>   For their next consciousness-raising project, women seemed a
logical choice. "Nothing has happened with the numbers of working
women in the film industry for the past 10 years, though there have
been committees and foundations to work hard to get more women into
the film industry but with no success," Lumme says. "So we thought,
maybe, you know, [offering] the same kind of visibility we gave the
screenwriters, we can help with women."</TE>
<TE>   The women spent eight months researching women from various fields
in the movie business. "We followed their career tracks," she says.
"We wanted to go with movies that are interesting and have given
people something. We didn't want to go with the big blockbusters.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted someone who could be the spokesperson for their craft
and through the book could tell their audience in very understandable
terms what does a production designer do, what an assistant director
does, so we give a little glimpse behind the scenes so people have a
better understanding."</TE>
<TE>   Among the veterans of their respective professions featured in the
exhibit are editor Dede Allen, writer-director Allison Anders, set
decorator Rosemary Brandenburg, costume designer Ruth Carter, prop
master Trish Gallagher Glenn, writer-director Kasi Lemmons,
production designer Jeannine Oppewall, composer Rachel Portman,
special-effects technician Christy Sumner and producer Christine
Vachon.</TE>
<TE>   Foster, Sarandon and Joan Allen were singled out for inclusion
because, in Lumme's view, they all respect the work of the
behind-the-scenes women on a set. "There are a lot of brilliant
actresses out there, but not all of them are capable of getting along
with other people," Manninen adds.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswomen for Their Craft</TE>
<TE>   In the black-and-white portrait of Joan Allen, the actress is
standing on a balcony looking into the distance with Los Angeles
looming in the background. "It's a wonderful thing," says Allen of
the project. "I love the recognition of all the different areas."</TE>
<TE>   Lumme says the women were excited with the prospect of being a
spokeswoman for their craft, but they also were apprehensive. "We all
hate to be photographed," Lumme says.</TE>
<TE>   "Half the job is trying to calm the person down and have them
trust you," Manninen adds.</TE>
<TE>   The color and black-and-white photographs depict the women in
various styles and settings. Some of the women chose to be
photographed as they took part in hobbies such as horseback riding or
catching butterflies. Others opted for a fantasy setting. Foster, for
example, looks as if she stepped out of "Nanook of the North."</TE>
<TE>   Costumer designer Carter went for an exotic cross between a Gypsy
and Cleopatra. Lumme and Manninen took her out to Death Valley for
the shoot; they felt it might evoke something of Carter's experiences
in Egypt while designing costumes for "Malcolm X."</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of threw a few ideas around, and they said you can select
any kind of persona that would embody you," Carter says. "I said
Cleopatra. She had about 250 changes in that movie, and she was a
great woman. She was romantic."</TE>
<TE>   Contrasting Sides of Personality</TE>
<TE>   Special-effects technician Sumner wanted a photograph that
depicted both the masculine and feminine sides of her profession. In
her color portrait, she is wearing a beautiful pink dress and
sporting green toenail polish as she's suspended above a fire with a
huge explosion in the background.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be really great to show the diversity of me
being a woman and doing the type of work that I do," she says. "As it
sort of evolved, I was talking with Mika that I could probably get
some of my assistants and people I work with to provide us with some
lovely special effects while I am suspended in midair. It just sort
of evolved as we went along."</TE>
<TE>   Carter and Sumner agree that the exhibition and book are
significant chronicles of the contributions of women in the film
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "When you think about the movie industry from a historical
perspective, the pioneers that come to mind are Chaplin, Capra, De
Mille and the studio boss sitting behind his big desk," Sumner says.
"The roles that women played were usually limited to the roles in
front of the camera. This reminds us that women are an integral part
of all creative aspects of filming."</TE>
<TE>   "As women, so many of us have to juggle many balls as far as being
wives and mothers and sisters," Carter says. "Most of the women in
this exhibit do have that duality going on. These are real people,
real women who are able to do those things and do what they wanted to
do--fulfill their dreams."</TE>
<TE>   "Great Women of Film" opens today and continues through April 21
in the Grand Lobby of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and
Sciences, 8949 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills. Hours are
Tuesdays-Fridays, 10 a.m.-5 p.m., and Saturdays-Sundays, noon-6 p.m.
Admission is free. Information: (310) 247-3600.</TE>

<HD>A Drive-Thru 'Macbeth' in Lifeless 'Scotland, PA.'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whoever assembled the trailer for "Scotland, PA." is nothing less
than a miracle worker for extracting a few clips funny enough to
suggest that a transposition of "Macbeth" to a small-town roadside
cafe in the 1970s just might make for an amusing black comedy. The
film, however, is so flat and uninspired that in context not even
those clips are funny.</LD>
<LD>   Writer-director Billy Morrissette got the idea for this bit of a
stretch 20 years ago when he was working at a Dairy Queen for a boss
he hated, at the same time he was introduced to "Macbeth."
Morrissette thankfully didn't go so far as to retain Shakespeare's
dialogue but is faithful to the plot.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, in his reworking he was unable to create characters
of even the slightest interest, resulting in a film that remains
lifeless throughout its plodding 102 minutes. Pat McBeth (Maura
Tierney, who is married to Morrissette) and her husband, Joe (James
LeGros), are a waitress and cook, respectively, at Duncan's, a modest
eatery. They have great sex, but Pat wants more out of life. When
their boss, Norm Duncan (James Rebhorn), passes over Joe for the
position of manager in favor of his oldest son, Malcolm (Tom Guiry),
who hates the joint and wants only to become a rock star, Pat has had
it.</LD>
<TE>   She gets her husband to whack Duncan to death, and Malcolm and his
equally uninterested younger brother, Donald (Geoff Dunsworth),
gladly sell them the place for a pittance. The McBeths immediately
remodel it into a McDonald's replica, complete with drive-thru. This
glitzy face-lift is the high point of the film's only successful
aspect, the spot-on contribution of production designer Jennifer
Stewart and her team and of costume designer David Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   Success comes swiftly, but Lt. Ernie McDuff (Christopher Walken),
brought in from the big city to investigate Duncan's death, keeps
poking around and asking endless questions with a folksy, unctuous
insistence. Because Pat and Joe are essentially dim types lacking in
moral imagination, they are incapable of experiencing true guilt,
which leads to more murders.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to accuse Morrissette of condescending to a bunch of
yokels, but hardly anybody would hold that against him if the result
had been hilarious instead of deadly dull. Tierney, LeGros and many
others are game, but only Walken has the chance to display wit that
lifts him above the surrounding desolation.</TE>
<TE>   Morrissette's only real stab at a light touch is in turning
Shakespeare's Three Witches into a trio of prophetic hippies, one of
whom is played by Timothy "Speed" Levitch, whose beguilingly frenetic
personality was captured in the memorable documentary "The Cruise";
one hopes he has held on to his day job as a Manhattan tour guide.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

violence. Times guidelines: The violence may be brief, but it is
extremely brutal.</TE>

<HD>99 Reasons to Watch 'Biography'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wayne Gretzky is known as the Great One, even to those who pride
themselves on their ignorance of hockey or sports in general. But
"what they ought to call me is the Grateful One," his 1990
autobiography says.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's "Biography" (8 p.m., A&amp;E) deftly explains why Gretzky,
who is retired from playing but is back in the spotlight as executive
director of the Canadian Olympic hockey team, still feels that way.
It emphasizes the importance of family and friends to him as his life
progressed from the backyard rink his father set up to the
international arena in which he is now an ambassador for the game.</LD>
<LD>   During his playing days, Gretzky dominated hockey with his scoring
ability, relying on anticipation and his knowledge of the game rather
than size, strength or skating speed. They were skills taught to him
by his father, Walter, a virtually constant presence at the big
moments throughout Gretzky's career. And, to be sure, there were many
of those--four Stanley Cup championships with his first NHL team, the
Edmonton Oilers; career scoring milestones as a member of the Kings;
and an emotional retirement with the New York Rangers.</LD>
<TE>   Though most of the story will be familiar to fans of the game, the
"Biography" documentary does an excellent job of keeping it fresh,
especially when examining Gretzky's younger days. Many of the
excerpts from home movies, early game films and even a segment of No.
99 singing on "The Alan Thicke Show" are rarely seen. More
surprisingly, among the many people interviewed for the show is his
mother, Phyllis, a huge presence in Gretzky's life who usually stays
in the background.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the more bizarre and unhappy twists in Gretzky's life,
including his departure from L.A. to a brief stint in St. Louis and
the imprisonment of friend and former Kings owner Bruce McNall for
bank fraud, aren't really addressed in the show. But overall, this
"Biography" hits the highlights in a compelling enough way to remind
you how much hockey misses the Great One on ice.</TE>

<HD>The Terrorism Is Unnerving, But It's the Same Arnold</HD>
<DH>The violence in 'Collateral Damage' takes on a more
disconcerting tone but ultimately it's business as usual for the
action star.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If it wasn't for an accident of history, "Collateral Damage" would
have come and gone without much fanfare, notable only for Arnold
Schwarzenegger taking a page out of Mike Tyson's book and biting the
ear off a bad guy.</LD>
<LD>   But because it concerns an average citizen whose family is killed
in an act of international terrorism on American soil, the Andrew
Davis-directed "Damage" received a degree of celebrity as one of the
films whose release was postponed after Sept. 11. Seeing it now
underscores the inevitability of that decision. Even today, watching
a bomb go off among unprepared civilians in what looks like Century
City is more disconcerting than it would otherwise have been.</LD>
<LD>   Also unnerving, for similar reasons, are the film's realistic
opening shots of Schwarzenegger as L.A. firefighter Gordy Brewer
dealing with the darkness, the smoke, the screaming chaos of a major
conflagration. While much has been made out of this being what one of
the producers calls "a significantly different Arnold," that's not
really the case. The Ordinary Arnold referred to lasts for about the
blink of an eye before he reemerges as such an indomitable one-man
army that not sending him into Afghanistan in search of Osama bin
Laden seems a regrettable oversight.</LD>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger's Gordy would have preferred to stay that regular
guy, a loving husband and involved father to a cute son with just the
right number of missing teeth. But then comes that bomb blast outside
the consulate of Colombia, an explosion that numbered his family
among its nine victims. Even Hollywood couldn't imagine a body count
as high as that of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Quickly taking responsibility for the carnage is El Lobo (the
wolf), the dreaded leader of Colombia's rebel faction (played by New
Zealander Cliff Curtis). "We will bring the war to you," a video
message from El Lobo eerily insists. "You will not feel safe in your
own beds."</TE>
<TE>   Distraught though he is about his loss, Gordy is willing to let
the government, symbolized by renegade CIA agent Brandt (Elias
Koteas), tackle El Lobo. At least at first. But hearing a smirking
Lobo sympathizer talk about how those civilian casualties were
nothing more than unfortunate collateral damage drives this
even-tempered firefighter over the edge and turns him into a demon of
revenge. "Your face has changed," someone says, and indeed it has.</TE>
<TE>   Now more Terminator than Ordinary Arnold, Gordy gets himself to
Colombia on a quest to personally dismember El Lobo. All kinds of
people want him dead, and all kinds of obstacles--from trained
killers to involuntary trips down enormous waterfalls--get placed in
his way. It wouldn't be accurate to say Gordy laughs at these
dangers--he's in far too sour a mood--but that's the general idea.</TE>
<TE>   Gordy is even impervious to unimpressive acting from some of
"Damage's" bigger names. Here's John Turturro as an expatriate
Canadian mechanic--"a wrench for hire" is what he imaginatively calls
himself--who briefly shares a cell with Gordy. And there's John
Leguizamo as a wacky cocaine manufacturer--is there any other
kind?--who is connected to the rebels. You meet such interesting
people when you travel.</TE>
<TE>   Given what he's been through, it's not surprising that the only
thing that gives Gordy pause on his relentless quest for revenge is
the plight of young mothers in the company of small sons. One that
especially catches his eye is sylph-like Selena (Italian actress
Francesca Neri, an object of Dr. Lecter's affection in "Hannibal"),
who crosses Gordy's path so often it makes you think Colombia
couldn't be much bigger than Larchmont Village.</TE>
<TE>   As directed by Davis (who did the memorable "The Fugitive") and
edited by Dennis Virkler and Dov Hoenig, "Collateral Damage" does a
solid job with its action sequences and the David Griffiths &amp; Peter
Griffiths script takes a few random stabs at being of interest.
Here's El Lobo, for instance, talking about how revolution plays in
the U.S. of A: "When an American sees a peasant with a gun on
television, he changes the channel. He never asks, 'What is a peasant
doing with a gun?'"</TE>
<TE>   "Collateral Damage's" heart, however, is not into radicalizing
Gordy and turning him into a firefighting Che Guevara. The film's
political philosophy, as much as it has one, is of the "a plague on
both your houses" variety, painting the rebels and the CIA as equally
fixated on killing innocent civilians for their own nefarious
ideological ends. We've seen it all before, and we'll likely see it
all again.</TE>
<TE>   "In the struggle for liberation," El Lobo says, "there is no room
for mistakes." Hollywood, however, is a lot more forgiving.</TE>

<HD>Writers Guild Nominations Announced</HD>
<DH>'Gosford Park,' 'The Man Who Wasn't There' and 'A Beautiful
Mind' are among films up for script awards in a competitive year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A tale of intrigue and murder at an English country estate, a
sprawling, action-filled adaptation of a beloved fantasy novel and an
exploration into the dark world of mental illness were among the
screenplays the Writers Guild of America nominated Thursday as the
best of 2001, setting up one of the toughest races to handicap in
this hotly contested Oscar season.</LD>
<LD>   Original screenplay nominations went to Julian Fellowes for USA
Films' class-conscious British murder mystery "Gosford Park"; Joel
and Ethan Coen for USA Films' wryly noirish "The Man Who Wasn't
There"; Milo Addica and Will Rokos for Lions Gate Films'
racially-charged drama "Monster's Ball"; Baz Luhrmann and Craig
Pearce for 20th Century Fox's energetically stylized musical "Moulin
Rouge"; and Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson for Touchstone Pictures'
dark comedy about an eccentric family, "The Royal Tenenbaums."</LD>
<LD>   Among screenplays based on material previously produced or
published, nominated material covered real-life events, popular
novels and even a comic book.</LD>
<TE>   Those films included Akiva Goldsman for Universal Pictures' "A
Beautiful Mind," about Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash,
whose battle to overcome schizophrenia was chronicled in Sylvia
Nasar's book; and Ken Nolan for Columbia Pictures' "Black Hawk Down,"
a screenplay based on a best-selling book by Mark Bowden about U.S.
military forces under attack in Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   Helen Fielding, Andrew Davies and Richard Curtis were also
nominated for Miramax Films' romantic comedy "Bridget Jones's Diary,"
which evolved from Fielding's novel; Daniel Clowes and Terry Zwigoff
for United Artists' offbeat drama "Ghost World," which was spawned
from Clowes' cult comic; and Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Peter
Jackson for New Line Cinema's epic fantasy spectacle "The Lord of the
Rings: Fellowship of the Ring."</TE>
<TE>   Five of the 10 screenplays were co-written by the directors of the
respective movies, including Joel Coen, Luhrmann and Anderson in the
original screenplay category and Zwigoff and Jackson for adapted
screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   A Number of Movies Not Eligible for Awards</TE>
<TE>   In the competitive atmosphere leading up to Tuesday's announcement
of Academy Award nominations, Hollywood is keeping close tabs on
every other key nomination, and the Writers Guild's selections are no
exception. "A Beautiful Mind," "Moulin Rouge," "Black Hawk Down" and
"The Lord of the Rings" are all considered strong Oscar contenders
for best picture.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, a number of celebrated movies were not eligible for
Writers Guild awards this year because at the time the films were
made the companies that hired the writers were not signatories to the
collective bargaining agreement with the guild, even though the
writers may have been guild members.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more glaring examples is Miramax's "In the Bedroom,"
which was named best picture by the Los Angeles Film Critics Assn.
and has received various awards for its stars Sissy Spacek and Tom
Wilkinson, including a Golden Globe for Spacek.</TE>
<TE>   Also ineligible were the intriguing mystery-told-backward
"Memento," whose director, Christopher Nolan, is up for a Directors
Guild award this year, as well as DreamWorks' "Shrek" and
Disney/Pixar's "Monsters, Inc.," two blockbuster feature-length
animated films that won the hearts of many filmgoers this year.</TE>
<TE>   Why can't these two successful and critically acclaimed animated
studio releases be recognized by the WGA, while the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences has even established an entire new category
just for animated movies this year?</TE>
<TE>   The guild explained that "Shrek" and "Monsters, Inc." could have
been considered, but neither DreamWorks nor Pixar signed a special
agreement covering animation that would have allowed them to be
eligible if they would have agreed to permit the guild to determine
writing credits for animation projects in the years 2002 and 2003.
Under those circumstances, the guild said it would have accepted the
writing credits for films released in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Pixar said the company did not even submit "Monsters, Inc." for
WGA consideration, while a spokesman for DreamWorks said the studio
did inquire if the guild could accept "Shrek" in the best screenplay
adaptation category, but the guild stressed that neither qualified
because the companies had declined to sign the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   There has been speculation that the failure of "In the Bedroom"
and "Memento" to qualify for a WGA award could hurt their chances in
the Oscar writing categories, but Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary
went on to win the 1994 Academy Award for "Pulp Fiction," even though
that film didn't qualify for a WGA nomination, and the next year
Christopher McQuarrie won an Oscar for "The Usual Suspects" without
having that film nominated by the guild.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is nothing like the recognition of one's peers, Akiva
Goldsman said Thursday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extraordinary," Goldsman said by phone from New York. "You
go to your first writing class and read aloud to other people who
write and those are always the people who are your best critics. They
know what you do every day. It's a funny, odd, twisted vocation, this
writing."</TE>
<TE>   'Rings' Writing Team Faced Difficult Challenges</TE>
<TE>   The writing team of Walsh and Boyens, speaking by phone from
Wellington, New Zealand, said the nomination was "the highest
compliment" they could imagine.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge facing them, the two women said, was not only
staying true to J.R.R. Tolkien's work, but taking a story that seemed
almost impossible to turn into a movie and bring those characters to
life by fitting them in a cinematic structure.</TE>
<TE>   There were times during the long production, they admitted, when
things looked so bleak, that one writer looked at the other and
joked, "Please kill me!"</TE>
<TE>   "It was the middle of the year 2000 and [director] Peter [Jackson]
had already been shooting 200-something days and we were in a
constant revision process," Boyens recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Writing, she added, is "pretty messy" anyway, but "it was also
exhilarating in a way."</TE>
<TE>   The Writers Guild Awards will take place March 2 at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel and simultaneously at the Pierre Hotel in New York.</TE>

<DH>Movies*  The Berlin fest's effort to promote German films
raises issues of globalization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>The starring actress is Australian. The script was written by a Pole.
Hollywood money financed the production, and Italy provides the
backdrop for a German director's newest film.</LD>
<LD>   "Heaven," starring Cate Blanchett and produced by Miramax, opened
this year's Berlinale international film festival on Wednesday with a
multicultural stew that testifies to the cinematic world's
globalization.</LD>
<LD>   The blending of languages, ideas, settings, stars and money into a
big-budget film aimed at the lucrative English-speaking market is
being applauded by European producers and promoters as an embrace of
diversity and the way of the future. But purists lament the
accelerating trend toward multinational production as a threat to
each domestic industry's national signature.</LD>
<TE>   With so many foreign influences competing to leave their stamps,
"film is at risk of becoming empty and faceless," Helkon Media
producer Bernhard Koch says.</TE>
<TE>   "The German language is what really keeps things together in
German film," says Koch, whose Munich company mostly makes
made-for-TV movies in German. "The problem is selling these abroad."</TE>
<TE>   It is that quest for international box-office success that is
driving European filmmakers to seek diverse partners to beef up
budgets and attract known-quantity talent. But as "Heaven" suggests,
with its uneven pace and unconvincing stab at being both thriller and
love story, there can be too many cooks in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Director Tom Tykwer, whose 1998 hit "Run Lola Run" pulsed with
Berlin's edgy cultural scene, spent lavishly on gorgeous settings and
aerial camera work for "Heaven," but flirts with farce in his
adaptation of the script by the late Krzysztof Kieslowski.</TE>
<TE>   Tykwer's film, like many other co-productions at this year's
festival, also raises the question of what national passport a film
should carry and whether the Berlinale can achieve its new director's
stated aim of showcasing domestic talent.</TE>
<TE>   Berlinale 2002 features four German films among 23 entries in
competition for the Golden Bear, to be awarded at the Feb. 17 finale.
That presence is in dramatic contrast with last year's festival,
where this country's offerings were strikingly absent. With 400,000
tickets sold long before the films are screened, the Berlinale is
Germany's biggest cultural event of the year. It also has risen in
international esteem in recent years to be considered among Europe's
top three film festivals, following Cannes and rivaling Venice.</TE>
<TE>   Berlinale director Dieter Kosslick says he assigns a film's
"certificate of origin" according to the nationality of the director.</TE>
<TE>   "'Heaven' in the most important sense can be labeled 'made in
Germany,' even though most of it wasn't in the physical sense," says
Kosslick.</TE>
<TE>   Gerhard Schmidt, head of Gemini Films in the city of Cologne,
disagrees with Kosslick's formula for ascribing nationality.</TE>
<TE>   "Is 'Independence Day' a German film?" he asks, referring to the
apocalyptic 1996 movie about aliens' invasion of the United States
that was directed by German-born Roland Emmerich.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt's colleague, H.W. Pausch, observes that films may be less
nationally distinctive now because the lifestyles and cultures of the
main producing countries have converged.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the 35 feature films co-produced by Gemini during the last
decade used German towns as American suburban backdrops with little
revision. "The same faceless architecture invaded both countries in
the 1970s, so one place looks much like the other now," Pausch says.</TE>
<TE>   Some scenes in "Heaven" were filmed in Britain and Germany,
although the setting is Italy throughout.</TE>
<TE>   After 22 years during which the festival was under the direction
of Swiss impresario Moritz de Hadeln, German movie moguls are
celebrating Kosslick's unabashed support for the national product and
what they see as belated arrival at their rightful place in the film
world.</TE>
<TE>   Germany is the most important market for Hollywood after the
United States, with more than 80% of the 178 million tickets sold
here last year for U.S. productions.</TE>
<TE>   That means proceeds flow out of the country, enriching outsized
competitors across the Atlantic. But the German share rose from less
than 14% in 2000 to 16% last year, and seven German films released in
2001 drew more than a million viewers each, hinting at an upswing for
the national industry, notes Thilo Kleine, head of Bavaria Film, one
of Germany's biggest producers.</TE>
<TE>   France's generous government subsidies and restricted import of
foreign films make it second in the world in raw ticket sales, with
184 million last year compared with 1.4 billion at U.S. cinemas.
Britain ranks third for the international market and fourth in all
ticket sales, with 156 million sold last year.</TE>
<TE>   Having four films in competition at the Berlinale may suggest a
step forward for German directors, but Kosslick insists that the
stamp he wants to put on the festival is anything but nationalist.</TE>
<TE>   Under the festival's overall rubric of "accept diversity," he has
assembled 400 dramas, documentaries and comedies from around the
world, many with the message that tolerance is the only cure for the
violence and hatreds consuming the planet. One film in competition,
the English-Irish co-production "Bloody Sunday," chronicles the start
of Northern Ireland's armed conflicts 30 years ago from both sides'
perspectives.</TE>
<TE>   Kosslick concedes that he sees the Berlinale as an opportunity to
promote young German creative talent, but he insists there has been
no lowering of the quality bar for his compatriots.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tornow, a Berlin journalist who a year ago founded the
Film 20 lobby to push for government subsidies for the nation's
filmmakers, says modern German cinema still has its own signature
despite the cultural leveling of co-production.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it can have international impact, but there is
still a distinction in German film," she says, rattling off a recent
spate of small movies lampooning social frictions that persist
between eastern and western Germans a dozen years after the Berlin
Wall fell. "It's about urban life, everyday life, from the rebels of
1968 to squatter movements and the Red Army Faction."</TE>
<TE>   The faction terrorized Germany throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and
one of its founders, Andreas Baader, is the subject of an eponymous
German entry this year.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas Klein, head of Splendid Pictures, which distributed last
year's Berlinale headliner, "Traffic," sees a uniquely German
commitment to assimilation driving the globalization of film.</TE>
<TE>   "When Germans move to the United States or Italy or Spain, they
try immediately to blend in, and you can't tell them apart from
Americans after a few years," Klein says, adding that a film's
national identity is of little concern to viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Some see "Heaven" as uniquely German, even if they can't put their
finger on exactly what makes it so.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a German idea realized with the support of American
partners. But it is an original German project," Constantin Film
marketing chief Thomas Friedl says of the film.</TE>
<TE>   But like most filmmaking executives, Friedl defends the confluence
of foreign interests as a means of bolstering a domestic industry
that has suffered in recent years from expanding too quickly and
investing almost exclusively in international productions.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the limited prospects for commercial success in the
all-important U.S. market, German companies dependent on television
revenues to produce feature films can seldom drum up more than about
$5 million for a project. That further constrains their ability to
compete against big-budget Hollywood productions, although the
occasional small film captures a global audience, such as "Run Lola
Run," on which the then-unknown Tykwer spent only $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Small art-house films from Germany still find a market abroad
among intellectual audiences that accept subtitles. But the German
financing system makes it difficult for an independent filmmaker to
dare to challenge Hollywood in epic presentations without the backing
of a major U.S. studio.</TE>
<TE>   "As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me" is a sweeping attempt by the
fledgling Cascadeur Productions in Munich to tell the true story of a
World War II German POW's escape across the breadth of Siberia. It
was filmed on location during a grueling and expensive 124-day shoot.</TE>
<TE>   But the film failed to sway Berlinale selection judges to include
it even in the special German national sector, a 10-film festival
within the overall festival, created this year. Producer Jimmy C.
Gerum attributes the omission to a residual taboo in presenting any
German of that era as a victim, while others in the industry say the
film, although successful at recent festivals, doesn't measure up to
the quality and emotion of that Hollywood-dominated genre.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Borrowing Off Sharply in December</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Americans let their credit cards cool off in December and cut back on
borrowing by the largest amount in 11 years.</LD>
<LD>   The retrenchment came after a record increase in personal debt in
November as zero-interest-rate financing offers spurred a big rise in
auto loans.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Reserve reported Thursday that consumer credit fell by
a seasonally adjusted $5.1 billion in December, or at a 3.7% annual
rate.</LD>
<TE>   The dollar decrease was the biggest since December 1990, when
borrowing fell by $5.8 billion. The percentage decrease matched the
rate of decline registered in October 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The pullback in December reflected a big drop in demand for
revolving credit, such as that used for credit cards. Demand for
revolving credit fell by a record $8.2 billion, or at an annual rate
of 14.2% in December. That compared with an increase of $5.5 billion
and a growth rate of 9.7% in November.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed said the dollar decrease in revolving credit was the
biggest since it began keeping records in 1943. The rate of decline
was the steepest since a 15.7% rate in January 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for nonrevolving credit, including new cars and vacations,
rose by $3.1 billion in December, or at an annual rate of 3.9%. That
followed a whopping $14.6-billion increase, or a 18.5% growth rate,
in November.</TE>
<TE>   In November, total consumer borrowing rose by a record $20.1
billion, or at a 14.8% rate.</TE>
<TE>   Worries about job security and a volatile stock market played a
role in getting consumers to trim their overall credit use in
December.</TE>

<HD>Irish Bank Prods Fraud Probe</HD>

<LD>Allied Irish Banks said Thursday that it would centralize currency
trading operations and appoint an "eminent person" from the financial
industry to investigate how internal safeguards failed to stop an
employee at its U.S. subsidiary from secretly losing $750 million.</LD>
<LD>   Ireland's largest bank also postponed a $365-million bond sale
planned for this week, after Wednesday's disclosure that a trader
lost $750 million at its Allfirst Bank in Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   Allied Irish has alleged that John M. Rusnak, part of Allfirst
Bank's foreign currency trading section, piled up the losses last
year. No charges have been filed against Rusnak, 37, but he and four
unidentified employees in Allfirst's treasury operations remained
suspended Thursday amid investigations by the FBI and regulators.</LD>
<TE>   Rusnak's lawyer, Bruce Lamdin, did not return calls but earlier
told The Times that estimates of losses may be "grossly exaggerated."
Allied Irish, however, said in a statement after a crisis meeting
Thursday that the bank board has reaffirmed the $750-million loss.</TE>
<TE>   With some analysts describing Allied Irish as a takeover target,
the stock rose $1.19 to $20.96 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Bigger Than Bioterror</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>No one wants to die of anthrax or smallpox or any disease cooked up
in a lab by some sociopath. But as the threat of terrorism joins
earthquakes and hurricanes as a part of the nation's ever-present
background anxiety, people are going to remember that complications
of childbirth, or cancer, can leave a person no less dead. Then they
probably will look askance at President Bush's new budget, which
showers public health officials with a whopping $11 billion over the
next two years to protect against bioterrorism while depriving them
of money to offer basic medical services to the nation's poor.</LD>
<LD>   Polls show that Americans consider health care to be a critically
important election issue. Congress should take note and press Bush to
move some of the money from the crucial task of fighting bioterrorism
to the equally imperative job of bolstering a health system that
effectively fights the diseases already undermining public well-being
and morale. If the president resists, legislators will need to take
the initiative.</LD>
<TE>   For starters, they should reverse his proposed cutbacks of $57
million from the money the Centers for Disease Control now get to
prevent chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes. They should also
add money to help states with the soaring costs of Medicaid coverage
for the poor and to roll back the  $184 million in cutbacks the
administration proposes next year for California hospitals serving
low-income individuals and the uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   To understand where Bush's apparently sincere thinking on this
subject goes off course, consider how he unveiled his plan. He had
just toured a university hospital's computerized biodefense network.
The network is a way to track patterns in hospital databases--an
outbreak of rashes or respiratory distress, say--that might signify a
bioterrorist attack. Bush predicted that such systems, which he
wisely wants to fund, will become as indispensable in detecting such
assaults as the radar-based "distant early warning" system was at
sounding the alarm about approaching Soviet aircraft during the Cold
War. What was apparently lost on him was that the urban hospitals
that serve the most people in America are so broke and behind the
times they still keep patient records in file cabinets.</TE>
<TE>   Bush won't be able to win the war against terrorism with high-tech
devices alone. He will need to invest not only in next-generation
computers but also on old-fashioned outreach like well-staffed
community health clinics. In addition, he will need to begin
seriously grappling with health care costs, which are now soaring at
10 times the overall inflation rate. The current Bush budget doesn't
acknowledge, much less address, the cost problem.</TE>
<TE>   Health care is a vital area where Bush could put his commitment to
compassionate conservatism to the test. One reason Bill Clinton beat
Bush's father in 1992 was because the challenger made health care a
cornerstone of his campaign. Given the younger Bush's great
popularity, he has an opportunity to do something Clinton couldn't
pull off--create a health care system that is conservative in
controlling costs and compassionate in guaranteeing that even the
poor will receive at least a measure of good care.</TE>

<LD>The 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics have been dogged by
controversy: the vote-buying scandal, the subsequent shake-up of the
International Olympic Committee, bickering over drug testing
and--especially since Sept. 11--the insistence on airtight security.
Now there's a flap over NBC's decision to wrap events in
"storytelling" packages to run hours later in prime time. Delays may
be forgivable when the Games are half a world away. But in Utah? And
as for the "storytelling," the syrupy bathos of past Olympic
broadcasts was as painful as a face plant on hard ice.</LD>
<LD>   Alas, TV ratings and ad dollars reign supreme.</LD>
<LD>   Now, though, let's do our best to forget all that. With the
opening ceremony tonight, it becomes the athletes' Olympics. That
means performance, skill, effort, concentration, frustration,
victory, defeat and fun, even. It's exchanging pins with a skater
from Russia or a ski racer from Slovakia, swapping e-mail addresses
and learning to say "Good luck" in Swedish or Japanese.</LD>
<TE>   Athletes have been pointing toward this moment since childhood,
and these Olympics will be the biggest of all: 2,654 athletes from 80
countries, 477 medals in 15 sports, hundreds of thousands of
visitors. Salt Lake City is a marvelous setting with its backdrop of
the Wasatch Range.</TE>
<TE>   Security, of course, is extraordinary and may cause massive people
and traffic jams. We may never know whether this is overkill. If a
terrorist attack occurs, we'll know instantly that it was anything
but.</TE>
<TE>   We must hope that the only drama comes on the ice and snow--and
there's always plenty there. Who would have thought that Hermann
Maier could recover from his spectacular crash in the downhill at
Nagano to win gold in the super-giant slalom? Or that Nancy Kerrigan
would rebound from the vicious whack on her knee to come within a
whisper of gold at Lillehammer? Or that Andrea Mead Lawrence could
win the slalom in Oslo in 1952 after falling on her first run and
losing precious seconds?</TE>
<TE>   There are favorites this year, of course. Many pick Michelle Kwan
to finally win a gold. Apolo Anton Ohno of Seattle may have a lock in
short-track speedskating. Austrian Maier isn't here because of a
motorcycle accident, but teammate Stephan Eberharter is likely to win
the men's downhill. Everyone's pulling for Picabo Street.</TE>
<TE>   The magic is that even with all the slick, unwelcome television
packaging, no one knows how any event will unfold. Unless, of course,
they live on the West Coast and can't see the Games in real time. But
a great downhill run or slap shot can't be extinguished by  delay.
Nor can the Olympic spirit.</TE>

<LD>Anew and hopeful private-public conservation partnership has quietly
developed out of sight in south-central Colorado, not unlike the
immense underground aquifer it's designed to protect. And while the
splashy Olympics, each day's overheated political rhetoric and Niles'
marriage proposal on "Fraser" are all very important doings, the
positive lessons buried in the wild San Luis Valley have more
long-term implications for American life. When's the last time, for
instance, you heard local folks--especially rural Western local
folks--supporting more federal land ownership and a new national
park?</LD>
<TE>   This complex land transfer will take a few years to consummate.
But using its familiar collaborative approach, here's what the Nature
Conservancy in Colorado has done so far, working with local citizens,
local officials, the governor, two senators, a representative, a
local water district and two Interior secretaries from different
parties: sign a $31.28-million agreement to purchase the
151-square-mile Baca Ranch, 140 miles southwest of Denver, now the
largest land preservation project in Colorado history. If everything
unfolds properly, in 2005 the land that covers the valley bottom,
vast sand dunes and towering mountain peaks will become the 58th
national park, a new wildlife refuge and additional national forest
acreage. This would preserve a prime underground water system now
threatened with commercial exploitation.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Congress has appropriated $10 million and created the
Great Sand Dunes National Park pending the final sale.</TE>
<TE>   Assembling diverse coalitions and emphasizing what they agree on
has been a familiar operating theme in the conservancy's successful
projects, which have protected more than 12 million acres nationally,
often by acquiring land and tacking it on to existing parks or
forests. In terms of dollars and involved parties, the Colorado deal
is one of the group's largest efforts, a growing scale its leaders
see as ever more necessary for 21st century conservation to have a
practical impact against rampant development.</TE>
<TE>   Obstacles remain. Current owners must resolve internal legal
disputes. Congress must appropriate $21 million more. But elected
officials seem united. And one owner, Yale University, vows to donate
its profit back to the conservancy. It seems so simple to note how
much progress can be made when clever confrontation is not the goal,
just patiently rowing in the same direction, together.</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P May Lower Gap's Credit Ratings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Standard &amp; Poor's on Thursday warned that it may downgrade Gap Inc.'s
credit and debt ratings after the nation's largest apparel chain
reported a 16% drop in January sales at stores open at least one
year.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts had expected Gap to report a decline of 10% to 15% in
same-store sales. Gap's poor showing came in a month when overall
retail sales rose to their highest level in nearly two years. The
sales decline was the 23rd in a row for Gap.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, analysts said Gap could lose more business with its new
merchandise return policy.</LD>
<TE>   As of Monday, patrons of the company's Old Navy stores who don't
have a receipt for a shirt, for instance, can exchange it only for
another color or size, not a pair of khakis. At Banana Republic, no
receipt now means no return.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, they should be happy just to get anybody to walk
into a store," said analyst Marty Bukoll of Northern Trust Corp.,
which owned 3.3 million Gap shares as of September. "What they need
to do is make their customers happy, not irritate them."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based Gap, on Thursday also reaffirmed its
expectation that it would post a loss of 3 cents to 5 cents a share
for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sunday, its first back-to-back
quarterly loss in 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said it planned to cut capital spending by 60%
this year from last year to about $400 million. It had expected to
spend $600 million to $650 million for the year.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P said it was reviewing Gap's BBB-plus senior unsecured debt
rating, its third-lowest investment grade, and its A-2 commercial
paper rating, its second-lowest.</TE>
<TE>   "The Gap may not be able to adequately turn around its flagging
sales and earnings at Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores," S&amp;P
said.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P's move follows a Jan. 14 downgrade by Moody's Investors
Service of its equivalent ratings to Baa3 and Prime-3, which are just
one notch above "junk" status. Moody's warned it may cut those
ratings again.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P said it expects Gap to post some improvement this year, but
that the announcement showed "its merchandise margins continue to
suffer from lower markdown margins and higher sales at markdown on a
year-over-year basis."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it said that over the near term, Gap "has very good
financial flexibility." The company said it expects to end its fourth
quarter with $800 million in cash and $2 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Gap shares, which have fallen 56% in the last year, closed up 20
cents at $13.10 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Hahn and Parks Part Ways on a Second Term</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Hahn Explains Stance on Chief; Many Express Anger," Feb. 6: It
was inappropriate for Mayor James Hahn to announce his opinion when
we have a Police Commission--which he appointed--and a charter
procedure to determine the choice.</LD>
<LD>   Further, why criticize Chief Bernard Parks for the disciplinary
measures he instituted while acknowledging the existent problems in
the Los Angeles Police Department? The decision should be based on
merit, not racial issues, which make media comments attributed to
members of the black community referring to "being betrayed" seem
inappropriate.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Earle</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Things not spoken about the LAPD:</TE>
<TE>   1. Attrition among officers: Suburbs use the LAPD to avoid the
cost of training their own.</TE>
<TE>   2. Officers' "low morale" is directly related to their transition
from an unfettered do-as-you-please history under
Parker-Reddin-Gates. Those officers don't live in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   3. Look at the race of the complainers and those leaving the
department.</TE>
<TE>   4. Recognize the obvious: Police officers ought to be residents of
the city in which they "protect and serve." Add this requirement and
watch the department improve, citizen complaints diminish and the
"intractable" problems disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell Williams</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although I am not African American, I am seriously disappointed in
Mayor Hahn's refusal to back Chief Parks for a second term. This will
be the second [African American] police chief of L.A. to be toppled
in a row, sending the message everywhere that Angelenos are not so
ready for multiculturalism as they like to think.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Maupin</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chief Parks should not have asked for a second five-year term as
LAPD chief. Mayor Hahn told Parks that he would not support a second
term before Parks announced that he wanted a second term (Feb. 5).</TE>
<TE>   No matter the outcome of this political fight, Parks loses because
his career advancement or non- advancement is tinged with politics
and scandal. Parks should have followed Hahn's suggestion that he
take credit for improvements and retire.</TE>

<HD>Remembering Baxter Ward</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I first met Baxter Ward when I was a high school student during his
first campaign for supervisor. As you noted in "Baxter Ward, 82;
Political Maverick" (obituary, Feb. 5), his memory and attention to
detail were exceptional. He cared deeply about civic responsibility
and public service and reminded me of my high school government
teacher.</LD>
<LD>   It is certainly true that Ward believed large campaign
contributions corrupted government. This was particularly true, he
believed, with the Board of Supervisors because of the "invisible"
nature of the institution. This view was, and still is, shared by
many.</LD>
<LD>   One interesting note that you didn't mention. During his 1972
campaign, Ward vigorously spoke out against the use of punch-card
ballots. He coined the term "hanging chads." After considering the
matter very carefully, he once told me that someday elections would

<LD>Re "Greenest Games Ever? Not!" Opinion, Feb. 3: I remember how much
fun it was working at the 1960 Squaw Valley Olympics before things
got out of hand. Here is my plan to save the Olympic Games.</LD>
<LD>   Both the Summer and Winter Games would be divided into three
categories and staged consecutively at three different host
countries. This would improve logistics, security and manageability,
shift the focus back to the athletes and bring back the Olympic
spirit. The three categories would be:</LD>
<LD>   1. Sports: volleyball, tennis, hockey, baseball, etc.</LD>
<TE>   2. Competition: track &amp; field, races, weightlifting, etc.</TE>
<TE>   3. Performance: diving, gymnastics, ice skating, anything decided
by judges or involving horses, guns or kayaks.</TE>
<TE>   The categories are designed so the Olympic Committee can balance
the number of competitors at each site.</TE>

<HD>Davis' Abortion Ads Are Hit and Miss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Davis Ads Have Riordan on Defensive Over Abortion Issue" (Feb. 5)
you state that "another part of the [Gov. Gray] Davis strategy in
using abortion against [Richard] Riordan is its potential to rile
both sides." From a strongly pro-life perspective, I am angry--not at
Riordan but at the Davis camp for the mean-spirited, biased
characterization of Riordan in its TV ad.</LD>
<LD>   It is a fallacy that if one is pro-choice, he or she must, of
necessity, support abortion. Riordan is not untrustworthy. His stance
is most practical. He is a Christian who believes that the life of
the unborn takes precedence over a woman's convenience. But he
intends to govern the people from where they are in their beliefs and
desires. He does not want to make a legal criminal of those who will
be traumatized enough if they choose the abortion route.</LD>
<LD>   Genie Kiser</LD>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I wish that we could make abortion a nonissue, once and for all,
during political campaigns. Although I have yet to decide for whom I
will vote in the upcoming election, Riordon has already stated, ''I
respect and support the right of a woman to make her own choices with
respect to her body.''</TE>
<TE>   Abortion is the law of the land and no governor or any other
politician of this state or any other is going to change that fact.
Let all candidates put this divisive issue aside and concentrate on
the more pressing matters at hand, such as the economy, the
environment, universal health care, education, immigrant rights and
the many other issues that affect those of us who are already born.</TE>
<TE>   John Tyrey</TE>
<TE>   Maywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's a shame that a good man like Riordan feels he has to hide his
true feelings on this issue in order to get elected. By doing so, he
fails to differentiate himself from Davis. I would have more respect
for Riordan's integrity if he would say what he really means, which I
suspect is that he personally opposes abortion but would enforce the
law as it stands. He should stop trying to make us believe that he
has altered his fundamental position on such a basic issue.</TE>

<LD>I just passed a dumpster alongside the 405 Freeway. It had a huge
American flag painted on its huge side. Alongside me on the freeway
drove cars with tattered, dirty flags fluttering. On the 10 Freeway
was a cement mixer rolling along, rotating, with Old Glory revolving
on its side. Back home, the neighbors proudly fly the Stars and
Stripes day and night, in the rain or whatever. A few flags show up
backward. I even saw one hanging from the back bumper of a truck,
spattered with mud.</LD>

<LD>Re "Unlikely Note Is Struck on World Financial Stage," Feb. 3: At the
World Economic Forum Bill Gates, U2's Bono and others urged Treasury
Secretary Paul O'Neill to push for a substantial increase in U.S.
foreign aid. O'Neill responded that we have "precious little to show"
for past aid programs.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill is correct that there have been abuses and that the U.S.
should not throw money down a rat hole. However, food, medicine,
economic infrastructure and democratic reforms are as essential to
winning the terrorism war as apprehending terrorists and preventing
future terrorist acts by Bin Laden and his cohorts. Polls taken prior
to Sept. 11 show most Americans favor a substantial increase in
foreign aid.</LD>
<LD>   We could keep nonperformance to an acceptably low level. O'Neill
could prepare a new foreign aid program featuring contracts calling
for reviewable performance by donor and recipient.</LD>
<TE>   Donald E. Mueller</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gates, Bono and O'Neill make an interesting trio. Let's hope that
not only billionaires and rock stars are concerned about what is
arguably the most important long-term strategic and humanitarian
problem facing the world. This is typified by the 10 million children
under 5 years old dying each year from largely preventable hunger and
disease, and by the 17,000 of all ages dying each day from
tuberculosis, AIDS and malaria.</TE>
<TE>   For less than an additional dime a day from each person in the
industrialized countries, many additional millions of lives could be
saved each year. Let's further hope that such millions will not die
just because our otherwise seemingly knowledgeable Treasury secretary
hasn't done his homework.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Miller</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This tapped-out taxpayer is sick of calls from billionaire Gates
and mega-millionaire Bono for increases in U.S. foreign aid. Who do
these well-heeled, holier-than-thou nags think ultimately ends up
footing the bill for debt forgiveness plans and "welfare for the
world" giveaways? Every middle-class, wage-slave working stiff who
thinks America already throws away too much money on other countries,
that's who.</TE>
<TE>   Whether here or abroad, charity should be a matter of one's
personal conscience, not a public concern. Gates, Bono and other
lap-of-luxury liberals are welcome to dispose of their assets in
whatever manner they see fit. They--and the U.S. government--should
allow the rest of us the same privilege.</TE>

14 vehicles had paid admission to the national forest and were

<LD>Re "Defense Increase Biggest Since '66," Feb. 5: The Bush
administration is determined to frighten the American people by
constantly speaking of the dangers of terrorism. The reason for this
is to justify the huge amount of money it wants to spend on defense.
There is political gain for the Bush administration and gain for the
corporations that profit from war. I hope their "words of mass
destruction" will be shown to be an exaggeration.</LD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. and the Justice Department asked a federal judge
Thursday to condense a fairness hearing on their controversial
antitrust settlement to a single day and bar competitors from
speaking.</LD>
<LD>   In a joint filing, the two sides said the federal court weighing
the proposed resolution of the case has more than enough written
commentary--an unprecedented 10,000 pages.</LD>
<LD>   About 30,000 people submitted comments to the Justice Department
during the prescribed 60-day period, ranging from detailed 100-page
analyses to such terse statements as "I hate Microsoft."</LD>
<TE>   The substantive comments ran 2 to 1 against the deal, according to
Thursday's filing. Among other things, the settlement would forbid
Microsoft retaliating against companies that install non-Microsoft
programs on personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   California and eight other states oppose the deal and will push at
a March trial for harsher remedies, including publication of the
source code for Microsoft's now-dominant Web browser.</TE>
<TE>   The new filing asks that only the states supporting the
agreement--not private companies--be permitted to debate the proposed
settlement at the fairness hearing, which could come in early March.</TE>
<TE>   "A large number of highly interested and motivated third parties
have taken full advantage of the opportunity to submit extensive
comments" in writing, Microsoft and Justice Department attorneys
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed restrictions on the fairness hearing drew immediate
fire from some of the deal's critics, who say it fails to punish
Microsoft for what courts have determined was illegal abuse of its
monopoly power over the operating system software in PCs.</TE>
<TE>   "To fairly determine whether the proposed settlement is in the
public interest, the judge needs to learn as much as possible from
those who would have to live with it--the consumers, software
developers, and equipment manufacturers," said Mark Cooper, research
director of the Consumer Federation of America.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly has wide latitude in
determining how extensive the fairness hearing should be, or if there
should even be one.</TE>
<TE>   "In the super-majority of instances, the court votes a settlement
up or down based on the written record," said Washington antitrust
lawyer Keith Shugarman. But the wide interest in and ramifications of
the Microsoft case make it more likely that the hearing could be
extended.</TE>
<TE>   California, Iowa and Connecticut declined to comment on the
fairness hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're focused on our remedies case," said California attorney
general spokeswoman Sandra Michioku.</TE>

<HD>Many Retailers Wrap Up Big January Sales Figures</HD>
<DH>Economy: It was the best month in two years, but analysts
caution that implications are unclear.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumers gave retailers their best month in two years in January,
snapping up sale items and buying more than ever at the nation's
largest discount stores, according to analyst and company reports
released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. achieved a crowning milestone: It has
officially become the world's largest company based on sales, passing
Exxon Mobil Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Same-store sales, or sales from stores open at least a year, rose
3.4% overall compared with January 2001, according to the Goldman
Sachs tally of retail chain stores. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, using
weighted sales figures from 72 retailers, said sales rose 5.1%,
beating the bank's forecast of a 3% gain. It was the strongest sales
pace since April 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Some analysts cautioned that it was too early to tell whether the
reports were solid enough to foretell a turnaround in the economy,
but said they were reassured things are not worsening.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales are considered an important measure of a firm's
overall health because the number excludes new and closed stores.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of strong January sales, Wal-Mart and Target Corp.
said they expected to beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates. But
struggling Gap Inc. posted another decline in same-store sales.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart posted an 8.6% gain in same-store sales compared with
last year, more than double the low end of the firm's sales target.
Sales in the fiscal year ended Jan.31 were about $218 billion,
topping Exxon Mobil's $212.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Target reported a 7.6% gain in the company's namesake stores open
at least a year, for a total sales increase of 5.8%, including the
company's Mervyn's and Marshall Field's department stores.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street darling Kohl's Corp., a discount chain set to open
several stores in Southern California next year, reported a
same-store sales gain of 11.5%.</TE>
<TE>   "Kohl's is simply knocking the cover off the ball," said Kevin
Tawes, senior vice president of Independence Investment in Boston.
"They snatched up--at bargain prices--inventory that department
stores turned back. They then got it into their stores at the right
price and consumers came in droves."</TE>
<TE>   Warehouse club chains were standouts in January, particularly
Costco Wholesale Corp., which had a 7% rise in same-store sales.</TE>
<TE>   Typically a clearance period for most retailers, January sales can
be deceptive as stores that had strong sales of full-price
merchandise in December are left with little to compete in the way of
markdowns. That could mean low January sales numbers but
better-than-expected December profits.</TE>
<TE>   "January is a real tough month to gauge and truthfully it doesn't
mean a whole heck of a lot to retailers," said Eric Beder, an analyst
with Ladenberg, Thalmann &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Even department stores did better than expected in January, though
most reported sales dips.</TE>
<TE>   Federated Department Stores Inc., parent of Macy's and
Bloomingdale's, said sales fell 8.8%. May Department Stores Co. said
same-store sales slumped 10.7%.</TE>
<TE>   But some specialty retailers, such as women's clothing chain
AnnTaylor Stores Corp., bucked the trend of weak apparel sales.</TE>
<TE>   AnnTaylor boosted its fourth-quarter earnings outlook and said
January same-store sales rose 14.6%. The company's stock surged $2.86
to $40.94 in New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow apparel seller Limited Inc. reported a 6% sales increase.</TE>
<TE>   Gap, however, continued to suffer, with its 23rd month of
declining same-store sales. Sales fell 16% in January, worse than
analyst estimates of a 10% to 15% drop.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said same-store sales fell 22% at Gap, 14% at Old Navy
stores and 7% at Banana Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Gap, which earlier reported a loss of 6 cents in the third
quarter, said it expects to post a fourth-quarter loss of 3 cents to
5 cents a share. The third-quarter loss was the company's first
quarterly loss in at least 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Gap stock Thursday rose 20 cents to $13.10 on the NYSE. Target
lost 50 cents to close at $42, Wal-Mart fell 49 cents to $58.39 and
Kohl's gained 12 cents to $67.20, all also on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Providian Posts $395.3-Million Loss in 4th Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>By Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Credit card issuer Providian Financial Corp. on Thursday reported a
$395.3-million loss in the fourth quarter, including almost $1
billion in charges and additional reserves as it was hit by rising
loan defaults.</LD>
<LD>   The loss for Providian, which lends to people with spotty credit
records, amounted to $1.39 a share after additions to loss reserves
and charges. That contrasted with a profit of $225.1 million, or 76
cents, in the year-ago quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The company also said banking regulators have accepted its capital
plan, which includes the sale of proceeds from $8.2 billion in credit
card loans to J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</LD>
<TE>   Providian had postponed releasing results hours before they
originally were due on Jan. 31, saying it was working out the final
components of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which in November was prohibited by regulators from
taking on new customers with short or poor credit histories, has been
cutting jobs and looking to unload parts of its card portfolio in an
effort to boost results.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotten our arms around the loss situation," Chief Executive
Joseph Saunders told investors on a conference call. "I believe that
we have turned the corner and the company is on an appropriate
trajectory to an acceptable earnings level."</TE>
<TE>   Providian's latest results included the addition of $252 million
for loan-loss reserves and several other charges.</TE>
<TE>   "They threw everything into it," said Matthew Park, an analyst at
Thomas Weisel Partners. "They put aside a lot of money to reserves,
in the anticipation of further deterioration in credit quality. But I
think it was encouraging regulators approved this set of charges and
their plan to grow."</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street had expected Providian to earn between a profit of 10
cents a share and a loss of 51 cents a share, with a mean estimated
loss of 6 cents, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Providian shares closed off 33 cents at $3.46 on the New York
Stock Exchange, before the results were released. Providian stock was
the worst performer in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index last year,
falling 94%.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of 2000, Providian was worth $16.3 billion on the stock
market. It has a market value of $985 million now.</TE>
<TE>   Other earnings from California companies, excluding one-time
items:</TE>
<TE>   * Engineering and construction firm Fluor Corp. reported
fourth-quarter net income of $28.5 million, or 36 cents a share,
including a $10.2-million charge stemming from the retirement of
Chairman and Chief Executive Philip Carroll and Vice Chairman Jim
Stein.</TE>
<TE>   The company's earnings from continued operations were $31.4
million, or 39 cents a share, on revenue of $2.6 billion. Analysts
had expected 40 cents on average, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The Aliso Viejo company, which changed its fiscal year end to Dec.
31 from Oct. 31, declined to provide comparable year-ago results.</TE>

<HD>Albertson's Expands Its Online Service</HD>
<DH>Internet: National supermarket chain offers Web grocery
shopping throughout the Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Supermarket giant Albertson's Inc. said this week it has expanded its
online grocery delivery service into Los Angeles, Orange and
Riverside counties, using a strategy it said won't incur the losses
racked up by its dot-com predecessors.</LD>
<LD>   Albertson's becomes the first national supermarket chain to offer
Web grocery shopping throughout the Southland, having already
launched the service in San Diego and the Seattle area. It also is
one of the few companies still remaining in online grocery delivery,
after the demise of Webvan.</LD>
<LD>   Traditional supermarkets, analysts say, have the best chance of
making the service work, because they can use clerks to pick
groceries and don't need to build a network of expensive warehouses.</LD>
<TE>   ''They have finally found a model that isn't going to cost them so
much money it will kill them,'' said Ken Cassar, senior analyst with
Jupiter Media Metrix.</TE>
<TE>   A string of dot-coms went belly up last year, leaving a handful of
small regional companies still delivering food. One of them is Aliso
Viejo-based WhyRunOut.com, which delivers food from Stater Bros.
Markets to customers in Orange County and liquor and sandwiches
through its sister Pink Dot company in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Albertson's, Cassar said, has taken the smart move of contracting
with WhyRunOut to deliver its groceries rather than investing
millions in trucks and drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Online grocers have said before that delivering in Southern
California is a risky proposition because affluent customers who use
the service are spread over a wider geographic area than other
markets. There are also more supermarkets per capita here, and the
region's mild weather makes shoppers more willing to leave home for
groceries.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Albertson's executives said, their lower overhead can make
this market work. Time-strapped customers, they said, will pay a fee
just to avoid walking crowded grocery aisles and standing in line.</TE>
<TE>   Customers can order from the Albertsons.com Web site and pay with
a credit card. Special clerks, or ''personal shoppers,'' at
participating local stores pick out groceries and store them in totes
at the back of the store. The prices are the same as those found in
circulars and at their local store.</TE>
<TE>   They can either pick up the groceries, or have them delivered.
Orders placed before 10 a.m. can be picked up or delivered after 5
p.m. Orders placed after that time are available the next day. Fees
for the service range from $5.95 for pick-up to $9.99 for delivery.</TE>
<TE>   Although these fees will sound expensive to all but the most
affluent customers, Cassar said, they don't come close to covering
Albertson's' costs, including the labor and cost of contracting out
delivery. Albertson's executives said they can make up the difference
by selling more items, and selling more of higher-margin items such
as produce, meat and gourmet foods.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, the executives said, Internet purchases are larger than
those in stores. "In San Diego it's been very successful," said Dave
Simonson, president of Albertson's Southern California division</TE>
<TE>   Rival Safeway Inc. only offers the service in Oregon and has not
yet disclosed any new target markets. Kroger Co. said it is still
struggling to come up with a profitable model.</TE>
<TE>   Albertson's shares were up 31 cents at $29.09 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Stock Slump Persists for 5th Day Amid Accounting Fears</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Indexes ease on shaky investor confidence,
marking the longest losing streak since Sept. 21. Gold futures
briefly rise above $300 an ounce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks slumped for a fifth session Thursday, marking the longest
losing streak for broad market indexes since the week trading resumed
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Fears of more corporate accounting scandals continued to weigh
heavily on investors, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   In other trading, gold futures prices briefly rose above $300 an
ounce for the first time in two years, as some investors apparently
sought refuge from troubled markets.</LD>
<TE>   On Wall Street, the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 3.34
points, or 0.3%, to 1,080.17, the lowest close since Oct. 31. The S&amp;P
has slumped 4.4% during the last five sessions.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index dropped 30.60 points, or 1.7%, to
1,782.11, extending its decline during the last five sessions to
7.9%. The index is at its lowest since Nov. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow industrial average fell 27.95 points, or 0.3%, to
9,625.44. It has lost 3% in the last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow dropped for six straight sessions early in January, but
the broader market had not lost ground for five sessions since Sept.
17-21, as trading reopened after the attacks. The sell-off that week
clipped 14.3% off the Dow and 16.1% off the Nasdaq index.</TE>
<TE>   The market then rallied sharply in the fourth quarter, amid
growing hopes for an economic recovery in 2002. Now, even as a
recovery seems more likely, the market's confidence has been dented
by the Enron debacle and fears that many firms in recent years used
aggressive accounting to artificially inflate earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, there's been a real shaking of investor confidence ...
with regard to these accounting and regulatory issues," said Joseph
Keating, money manager at AmSouth Asset Management. "I think the
economy is recovering....But until this crisis of confidence passes,
it's going to be very hard for the market to hold any gain."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, stocks rallied in the late morning, sold off at
midday, rallied again in the afternoon, then sold off in the final
hour.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 17 to 14 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 now is 11.8% above its three-year closing low reached
Sept. 21. Falling through that mark could shake Wall Street, some
analysts say. The Nasdaq index is 25% above its Sept. 21 close, and
the Dow is 17% above its close that day.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Nasdaq was led lower by Cisco Systems, which fell
$1.55, or 8.3%, to $17.06 after the networking giant gave a guarded
financial forecast for the near term.</TE>
<TE>   Other weak tech stocks included Broadcom, down $3.08 to $36.92;
IBM, down $2.72 to $103.91; and KLA Tencor, off $4.49 to $54.41.</TE>
<TE>   Drug firm Elan fell 51 cents to $13.49, a 52-week low. After the
market closed, the company said the Securities and Exchange
Commission has launched an investigation of the firm related to
allegations of misleading accounting.</TE>
<TE>   But some stocks recently battered by accounting concerns attracted
buyers Thursday, including Tyco, up $2.13 to $28.05, and Cendant, up
45 cents to $16.02.</TE>
<TE>   Many bank stocks edged higher after sliding in recent sessions on
concerns about troubled loans. Citigroup added 14 cents to $44.14 and
J.P. Morgan Chase rose 63 cents to $30.07.</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper stocks rallied after investment firm Dresdner Kleinworst
Wasserstein raised several of the stocks to "buy," including Gannett,
up $2.49 to $69, and Dow Jones, up $1.23 to $53.29.</TE>
<TE>   Gold mining stocks were strong as near-term gold futures prices in
New York rose as high as $301.50 an ounce, a two-year high. The price
then slipped back to close up $2.20 at $299.70.</TE>
<TE>   Among gold firms, Placer Dome jumped 98 cents to $13.38, Goldcorp
gained 92 cents to $16.22 and Barrick Gold was up 81 cents to $18.77.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's Nikkei 225 index rallied 1.7% to 9,583.27 after falling in
six of the seven previous sessions.</TE>

<HD>Pixar Profit Down 63% Despite 'Monster' Success</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FREDERICK M. MUIR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pixar Animation Studios said its net income fell 63% in the fourth
quarter, despite the hugely successful release of its fourth animated
feature film, "Monsters, Inc."</LD>
<LD>   The computer animation firm headed by Apple Computer Inc.
co-founder Steve Jobs reported that most of the revenue and income
from "Monsters, Inc.," which has grossed more than $250 million
domestically since its November release, will be recognized in later
quarters.</LD>
<LD>   In the fourth quarter Pixar reported net income of $13 million, or
25 cents a share, compared with $35.2 million, or 71 cents, a year
earlier when profit was driven by the video release of "Toy Story 2."
Revenue in the latest quarter fell 66% to $26.1 million from $75.7
million.</LD>
<TE>   For 2001, Pixar's profit fell to $36.2 million, or 71 cents a
share, from $78.4 million, or $1.57 a share, a year earlier when
nearly all of the domestic and international theatrical receipts and
merchandise revenue of "Toy Story 2" were recognized. The company's
full-year revenue dropped to $70.2 million, from $172.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Pixar typically reports significant swings in its financial
results because they are tied almost entirely to new releases of
films or videos. The quarterly and full-year results beat Wall Street
analyst projections.</TE>
<TE>   "'Monsters, Inc.' was a monster hit in the U.S., and we look
forward to continued success as its international roll-outs kick into
high gear this quarter," Jobs said.</TE>
<TE>   The film's international box office receipts have topped $55
million, and Jobs said that he hopes the film's overseas performance
will equal its domestic gross.</TE>
<TE>   Jobs forecast that Pixar's 2002 net income would jump about 50% to
about $1 to $1.20 a share.</TE>
<TE>   The company splits the production costs of its films with Walt
Disney Co., which also distributes the movies and shares equally in
revenue and profit.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies have a seven-picture deal. The partners have
launched four successful films in a row, and Jobs said he has high
hopes for the summer 2003 release of its fifth film, "Finding Nemo."</TE>
<TE>   "We're four-for-four," said Jobs. "We want to be five-for-five.
That's what we are focused on."</TE>
<TE>   Pixar shares fell 75 cents to $30.67 on Nasdaq, but rose as high
as $32 in after-hours trading after the release of its earnings
results.</TE>

<HD>Valenti Says He's Against Tariffs</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Film industry's chief lobbyist tells
Canadians he supports tax credits to keep production in U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Motion Picture Assn. of America Chief Executive Jack Valenti told
Canadian film and television producers Thursday that he opposes
American tariffs to combat a surge in Canadian film productions
because of generous tax credits and lower labor costs.</LD>
<LD>   But Valenti added that he and others are lobbying Congress to pass
tax credit legislation to encourage film and TV productions to stay
in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   "Tariffs, duties, quotas and other artificial trade barriers which
interfere with marketplace competition are wrong," Valenti told
members of the Canadian Film and Television Production Assn. in
Ottawa. "They cause fiscal mischief to no one's gain."</LD>
<TE>   Valenti represents Hollywood's largest studios, and his remarks
were designed to mollify Canadians who have been anxious about
efforts by Hollywood groups to get the U.S. government to investigate
whether Canada's film tax credits violate free-trade treaties. Such a
lobbying effort, which has lost steam in recent weeks, could lead to
taxes on films and TV shows shot in Canada and then released in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like [Valenti] is up there promoting a trade war by
calling for U.S. subsidies for his clients. Under his plan, the
studios get more money," said Brent Swift, president of the Film and
Television Action Committee, a group of mostly displaced industry
workers that last month withdrew its request for a U.S. Commerce
Department investigation of the Canadian subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Swift's group has hired a lawyer and plans to resubmit its
petition, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Runaway production has been a growing concern among the working
class of Hollywood. Last month, Gov. Gray Davis proposed a tax credit
on wages to dissuade film and TV productions from moving out of
state. Davis proposed a 15% tax credit on the first $25,000 earned by
workers on lower-budget productions, but his proposal does not have
widespread support in the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, more than $3.3 billion was spent on film and television
production in Canada, an increase of 9% from the previous year,
according to a new report by the Canadian Film and Television
Production Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Of that, nearly $1.4 billion were foreign productions, largely
from Hollywood. Though the Canadian industry has experienced a dip in
the number of feature films, television dramas and children's
programs by Canadians, U.S. producers have more than picked up the
slack.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian industry is moving into a period of uncertainty, the
report said, because of a slowing economy and retrenchment in the
aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. The Canadian
government is phasing out lucrative tax shelters that allowed
producers to save millions on production costs.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EMI, one of the world's top music companies, pushed on with yet more
restructuring when it reorganized its labels under two global
brands--Virgin and Capitol--and streamlined its international
management.</LD>
<LD>   British-based EMI Group, whose stars include Lenny Kravitz and
Janet Jackson, said it was scrapping the "EMI" name as a label and
combining back-office operations of all its imprints as part of plans
to cut costs and improve creativity.</LD>
<LD>   The moves come two days after EMI issued its second profit warning
in six months and a week after dropping Mariah Carey from its roster
in an effort to save money.</LD>
<TE>   Music groups have been under pressure to slash costs and
restructure after one of the industry's worst years on record.</TE>

Technologies of San Carlos, Calif., for patent infringement, claiming
that Liberate violated two of its key patents.</LD>

accusations. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in San

<HD>Proposed Rules for Analysts Get Solid Marks</HD>
<DH>Securities: Praise is tempered by concerns that guidelines
fail to address underlying conflicts of interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some experts said they were pleasantly surprised by the scope of
disclosure rules proposed Thursday to govern brokerage
analysts--including a requirement that past ratings be plotted on a
stock's price chart in research reports. But they said the plan falls
short of solving the industry's inherent conflict-of-interest
problem.</LD>
<LD>   "It's better than I was expecting, and it should do a lot for
investor education," said Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the
University of Florida. "But let's face it: As long as analysts are
employed by [brokerages] there's going to be a major league conflict.
There's still an economic incentive to be friendly to corporate
management."</LD>
<LD>   The National Assn. of Securities Dealers devised the rules at the
urging of Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
have joined the debate over whether analysts are pushed to issue
glowing research reports to win and maintain lucrative investment
banking deals, such as stock underwriting.</LD>
<TE>   The New York Stock Exchange on Thursday proposed similar rules for
its member firms.</TE>
<TE>   SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt immediately urged brokerages to abide
by the proposed changes even before they are formally approved, a
process that could take two months, after the agency invites public
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the rules sought by the NASD, the industry's
self-regulatory agency, match those the Securities Industry Assn.
trade group unveiled last summer--guidelines major brokerages say
they already follow. But their adoption by the NASD and the NYSE
would give the organizations enforcement power.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD surprised some observers by telling brokerages to include
charts in research reports showing a stock's price trend and the
points along the way when an analyst recommended that investors buy,
hold or sell the stock, along with details about the firm's rating
system.</TE>
<TE>   A common complaint is that Wall Street analysts are so biased that
they often reiterate buy ratings on crumbling stocks, as with Enron
Corp. last year. Performance charts would enable investors to see how
astute an analyst's earlier calls were.</TE>
<TE>   That part of the plan, however, is likely to meet resistance, one
observer said. "As an investor I'd be interested in seeing it, but I
think broker-dealers will be averse to the idea unless they have
spectacular records," said Tom Carter, chief financial officer of
StarMine Corp. in San Francisco, which evaluates analysts'
performance.</TE>
<TE>   A proposed NASD requirement that brokerages define their stock
ratings and provide data on how commonly each rating is issued would
help individual investors who may be unable to read between the lines
of research reports, experts said. For example, a brokerage's "strong
buy" rating might indicate that a stock is expected to rise 10% more
than others in its sector during the next 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   The true meaning of a "hold" rating has long been a sore point
with brokerage critics. "Mom and Pop in Peoria might not know that
'hold' really means 'sell,'" Ritter said.</TE>
<TE>   A firm-wide breakdown of analysts' ratings might show how inflated
they can be, he said. Some observers, however, said a uniform stock
rating system across the brokerage industry might be more helpful.
Firms still use a hodgepodge of euphemisms such as "reduce,"
"accumulate" and "market perform" when rating stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "The proposal leaves a lot of room for ambiguity," said Kei
Kianpoor, chief executive of Investars.com, a New York company that
tracks analyst performance. "What about brokerages that have two
ratings on the same stock, like 'near-term hold' and 'long-term buy'?
Does that mean you should wait to buy, or buy and then wait?"</TE>
<TE>   Ritter said he was pleased by proposals for a firewall that would
prevent a firm's investment banking department from reviewing or
having veto power over analysts' research reports before publication,
and for disclosure of underwriting work done for a company "up front
in big type rather than buried in the footnotes."</TE>
<TE>   But he and others said the overriding problem--pressure on
analysts to accentuate the positive--remains. "Analysts who don't
cozy up to management [of companies they follow] will still have a
hard time getting their phone calls returned," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the NASD and NYSE proposals, analyst compensation could not
be linked directly to underwriting fees on a given deal, but bonuses
could be tied to a firm's overall underwriting success, Ritter noted.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies choosing a [brokerage] to work with on a merger deal or
a follow-on stock offering are still going to be starting from a list
of firms whose analysts put out positive reports," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Carter noted that the NASD can't regulate the behavior of
corporate executives: "I hear of CFOs who tell the analyst community
flat-out, 'Here are the numbers, here's the story and if you go out
and say something different, your firm is not going to be getting any
part of our investment banking business,'" he said.</TE>

<HD>SBC Pacific Bell Under Scrutiny</HD>
<DH> Internet: The PUC is investigating claims that customers
were overcharged for high-speed service.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Public Utilities Commission announced Thursday that it has
launched an investigation into claims that SBC Pacific Bell
overcharged customers for high-speed Internet access and billed some
customers for Internet service they never ordered.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1999, the PUC has received more than 750 complaints against
California's largest phone company. SBC Pacific Bell is a subsidiary
of Texas-based SBC Communications Inc., which provides high-speed
Internet access via digital subscriber line technology, or DSL, to
more than 1.3 million people in 13 states--about 60% of whom are in
California.</LD>
<LD>   According to consumer complaints reviewed by the PUC, SBC Pacific
Bell also charged customers for Internet services after they had been
terminated, billed customers twice for the same service and charged
customers for more than the advertised cost of some services and
products.</LD>
<TE>   John Britton, a spokesman for SBC Pacific Bell, said that many of
the complaints originated when a sister company, Advanced Solutions
Inc., took over the company's DSL service in 2000. During the
transition, some customers were incorrectly billed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed that the committee is reaching back many
months to investigate complaints that we believe, for the most part,
have been corrected," Britton said.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC, which ordered the investigation last month, is also
looking into claims that SBC Pacific Bell failed to report consumer
billing complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state's public utilities code, SBC Pacific Bell must
disclose the number of billing complaints it receives each month.
According to quarterly reports reviewed by the PUC, the company did
not disclose any complaints against its DSL unit last year.</TE>
<TE>   SBC Pacific Bell made about $24 million in billing adjustments
last year, the quarterly reports noted.</TE>
<TE>   The phone company has until Feb. 22 to provide the PUC with all
records of California billing complaints since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   SBC Pacific Bell, which has asked the PUC to approve its expansion
into the state's long-distance market, has informed the commission
that it will be filing revised reports, Britton said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're committed to making sure we follow all the rules and
regulations and get it right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC investigation follows a series of complaints against the
phone company's Internet service.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San
Diego-based consumer group, filed a similar complaint with the PUC,
alleging the company overbilled customers for DSL services. The group
also filed a lawsuit in December against the company in San Diego
Superior Court, claiming the phone company charged customers for
Prodigy Internet services they never ordered.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement of the PUC investigation came near the end of the
trading day. Shares of SBC Communications were up 61 cents to $35.10
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Patient Advocates Urge FDA Disclosure</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals:  Groups want details about decisions,
including the rejection of cancer drug Erbitux.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stung by the sudden rejection of ImClone System's highly touted
cancer drug Erbitux, patient advocacy groups have begun a push to
force the government to disclose more details about its decisions
regarding drug approvals.</LD>
<LD>   Existing law prevents the Food and Drug Administration from
publicly discussing its findings, but at least two advocacy groups
are seeking to change that and are pressing their case with the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Louisiana Republican W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin.</LD>
<LD>   The committee is investigating complaints that ImClone misled
investors about prospects for Erbitux. It also told the FDA it was
concerned with protecting patients from deception.</LD>
<TE>   The panel, which also is investigating Enron Corp., has signaled
its concern about the secrecy surrounding the drug approval process.
In a letter to the agency, it asked the FDA to provide a legal
analysis on whether it can provide confidential information to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Advocacy groups maintain that interagency communication, even if
permitted, would not go far enough to protect their interests. FDA
documents, they argue, can alert seriously ill patients to problems
or delays that drug makers might be reluctant to reveal.</TE>
<TE>   "The FDA has become the shield behind which companies hide" bad
news, said Bob Erwin, a biotechnology executive who also is director
of the Marti Nelson Cancer Research Foundation, an advocacy group
based in Vacaville, Calif., that has lobbied the committee.</TE>
<TE>   But even as the Enron scandal pushes corporate disclosure issues
to the forefront, advocates for cancer patients face an uphill
battle. The pharmaceutical industry opposes any change, which would
take an act of Congress. The industry maintains that confidentiality
is needed to protect competition and promote honest communication
between drug makers and the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   "Communication would be much less candid," said Carl Feldbaum,
president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization.  Correspondence
between the FDA and drug makers would be sanitized for public
consumption, he said. "It would not be helpful."</TE>
<TE>   Feldbaum said he had talked informally with committee members "in
an education vein" about the regulatory process. Among his concerns,
he said,  was that investors would overreact to FDA disclosures,
adding to the volatility of biotechnology stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Goldhammer, associate vice president for regulatory affairs
for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said
safeguards are already in check to prevent the spread of
misinformation. He said the federal securities laws require public
companies to make timely disclosures about such material events as
drug approvals.</TE>
<TE>   "You're putting the FDA in the position of policing disclosures
under the act" that created the SEC. "I don't think that's the FDA's
job."</TE>
<TE>   But patient advocates contend that the increasingly messy
controversy over Erbitux points to a need for reforms.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA rejected ImClone's application to market the drug Dec. 28,
an unexpected setback that ImClone first attributed to record-keeping
mistakes that it said would take a short time to resolve.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, however, an industry newsletter published lengthy
excerpts from the FDA's confidential rejection letter that cast doubt
on ImClone's explanation. The Cancer Letter account said the agency
had serious concerns about Erbitux that would require the company to
perform additional, time-consuming tests.</TE>
<TE>   Investors dumped the stock, which closed off  58 cents on Thursday
at $14.87 on Nasdaq, down from a high of $75 in early December.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone, which faces inquiries from the Justice Department and the
SEC, has not challenged the newsletter's disclosures. But the company
has denied that it acted to deceive investors.</TE>
<TE>   "What I find troubling is that if it had not been for the leak of
the letter, patients would not understand that the drug is a long way
from approval," Erwin said.  "This is important information to
patients who must choose from among alternative treatment options."</TE>
<TE>   Erwin, chief executive of Large Scale Biology, a biotechnology
company, said very little confidential information is contained in
FDA approval or rejection letters.  "There has to be a level of
trust," said Nancy Roach, a founder of the Colon Cancer Alliance in
Kirkland, Wash. "You have to trust the drug you get; you have to
trust what the drug company says about the drug. I think that trust
has been damaged, and we are looking for the FDA to get that trust
back together."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Marti Nelson Cancer Research Foundation and the
Colon Cancer Alliance, the Abigail Alliance for Better Access to
Developmental Drugs also is lobbying the committee.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone and its estranged marketing partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb,
predicted last fall that Erbitux would receive FDA approval by
spring. Bristol-Myers acknowledged recently that the drug would be
delayed; some analysts do not expect it to reach the market until
2004.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies, meanwhile, are locked in a power struggle
stemming from ImClone's legal and regulatory problems. Bristol-Myers,
which has invested $1.2 billion in ImClone, wants to restructure its
commitment to invest up to $800 million more in the company. And it
is demanding that the management of ImClone step aside, at least
until regulatory matters regarding Erbitux are resolved.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone said it was planning a response to Bristol-Myers, which
also insists on taking the lead on Erbitux with the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   The companies had heralded the drug as a financial blockbuster,
with sales of $1.5 billion by 2005. Although those predictions
attracted investors, cancer patients were drawn by well-publicized
results of a clinical trial in which 22.5% of 121 patients responded
to the combination of Erbitux and a chemotherapy drug. ImClone
received as many as 400 calls a day on behalf of patients seeking the
experimental medication.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA, however, told ImClone that its drug application did not
sufficiently document that Erbitux, rather than the chemotherapy
drug, produced the results. ImClone Chief Executive Samuel Waksal has
said the documentation sought by the agency does not exist.</TE>

<HD>Mattel Makes Play to Revive Declining Sales of Barbie</HD>
<DH>Toys: Firm will launch new dolls, movies and clothing to
draw younger and older girls back to brand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mattel Inc., almost midway through a three-year financial realignment
plan, is getting good marks from Wall Street for renewed fiscal
discipline, speedier product cycles and tighter inventory controls.
Profit has rebounded.</LD>
<LD>   But as the 18-month-old management team works on the business
problems left over from previous administrations, a more enduring
challenge is rearing her head.</LD>
<LD>   Barbie, the doll that accounts for nearly a third of the El
Segundo-based toy maker's $4.8-billion revenue, is showing signs of
age as she turns 43 this year. Sales of Barbie slumped last year,
continuing a decline since 1997 that stems in part from shifting
tastes of young girls.</LD>
<TE>   Although Mattel is developing other products aimed at young girls,
a revival of Barbie's sales growth is seen as critical for the
company, given the doll's high profile and high profit margins.</TE>
<TE>   Like other aging starlets, Barbie and her handlers are determined
to find the right platforms to keep Barbie on top. Stimulating sales
and excitement for a brand of Barbie's size and age is a daunting
proposition, one that helped propel earlier management teams into the
same financial missteps the company is working to undo.</TE>
<TE>   For the coming year, Mattel's plans include a return of Barbie to
the small screen via a new video and possible TV special in "Barbie
as Rapunzel," building on last year's $150-million "Barbie in the
Nutcracker."</TE>
<TE>   The new movie features Barbie in an updated version of the fairy
tale classic, although she doesn't let down her hair for Ken to
climb.</TE>
<TE>   And in addition to an array of new-for-2002 Barbie dolls--which
include a soft-body Barbie with glow-in-the-dark hair and pajamas for
girls to bring to bed--Mattel will launch a dramatic marketing and
product-licensing campaign aimed at establishing Barbie as a
ubiquitous "lifestyle brand," with a product for a girl's every
fashion need.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the company continues to expand its other
products within the girls division. Those new products helped boost
the $2.2-billion sales in the division, offsetting Barbie problems.</TE>
<TE>   Among other products, Mattel this year will add pets and houses to
the What's Her Face line of write-on, wipe-off dolls and new baby
dolls called Shining Stars that include materials to name and
register them with the International Star Registry.</TE>
<TE>   "We criticized Mattel and the girls division for years for being a
one-trick pony, and now they're growing their gross margins" despite
declines in Barbie sales, said Hayley Kissel, leisure industry
analyst for Merrill Lynch. "No one would have believed they could do
that."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, U.S. Barbie sales dropped 12% when compared with the
same time a year ago, with sales of higher-end collectible Barbie
dolls, a mostly adult product, falling 40%. Worldwide, Barbie sales
in 2001 fell 3%, to $1.55 billion, the company said, well off a 1997
Barbie peak of $1.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Those numbers are history," said Jill Krutick, an analyst with
Salomon Smith Barney in New York. "We're not anticipating Barbie
revisiting a double-digit growth trajectory any time soon."</TE>
<TE>   Still, double-digit international Barbie sales and strong sales in
the other girls products pushed the division to an overall sales gain
of 3%. Those numbers include a 5% gain for Mattel's pricey American
Girl dolls aimed at slightly older girls; Polly Pocket, a micro-size
doll for young girls; and the Diva Starz group of talking fashion
dolls.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this year is a great illustration of what we've done as a
division," said Adrienne Fontanella, president of Mattel's girls
division. "To come out 3% ahead on a worldwide basis really speaks to
the portfolio of brands that we're managing."</TE>
<TE>   Some financial analysts and investors, however, worry that even
strong earnings from licensing fees and newer toys can't make up for
profit losses when Barbie has a bad year. The company does not
disclose earnings by division.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few products in the history of the toy business
that are as profitable as Barbie, which has high margins, no
royalties, low advertising costs and high markup," said Sean McGowan,
a longtime toy industry analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison in New
York. "They may be doing everything a company in their position
should do, but nevertheless the slowing of their most profitable
brand is a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Even as Barbie sales climbed to new highs in the mid-1990s,
Barbie's core customer was changing.</TE>
<TE>   Girls older than 7 or 8, a group that years ago continued playing
with Barbie dolls through their preteen years, began giving up the
doll and her dream house in favor of video games, stereo systems and
other high-tech entertainment products. Soon, Barbie's perpetually
sunny expressions seemed best suited for a younger sister, age 3 to 5
years old.</TE>
<TE>   When sales of Barbie and other traditional toys began to shrink,
former Mattel Chief Executive Jill Barad hoped to revive Barbie and
other products in part by moving them into online interactive
properties. The strategy culminated in the disastrous $3.5-billion
acquisition of software maker Learning Co., a money-losing albatross
that eventually cost Barad her job.</TE>
<TE>   Since taking the chief executive spot at Mattel in 2000 after the
dismissal of Barad, Robert Eckert has shifted the company's focus
away from such high-tech aspirations and back to the real world of
toy making. This came as Eckert reversed Mattel's earnings decline,
slimmed down the company and bolstered thin management ranks.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 10 years, a thriving collectors market helped fill in
Barbie sales with higher-priced, higher-quality dolls that often
featured marquee designers, such as Vera Wang, fashioning a Barbie
gown.</TE>
<TE>   But when the economy faltered last year, even before Sept. 11,
that collectors market began to fade.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people are lining up to pay these kinds of dollars
for things to look at and put in their closet given what's going on
in the economy," Eckert said in a conference call last month with
analysts and investors. "So I'm not thinking about [the collectors
market] being a growth avenue, and I think the same is true with
holiday Barbie."</TE>
<TE>   The goal instead, Eckert said, is to revive the Barbie franchise
by making fewer, better-quality dolls that can command higher prices
and still be in demand.</TE>
<TE>   New consumer product efforts offer another opportunity for
reinforcing Barbie as a brand and, if all goes well, reaching an
older age group.</TE>
<TE>   For younger girls, items include new bath products with removable
Barbie bangle bracelets and a luggage line that for the first time
can be checked through airport baggage systems.</TE>
<TE>   To capture slightly older girls, Mattel is introducing Mystery
Squad, envisioned as a cross between Barbie dolls and a Nancy Drew
book, in which new Barbie dolls carry detective accessories and a
dossier outlining the "Prom Caper" for girls to solve.</TE>
<TE>   Still in the planning stage are designs for an apparel line for
teens and young women in the United States, including highly stylized
Barbie depictions that border on kitsch-cool, such as a giant outline
of a Barbie's head plastered on to a tight-fitting T-shirt and
wild-color illustrated Barbie images splashed across jeans and
skirts.</TE>
<TE>   Later this year, the company will introduce a line of women's
accessories, including china and stationery sets designed with colors
and patterns from vintage Barbie dresses and featuring more subtle
Barbie images.</TE>
<TE>   "Years ago the only thing that excited people was the doll and toy
products and now the doll and toy products are a piece of the brand,"
said girls division president Fontanella. "Now there are many, many
other pieces."</TE>
<TE>   Mattel shares closed at $17.33, down 7 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Wins Upgrade of S&amp;P Foreign Debt Rating</HD>
<DH>Latin America: New investment-grade status will reduce
country's cost of borrowing and attract investment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. raised Mexico's foreign debt rating to
investment grade Thursday, a long-awaited seal of approval for
President Vicente Fox's economic policies that recently have included
steep budget cuts and unpopular tax and electricity rate hikes.</LD>
<LD>   The upgrade to BBB-minus from BB-plus by the rating agency often
viewed as the most influential will reduce Mexico's cost of borrowing
on international markets and generate a significant increase in
foreign investment, analysts said. The move follows similar upgrades
by Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico's sound fiscal and monetary policy, low inflation and
improved tax collections have improved economic stability and
enhanced Mexico's status of "safe haven" for foreign investment, said
S&amp;P Latin America Managing Director Jane Eddy in explaining the
upgrade.</LD>
<TE>   A pleased President Fox told German reporters that the upgrade is
a "recognition of Mexico today. I dare say that in this moment Mexico
is the best destination for investment in the world."</TE>
<TE>   The political price President Fox has paid to attain the rating
has been considerable, said Pamela Starr, a professor at the
Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Fox raised the value-added tax--which is similar to a
sales tax--to as high as 20% on some luxury items, while proposing
the elimination of billions of dollars in electricity subsidies. As a
result, Fox's popularity with the middle class, which swept him to
power in July 2000, has fallen, Starr said.</TE>
<TE>   The new rating will reduce Mexico's borrowing costs, because it
now can pay investors who buy Mexico's bonds less interest, a
trade-off for reduced risk that the upgrade implies.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Garrido, senior emerging market analyst at Montgomery Asset
Management in San Francisco, said the upgrade is a result of fiscal
policies that began under President Ernesto Zedillo, who preceded
Fox.</TE>
<TE>   The upgrade could generate $5 billion in additional foreign
investment in Mexico because it gives a green light to mutual and
pension funds and insurance companies barred from investing in
countries with ratings of anything less than investment grade, said
Alfredo Coutino, a macroeconomist with Philadelphia-based
Ciemex-Wefa.</TE>
<TE>   "This converts Mexico into an attraction for investors for whom
previously it was not an option," Coutino said. The $5 billion in
additional foreign investment the upgrade may attract would come on
top of the $14 billion already projected for Mexico in 2002, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chile and Uruguay are the only other countries in Latin America
that have an investment-grade rating from S&amp;P. In the Caribbean,
Barbados and Trinidad also have it.</TE>
<TE>   The upgrade comes as no surprise to investors, who have bid up
Mexico's shares this year in anticipation of the upgrade, Garrido
said. Mexico's leading stock index is up 6.5% year to date, while
Brazil's market, for example, is down 12.4%. Mexico's IPC index fell
0.1% in Thursday trading.</TE>
<TE>   The year-to-date rise in Mexico's stock index also compares
favorably with Nasdaq, down 8.6%, and the Dow Jones industrial
average, which is off 4%. European markets are down 5% to 8%, Garrido
said.</TE>
<TE>   Starr said some of the taxes, such as the one on cellular
telephone services, could be struck down on appeal by the Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Observers said the upgrade should not be taken as a guarantee of
economic success for Mexico. Enrique Dussel Peters, a political
economist at National Autonomous University of Mexico, said the
economy remains vulnerable to a continued U.S. slowdown and to
increased foreign competition, especially from China.</TE>
<TE>   "The risk is that fiscal authorities get too comfortable and get
derailed. But I don't think that's where Mexico is heading," said
Montgomery's Garrido.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Earnings Plunge 64%</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Results for quarter come amid fears of credit
default. Revised forecast for this year has agency considering
lowering credit rating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beleaguered telecommunications giant WorldCom Inc. said Thursday that
fourth-quarter profit plunged 64% and that 2002 results will be lower
than expected, partly due to an upcoming charge of as much as $20
billion.</LD>
<LD>   But investors fearing that the Clinton, Miss.-based company might
succumb to the financial devastation sweeping the telecom industry
gave the company a reprieve after Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers said
WorldCom has access to $10billion in cash and that its operations,
though struggling, are sound.</LD>
<LD>   "Bankruptcy or a credit default is not a concern," he said in a
conference call with analysts.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom shares, down 50% this year on fears of a credit default,
rebounded Thursday as much as 20% before closing on Nasdaq at $7.52,
up 83 cents, or 12%. But falling traffic in its long-distance
business caused WorldCom's MCI tracking stock to skid 16%, or $1.45,
to $7.61, also on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, behind AT&amp;T
Corp., said profit in the three months ended Dec. 31 fell to $258
million from $726 million in the year-earlier period. Sales fell 12%
to $8.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said they were encouraged by the report, but several said
WorldCom is not out of the woods.</TE>
<TE>   "Growth companies grow despite economic conditions," said Scott C.
Cleland, a telecommunications analyst at the Washington research firm
Precursor Group. "WorldCom's no longer doing that."</TE>
<TE>   The   two main operating units posted disappointing results.</TE>
<TE>   Profit in its corporate-data division fell 48% to $305 million, or
10 cents a share, as revenue dropped 9.6% to $5.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The MCI unit reported a fourth-quarter loss of $89 million, or 75
cents a share, contrasted with a profit of $125 million, or $1.09, a
year earlier. Revenue fell 16% to $3.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "WorldCom is not immune to the challenges of the telecom
marketplace," Ebbers said. But "WorldCom has a solid base of
bill-paying customers, strong fundamentals, a solid balance sheet,
manageable leverage and nearly $10 billion in available liquidity."</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers and other executives said 2002 profit would fall to 75
cents to 85 cents a share, below analysts' estimates of 95 cents. The
revised forecast prompted Moody's Investors Service to put WorldCom's
long-term credit rating on review for possible downgrade.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom said it trimmed its debt by $1 billion in the fourth
quarter to $24.7 billion. It is owed less than $10 million by Global
Crossing Ltd., the Bermuda-based fiber-optic network operator that
filed for bankruptcy protection last month.</TE>
<TE>   But WorldCom said it may have to write down as much as $20 billion
from its spree of acquisitions in recent years. The company carries
$50.5 billion in goodwill--the difference between the purchase price
of an asset and its book value--on its balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also have been worried about Ebbers' ability to repay
nearly $200 million in personal loans from the company and the
possibility he would have to sell millions of shares of WorldCom
stock to cover those debts. Ebbers said Thursday that he has the
resources to repay the loans and won't be selling any stock to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, WorldCom investors have lost more than $100 billion in
equity since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts Thursday warned that the damage could grow in coming
months because WorldCom's core long-distance market is shrinking as
cell phones and e-mail siphon away traditional users of long-distance
services.</TE>
<TE>   Though WorldCom and rivals AT&amp;T and Sprint Corp. have tried to
stem the damage by raising long-distance rates, experts say the
long-term outlook for renewed robust growth is not bright.</TE>
<TE>   "I think WorldCom is doing among the best of a pretty poor lot
right now ... but the question is whether they can ride it out," said
Eileen Eastman, a telecommunications analyst at Yankee Group, a
consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom has been hit by sharp reductions in corporate spending on
telecommunications, the dot-com bust and the slow roll-out of
next-generation technology products such as high-speed Internet
access.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom went on a torrid acquisition binge during the 1990s,
gobbling up Internet service provider UUNet Technologies,
long-distance giant MCI and dozens of other companies.</TE>
<TE>   For the year, WorldCom's profit plummeted 94% to $1.4 billion, or
48 cents per share, from $22.8 billion, or 87 cents, in 2000. Revenue
fell 6.5% to $21.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In other earnings news:</TE>
<TE>   * Ask Jeeves Inc. reported a fourth-quarter loss of $3.5 million,
or 9 cents a share. The loss does not include restructuring charges,
gains on the dissolution of a joint venture and other one-time items.
That's narrower than its loss in the period a year ago of $18.7
million, or 53 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   * Electronic Data Systems Corp. posted a 20% increase in
fourth-quarter earnings, excluding a one-time credit, as companies
and governments outsourced computer operations to cut costs.
Texas-based EDS, the world's No. 2 computer-services provider after
IBM Corp., said fourth-quarter earnings were $396 million, or 81
cents per diluted share, compared with $331 million, or 70 cents, a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   * Royal Philips Electronics, Europe's largest maker of consumer
electronics, had a record loss in the fourth quarter on slumping
sales of semiconductors, computer screens and televisions. The loss
was $1 billion, or 90 cents a share, contrasted with profit of $2.79
billion a year earlier.</TE>

against earnings to cover costs stemming from class-action lawsuits

<LD>   The lawsuits allege MetLife's Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.
charged higher premiums to black customers than to whites for less
insurance coverage. The suits also allege the firm urged construction
of race-based mortality tables.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Initial claims for jobless benefits nationwide fell last week, a sign
that the economy is strengthening enough for companies to resume
hiring. New applications during January were the fewest since the
recession began.</LD>
<LD>   State unemployment offices received 376,000 claims last week, a
decline of 15,000, the U.S. Labor Department said. Claims have held
at less than 400,000 for five weeks. The last time that happened was
in March.</LD>
<LD>   The four-week moving average, considered a more reliable measure
of employment conditions because it irons out weekly fluctuations,
fell to 380,500, its lowest level since last August.</LD>
<TE>   The number of workers remaining on jobless benefits for the week
ended Jan. 26, the most recent week for which data were available,
fell to 3.427 million from 3.477 million.</TE>

<LD>Former General Electric Chairman Jack Welch told Hewlett-Packard
Chairwoman Carly Fiorina that he sees the potential for "chaos"
surrounding HP's plan to acquire Compaq Computer Corp. that
competitors would exploit.</LD>
<LD>   Welch said in a television interview with Fiorina that support for
the deal among HP's competitors helped explain why European
regulators had given the go-ahead to HP's proposed deal while
rejecting GE's bid under Welch to buy Honeywell.</LD>
<LD>   "Your competitors want this deal to go through. It will create
chaos. They will clean both your clocks while you're doing all this,"
Welch said.</LD>

<CX>   Jack Welch comments--A story in Friday's Business section
misconstrued a comment by former General Electric Co. Chairman Jack Welch
that appeared critical of Hewlett-Packard Co.'s plan to acquire Compaq
Computer Corp. Welch was actually paraphrasing the comments of Walter
Hewlett, the main opponent of the deal, and not expressing his own
opinion.</CX>

<HD>Providian Posts $395.3-Million Loss in 4th Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>By Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Credit card issuer Providian Financial Corp. on Thursday reported a
$395.3-million loss in the fourth quarter, including almost $1
billion in charges and additional reserves as it was hit by rising
loan defaults.</LD>
<LD>   The loss for Providian, which lends to people with spotty credit
records, amounted to $1.39 a share after additions to loss reserves
and charges. That contrasted with a profit of $225.1 million, or 76
cents, in the year-ago quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The company also said banking regulators have accepted its capital
plan, which includes the sale of proceeds from $8.2 billion in credit
card loans to J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</LD>
<TE>   Providian had postponed releasing results hours before they
originally were due on Jan. 31, saying it was working out the final
components of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which in November was prohibited by regulators from
taking on new customers with short or poor credit histories, has been
cutting jobs and looking to unload parts of its card portfolio in an
effort to boost results.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotten our arms around the loss situation," Chief Executive
Joseph Saunders told investors on a conference call. "I believe that
we have turned the corner and the company is on an appropriate
trajectory to an acceptable earnings level."</TE>
<TE>   Providian's latest results included the addition of $252 million
for loan-loss reserves and several other charges.</TE>
<TE>   "They threw everything into it," said Matthew Park, an analyst at
Thomas Weisel Partners. "They put aside a lot of money to reserves,
in the anticipation of further deterioration in credit quality. But I
think it was encouraging regulators approved this set of charges and
their plan to grow."</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street had expected Providian to earn between a profit of 10
cents a share and a loss of 51 cents a share, with a mean estimated
loss of 6 cents, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Providian shares closed off 33 cents at $3.46 on the New York
Stock Exchange, before the results were released. Providian stock was
the worst performer in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index last year,
falling 94%.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of 2000, Providian was worth $16.3 billion on the stock
market. It has a market value of $985 million now.</TE>
<TE>   Other earnings from California companies, excluding one-time
items:</TE>
<TE>   * Engineering and construction firm Fluor Corp. reported
fourth-quarter net income of $28.5 million, or 36 cents a share,
including a $10.2-million charge stemming from the retirement of
Chairman and Chief Executive Philip Carroll and Vice Chairman Jim
Stein.</TE>
<TE>   The company's earnings from continued operations were $31.4
million, or 39 cents a share, on revenue of $2.6 billion. Analysts
had expected 40 cents on average, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The Aliso Viejo company, which changed its fiscal year end to Dec.
31 from Oct. 31, declined to provide comparable year-ago results.</TE>
<TE>   * Smith Micro Software Inc. posted its first quarterly profit in
nearly four years. The Aliso Viejo developer of wireless
communication and utility software products said net income for the
fourth quarter totaled $116,000, or 1 cent a share, versus a loss of
$989,000, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier. The company last showed
a profit in the first quarter of 1998. Revenue declined 5% to $3.9
million.</TE>
<TE>   * MindArrow Systems Inc., an Aliso Viejo provider of marketing
software and services, reported net income of $665,712, or 5 cents a
share, for the first fiscal quarter, which included a gain of $3.6
million recovered after a counterfeit-stock fraud. A year earlier,
the company lost $5.4 million, or 53 cents a share, for the same
quarter. Revenue rose 8% to a record $1.1 million.</TE>

<HD>Sheldon Allman, 77; Actor, Songwriter, Cartoon Voice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George, George, George of the Jungle,</LD>
<LD>   Friend to you and me.</LD>
<LD>   Watch out for that tree!</LD>
<TE>   Sheldon Allman, who wrote those words introducing the bumbling
jungle-savvy cartoon television hero and later Brendan Fraser in the
motion picture version, has died. He was 77.</TE>
<TE>   Allman--actor, songwriter, nightclub performer and recording
artist who also sang through the mouth of a horse named Mister
Ed--died Jan. 22 of heart failure at his home in Culver City.</TE>
<TE>   The cartoon jungle family lasted 17 episodes on ABC Saturday
morning television in 1967, but the catchy chorus about George may
never die.</TE>
<TE>   That song--"the one song I know that makes everyone smile,"
producer Jordan Kerner told The Times in 1997--was a major reason
that Walt Disney agreed to make the $50-million film starring Fraser.</TE>
<TE>   Performed by the Seattle-based rock band the Presidents of the
United States of America, the number graced the movie's opening
titles.</TE>
<TE>   All in an afternoon's work, Allman told The Times in an interview
when the film was released. He said he wrote the theme song with
singer and musician Stan Worth in 1967 at the request of Jay Ward,
producer of the cartoon "George."</TE>
<TE>   The instructions were to name all the characters--head of the
jungle George; his wife, Ursula; the well-educated ape friend, Ape;
and elephant Shep, who thought he was a dog.</TE>
<TE>   Ward also ordered themes for two other cartoons to run in the
"George" time slot--satirical superhero "Super Chicken" and a
race-car driver called "Tom Slick."</TE>
<TE>   "Stan came over to my house," Allman related. "We started at 1
o'clock, and by 4 o'clock we had the three songs."</TE>
<TE>   Allman's wife, Lorraine, returning home, was the first to hear the
unforgettable "George, George, George" singsong chant. "You guys,"
she chided, "with all of your talent and all of your training, and
this is what you find to put your time in on? Shame on you."</TE>
<TE>   Worth, who died in a plane crash in 1980, primarily composed the
music and Allman wrote the words.</TE>
<TE>   To Allman, incorporating the song into the motion picture score
seemed natural.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the connection of the character to the music," he said. "You
cannot imagine 'George of the Jungle' without the song, and you can't
sing the song without seeing George of the Jungle."</TE>
<TE>   Allman, who sometimes did voice-overs for cartoons, including
"Undercover Elephant," also worked with Worth on the music for Ward's
cartoon "The Dudley Do-Right Show," in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   The songwriter may have prepared himself for his cartoon efforts
with the novelty tunes he wrote and then sang for the unusual 1961-65
CBS comedy series "Mister Ed," which starred Alan Young as architect
Wilbur Post, owner of a talking horse. The horse's speaking voice was
provided by former western star Allan "Rocky" Lane.</TE>
<TE>   But when Mister Ed sang, it was Allman vocalizing his original
ditties, including "Pretty Little Filly With the Pony Tail" and "The
Empty Feedbag Blues."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chicago, Allman grew up in Canada and began singing with
the Royal National Guard during his World War II service in the Royal
Canadian Air Force. He came to Los Angeles in 1949 and graduated from
the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote such songs as "A Quiet Kind of Love" and "Christmas in
the Air," and recorded such albums as "Folk Songs for the 21st
Century" and the monster-spoofing "Sing Along with Drac," including
the songs "Don't Maim Me," "A Coffin for Sale" and "These Ghoulish
Things Behind Me Were You."</TE>
<TE>   Allman also wrote theme songs for a number of TV game shows,
including "Let's Make a Deal," "Split Second" and "Your First
Impression."</TE>
<TE>   After he met "Monster Mash" songwriter Bobby "Boris" Pickett when
both were performing in a play in 1966, Allman joined Pickett to
write the musical comedy play "Dracula ... Sorry the Bridge Is Out,
You'll Have to Spend the Night."</TE>
<TE>   The play was produced at Los Angeles' Coronet Theatre and on other
small stages and turned into the 1995 direct-to-video film "Monster
Mash: The Movie," starring Pickett as Frankenstein.</TE>
<TE>   The video production, especially popular at Halloween, prodded
Allman and Pickett to write a sequel for the play, "Frankenstein
Unbound."</TE>
<TE>   Allman also amassed a considerable resume as a character actor,
appearing in more than 20 motion pictures and 120 TV shows and
countless commercials.</TE>
<TE>   He was the unsympathetic veterinarian Thompson in "Hud," starring
Paul Newman; Judge Harry Evers in "The Sons of Katie Elder," starring
John Wayne; the sheriff in "Nevada Smith," starring Steve McQueen;
and prison chaplain the Rev. Jim Post in "In Cold Blood."</TE>
<TE>   Allman played the regular character Norm Miller in the 1964 Jack
Klugman TV series "Harris Against the World," and from the 1950s
through the 1970s appeared in episodes of such popular series as
"Gunsmoke," "Maverick," "The Untouchables," "My Favorite Martian,"
"The Fugitive," "I Dream of Jeanie" and "Little House on the
Prairie," and television movies including "Hunter" and "Miles to Go
Before I Sleep."</TE>
<TE>   Allman is survived by his wife of 35 years, Lorraine Allman; a
daughter, Anne Allman Huddleston of Los Angeles; and a brother, Sam
Allman of Vancouver, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the
Motion Picture and Television Fund Foundation.</TE>

<HD>Belmont Panel: Finish the Job</HD>
<DH>Schools: Experts say completing the campus could cost $80
million more, and that the facility can be made safe.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Completion of the Belmont Learning Complex, including solving
environmental problems at the stalled Los Angeles high school, could
cost another $80 million, a panel of experts has concluded.</LD>
<LD>   The extra cost could bring the final tab for Belmont to more than
$250 million, guaranteeing its place as the costliest high school
ever built in California.</LD>
<LD>   The panel hired by the Los Angeles Unified School District
reviewed three proposals from private firms seeking to finish
construction of the high school near downtown. It found that they
would be able to make the school safe for its anticipated 4,000
students.</LD>
<TE>   However, after a separate investigation by the school district's
inspector general, one of the three bidders was disqualified on
Wednesday because of a potential conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   "The Belmont Learning Center can be completed and can be safe,"
said Terry Sanglerat, an environmental expert on the seven-member
panel and executive vice president of GeoSyntec Consultants of
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Our conclusion is that the district should proceed and finish the
center," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The half-finished school, where work was halted in 1999 because of
environmental worries, sits atop an abandoned oil field that contains
methane and hydrogen sulfide gases. Partly wrapped in plastic, the
hulking structure at the corner of Beaudry Avenue and 1st Street is a
constant reminder of the nasty political debates and prolonged
litigation that its problems spawned.</TE>
<TE>   Even with such extra costs, the panelists and school district
officials said that completing the campus makes financial sense.
Building a school from scratch for the same number of students could
cost about $170 million and take five years, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The Belmont school could be finished in two to three years, panel
members said.</TE>
<TE>   "This school will tremendously relieve overcrowding and get kids
off buses," Supt. Roy Romer said. "It is an important educational
tool if we can get it."</TE>
<TE>   The school district is deliberating over whether to finish the
school and, if so, which of the two remaining bidders to hire.</TE>
<TE>   The review panelists briefed school board members Thursday on
their findings. They will deliver their report publicly next Tuesday.
Romer is expected to recommend one of the two remaining bids later
this month. The school board will make a final decision in March.</TE>
<TE>   The panel did not rank the three proposals. Romer has not publicly
expressed a preference.</TE>
<TE>   The disqualified bidder, meanwhile, held out hope of getting back
into the competition.</TE>
<TE>   Romer threw out a proposal from Eastridge Cos., citing an internal
investigation that revealed an apparent conflict of interest.
Eastridge's lead executive for its Belmont bid was reported to be
working for the district as a real estate consultant on other
projects at the same time he was preparing the company's Belmont bid,
possibly giving the firm an advantage, the investigation concluded.</TE>
<TE>   The chief executive of the Eastridge firm strongly disputes those
findings and said she was stunned by the turn of events.</TE>
<TE>   "The district has a lot at stake with this [Belmont] proposal, and
I'm still convinced that our proposal was going to be the only
solution to getting the project done," Susan Eastridge said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the partners of a competing team said he fears the process
could be held up by a lawsuit. But Eastridge said her firm has no
plans to sue.</TE>
<TE>   The review panel evaluated the three proposals on how each would
finance the project, resolve environmental hazards at the site and
finish construction.</TE>
<TE>   The panel found that all of the proposals offered sufficient
remedies for alleviating the dangerous gases beneath the school. They
said that cleaning and monitoring the environmental hazards would
cost as much as $15 million, a figure wrapped into the total cost.</TE>
<TE>   A state regulator who participated in the reviews told the
district that all three plans are workable and meet state
environmental standards.</TE>
<TE>   In general, experts are recommending plans that would actively
vent the underground gases beneath the 34-acre site.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all off-the-shelf technology," said panelist Timothy
Buresh, director of engineering and construction for the Alameda
Corridor Transportation Authority. "There's nothing here we're
inventing."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the district has spent $154 million on Belmont so
far and about $20 million more on attorneys, litigation and other
costs associated with the school. The panelists estimated that
finishing the campus would cost $60 million to $80 million.</TE>
<TE>   School Board President Caprice Young said she is still weighing
whether to build Belmont, but she is encouraged by the panel's
report.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I think we have a shot at potentially building a safe
school," she said.</TE>

<HD>Bill to Boost Aid for 9/11 Jobless Gains</HD>
<DH>Legislature: Employers oppose it, saying it would extend
benefits to those who weren't thrown out of work by attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' emergency bill to extend newly increased
unemployment benefits to workers thrown out of a job by the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks advanced Thursday over the opposition of major
California employers.</LD>
<LD>   Employers' lobbyists warned that unless the bill was substantially
amended, it would contribute to a threatened bankruptcy of the
state's $5.5-billion unemployment insurance fund in a few years and
trigger a drastic increase in unemployment insurance taxes paid by
recession-pressed businesses.</LD>
<LD>   They indicated that they support increased payments for workers
who were idled by the Sept. 11 attacks, but complained that the bill
is written so broadly that it would also cover those whose loss of
employment occurred for other reasons.</LD>
<TE>   At a testy hearing of the Senate Labor Committee, Sen. Richard
Alarcon (D-Sylmar), author of the governor's bill (SB 2x), along with
officials of the Davis administration, organized labor and jobless
airline workers, sought to dismiss the employers' objections as
fear-mongering and insensitive to the economic needs of workers who
lost their jobs for reasons other than the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Alarcon, chairman of the committee, criticized
testimony of the employer advocates as "basically Chicken Little
statistics. It is neither accurate nor compassionate."</TE>
<TE>   Five Democratic members of the committee voted for the bill; two
Republicans voted against it. The proposal was sent to the
Appropriations Committee for another hearing, the final stop before
action by the full Senate.</TE>
<TE>   As an urgency measure, the bill will require a favorable
two-thirds vote of each house for final approval. This means it will
need at least one Republican vote in the Senate and four in the
Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   The Employment Development Department has estimated that about
15,000 California workers lost their jobs as a result of the Sept. 11
attacks. The retroactive benefits for those workers would total $540
million.</TE>
<TE>   As of Dec. 31, the unemployment fund contained $5.5 billion, much
of it considered a reserve for emergency purposes. Administration
officials say the retroactive payments would not cause a tax increase
for employers.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature and Davis voted last summer to gradually increase
benefits for jobless workers from a weekly maximum of $230 then to
$450 in 2005. Davis and lawmakers mistakenly assumed that the new
benefits would apply to those who lost their jobs as a result of
Sept. 11--chiefly airline, hotel and tourist industry workers.</TE>
<TE>   Later, they learned that the new law, also written by Alarcon, did
not provide the increased benefits to those workers because it did
not take effect until Jan. 1. As a result, Davis proposed making the
increases retroactive to Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Lobbyists of the California Chamber of Commerce and the California
Taxpayers Assn., which represent businesses and major employers, said
they were surprised to learn that the retroactive bill applied not
only to the Sept. 11 jobless workers, as he had indicated, but to
unknown numbers of others who lost their jobs last year and whose
cases are open.</TE>
<TE>   "It is much broader than it ought to be," said Carol Evans of the
taxpayers association. "Their version is that anyone who is
unemployed for any reason is going to get those increased benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with last year's law to increase benefits, which raised
California from near the bottom in unemployment payments, the
retroactive bill could invite about 750,000 new claims, including
those of people who have since found employment again, said Julianne
Broyles of the California Chamber of Commerce. These claims would
drain the fund, she said.</TE>

<LD>Top Sheriff's Department officials dropped their union memberships
because of union support for challengers of Sheriff Lee Baca,
officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Professional Peace Officers Assn. endorsed Sgt. John Stites in
the March 5 election, and the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs
appeared to be poised to back Sgt. Patrick Gomez.</LD>
<LD>   The peace officers board also gave Stites a $1,000 campaign
contribution, which led some union members to question the direction
of the group. Undersheriff William Stonich, Assistant Sheriff Larry
Waldie, and Cmdrs. Doyle Campbell and Chuck Jackson notified the
union that they could not remain members. All were promoted by Baca
and are considered loyal to him.</LD>

<HD>Chase and Standoff Lead to 2 Arrests</HD>
<DH>Crime: Shots are fired at police helicopter during pursuit.
One suspect holes up in Tarzana apartment complex.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man fleeing authorities fired several rounds at a Los Angeles
Police Department helicopter Thursday, triggering a daylong standoff
when one of two suspects barricaded himself inside a Tarzana
apartment complex.</LD>
<LD>   No one was injured in the shooting in the 5400 block of Lindley
Avenue, police said, and both suspects surrendered by late afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began at 9:10 a.m. when two men stole a green,
two-door Pontiac equipped with an anti-theft device that helped
police locate the car in the 15000 block of Roscoe Boulevard in North
Hills, Cmdr. Michel Moore said.</LD>
<TE>   A 15-minute chase through the San Fernando Valley began after
police tried to pull the car over. The vehicle eventually collided
with another car on Lindley Avenue beneath the Ventura Freeway, and
the suspects ran off, Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   One of them ran south on Lindley past apartments and single-story
homes, and one fired several rounds from a handgun at a police
helicopter, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities withheld the suspects' names Thursday but said they
face felony charges, including grand theft auto, evading police and
attempted murder of an officer.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear if the helicopter was damaged, Moore said. "We
pulled the helicopter out of the air to inspect it."</TE>
<TE>   Police detained one of the men within an hour of the incident. The
other suspect holed up in a second-floor apartment of a 40-unit
complex before surrendering just before 3 p.m., Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   During the standoff, police evacuated residents of nearby homes
and 100 students attending a private school on Lindley.</TE>
<TE>   "The children were never in danger," Moore said, praising the
school's quick response.</TE>
<TE>   Police said one of the suspects knew someone who lives in the
apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   The incident interrupted a bingo game at the nearby Encino Rivera
Retirement Home, said Maria Luisa Avneri, an administrator.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody misses bingo," Avneri said, "so you know this is a big
event."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Kristina Sauerwein contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Rampart Officer Says He Lied Due to Fear of Reprisals</HD>
<DH>Police: He testifies in misconduct case over beating of
alleged gang member that the suspect didn't put up a fight, as was
originally reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Los Angeles police officer in the Rampart Division testified
Thursday that his fear of retaliation and other concerns prevented
him from telling supervisors that he and other officers lied in
official reports to allegedly cover up the beating of a suspect in
1998.</LD>
<LD>   "I was covering my butt, and everyone else's that was there,"
Shawn Gomez, 29, said while testifying at a preliminary hearing in
Los Angeles Superior Court in the misconduct case of former LAPD
Officer Ethan Cohan.</LD>
<LD>   "You are afraid of retaliation, of being snubbed by your
co-workers," he said when asked by Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Goudy why
he filed a false report.</LD>
<TE>   Cohan is charged with assault with a deadly weapon, perjury,
filing a false police report and conspiracy in connection with the
arrest and beating of alleged gang member Gabriel Aguirre on March
26, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, which will resume Feb. 19, Judge William R.
Chidsey Jr. will decide whether prosecutors have enough evidence to
send the case to trial.</TE>
<TE>   He also will rule on a motion by Cohan's defense attorney Harland
Braun to exclude Gomez's testimony because he had access to
statements Cohan was compelled to give during a police disciplinary
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In his testimony Thursday, Gomez, who is testifying as part of a
plea bargain arrangement with prosecutors, said he lied because he
was afraid fellow officers would not respond to his calls for backup
help if he ever got into a dangerous situation. "They can make life
miserable for you," Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez was one of two officers Thursday who contradicted assertions
in official reports that he, Cohan and other officers filed saying
the suspect was hurt when he fell while running down fire escape
steps and while resisting arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The case arose as part of the Rampart scandal, which surfaced when
former Officer Rafael Perez revealed widespread corruption in that
division's anti-gang unit in exchange for a plea arrangement on drug
charges.</TE>
<TE>   In one of his allegations, Perez said he, Cohan, 31; Gomez; and
Officers Manuel Chavez, 31; and Camerino Mesina took part in an
attack on Aguirre when they arrested him in a vacant apartment on
Witmer Street on charges of assault with a deadly weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Their reports of the arrest said Aguirre began to "swing his arms
and fists and kick at the officers in an attempt to escape." The
reports said Aguirre punched Gomez and Chavez and kicked Mesina,
Cohan and Perez. They also said Aguirre got a bloody nose when they
"guided the defendant against the wall so as to control him."</TE>
<TE>   Gomez testified that Perez pushed Aguirre hard against the wall
while he was handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   He and Chavez testified that Aguirre peacefully submitted to the
arrest, that neither of them were punched and that they did not see
Aguirre kick the other three officers.</TE>
<TE>   But both said they left the apartment building after the arrest to
get their patrol car and did not see Cohan or anyone else beat
Aguirre.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez, who has pleaded no contest to a charge of filing a false
report, is testifying as part of plea bargain in which prosecutors
agreed not to oppose reducing the charges to a misdemeanor, to
recommend that he be put on probation and made to perform community
service.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez also is cooperating with prosecutors as part of a plea
bargain in which he pleaded no contest to assault under color of
authority. The district attorney's office has agreed not to oppose
reducing the charge to a misdemeanor and to recommend that he serve
not more than a year in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Perez served three years in state prison for the drug charges and
is now serving a two-year federal term for civil rights violations
related to the cover-up of a shooting of an unarmed man who was
subsequently framed and convicted of attacking police.</TE>

<HD>A One-Man Crusade for Safety, Sparked by One Drowning</HD>
<DH>Health: The Irvine Lake death of a girl he didn't know led
him to become a CPR instructor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chet Ossowski keeps his motivation tucked inside his wallet, two
photos laminated back to back. On one side is Emiline, who turns 10
this year. Flip it over and there is Brianna, who would have turned
12.</LD>
<LD>   Come Feb. 20, Ossowski will visit her grave as he does twice a
year. Once on Brianna's birthday, and once on June 22, the day
Ossowski watched as the 6-year-old stranger was pulled from Irvine
Lake, where she had gone swimming during a birthday party.</LD>
<LD>   "There were 200 people there that day; four lifeguards," said
Ossowski, 55, who wants to keep the girls' last names private. "And
somehow she managed to die."</LD>
<TE>   Brianna's 1996 death shook the former Marine fighter pilot who
works as family program director for the Central Orange Coast YMCA.
He sought out Brianna's parents and made them a promise.</TE>
<TE>   "I promised them that somehow this would be turned into a
positive," Ossowski said. He was inspired to become an instructor in
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and has trained thousands of Irvine
high school students. "I told them that I would make this commitment:
That I would work to make this planet a safer place for
children--especially around water."</TE>
<TE>   One year later, Ossowski was at the same lake, which is in his
neighborhood, when a 5-year-old girl found herself in over her head.
She was rescued from the water, but she wasn't breathing. She had no
pulse. Ossowski stepped between the teenage lifeguards and performed
CPR.</TE>
<TE>   As paramedics arrived, Emiline began breathing again.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, drowning is among the leading causes of death for
children age 5 and under. In Southern California, where swimming is a
rite of passage, where the ocean beckons and backyard pools are
commonplace, drowning is a constant threat.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, regional agencies will kick off an awareness campaign
by teaching CPR to parents.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gary Goodman, director of the pediatric intensive care unit at
the Mission Viejo branch of Children's Hospital of Orange County, has
seen so many children who have died or been left brain-damaged in the
water that he has lost count. "Let's just say it's a lot."</TE>
<TE>   He has seen children who have drowned in hot tubs, bathtubs,
toilets and buckets containing just a few inches of water. He knows
it takes only five minutes of oxygen deprivation to wipe clean the
part of the brain responsible for thinking and personality.</TE>
<TE>   He knows how quiet a drowning can be, how a toddler who steps
innocently into a pool will not struggle, just sink to the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll just sit there at the bottom of the pool and watch the
world go by," Goodman said.</TE>
<TE>   He has talked to parents who plucked their living child from a
pool only to hand him over dead to paramedics because they didn't
know--or didn't try--CPR. And he has seen how, unlike parents of
children who die from disease, the parents of children who drown
never get over it.</TE>
<TE>   "Drowning is preventable," Goodman said. "Having to live with
that--the knowledge that if only I had not answered the doorbell, or
the phone, if I hadn't turned my attention away for just a minute,
that this wouldn't have happened.</TE>
<TE>   "The guilt just eats them up. The pain doesn't go away. These
people are never the same again. They're like hollow people, like
shadows."</TE>
<TE>   Marcia Kerr knows the emptiness and regret. In 1988, her
2-year-old son Cody was in the care of a nanny, asleep on the couch.
Suddenly, he wasn't asleep. He walked out an unlocked back door and
into the family's pool, which had been cleaned that day.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the cleaning, the pool's cover had been left off to
allow the chemicals to air out.</TE>
<TE>   "We found out about all the false truths about children and
drowning," said Kerr, now 54. "We always thought that because we were
good parents, something like this wouldn't happen to us. We learned
that you have to have safety equipment in place every moment because
you can't watch your kids every moment."</TE>
<TE>   Because of what he has seen, Goodman, the father of two, won't own
a home with a pool. The Kerrs dealt with grief by attacking it, and
the issue of drowning, head on. Marcia shares her story with parents
in support groups. Bill started a pool safety products company and
helped produce an informational video when California law changed,
requiring fences or barriers around new pools.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's motivation sits on a shelf in their Lake Forest home:
an urn of Cody's ashes surrounded by toy cars and a Superman doll.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something you never get over," Marcia Kerr said. "There's a
hole in my family. I will never have another son again.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd be almost 16 now. After it happened, I'd see 2-year-olds and
think of him. Now, when I see 16-year-old boys, I always wonder what
he'd be like, what he'd be doing, what he'd be interested in. I think
of him every single day."</TE>

<LD>Chet Ossowski keeps his motivation tucked inside his wallet, two

<TE>   Nationwide, drowning is among the leading causes of death for
children age 5 and under. In Southern California, where swimming is a
rite of passage, where the ocean beckons and backyard pools are
commonplace, drowning is a constant threat.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, nine children age 5 and under drowned in Orange County,
the most since 1996. In addition, 30 "near drownings" were reported,
the first year such incidents were tracked.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the YMCA, along with the American Heart Assn.,
Children's Hospital of Orange County and the Orange County Drowning
Prevention Network will kick off an awareness campaign by teaching
CPR to several hundred parents.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at how many pools there are in Orange County, it's
lucky that we don't have many more," said Dr. Gary Goodman, director
of the pediatric intensive care unit at CHOC's Mission Viejo branch.</TE>
<TE>   In 20 years of practicing medicine, Goodman has seen so many
children who have died or been left brain-damaged in the water that
he has lost count. "Let's just say it's a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Through them, he has learned not only about the physiology of
drowning, but the ecology of what allows it to occur and the
emotional scars it causes.</TE>
<TE>   He has seen children who have drowned in hot tubs, bathtubs,
toilets and buckets containing just a few inches of water. He knows
it takes only five minutes of oxygen deprivation to wipe clean the

<TE>   Preventable, and Thus Agonizing</TE>
<TE>   He has talked to parents who plucked their living child from a

children who die from disease, the parents of children who drown

<TE>   Because of what he has seen, Goodman, the father of two, won't own

<TE>   Kerr and her husband, Bill, on the other hand, decided after
Cody's death that they and their two daughters--too young at the time
to know how their brother died--would head back in the water.</TE>
<TE>   "We forced ourselves to ... sit in that pool," Kerr said. "We
needed to get our life back to normal. We didn't blame the water. We
blamed ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   The Kerrs dealt with grief by attacking it, and the issue of
drowning, head on. Marcia shares her story with parents in support

<HD>Fight for Park Pits Residents vs. Scouts</HD>
<DH>Recreation: South Pasadena sides with Girl Scouts in a
dispute with neighbors over how many hours they may use the tiny
facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Smack in the middle of South Pasadena's estate district is a patch of
park where children are discouraged from running around and
shrieking, families can't reserve space for a party and the jungle
gym was briefly condemned.</LD>
<LD>   But things didn't come to a name-calling head in the small,
usually child-friendly town until residents living near Eddie Park
messed with the Girl Scouts.</LD>
<LD>   It took nearly three hours to settle the dispute at a City Hall
meeting this week. The Girl Scouts won. Troops will be able to meet
77 hours a month at the park clubhouse, despite the neighbors'
attempt to restrict them to 39 hours.</LD>
<TE>   The months-long dispute gathered steam when Girl Scouts' parents
and other residents began to review city policies at Eddie Park,
where vigilant neighbors have long worked with city officials to win
special limits on park operations.</TE>
<TE>   In a park of less than one acre, for instance, visitors are not
allowed to barbecue or set up a moon bounce, as they can at the
city's three other parks. Fees to rent the clubhouse have quadrupled
since 1998, from $50 to $200.</TE>
<TE>   In response to neighbors' complaints about excessive use, the city
ended the reservations policy at Eddie to reduce organized
gatherings, which had included weddings and large birthday parties
with rental equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Two exceptions to the reservation policy were granted, but only to
Eddie Park neighbors. They book the grounds for their annual Fourth
of July party and barbecue and for an annual Greek-themed party.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, neighbors rejected the installation of donated
playground equipment, which was disassembled and stored in a city
basement until Boy Scouts retrieved it and installed it at the city's
Arroyo Park.</TE>
<TE>   Few had complained much about the special policies at little Eddie
Park, a pocket of green that includes an old three-story mansion with
towering columns. The property, located in South Pasadena's Marengo
Estate District, was willed to the town in 1934 by Ellen Mary Eddie,
who left virtually everything she owned to her faithful housekeeper
and the city.</TE>
<TE>   But late last year, parents and others mobilized when word spread
that Girls Scout troop meetings were under siege. When the Scouts
reluctantly agreed to cut back their meetings to appease neighbors,
petitions and letters started flying.</TE>
<TE>   In letters and public comments, dozens of residents accused the
neighbors of being whiny, elitist, even anti-Girl Scout. It was said
they were intent on turning a public park into a private yard.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, don't call us names," park neighbor Tuncer Toprakci said
to a packed crowd at the Wednesday night council meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Fran Norris Scoble, head of the all-girl Westridge School in
Pasadena, wrote a letter to the city on school stationery saying that
the increasing numbers of noisy Scouts "intrudes unduly on evening
time in the neighborhood." Scoble lives next door to the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Lash, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School who
happens to be a Brownie dad, weighed in: "This park, like all parks
in the city, belongs to the entire community," he said. "This is an
unfair, unequal enforcement of city policies that have been unduly
influenced by a small group of vocal neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   The council voted 3 to 2 to increase the Scouts' use of the
clubhouse. Siding with residents, the policy against reservations for
the grounds was kept in place. But neighbors will no longer have
exclusive use of the park for their two annual parties and the city
will study whether it is safe to barbecue at Eddie Park.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy Gewecke, a Scouting official, pledged the girls will be
responsible and considerate of neighbors, in adherence to Girl Scout
traditions.</TE>

<HD>Enrollment Is Up at County's 2-Year Colleges</HD>
<DH>Education: School officials credit a slow economy, as well
as marketing efforts and demographic changes, for the boost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A slumping economy, teamed with aggressive marketing and a growing
college-age population, helped hike spring enrollment at Ventura
County's three community colleges, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Oxnard College, the smallest of the two-year campuses, grew
fastest, adding 643 students--a nearly 9.5% increase. Moorpark
College's student body grew more than 7%, and enrollment at Ventura
College was up 2%.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Hall, math and science dean at Oxnard College, said the
growth at his campus was expected.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the result of outreach and recruitment and an effort to show
people that this is a premiere institution of higher learning in
Ventura County," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As an example of how such recruiting has paid off, Hall cited the
rapid growth of the college's addictive-disorders program, which
trains people for careers as drug and alcohol counselors. Enrollment
in the program grew from 225 to more than 400 students this year, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard College's student body now stands at 7,464, a record for
the spring semester and one-third more than the school registered
four years ago. And the number of Latinos attending the school
continues to climb, now representing 56% of the student population.</TE>
<TE>   With a spring head count of 13,796 students, Moorpark College
remains the county's largest community college. The addition of 943
students has been felt in nearly every academic department, said Eva
Conrad, Moorpark's executive vice president.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at what classes fill first, it's the basics--English,
math, Spanish and the sciences," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura College's more modest growth of 270 students reflects that
the school of 11,969 students is in an older area with fewer
college-age students, said Alisa Moore, a campus spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   College district officials believe that at least some of the
growth is due to corporate layoffs linked to the state's beleaguered
economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Bad news on the job front is usually good news for us," Moore
said. "When people lose their jobs, they often head back to school."
Moorpark College President James Walker said increased enrollment,
which averaged nearly 6% districtwide, could also reflect the
beginning of a population boom among the county's teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   The number of high school graduates in the county is expected to
increase by 36% within six years, Walker said, and most college-bound
seniors in the area attend local community colleges.</TE>
<TE>   District officials are touting the latest enrollment data to build
a case for a $356-million community college bond measure on the March
5 ballot. The bond money would be used to build and renovate
buildings, parking lots and athletic facilities at the colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Conrad of Moorpark College noted that her east county campus is
nearing its 15,000-student capacity. To accommodate demand, Moorpark
has already begun to offer weekend courses and is asking its faculty
to share offices.</TE>
<TE>   "We are out of space," she said. "We need new buildings, plain and
simple."</TE>

<HD>Cardenas Denies Getting Tribes to Back Hahn Bid</HD>
<DH>Ethics: Assemblyman says he did not play a behind-scenes
role in getting Indian groups to aid mayor's campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City) said Thursday that he did
nothing wrong in encouraging out-of-town American Indian tribes to
get involved in last year's mayoral race, in which they paid for
radio spots and mailers attacking Antonio Villaraigosa.</LD>
<LD>   A report by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said
there is evidence that Cardenas played a behind-the-scenes role in
enlisting help from the tribes that aided Mayor James K. Hahn's
winning campaign against Villaraigosa.</LD>
<LD>   The report, released Wednesday, said information on Cardenas'
actions has been referred to the city Ethics Commission for review.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm vindicated by that report," said Cardenas, a 2nd District
candidate for the City Council. "It says there was no criminal
wrongdoing. I have not done anything wrong."</TE>
<TE>   But his opponent in the March 5 council race, Wendy Greuel, said
in a statement that the report shows Cardenas is "engaging in a
repeated pattern of hide-and-seek with respect to campaign finance
and disclosure rules."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel noted that the Ethics Commission had fined Cardenas in
December for late disclosure of fund-raising activities.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas has contested and not paid the $1,560 in fines, even
though the commission denied his appeal.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation by the district attorney's office found
insufficient evidence to file criminal charges over links between
Hahn's campaign and the spending by three Native American tribes.</TE>
<TE>   But the report cited "serious questions" on whether Hahn
fund-raiser Daniel Weinstein improperly directed the tribes to send
mailers attacking Villaraigosa.</TE>
<TE>   A law that imposes spending limits on campaigns allows
expenditures by independent groups or individuals, provided there is
no coordination between them and the candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The $1,000-per-person cap on campaign contributions does not apply
to independent efforts.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2001, Cardenas told The Times he was not involved in the
independent campaign by the Morongo Band of Mission Indians against
Villaraigosa.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's report said "the investigation uncovered
some evidence that Assemblyman Tony Cardenas also may have been
involved in encouraging the three tribes to get involved in the Los
Angeles mayoral race, even though none of the tribes are located in
Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Morongo Band, the tribes are the Soboba Band of
Mission Indians and the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians.</TE>
<TE>   The report said there was evidence Cardenas participated in a May
21 conference call to tribal leaders, who had gathered at a Coco's
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   During the call, Cardenas had said "Weinstein would provide the
tribes with information on how to defeat Villaraigosa," according to
the report.</TE>
<TE>   The report also said investigators had information that Weinstein,
in a later conference call to the same meeting, discussed defeating
Villaraigosa.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas confirmed Thursday he had talked with the tribal leaders
by phone on May 21, but said he did not recall mentioning Weinstein.</TE>
<TE>   "They asked me about the mayor's race. I told them that Jim Hahn
was a great guy. I said he's the best guy to lead Los Angeles,"
Cardenas added.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor's report does not provide evidence that Cardenas
was acting on behalf of Hahn and his campaign, which would have
violated the law. Cardenas said he was acting alone.</TE>
<TE>   During the investigation, the report said, Hahn staff members said
they had no knowledge of Cardenas' involvement with the tribes, which
spent $350,000 to help defeat Villaraigosa. The report also said
Weinstein told investigators he had never informed Cardenas of
Weinstein's contacts with the tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said the report will be an issue in the race for the east
San Fernando Valley council seat. She questioned whether Cardenas had
been honest about his role.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas said he was truthful when he denied, before last April's
primary, that he had lobbied any tribes to become active in the
mayor's race.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Judge Won't Block State's School Exit Exam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A federal judge who is considering a challenge to the state's
mandated high school exit examination said Thursday that he does not
intend to block the test.</LD>
<LD>   "I am not of the opinion I want to stop this entire process," U.S.
District Judge Charles Breyer said during a court hearing here. "I am
of the opinion a test should go forward."</LD>
<LD>   Advocates for the disabled have challenged the test in a lawsuit,
charging that the exams are unfair to students who have reading
disabilities and other kinds of learning impairments.</LD>
<TE>   Rather than stopping the test for everyone, Breyer said, he is
more interested in determining whether he should order the state to
ensure that the disabled are accommodated.</TE>
<TE>   State officials say they already have pledged to help disabled
students by allowing them to use calculators or have someone read
them the test if their disability necessitates such aid.</TE>
<TE>   Breyer, however, noted that the state's policy for disabled
test-takers is not an ironclad guarantee that help for the students
will continue. "Policies change," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also expressed concern about students who might not be able to
pass the test even with accommodations from the state.</TE>
<TE>   California's Department of Education has argued that the
accommodations it will offer this year are sufficient to ensure that
disabled students who grasp high school requirements will pass the
exam.</TE>
<TE>   Breyer's ruling in the case is pending.</TE>

<LD>The venerable Farmers Market--that comfy, kitschy hangout for locals
and tourists at 3rd and Fairfax--is about to go uptown in a big way.</LD>
<LD>   With a bevy of tony shops opening in mid-March on the vast and
storied corner, the 68-year-old market is gearing up for some
extraordinary changes. Later-than-ever hours, for one. And the
likelihood of parking fees at a place where denizens have long been
able to stow their vehicles free for hours on end in the open-air lot
with little threat of retribution.</LD>
<LD>   The prospect of such a marked cultural shift at the beloved but
scruffy landmark has longtime merchants and customers abuzz.</LD>
<TE>   Customers seem eager for the longer hours and the greater variety
of retail options, as long as the market's quaint character survives.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm happy about it,'' said Chris DeCristo, a visual effects
supervisor at CBS Television City, just north of the market. ''When I
leave work, I'll be able to grab something to eat.''</TE>
<TE>   Laura Stegman of Westchester, lunching with her husband, Hugh,
worried about the prospect of parking charges. "If we had to pay more
than $1, we'd probably go somewhere else," she said. But, she said,
''we understand this land is very valuable and had to be developed.''</TE>
<TE>   Opinion among vendors is split. Many see the changes as an
unprecedented business opportunity. Others view the new 9 a.m.-to-9
p.m. hours (10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sundays) as a hardship for the
family-run stands that give the market much of its flavor. Gone, as
of mid-March, will be the days of shuttering the shop at 6:30 p.m. in
winter and 7 p.m. in summer.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of their opinion, the merchants know that times are
changing, just as the market's development-minded owners for years
have advised. For former Parisian Stephane Strouk, who gravitated to
the market in 1993 because of its European ambience and opened his
French Crepe Co. restaurant in the structure's smallest pocket, the
overhaul can't come soon enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to be great," he gushed one recent afternoon.
"If I could stay open 24 hours, I would do it."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the tenants, he suggested, are wary of the changes because
"they're not really, really businesspeople.</TE>
<TE>   "They just want to make enough to survive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Strouk, by contrast, has the unbridled ambitions of a natural-born
entrepreneur. The French Crepe Co. started with only 115 square feet;
he now has signed a lease for 7,000 square feet in the southeast
corner, which would be the largest space in the original market.</TE>
<TE>   On March 1, he plans to begin installing an international gourmet
market, to open in June, with what he boasts will be California's
largest selection of imported cheeses, cold cuts and groceries.</TE>
<TE>   In Strouk's view, more selling space and longer hours are part of
the solution to the market's problems.</TE>
<TE>   "What some tenants do not understand is their interest is the
landlord's," Strouk said. "If we did not have this big development
coming in, half the merchants would die."</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Magee, whose family has operated Magee's Kitchen and
Magee's House of Nuts at the market since it opened in 1934, is
another merchant who welcomes the changes, anticipating a return of
much of the venue's early glory.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, she recalled, the market stayed open until 8 at night
in the summers. In the 1970s, the owner and the merchants decided to
open on Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   But by the early 1980s, the market decided to cut back to the
earlier hours that have until now been the rule, with some exceptions
for merchants who have stayed open as late as 10 p.m. for late-night
crowds or special events.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very excited," Magee said. "We were getting to the point
where we really needed a change."</TE>
<TE>   The attitude could not be more different on the west patio, where
Charlie's Coffee Shop does a brisk breakfast and lunch trade but
fades after 3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't like it," Kyle Gilbert, son of owner Charlie Sue
Gilbert, said of the extended hours. "We have a hard enough time
finding employees to work regular hours. It's going to be a very big
hardship for us."</TE>
<TE>   Driving the Farmers Market revolution is the March 15 opening of
two large developments that have been constructed in tandem at the
site.</TE>
<TE>   The smaller, built by A.F. Gilmore Co. for $45 million, contains
170,000 square feet and will include Cost Plus World Market, Coffee
Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, Marmalade Cafe and the first Los Angeles location
for Sur La Table, a high-end cooking supply shop.</TE>
<TE>   That project is rising next to 575,000 square feet of upscale
stores in the Grove at Farmers Market, a $160-million venture of
Caruso Affiliated Holdings that is opening on property mostly to the
east of the original market along 3rd Street.</TE>
<TE>   Among occupants at the Grove will be Nordstrom, FAO Schwarz, Nike
Goddess, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and a 14-screen multiplex theater, with
a 3,500-space parking structure. A trolley will run from the Grove's
eastern edge to the Farmers Market.</TE>
<TE>   Parking fees have yet to be announced at either the Grove or the
market, but both developments appear to be leaning toward some period
of free parking with merchant validations.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Caruso, developer of the Grove, said he wanted to avoid the
hefty parking tabs that some outraged customers have incurred at the
new Hollywood &amp; Highland mall in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a major turnoff for the consumer," he said. "The parking
needs to be convenient and reasonably priced."</TE>
<TE>   But he added that "garages are expensive to operate. If you want
to operate them nicely, you have to spend the money to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Hank Hilty, Gilmore's president and chief executive, said
validations probably would be the best approach to controlling the
market's parking without annoying shoppers, especially since
construction has reduced the number of open-air parking spots by
several hundred. Merchants should view the changes at the Farmers
Market as a plus, said Richard Giss, a partner in the retail services
group at Deloitte &amp; Touche. But he understands why some vendors are
leery.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd expect the Grove, by creating a greater retail presence, to
help the Farmers Market," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But there's nothing so difficult for people to deal with as
change."</TE>

<HD>2 Die When Car Rear-Ends Truck</HD>
<DH>Accident: The Valley men were killed in a collision on the
118 Freeway that backed up morning rush-hour traffic for miles.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two San Fernando Valley men died Thursday when their car slammed into
a truck that had stalled on the Ronald Reagan Freeway, snarling
morning traffic for nearly four hours, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The car rear-ended the truck, which was stopped in a westbound
lane after having mechanical problems.</LD>
<LD>   The car's driver, Francisco Gonzalez, 23, of Pacoima, and his
uncle, Jose Gonzalez, 43, of Sun Valley, were killed in the accident,
which blocked two lanes of the freeway just east of Topanga Canyon
Boulevard, said California Highway Patrol Sgt. Louis Pravettone A
third person in the 1995 Ford Mustang, the driver's brother, Juan
Gonzalez, 29, of Pacoima, was taken to Providence Holy Cross Medical
Center in Mission Hills, where he was treated for facial cuts and
released, hospital officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The three had been heading to a tree-service job off Topanga
Canyon Boulevard, CHP Officer Derek Kawai said.</TE>
<TE>   None of the truck's three occupants was injured, Pravettone said.</TE>
<TE>   The truck's driver, Carlos Reynoso, 36, of Sylmar, was also
heading to work when his vehicle began having engine trouble, so he
tried to pull over, Pravettone said.</TE>
<TE>   The truck stalled before it could get to the shoulder. One car
managed to swerve around it, but the Mustang hit the truck and ended
up beneath it, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the Mustang was traveling 60 to 65 mph when it
collided with the truck.</TE>
<TE>   Crouching next to the freeway buffer after the accident, Reynoso
alternately cried and stared at the cars crawling by, shielding the
sun with his hand. He declined to comment on the accident Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The three right lanes of the freeway were blocked until about
10:30 a.m., causing a four-mile backup.</TE>

<HD>Probe of Enron's Influence Over FERC Is Urged</HD>
<DH>Controversy: State Sen. Peace says Congress should look at
the regulators' tardy response to energy crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Calling federal regulators the ''handmaiden'' of Enron Corp., a
California legislator is urging Congress to investigate Enron's
influence over the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Congress should expand its probe of the bankrupt energy giant to
include FERC, the nation's overseer of wholesale electricity markets,
state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) said this week.</LD>
<LD>   Peace was heavily involved in refining California's 1996
electricity deregulation plan, and has long blamed FERC for failing
to intervene forcefully when prices in California's electricity
market jumped to record levels starting in June 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The state senator wrote to Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles)
Wednesday and asked him to hold hearings to scrutinize the influence
of Enron on federal energy policy over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   ''Despite its recent actions,'' wrote Peace, ''FERC continues to
be a regulatory agency whose agenda, distorted for so many years by
Enron, serves the financial objectives of energy suppliers at the
expense of consumers who pay the bills.''</TE>
<TE>   It is clear, Peace wrote, ''that Enron inhibited FERC, under both
the Clinton and Bush administrations, from addressing the Western
energy crisis in a timely way.''</TE>
<TE>   FERC officials refused to comment, saying that they had not seen a
copy of the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman is a senior Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, one of a dozen congressional committees investigating the
Enron collapse.</TE>
<TE>   ''There's a lot of concern about FERC's action last year,'' said
Waxman's chief of staff, Phil Schiliro, ''so it very well may be an
area for scrutiny.''</TE>
<TE>   Enron was created in 1985 with the merger of two natural gas
pipeline companies. It took advantage of the federal deregulation of
natural gas to pioneer gas trading and marketing. Its then-chief
executive officer, Kenneth L. Lay, became a strong, politically savvy
advocate of deregulating the even more lucrative electricity
industry. Enron and its employees gave millions of dollars to local,
state and federal politicians, and Lay hired former employees of
government agencies, including the California Public Utilities
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The company experienced phenomenal growth in the 1990s. But Enron
collapsed quickly late last year amid revelations of underhanded
accounting and losses hidden behind complex deals. In December, Enron
became the largest company to file for bankruptcy in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   Peace argues that Enron's pro-market doctrine held sway over the
five presidential appointees and staff at FERC. As a result, he
argues, the agency was reluctant to impose price controls in the
Western electricity market or to punish companies accused of
manipulating prices.</TE>
<TE>   Today, with Enron executives facing lawsuits, potential criminal
charges and congressional investigations, the company's role in
California's yearlong electricity crisis is being dissected.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) asked FERC to
document meetings and telephone calls between the agency and Enron
executives. Gov. Gray Davis also has called on FERC to investigate
possible market manipulation by Enron.</TE>
<TE>   But Peace said the focus needs to reach back to the late 1980s,
when Congress and FERC made decisions benefiting companies like
Enron.</TE>
<TE>   ''This influence started in the first Bush administration, carried
through the Clinton administration and goes beyond the Capitol,''
said Peace. ''It goes to academia, it goes to the press.</TE>
<TE>   ''The reason FERC is critical,'' he said, ''is because, at the end
of the day, they're in charge. They're the policeman.''</TE>
<TE>   Peace argued in the summer of 2000 for price caps in California's
electricity market. FERC did not impose strong price controls until
June 2001. By then, months of spectacularly high wholesale
electricity prices had driven Pacific Gas &amp; Electric to bankruptcy
and forced the state to spend billions of dollars to keep power
flowing to utility customers.</TE>

<HD>Opponents Offer Similar Visions for 40th District</HD>
<DH>Election: Assembly rivals Cherny and Levine stress schools,
crime and traffic as key issues, but find reasons to bicker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Speaking to San Fernando Valley executives Thursday, the two
Democratic candidates for the 40th Assembly District seat stuck to
the topics of education, crime and traffic, and displayed just brief
flashes of the sniping that has become a hallmark of the race between
two political novices.</LD>
<LD>   Valley natives Lloyd Levine, 32, and Andrei Cherny, 26, repeated
stances they have taken in front of other groups and in their
campaign literature, and continued to compare endorsements and debate
who is more connected to the district.</LD>
<LD>   "You're not ready to represent this community," said Cherny, a
former White House speech writer and Assembly aide, to Levine, who
moved home recently from Sacramento, where he was an aide to an
assemblyman from the Inland Empire.</LD>
<TE>   Levine countered that he has "practical, hands-on experience"
writing legislation, while his opponent's work in Washington and for
Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) was largely
theoretical.</TE>
<TE>   Answering questions posed by The Executives, a networking group
that supports the Los Angeles Jewish Home for the Aging, Cherny and
Levine said, if elected, they would seek to make schools better,
streets safer and freeways more fluid--throughout the Valley, not
just in the southwestern district.</TE>
<TE>   "If you just cross the street, you're in a new district with the
same problems," Levine said.</TE>
<TE>   Both men said they oppose breaking the San Fernando Valley away
from Los Angeles but favor settling the secession question by ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The 40th District election is in November, but the seat is
expected to go to the winner of the Democratic primary March 5.
Democrats outnumber GOP voters in the district, which includes Van
Nuys, Reseda, Northridge, Canoga Park, North Hills and Woodland
Hills. Incumbent Hertzberg must give up the seat because of term
limits.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican who will compete in the November general election,
West Hills businesswoman Connie Friedman, did not attend Thursday's
forum because she was ill, organizers said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's debate was the Democratic candidates' second in front
of an audience. It will be shown on Time Warner cable. Another
interview, taped Wednesday, will be shown on Adelphia cable.</TE>

<HD>Frances Macgregor, 95; Social Scientist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frances Cooke Macgregor, who forged an eclectic career that included
professional photography, sociology, anthropology and pioneering work
with the psychological problems caused by facial deformities, has
died. She was 95.</LD>
<LD>   Macgregor, who wrote, photographed or co-wrote a half-dozen
scholarly books on subjects ranging from American Indians to plastic
surgery, died Dec. 24 of congestive heart failure in her Carmel,
Calif., home, said her executor, John Murphy.</LD>
<LD>   A professor at Cornell University Medical and Nursing School from
1954 to 1968, Macgregor later taught at the New York University
Medical Center's Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery.</LD>
<TE>   She is credited as the first scholar to document the major social
and psychological stresses of patients who suffer facial
disfigurement through birth, accident, disease or war. She
continually warned doctors to treat psychosocial problems associated
with even the most rudimentary cosmetic surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Changing a nose doesn't change a personality; not even if one
goes from ugly to pretty," she explained in a 1981 article in
Newsday. "... Has the nose been used as a scapegoat for human
shortcomings? Has it been wrongfully indicted as the reason for lack
of social success? If such are the considerations behind the
operation, then other emotional problems may surface."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Portland, Ore., on April 21, 1906, and reared in San
Rafael, Calif., Frances Cooke grew up steeped in helping those with
disabilities because of her parents' work with Guide Dogs for the
Blind.</TE>
<TE>   She earned a bachelor's degree in economics at UC Berkeley,
married anthropologist Gordon Macgregor and spent the next several
years following him through the West on his rounds for the U.S.
Bureau of Indian Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The photos she took on reservations during that period were turned
into her 1941 book, "Twentieth Century Indians." Those photographs
and other materials she collected to document the lives of Native
Americans in the 1930s are now a part of the Smithsonian Institution
in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Other photos she took crisscrossing the country became
illustrations for the book written by her friend Eleanor Roosevelt,
"This Is America," published in 1942.</TE>
<TE>   Macgregor collaborated with sociologist Margaret Mead, on the 1951
book "Growth and Culture: A Photographic Study of Balinese
Childhood."</TE>
<TE>   Intrigued by her various observations, Macgregor obtained a
master's degree in sociology and anthropology at the University of
Missouri in 1947. She did additional graduate study at Columbia
University and in the late 1940s became a research associate at NYU
College of Medicine, continuing work on psychological and
sociological aspects of facial deformities and plastic surgery.</TE>
<TE>   She interviewed hundreds of patients and their families, and over
the years wrote three books that became known to surgeons, nurses and
other medical personnel as "Macgregor's trilogy." Her research and
the three books--"Facial Deformities and Plastic Surgery,"
"Transformation and Identity" and "After Plastic Surgery"--fueled
development of many self-help and support groups for patients and
their families.</TE>

<HD>Gardena High Security Criticized</HD>
<DH>Education: Parents are angry about lockdown enforced after
shooting Wednesday. The school says it was LAPD's call. Police defend
action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irate parents criticized security procedures at Gardena High School
after a campus shooting Wednesday that wounded two students.</LD>
<LD>   Three suspects remained at large Thursday in the shooting of
16-year-old Stephanie Alonso and an unidentified 19-year-old male
student. The attackers approached them on campus, demanded money and
then shot them. The male student was later released from the
hospital, and authorities said Alonso's wounds were not
life-threatening. The complaints about campus safety were spurred by
both the shooting and a subsequent lockdown, during which police
searched the 25-acre campus classroom by classroom for the attackers.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the school's 2,300 students were released within minutes
of the afternoon shooting, but about 500 were confined to classrooms
for up to five hours.</LD>
<TE>   When the group of parents who had gathered outside the school
Wednesday night became angry, officials announced that the remaining
students would be bused to nearby Peary Middle School and released.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those parents returned Thursday morning to voice their
concerns in a hastily arranged series of meetings with school
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really mad at the school for not providing better security,"
said Mary Kohatsu, who said her daughter Dena is scheduled to
graduate in June. "They really need to do something different."</TE>
<TE>   Lapses in campus security were evident both during and after the
lockdown. At least one teacher was spotted sneaking students around a
locked gate Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a group of parents at the school complained when a
pizza delivery man, unchallenged, handed a stack of boxes through a
classroom window within sight of several police cruisers stationed in
front of the campus.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, a student rolled and lighted a fat marijuana cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Cole, a campus aide, said he and nine other such aides patrol
the school. But their limited hours mean that, at times, only one or
two of them are on duty, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents said they were disturbed by the way the lockdown
itself was conducted.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to teach my baby to jump the fence next time something
like this happens," said Elnora Oseguera, who said her asthmatic son
was held until nearly 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Another parent, Wanda Hardie, said she left her job in East Los
Angeles after hearing about the shooting and arrived at the school by
5 p.m., but wasn't able to pick up her twin daughters until nearly 10
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reason to bus 200 students to another school like
that," she said. "There was no communication with parents, no command
post for people to go to for information."</TE>
<TE>   School officials said the campus' emergency procedures were
superseded when the Los Angeles Police Department took command of the
crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   "Our normal procedure is to reunite parents with their children as
soon as possible," said Kevin J. Baker, a district spokesman. "The
decision to bus students to another location happened after the LAPD
took charge of the command center."</TE>
<TE>   Police officials defended their handling of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a multitude of agencies involved, but there was not a
chaotic scene at the location. It was completely controlled," said
Randy Brooks, an LAPD spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an understandable level of frustration when things aren't
done exactly the way people want, but we made it safe for everybody,"
Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   The high school is in a tiny piece of the city of Los Angeles that
is almost entirely surrounded by Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   The campus is policed jointly by the LAPD, Gardena Police
Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Police, who have made no arrests in the shooting, said the
investigation was continuing.</TE>
<TE>   Although police had said Wednesday that the suspects were two
current and one former student, they refused Thursday to confirm
that.</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Jones, Simon Trumpet Endorsements</HD>
<DH>Campaign: The underdogs in the GOP primary cover much of
the state, but front- runner Richard Riordan stays in background.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>While front-runner Richard Riordan stayed out of sight, the two other
candidates for the Republican nomination for governor sprinted up and
down California on Thursday, trying to build momentum before this
weekend's state party convention.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Bill Jones announced his endorsement by the
National Rifle Assn. at stops here and in Bakersfield, then headed to
Los Angeles to bash former Mayor Riordan for his connections to the
energy trading firm Enron.</LD>
<LD>   Businessman Bill Simon Jr. touted his endorsement from a longtime
friend, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary and vice
presidential nominee Jack Kemp, in Sacramento and at a San Francisco
fund-raiser.</LD>
<TE>   The candidates' activities demonstrated the difference between the
campaigns of the two underdogs.</TE>
<TE>   Simon spoke broadly about his plans for California and, taking a
page from Kemp, proclaimed that his proposed capital gains tax would
improve lives in the inner city.</TE>
<TE>   The ever-feisty Jones briefly basked in his NRA backing before
going after Riordan, who, he noted, has no public events in
California this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick Riordan has no organization, no track record in the
Republican Party, and in fact, to my knowledge, this week Dick
Riordan is nowhere to be found," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Citing Riordan's turn-the-other-cheek response to attack ads
launched by Gov. Gray Davis, Jones added: "If Mr. Riordan can't stand
up to Mr. Davis in a primary, he most certainly is not going to be
able to do it in a general election."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who has already dug into decade-old comments and
contributions to question Riordan's abortion rights record, launched
a new attack ad Wednesday in the Central Valley questioning his
commitment to the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Reference Made to Quote in Journal</TE>
<TE>   The 30-second commercial cites a 15-year-old interview with the
Los Angeles Business Journal during which Riordan said he did not
"personally ... support" the death penalty and statements last month
in which Riordan said he would be open to a temporary ban on its use.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it any wonder Riordan's own police officers in L.A. refused to
support him for governor?" the spot asks. The union representing the
Los Angeles Police Department's rank-and-file has endorsed Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has said he was misquoted in the Business Journal
interview and has stressed that he has always backed the death
penalty. In his statements last month on a moratorium, Riordan said:
"It's something I'd want to study. But basically I believe in the
death penalty, and I believe that we should have an open mind in
looking at whether it's done fairly."</TE>
<TE>   Before he was mayor, Riordan helped spearhead the recall of state
Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird, who opposed the death penalty, and
also helped lead the push for Proposition 115, which increased the
number of crimes that were eligible for the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "Since 1985, when the campaign against the Bird court began, every
action that Dick Riordan took was consistent with strong support of
the death penalty," said Kern County Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels, who
worked on both campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan spokeswoman Kim Serafin defended the former mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a surprise that, once again, Davis is using sleaze
tactics to distort Richard Riordan's record," she said. "Obviously
he's desperate to keep his job and he's doing desperate things to
distract from his own record of failing our state."</TE>
<TE>   The governor's early salvos at Riordan are an apparent reaction to
the lead the former mayor has opened up, both in fund-raising and the
polls, over his two rivals. They have spent the week trying to chip
away at that lead.</TE>
<TE>   Jones Proclaims Strong Party Loyalty</TE>
<TE>   At his NRA endorsement announcement, Jones questioned the
Republican credentials of his rivals, saying they reached out to the
GOP only when it suited them. "My granddaughter has gone to as many
Republican conventions as Bill Simon and Dick Riordan," said Jones,
who has held elective office as a Republican for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was accompanied by state NRA board member Manny Fernandez,
who said the secretary of state has a long record of protecting gun
owners' rights.</TE>
<TE>   Jones won an A+ rating from the NRA, Simon an A because he has not
held elected office.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan got an F.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't given him a G because there's no such letter in our
mailing card," Fernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez said the NRA would push its 400,000 members in
California to back Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Jones then rushed to Los Angeles, where he stood before the
headquarters of the Department of Water and Power and criticized
Riordan--who last month said he had never taken contributions from
bankrupt energy giant Enron--for raising $10,000 from the company for
a city proposition in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're running against Gray Davis, I can tell you, you better
be able to run against him as a Republican nominee on the issue of
energy," Jones said. "If you cannot, then you're setting aside one of
the biggest debacles that any governor has created in California in
history."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan spokeswoman Carolina Guevara said there was nothing
improper about the contribution, given for an initiative to let the
DWP sell energy in California's newly deregulated power market.
Riordan also received $500 from an Enron subsidiary for his
reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The Jones campaign is grasping at straws," Guevara said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Makes Most of Kemp's Support</TE>
<TE>   As usual, Simon stayed away from the back-and-forth Thursday,
basking in the glow of Kemp, a darling of Republican intellectuals
for pushing tax cuts while promoting issues of concern to minorities
and urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, at the beginning of the 21st century, California needs a
21st century governor," Kemp told reporters in Sacramento. "Bill
Simon is the one person in this race, Democrat and Republican, who
understands how important economic growth is to the budget of
California."</TE>
<TE>   Simon continued on Kemp's themes, saying that conservatives have
just as much compassion as liberals. He said his proposals for the
state budget, education and infrastructure are "all realistic
programs that are premised on the Kemp ideal: opportunity for
everyone, freedom, accountability, empowerment."</TE>

<HD>Hahn Offers Community Police Plan</HD>
<DH>Politics: Neighborhood activists cheer his vow to boost the
ranks of senior lead officers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD and JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn promised Thursday to bolster
community policing by speeding up the return of senior lead officers
to the field and dedicating five officers to the program for every 35
new recruits who join the department.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn's pledge, two days after he announced his opposition to a
second five-year term for Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, came at a
meeting with about 100 supportive neighborhood activists from around
the city who have been lobbying for the return of the senior lead
officers, who work as community liaisons.</LD>
<LD>   The activists gathered at the Van Nuys Library applauded Hahn's
opposition to Parks, saying they agree with the mayor's assessment
that the chief has been slow to restore the program he once
terminated.</LD>
<TE>   "It took a lot of courage to do what you've done," said North
Hills resident Harry Coleman, as people rose to their feet and gave
the mayor a sustained standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Horace Frank, spokesman for the LAPD, said later that he
wasn't familiar with details of Hahn's plan. But, he said, "the
chief's position has always been that every officer--every
officer--should be involved in community policing."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few days, Hahn has been pummeled by criticism from
African American political leaders angry that he is against the
reappointment of the black police chief. But in the San Fernando
Valley on Thursday, the mayor was thanked repeatedly by residents who
said he showed guts by making what is a politically unpopular
decision in some quarters.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor appeared moved by the show of support but quickly turned
the topic back to community policing.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate your comments, but I want to talk about what we need
to do to make the city safer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he is committed to returning all senior lead officers to
their posts and hopes to fully restore the program within six months.
Parks says the program has been restored and carried out in the form
mandated by an agreement with the police union approved by the Police
Commission and City Council.</TE>
<TE>   In the next few weeks, Hahn is going to present the commission
with a proposal to move five officers into senior lead positions for
every 35 new police cadets that bolster the LAPD's ranks, aides said.
The commision's five members, all Hahn appointees, are also due to
determine the fate of Parks, who said Wednesday that he is going
forward with his reappointment bid despite Hahn's request that he bow
out.</TE>
<TE>   Senior lead officers are praised by many residents as their only
direct link to the Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   When Parks became chief in 1997, he reassigned about 160 senior
lead officers to patrol duties, saying he wanted all patrol officers
to perform community-policing functions. The model employed by Parks
is similar to that used in several other cities.</TE>
<TE>   But the move produced a sharp backlash from many community groups,
and former Mayor Richard Riordan ultimately ordered Parks to restore
the program.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current program, senior lead officers can work up to
four days a week on community policing, but also must do patrol at
least one day a week.</TE>
<TE>   When he announced his opposition to the chief's reappointment
Tuesday, the mayor said he wants senior leads to be exempted from
patrol duties and charged that Parks has not pushed hard enough to
restore the program.</TE>
<TE>   Parks denies that.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Dan Koenig said further that senior lead officers are
not doing more than two days a week on patrol.</TE>
<TE>   But on Thursday, residents hotly disputed that, saying that in
many divisions the officers do community work only a couple times a
month.</TE>
<TE>   Boyle Heights resident Terry Gonzalez told the mayor at the forum
that the reduced hours of the senior lead officer in her neighborhood
have made a recent spate of killings even more difficult to cope
with.</TE>
<TE>   When shootings happen, Gonzalez said, the officer is "our
lifeline," providing information about places to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   "We have murders every single day of the week, not just the days
he's available," she said. "When our senior leads were taken away,
the department was taken away."</TE>
<TE>   Even as Hahn was warmly praised by some neighborhood activists on
Thursday, African American community leaders continued to lambaste
his opposition to the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and his staff don't take the black leaders who endorsed him
seriously, said Ken Lombard, the business partner of former Lakers
basketball star Earvin "Magic" Johnson. Nor, he added, do they "take
this community seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Lombard said Johnson is even flirting with the idea of running for
mayor "at the appropriate time" because of Hahn's decision. Last
year, when Johnson was a Hahn supporter, he also indicated a future
interest in the job.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Johnson clearly feels that this is an issue that the African
American community in Los Angeles will not forget," Lombard said.</TE>
<TE>   Some black officials, including Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los
Angeles), have said they may launch a recall effort against the man
they helped elect.</TE>
<TE>   That campaign could bring together an unlikely alliance of liberal
African American officials and discontented San Fernando Valley
residents who have been agitating to create a separate city.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of the secession group Valley VOTE, said
Thursday that he and other San Fernando Valley leaders have been
contacted in the last few days by black leaders from other parts of
the city about meeting to discuss a possible recall effort against
Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "If other, credible people organize such a campaign, I would look
favorably on participating," Close said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Hahn's opposition to a second Parks term is not an issue
for Valley leaders. "For us it's about broken promises," Close said,
citing the mayor's active opposition to Valley secession and inaction
on the expansion of Sunshine Canyon landfill.</TE>
<TE>   At Thursday's meeting with residents, City Councilman Dennis Zine,
who represents the West Valley, said he would fight such an effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to tell Mayor Hahn, I will stand behind him, side by
side," said the former police union official, linking arms with Hahn.
"If someone wants to recall Mayor Hahn, recall Dennis Zine."</TE>

<HD>Man Gets 15 Months for False Tax Claims</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Thursday sentenced a Sherman Oaks man to 15 months
in prison for fraudulently trying to get $1.2 million in federal tax
refunds.</LD>
<LD>   Chuck Nnamdi Opara, 32, stole 24 identities, which he used to file
fraudulent tax returns over the Internet, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman
for the U.S. attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Opara pleaded guilty in 2000 to two counts each of making false
claims to the government and identity theft.</LD>
<TE>   "This was a very orchestrated effort to make these claims," Mrozek
said. "But he didn't get a dime from the scheme because IRS red flags
went up."</TE>
<TE>   The Internal Revenue Service intercepted the returns before any
money was paid.</TE>
<TE>   Opara used insiders at area businesses to provide him with
customers' information and then set up mailboxes in each name, Mrozek
said. Opara sought refunds as high as $82,637.</TE>

<HD>Channel Islands Fish Reserve Plan Ready</HD>
<DH>Conservation: The proposal would ban angling in nearly 25%
of the area's waters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State and federal authorities recommend that nearly one-fourth of the
waters around the Channel Islands be placed off limits to fishing to
give severely depleted marine life a chance to recover.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed Channel Island reserves, culminating three years of
study and debate, will be publicly unveiled today before the
California Fish and Game Commission. The commissioners are expected
to make a decision by August.</LD>
<LD>   The recommended network of 13 marine reserves and conservation
areas that covers about 490 square miles is scattered around the five
islands that make up the Channel Islands National Park.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed no-fishing areas make up nearly one-fourth of the
Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, a buffer of partly
protected ocean that surrounds the islands.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its name, the marine sanctuary is no haven for
fish--except for a small area off Anacapa Island where fishing is
forbidden. The sanctuary was set up primarily to protect the waters
from offshore oil and gas drilling.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands now, only 0.2% of California's coastal waters is
off-limits to fishing.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed reserves for the Channel Islands reflect a growing
consensus among scientists and government officials that closing some
sections of the ocean to fishing offers the best hope of saving
species that continue to decline despite limits imposed on catch.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the size and location of the proposed reserves are the
subjects of fierce debate.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't one square inch of ocean that you could close and not
find someone screaming that their ox is being gored," said Warner
Chabot, vice president of the Oceans Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   Busloads of angry fishermen show up at every meeting to protest
what they see as a threat to their livelihood or their way of life.</TE>
<TE>   Today's commission meeting in Sacramento will be no exception. A
busload of 50 fishermen from the San Fernando Valley will be there
"to keep up the pressure," said trip organizer Sal Vallone, the owner
of Bob Sands Fishing Tackle in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   Vallone charters boats for 23 fishing trips a year to the Channel
Islands, and he figures the proposal to end or restrict fishing
around the islands will hurt his business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful idea, but the way they are doing it is very
wrong," Vallone said. "If you are going to make [marine] reserves,
make them so people can use them. All of their arguments have been to
benefit the fish, not the public's enjoyment."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists plan to release a public opinion poll today that
shows widespread support for marine reserves in California.
"Politicians should speak for the masses, not just the 150 angry
fishermen who show up at a public hearing," said Vikki Spruill,
executive director of SeaWeb, a marine conservation organization that
commissioned the poll.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 1,000 likely voters contacted by telephone last month as
part of the poll, 69% said they favored "fully protected areas" even
if that meant "you may no longer be able to fish in one of your
favorite places."</TE>
<TE>   Answering a question designed for this election year, the survey
found that 83% of the voters said it was important that "the governor
take a leadership role to make sure that at least some percentage of
California's ocean is fully protected from all extractive,
recreational and commercial activities."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, who has appointed most of the state's Fish and
Game commissioners, has not taken a public position on marine
reserves.</TE>
<TE>   But the Department of Fish and Game, part of the Davis
administration's Resources Agency, has joined with the federal
manager of the Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary to propose setting
aside 25% of the islands' waters for special protection.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed network includes 11 marine reserves, which would ban
all fishing, and two marine conservation areas, which would ban
fishing for bottom-dwelling rockfish, but allow the take of lobster
and migratory fish such as yellowtail and barracuda.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of scientists believes that closing 30% to 50% of the
waters is needed to cover all types of underwater habitat so that the
widest array of marine life can hide from hooks and nets long enough
to regenerate their numbers.</TE>
<TE>   The fishing industry wants 13% or less placed off limits. For now,
its representatives are pushing for the commission to take no action
and allow fishermen to resume negotiations with biologists and
environmentalists on drawing the maps.</TE>
<TE>   That is what is about to happen elsewhere in a separate statewide
effort to design a necklace of marine reserves along California's
entire 1,100-mile coast.</TE>
<TE>   State law required the plan to be finalized this year. But the
fishing lobby stirred up such a political storm that Fish and Game
officials coaxed the Legislature to postpone the deadline for more
than a year to allow for meetings with local fishermen on the size
and location of each reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Game officials believe that little would be gained by
more delays and more negotiations for the Channel Islands reserves.
Fishermen, environmentalists and biologists spent two years trying to
draw the boundaries before their talks fell apart.</TE>
<TE>   "The consensus-based approach showed you can only get people to go
so far," said Mike Chrisman, president of the Fish and Game
Commission. "It's our responsibility now to weigh all of the options,
the science and socioeconomic factors. Our hope is that by August we
will have a compromise that will work."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Attorney Acts the Part</HD>
<DH>John Gordon relishes running the L.A. office, even if it is
temporary. He focuses on making enduring changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John S. Gordon, a career prosecutor known for his work ethic, has
been making his mark while serving as temporary head of the U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles, the largest outside Washington,
D.C.</LD>
<LD>   After taking over 10 months ago, Gordon moved to streamline
operations in the 245-lawyer office, where he has spent virtually all
of his legal career.</LD>
<LD>   He ordered a review of all unresolved cases three years or older.
The result was a dramatic decline in a large backlog.</LD>
<TE>   Gordon also trimmed the number of managers in the U.S. attorney's
office, sending more attorneys into the trenches to prosecute
suspected criminals.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed more soldiers and fewer generals," he explained in a
recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   From his 12th-floor suite in the U.S. Courthouse in downtown Los
Angeles, Gordon rides herd over the prosecution of federal crimes in
a seven-county region with a population of 17 million extending from
Orange to San Luis Obispo counties. The office also represents the
Justice Department in civil litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The 43-year-old Gordon clearly relishes his job, even though he
knows he will have to relinquish the reins when President Bush
nominates a full-term successor to former U.S. Atty. Alejandro N.
Mayorkas. That might happen any day now.</TE>
<TE>   Mayorkas, a Democrat, stepped down last April as part of a
changing of the guard at federal prosecutors' offices around the
nation following the Republican presidential victory in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon, then serving as head of the criminal division, the No. 3
job in the office, was tapped by Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft to fill in
while the new administration looked for a replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Though there has been no official announcement from the White
House, Republican sources say the nomination will probably go to
Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Debra Yang, a former federal
prosecutor who has strong GOP credentials. The nomination requires
U.S. Senate confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon, an independent, initially declared that he was not
interested in the job. He changed his mind later and applied.</TE>
<TE>   "But I went nowhere," he joked. "I don't think I even got to the
second heat."</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for a new boss to be picked has been unsettling for some
prosecutors, but Gordon refuses to be distracted. He is all business,
coping with daily crises and making long-range plans intended to
outlast his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   After taking over last April, Gordon set out to reduce the backlog
of cases that were gathering dust. He ordered a review of all cases
three years or older in which no charges had been filed. Prosecutors
with aging, unresolved cases had to justify the delays.</TE>
<TE>   "Just by announcing the project, we motivated a lot of people to
clear them out because they didn't want the front office to know they
had a number of 3-year-old investigations," Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the 54 cases were taken to trial, some were settled with
plea agreements and others were thrown out. Much of the backlog is
now gone, Gordon said, adding, "Now, I believe, we're staying
current."</TE>
<TE>   Some prosecutors grumbled about the review but Gordon is
unapologetic.</TE>
<TE>   "I was never in the military, but I probably do run the office in
more of a military fashion than my predecessor," he said. "I don't
believe in mindless discipline, but I do believe in efficiency and I
do believe in the chain of command."</TE>
<TE>   That was borne out in a memorandum that Gordon ordered circulated
among the defense bar last year.</TE>
<TE>   Put simply, the message said: Don't buck the chain of command. If
you have a beef with a prosecutor, take it up with his section chief.
If that fails, write a letter to the chief of the criminal division
and, if that doesn't help, then write one to the U.S. attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the biggest names in the white-collar criminal defense bar
are former federal prosecutors who maintain their old ties to the
U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them were used to being able to ... just go straight to
the top," Gordon said. "Some of them got irritated that I was
formalizing a process that for many years was handled very
informally."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said he can recall incidents over the years in which
high-powered defense lawyers went over the heads of trial prosecutors
and their supervisors to make their case with top officials in the
U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "I firmly believe that's wrong," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The past year has seen a large turnover of personnel at the U.S.
attorney's office. Gordon has hired 21 new lawyers since he took
over.</TE>
<TE>   He said the office was "getting too top-heavy with titles and not
lean enough to prosecute cases," so he stopped filling some
supervisory slots and designated others as acting supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his loyalty to his staff, Gordon is not known as Mr.
Personality. He does not mince his words. Schmoozing with the staff
ranks low on his list of priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't do it when I was rising through the office," he said.
"My preference is to sit down, get your work done, be friendly and
nice, but not go around socializing."</TE>
<TE>   But Gordon said he does make a point of reaching out to his
prosecutors with words of support after every trial, regardless of
the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   The most notable cases handled on his watch have included former
Hollywood nightclub owner Eddie Nash's guilty plea to racketeering
charges; former Los Angeles Police Officer Rafael Perez's guilty plea
to civil rights violations; a guilty plea by Mark Jakob of El Segundo
to fabricating a news release that caused nearly $110 million in
losses to investors in Emulex Corp.; and the recent indictment of two
Jewish Defense League leaders in an alleged bombing plot.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assistant U.S. Atty. Duane Lyons, now in private practice,
worked under Gordon when he was prosecuting major drug traffickers
and money launderers.</TE>
<TE>   "People who don't know John very well may view him as standoffish
or wooden or unemotional," he said. "However, I don't think that's
fair."</TE>
<TE>   Lyons said Gordon took pains to make sure that his feelings did
not get in the way of his commitment to treating everyone fairly.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back on the last 10 months, Gordon recalled asking
Mayorkas as he was about to depart why he ever wanted to become U.S.
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to him, 'Isn't it more fun to be a trial lawyer or someone
who keeps his hand in it?' And he said something that has been borne
out by my experience. It's not more fun, but it's ultimately more
fulfilling and more satisfying to get to make the final decisions on
overall office direction, the big-case resolution, and on hiring and
promotions. So I have found this job satisfying and rewarding."</TE>
<TE>   What will he do when he has to vacate his office?</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here 17 1/2 years, and my heart is in being a federal
prosecutor," he said. "So my first preference would be to remain in
the upper level of management in the office. And if that's not in the
cards, then to go into private practice and do some white-collar
criminal and some civil."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon then worried aloud whether that comment might be
misunderstood by his new boss. He said he hopes it doesn't sound like
he is making any demands.</TE>

<HD>Farm Worker Is Killed in Somis Accident</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Woman is knocked from ladder by passing forklift.
She is third field laborer to die on the job in past year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 28-year-old farm worker picking lemons in a Somis grove was killed
Thursday when she sustained massive head injuries after being knocked
off a ladder by a passing forklift.</LD>
<LD>   Olivia Hernandez of Santa Paula was pronounced dead at St. John's
Regional Medical Center in Oxnard about an hour after the 11:40 a.m.
accident, said Craig Stevens, a senior deputy medical examiner for
Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez became the third farm worker killed during an on-the-job
accident in Ventura County in the past year and the eighth in 1 1/2
years. She was among 26 farm workers at an 85-acre grove on Aggen
Road, about half a mile north of California 118 when the accident
occurred.</LD>
<TE>   Stevens said Hernandez was three to four feet above the ground
when a forklift jarred her ladder and she fell and struck her head on
a section of hard dirt. She had few visible signs of head trauma, but
most likely suffered massive internal head injuries, Stevens said.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy is set for today.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators from Cal/OSHA spent much of the afternoon
interviewing employees and retracing the events leading up to the
accident. Dean Fryer, a spokesman for the state safety agency, said
many questions remain. Investigators, for instance, were unsure
whether Hernandez's head first struck the forklift.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said there was nothing on the straddle forklift--designed
to pick up large boxes or containers--to indicate Hernandez had
struck the vehicle before the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Several employees pulled Hernandez from under the trees and
attempted to revive her until paramedics arrived, said Carlos
Quintino, a foreman at the farm.</TE>
<TE>   Fryer said Hernandez was an employee of farm labor contractor
Da-Vir Industries Ltd. of Ventura. He said the company's safety
record was unblemished except for minor health violations involving
worker cleanliness.</TE>
<TE>   The farm is operated by the D.F.K. Corp. in Somis, Quintino said.
No one answered the phone Thursday at the company's office.</TE>
<TE>   Since last spring, two other farm employees have been killed on
the job. In November, a 65-year-old tractor driver was killed when he
attempted to cross an unguarded section of railroad track near
Camarillo and was struck by an Amtrak train.</TE>
<TE>   In April, a 79-year-old labor contractor from Fillmore died when
he was run over by a forklift driven by one of his employees at
Calleguas Ranch in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Fryer said an investigation into Thursday's accident could take up
to three months and bring a penalty of between a "a few hundred and
$25,000."</TE>
<TE>   Since the agency began a statewide program in 1999 to increase
awareness of farm hazards for workers, the number of fatal accidents
has declined.</TE>
<TE>   There were 39 farm worker deaths in 1999 and 16 reported in 2000.
Numbers for 2001 were not available, Fryer said.</TE>
<TE>   The program includes safety classes for farm workers and owners as
well as periodic inspections of equipment and working conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "You are out there in the weather and the elements and it's
dangerous work," Fryer said. "It's very difficult and strenuous work
especially when you have equipment moving around."</TE>

<LD>I was standing next to Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden on
Tuesday when he went on and on about how shocked and appalled he was
that Mayor Jim Hahn gave thumbs down to Police Chief Bernard Parks.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an insult to my community," Holden promised, and I'm sure he
had to be right, because, Lord knows, the entire African American
community thinks with one mind.</LD>
<LD>   I was shocked too, but not by Hahn. I was shocked that Holden
would show his face in public six weeks after the Ethics Commission
fingered him for 31 campaign violations.</LD>
<TE>   I would have suspected that such a rip-off, with penalties that
could run as high as $155,000, might constitute an insult to Holden's
community.</TE>
<TE>   But I'm still learning.</TE>
<TE>   As you know by now, there's some talk of recall because of Mayor
Hahn's bar mitzvah moment Tuesday, in which he kicked off Black
History Month by telling Parks to get lost. Very smooth on the
timing. I can't wait to see what Latino Hahn wrestles to the ground
to ring in Cinco de Mayo.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of a recall, by the way, is fine by me. I like the sound
of revolution now and then, but we ought to broaden the focus.</TE>
<TE>   Why not recall Holden, or does everyone in the "community" think
it's fine for him to thumb his nose at campaign law every time he
runs for reelection? Why not recall City Council President Alex
Padilla, who got smacked with $79,000 in fines last month for his own
campaign violations?</TE>
<TE>   "A recall is certainly something that has to be discussed by the
leadership of the black community," U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters said
about Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   I trust that Maxine Waters knows what she's talking about, but the
turnout at a protest rally in Leimert Park on Wednesday night
suggests otherwise. Only about 50 people showed up to chant, "Hey
hey, ho ho, Mayor Hahn has got to go."</TE>
<TE>   (Just as an aside, the mayor is not the Cat in a Hat, so let's
work on a better verse for the next rally.)</TE>
<TE>   I'm wondering if Holden and Waters really represent the
communities they claim to. Here they are blowing their horns, but
there appears to be no army falling in line behind them. Maybe people
are smarter than their leaders give them credit for.</TE>
<TE>   In the past week, I've made three visits to the East L.A. home of
a family that's been devastated by a tragedy that's become too
familiar.</TE>
<TE>   A father and his two stepsons, working as unarmed security guards,
saw a gangbanger spray-painting a wall in South-Central Los Angeles
and tried to stop him. He turned on them with a semiautomatic rifle,
killing 18-year-old Luis Gamez and critically wounding his
21-year-old brother, Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   The detective on the case tells me it was one of 13 homicides in
the 77th Street Division in January alone.</TE>
<TE>   Is anyone shocked by that?</TE>
<TE>   Is anyone appalled at the spreading stain of blood?</TE>
<TE>   Does anyone think maybe the leadership ought to have a discussion?</TE>
<TE>   We're three months away from the 10-year anniversary of rioting
after the acquittal of Rodney King's posse.</TE>
<TE>   The last thing we need is for professional agitators to rally
support for themselves by framing Hahn's difference with Parks
entirely in racial terms.</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully there have been other voices in the African American
community. People like civil rights attorney Connie Rice, who saw
Hahn's move as a matter of policy rather than race.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't help that the predominantly white Police Protective
League, with nothing but shades of pale on its board of directors,
has saddled up and ridden hard after two black chiefs in a row.
There's not a doubt in my head that some of those cowboys just can't
stomach being told what to do by a black boss.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a mistake to ignore racism in the LAPD in
understanding why there's opposition to Parks," says USC law
professor Erwin Chemerinsky. "There's a long history of racism in the
department. But it would also be a mistake to attribute all this to
racism and ignore the complaints against Parks from officers of all
races."</TE>
<TE>   But I don't think the union had much to do with Hahn's decision,
which was made without racial motivation.</TE>
<TE>   For Parks' defenders, I'd like to point out that you can be a
strict disciplinarian and still be a lousy manager. You can be a man
of honor and integrity and still fail as a leader.</TE>
<TE>   That's the Bernie Parks story.</TE>
<TE>   "The irony," says Chemerinsky, "is that if Parks were of a
different race and had this record on police reform, the African
American community would almost certainly be calling for his ouster."</TE>
<TE>   There's a stink in this department that goes back decades, and the
only way to get it out is to open the windows and let the wind blow
through.</TE>
<TE>   Black, white, magenta, it doesn't matter who follows, as long as
he isn't from within.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody who came up through the muck of the LAPD has any idea what
fresh air smells like.</TE>

<HD>Princess Marcella Borghese, 90; Socialite Created Line of
Cosmetics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Princess Marcella Borghese, an Italian socialite who turned a small
line of lipsticks into a skin care and cosmetics brand sold in
exclusive stores around the world, has died at age 90.</LD>
<LD>   Borghese died Jan. 19 at her home in Montreux, Switzerland, her
family said Thursday. She was buried in the family crypt at the
Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.</LD>
<LD>   Born Marcella Fazi, Borghese joined the Roman noble family in 1937
with her wedding to Prince Paolo Borghese, the duke of Bomarzo. The
prince, who died in 1985, was part of a family linked to the arts and
the history of Italy since the Middle Ages. It produced one pope --
Paul V -- as well as Rome's most famous public park and one of its
loveliest art galleries, the Galleria Borghese.</LD>
<TE>   For generations, the family had had their cosmetics made for them,
mainly from fruits and other natural ingredients. Marcella Borghese
had lipsticks made for herself that were color-coordinated to her
wardrobe.</TE>
<TE>   When her children were older and she had time on her hands, she
decided to take that idea into the cosmetics business.</TE>
<TE>   She had her personal chemist create samples of eight lipsticks and
asked eight Italian designers to make outfits to match each shade.</TE>
<TE>   In 1956 she came to the United States with three models, the eight
lipsticks and the designer clothes to launch Princess Marcella
Borghese Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary of Revlon Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Her line, comprising upscale skin products and makeup as well as
spa treatments, is sold in some of the most exclusive department
stores. Revlon sold the company to Saudi investors in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The princess remained involved with the line until recently, her
son, Livio, said in a telephone interview from New York. "She never
really left the company," he said, adding that his mother died
peacefully.</TE>
<TE>   The princess is survived by Livio; his twin, Francesco; Anita
Mauritzi of Rome, her daughter from her first marriage; and seven
grandchildren. A memorial Mass is scheduled for Feb. 19 at St.
Patrick's Cathedral in New York.</TE>

<HD>Designing Olympic Glory on Metal</HD>
<DH>Athletics: A Pasadena firm creates the gold, silver and
bronze medals awarded at the games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brent Watts' design firm has created packaging for Hot Wheels,
marketed the Muppets and built a massive Fifth Avenue window display
for the upcoming "Cat in the Hat" movie.</LD>
<LD>   But this week, the Pasadena company's tiniest creation--measuring
4 inches high and 3.25 inches wide--will attract worldwide attention.
A design cast in gold, silver and bronze will be Watts' legacy: the
2002 Salt Lake City Olympic medal.</LD>
<LD>   Designing an Olympic medal requires distilling all the symbolism
of the games into one inanimate object. A medal must capture the
pursuit of athletic excellence. It must allude to the theme and
setting of the games. And it must do it all in a space no bigger than
the palm of your hand.</LD>
<TE>   But the challenge--and reward--of an Olympic commission is the
chance for an artisan to create something for the ages. "In this
business," Watts said, "it's all about what resonates the longest."</TE>
<TE>   Creating an Olympic medal is a time-consuming, painstaking
process. What began in mid-2000 with an invitation to participate in
a design competition and a few rough ideas in Watts' sketchbook has
for the last year taken a team of artists, a sculptor, a die-cutter,
an engraver and a 1,000-ton metal press to produce. The finished
medals--which weigh slightly more than a pound each--will be on view
when the games begin Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In ancient times, Olympians were awarded an olive wreath, a prize
that was instituted at the suggestion of the Oracle at Delphi. But
since the start of the modern games in 1896, medals--often created by
local artisans--have been given out in gold, silver and bronze.</TE>
<TE>   The International Olympic Committee has strict rules governing the
design of medals for the Summer Games, but organizers of the Winter
Games have always had free reign over the look and content of their
medals. Winter Olympic medals have in the past been square, colored
and even made of stone and crystal.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting Utah's Beauty</TE>
<TE>   In Salt Lake City, Organizing Committee members had a clear idea
of what they wanted their medals to be, said Chairman Mitt Romney.
They wanted something that would be rendered completely in metal--in
part because O.C. Tanner, a Utah company that makes employee
recognition products and is a sponsor of the games, already had been
chosen to craft the medals.</TE>
<TE>   They wanted something that would reflect Utah's natural beauty,
either in shape or design. And they wanted something distinctive. A
proposal submitted by one of the 100 competitors in the design
competition was rejected because its pine-cone decorations were too
reminiscent of the 1992 Albertville, France, medal.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, said Romney, "I wanted something that was art and not
just beautiful graphic work. Something that connected with the theme
of our games--'Light the fire within'--that showed how these athletes
overcome the challenges of the snow and ice in mountain venues to
achieve their dreams and inspire others. There's a metaphor in what
they do, and I was looking for a metaphor."</TE>
<TE>   Watts, president of Axiom Designed Communications, said he usually
avoids entering competitions. But to Watts, a native of Utah, this
one was different.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at what this assignment means, what it means for an
athlete to receive a medal," Watts said recently at Axiom's airy
Pasadena studio. "The victory medal must represent certain things. We
looked at the history of athletes in competition. And we looked at
the historical products of the medals that had been previously
awarded."</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by Sculptures</TE>
<TE>   Watts studied pictures of Native American jewelry, rugs and
blankets. He admired the organic shapes of Eskimo art. He drew
inspiration from classic representations of the athlete as victor,
such as those found on Greek urns. On a family vacation in Warsaw, he
bought three Communist-era medals in an antique store that ultimately
helped him choose a weathered patina for the 2002 medals.</TE>
<TE>   And, perhaps most important, Watts stared long and hard at
Michelangelo's series of "slave" sculptures, originally conceived for
the tomb of Pope Julius II in the early 1500s. The statues, which
appear to be unfinished, depict figures seemingly emerging from their
still roughhewn marble blocks.</TE>
<TE>   Michelangelo once described the art of sculpting as liberating the
figure imprisoned in the marble. And the Axiom-designed medal echoes
that sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   The front of the medal is a direct descendant of those slave
statues, which many have argued were purposely given an incomplete
look. A central figure, torch in hand, seems to be emerging from the
medal, breaking free of the rock or ice that serves as a backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted the content to be about this forging forward, this
emerging from," said Watts. "We all came west, we conquered and
forged, and so a representation of that was appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   For the reverse of the medal, Romney asked Axiom to use another
design that the firm had submitted--an almost gender-neutral
rendering of Nike, goddess of victory, her hand cupped around the
circumference of the medal. Originally, she breathed frost onto the
face of the medal, but IOC members raised a fear that the frost would
be mistaken for smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Nike, everyone quickly agreed, could not be caught with a
cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   And so, in the final version of the medal, Nike clasps an olive
leaf in her hand, an homage to the ancient games. Behind her,
depending on which sport the medal is awarded in, will be one of 15
different scenes, from ice rinks to ski slopes.</TE>
<TE>   Watts, Romney and the Salt Lake Olympic Committee agreed on the 15
settings after talking to a focus group of Olympians about what they
liked and disliked about their medals from past games. It became
clear that figure skaters viewed their sport differently from those
who compete in the biathlon.</TE>
<TE>   "They said it would be an Olympian's dream that his or her sport
was featured on the medal somehow," said Romney. "To engrave the name
of the sport on a medal, as we do, is not new. But to have a sculpted
depiction of the sport, that's a first."</TE>
<TE>   Medal's Shape Is Organic</TE>
<TE>   There are many things that make the 2002 medal unique. It is
wider, thicker and heavier than any before it. All of the precious
metals, including the 6 grams of gold used in each gold medal (the
rest is mostly silver), were mined in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the shape of the medal, a not-quite-perfect
circle. This organic form, said Romney, makes the medal look as if it
"had been taken from a Utah river."</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to specifically show the mountainous West," said
Watts, "but we wanted to allude to it."</TE>
<TE>   To craft such a shape, the medals were pressed with 2 million
pounds of pressure and then finished by hand. Each medal took about
20 hours to create.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 861 medals were produced for the 2002 games. At least 477
will be awarded during the Olympics; the rest were made in case of
ties and for the IOC to archive at its museum in Lausanne,
Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that so few medals will be awarded, said Jim
Greensfelder, coauthor of "Olympic Medals: A Reference Guide," makes
them incredibly collectible. Although participation medals--smaller
medallions awarded to all who compete in Olympic games--have been
sold and traded for years, the buying and selling of prize medals is
a recent phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   "For collectors," said Greensfelder, "rarity is more important
than beauty."</TE>
<TE>   "More than anything else," said Mike Paganos, the founder of
Coubertin.com, an online Olympic collectors' auction, "the fact that
they are Olympic medals makes them desirable and valuable."</TE>
<TE>   When Olympic medals do appear at auction, they usually have little
information about the athlete who won them. (Most are from team
sports, in which many awards are given out for a single event.) But
many Olympic collectors said that most medals they see at auction are
sold by athletes in the former Soviet republics.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even without a clear provenance, prize medals have fetched
between $3,000 and $7,000 apiece at recent auctions. A gold medal
from the 1992 Barcelona Summer Games, awarded in baseball, sold last
week on EBay for $3,100.</TE>
<TE>   "The demand for these medals," Paganos said, "has markedly
increased in the last five years. I believe the potential for
dramatic appreciation is now there."</TE>
<TE>   When asked which medal he covets, Paganos replied that he likes
"the more unusual medals, because many of the medals have similar or
very plain designs." He cited the medal for the 1998 Nagano Winter
Games as among his favorites. "It has a wonderful texture. It is a
'touchy- feely' medal very different from any other."</TE>
<TE>   The Nagano medal, which highlights several Japanese arts,
including cloisonne and makie, a technique for applying gold and
silver powder to a lacquered surface, is the most recent example of
how medals attempt to evoke the host country or region. The 1972
Sapporo, Japan, medal, the first square design, depicted a ski trail
reminiscent of a Zen garden. The medal for the 1994 Lillehammer games
contained sparagmite, a Norwegian stone extracted from a site that
became the Olympic ski jump.</TE>
<TE>   And the medal for the 1992 games in Albertville, manufactured by
Lalique, was almost entirely crystal set in gold, silver and bronze.
That medal, said Olympic collector Craig Perlow, has rarely appeared
at auction.</TE>
<TE>   "That's probably because it's fairly recent, but also because the
people fortunate enough to be awarded them want to hold on to them,"
he said. "It's a beautiful medal."</TE>
<TE>   An Olympic medal, Perlow said, exudes a unique power.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, there is nothing more important than being able to capture
that moment in time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The place where it was won was part of it. The event is a part of
it. But it's that moment in time--a unique and singularly important
one--that that medal freezes forever."</TE>

<HD>Teacher Faces 19 Counts in Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Camarillo: Investigation of alleged lewd conduct now
involves at least five teen boys. Student reactions range from shock
to ambivalence.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Camarillo High School teacher accused of sexual misconduct with a
17-year-old student was charged Thursday with multiple felony counts
involving four other teenage boys.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors filed a 19-count complaint against Chad Wenzlick
Pridgen, 30, three days after the science teacher and tennis coach
was arrested on suspicion of trying to seduce a minor using
pornography.</LD>
<LD>   A dozen of the charges allege oral copulation with a minor,
including one forced incident.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted, Pridgen could face a maximum of 18 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen, who remains in custody in lieu of $250,000 bail, appeared
at a brief hearing in Ventura County Superior Court but did not enter
a plea.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled for arraignment Feb. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Stephen Sitkoff refused to comment on behalf of
his client, saying, "Cases should be tried in court."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Ridley said authorities are continuing
to interview possible victims and more charges may be filed against
Pridgen.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators said Thursday afternoon they believed they
had found a sixth victim.</TE>
<TE>   "We are learning new things hourly," Ridley said.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen was arrested Tuesday night at his Camarillo home after a
weeklong sheriff's investigation, prompted by a report from a
student, now 18, that the teacher showed him pornography, gave him
alcohol and behaved lewdly in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley would not comment on the facts of the case, including
whether the other teenagers accusing Pridgen of molestation are also
Camarillo High School students.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Oxnard Union High School District officials have placed
Pridgen on paid leave pending the outcome of their own investigation.</TE>
<TE>   School board members will review the matter at their meeting
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   For now, a substitute teacher will take over Pridgen's course
load, which includes four Advanced Placement science classes,
Camarillo High School Principal Sylvia Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   School officials also have arranged for Oxnard High School's AP
science teacher to tutor Pridgen's environmental science and
chemistry students one day a week.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the time of year when preparation for the AP exams in May
becomes very intense," Jackson said. "We're going to try to support
them as best we can."</TE>
<TE>   As for Pridgen's other duties, Jackson said the school's athletic
director will temporarily coach the boys' tennis team.</TE>
<TE>   Another Camarillo High teacher also has agreed to take over the
school's Envirothon team, which competes in academic contests about
environmental issues.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Pridgen took seven students to the national
competition in Mississippi, where they came in 10th.</TE>
<TE>   At the high school Thursday, reactions to Pridgen's arrest ranged
from shock to ambivalence.</TE>
<TE>   "This is totally unexpected to me," said freshman Tyler Perez, 14.
"Now I have to think about my teachers when I go into class."</TE>
<TE>   But senior Meagan Martinez, 18, said Pridgen's arrest was not seen
as a major disruption by some students.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids were surprised but most weren't impacted. You'd like to
think that it's not common, but stuff like this goes on everywhere,"
she said. "There is so much else going on right now, like prom and
college, that it's not that big a deal."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said that is the message she and other administrators are
trying to send to students and teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "It is tough, but what we have to do is focus on why we are here,
and that's for student learning," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to rely on our professional and collegial relationships
and just get through this."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Timothy Hughes contributed to this report.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The board of the NAACP's Long Beach chapter voted Thursday to condemn
the fatal police shooting last month of a knife-wielding
schizophrenic woman, which has led to a deluge of concern in the
black community.</LD>
<LD>   The 15-member board unanimously approved a resolution that demands
a meeting with Long Beach city officials "and assignment of a
community relations team to address African American concerns of
police brutality and excessive force."</LD>
<LD>   The resolution will be presented to the chapter's 300 members at
its monthly meeting Feb. 17.</LD>
<TE>   Community concern has been mounting since the Jan. 19 shooting of
Marcella Byrd, and by mid-afternoon Thursday word of the charged
NAACP board meeting and vote had leaked out.</TE>
<TE>   A protest rally is planned for 3 p.m. Saturday at Lincoln Park
beside the main downtown library, organized by the Peace Action
Network, a group concerned with broad civil rights issues. The rally
will start at the park, and participants are set to march a few
blocks away to Top Valu Market, where Byrd's failure to pay for
groceries launched her into her fatal encounter with police.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, 57, who was 5-foot-3, weighed 277 pounds and was wearing
high heels at the time, allegedly displayed a kitchen knife with an
8-inch blade when store workers confronted her in the parking lot.
They backed off and called police, who located her after 11 a.m. that
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   First one officer, then several, ordered Byrd to stop and drop her
knife, and she did neither. As she started to cross the street toward
a Gold's Gym and the downtown restaurant district, officers fired
pellet-filled bean bags at Byrd. The department said these did not
stop her and seemed to infuriate her, at which point she raised her
knife as if to throw it.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials would not say whether the knife was raised over
Byrd's head but said officers believed they were in danger. At least
three fired at Byrd, who was wounded numerous times in the torso and
died a few hours later in surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Her survivors--a son, daughter and sister--have said they intend
to file a wrongful death lawsuit against the city.</TE>
<TE>   The NAACP's board meeting was its first since the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Chapter president Naomi Rainey said the organization's board
meetings are confidential and its rules prevented her from discussing
the resolution before it was voted on by the general membership.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a heated discussion, I will say that," she said, adding
that it focused on members' concerns about the shooting and "the
treatment of African Americans by the police department."</TE>
<TE>   Investigations into the shooting are underway by the department
and by the L.A. coroner and district attorney's offices, which
routinely examine officer-involved deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Jerome Vance, who has been closely involved in the
investigation, was surprised to learn of the NAACP board's position,
said Sgt. Steve Filippini, a department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been meeting with community groups to discuss their
concerns, and he already met with the president of the NAACP,"
Filippini said. "He just met with the gal, so it's a little funny the
way it's come out."</TE>
<TE>   Several sources on the NAACP board said the condemnation
resolution is unusual for the chapter. But Byrd attended church with
the chapter's secretary, a school teacher, one board member said,
adding: "This time it's close to home, someone we know."</TE>

<HD>Driver Gets a 5-Ring Circuit</HD>
<DH>Olympics: OCTA veteran says ferrying athletes to
competition is the 'highlight of my career.'</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The competition to get to the Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City
was stiff. You had to be among the best, with years of experience
under your belt. Now, the lucky few will have to perform under
pressure as the world watches.</LD>
<LD>   We're talking here about the bus drivers, of course.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience," said Mark Goldberg, a
26-year veteran of the Orange County Transportation Authority who is
among hundreds of bus drivers nationwide who have been hired to ferry
spectators to and from Olympic events.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll probably retire in two years. This will be the highlight of
my career."</TE>
<TE>   While the athletes compete for medals to hang around their necks,
Goldberg and his fellow drivers already have their reward: badges
that identify them as "Drivers for the Gold."</TE>
<TE>   "It's very cool," said Goldberg, 55, of Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   The Utah Transportation Authority has rented 900 buses from
transit agencies from as far away as New York and Texas. Among them
are 60 OCTA buses that recently were taken out of service and sitting
idle.</TE>
<TE>   "They're old buses, but they're still in good shape," OCTA
spokesman George Urch said.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg is one of 41 OCTA drivers in Utah for the games.</TE>
<TE>   To get the job, they had to have at least 20 years' experience, a
safe driving record and pass security clearances.</TE>
<TE>   "They also asked, 'Have you ever driven in snow before? Have you
ever driven on ice before?' " Goldberg said by telephone from Utah,
where he's using three weeks of vacation for the adventure.</TE>
<TE>   The drivers get paid, meals and lodging. Goldberg is bunking at a
Motel 6.</TE>
<TE>   But it's a Motel 6 at the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   His normal route is the 71 Line, from Balboa Peninsula to Tustin,
Yorba Linda and back.</TE>
<TE>   For the next few weeks, his route will be the 10-minute drive from
a parking lot to the Snow Basin Ski Area where the downhill
competition will be held.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg doesn't have tickets, but from where he parks his bus, he
can see the course out his front window.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good seat," he said. "It's heated."</TE>

<LD>Hot heads: The crime blotter of the Saddleback Valley News reported
that a store manager "and a female customer were fighting over hair
products."</LD>
<LD>   Moving on to food fights: An assault case against a Rancho Santa
Margarita woman accused of whacking a friend with a peanut butter
sandwich has been dismissed for lack of evidence, the Dana Point News
said.</LD>
<LD>   Joy DuBord of Dana Point alleged that she was struck on the side
of the head during a dispute with Sandra Guba over the affections of
a massage therapist last July. Guba denied the attack--termed a
sticky-up by some--and said she did nothing more than sprinkle crumbs
on DuBord.</LD>
<TE>   Media outlets from here to Denmark covered the messy case. One
television station had DuBord reenact the incident.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, professional courtesy dictates that I mention that it
was Ricky Young of the Orange County Register who revealed the brand
of peanut butter involved was Jif.</TE>
<TE>   Can't we all get along? Then there's this from the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise: "An opossum on a garage shelf kept hissing at the
resident and would not leave."</TE>
<TE>   On the road: Who wouldn't want to get on the road with all this
local strife? On a visit to Washington, D.C., Alice Clifner of
Mission Viejo caught a couple of workers who looked as though they
were part of a "Paint by Number" display (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of numbers: Here are some figures that apparently were
certified by Arthur Andersen (see accompanying):</TE>
<TE>   * An ad for a cooling system that would prompt customers to wait
until the sale was over (Daniel Giang, Yucaipa).</TE>
<TE>   * An NFL toy for extremely old children (Sharon Ruiz of L.A.).</TE>
<TE>   * And a notice of a fluctuating deadline from the city of Rancho
Palos Verdes (resident Steve Katz).</TE>
<TE>   Don't even ask about Gomer: Photographer Henk Friezer attended a
reception for Dan Watson, the new police chief of South Pasadena.
Someone compared South Pasadena to TV's sleepy "Mayberry," prompting
Watson to say: "I want you to know I'm no Andy Griffith and my
officers are no Barney Fifes."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Writing about radio promotion slogans on his
Laradio.com Web site, author Don Barrett points out that "KLAC has
been using 'Not just facts, but feelings.' "</TE>
<TE>   But inasmuch as the station has both talk and infomercials,
Barrett suggests this slogan: "'I feel the infomercials are awful."</TE>

<HD>If Toll Road Is Like Restaurant, No Reservations Are Needed</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>My memory isn't what it used to be, so I had to dip into the archives
to remember what the meetings were like 10 years ago, when some
people thought they could stop the San Joaquin Hills tollway from
cutting a swath through beautiful Laguna Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   What heady times they were.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents fought in court and on the roadsides. They went to
county offices in Santa Ana and to City Hall in Laguna Beach. They
talked about civil disobedience at the toll road construction sites
or, maybe, a unified opposition from South County cities.</LD>
<TE>   Then, things just died. There was a meeting in Laguna Beach in
March 1993 when then-Mayor Lida Lenney captured the alternating hope
and futility of the moment. "I'm confident this road is not going to
be built," she said, only to say a few moments later, "We're losing
this battle."</TE>
<TE>   The toll road eventually opened in November 1996, even as
naysayers argued loud and long that the road never would generate the
traffic its supporters predicted.</TE>
<TE>   What do you know, the naysayers were right. The tollway hasn't
come close to its estimates, and this week, one Wall Street ratings
agency downgraded to junk status more than $1billion in bonds for the
tollway while another maintained the road's investment-level rating.
The reason was the same one we'd heard almost since the tollway
opened: It's not as popular as its supporters expected and, as a
result, isn't generating the revenue that was forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Tollway officials say things will be fine, although they haven't
been right about many things over the years. For those of us who
drive the San Joaquin from time to time, an essential truth hasn't
changed much: Unless you drive in rush hour, there's nobody on the
road. Nobody, that is, by Southern California standards--and
certainly not enough to justify it being there.</TE>
<TE>   I figured that position was unassailable, so I decided to revisit
Jack Camp, who owns an urban planning company in Laguna Beach. A
decade ago, he favored the toll road, even while suggesting some
design changes.</TE>
<TE>   With five years of flagging ridership on the books, I wondered if
Camp still favors it.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling is that if we didn't have the road, we'd be in a lot
worse shape," he says. "Eventually, it will pan out as growth
continues in South County, and it will be beneficial."</TE>
<TE>   I ask why the road has flopped so far. "People are cheap," Camp
said. "But as we continue to develop in South County, people are
going to use it. They're going to realize it's a better way. It's
still relatively new. I use it, but only when I have to hurry and get
up to Newport Beach."</TE>
<TE>   I don't understand all the ramifications of Wall Street's bond
ratings, but tollway officials say a default on the bonds is not
imminent.</TE>
<TE>   In the next breath, however, they acknowledge the need to raise
the price of the ride again. That sounds like a formula for
decreasing revenue, especially if a typical rider is like Camp, who
takes the San Joaquin only in a pinch. Three bucks a shot may reduce
the urgency.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, the tollway supporters always have an argument you
can't rebut: Whatever traffic is on the San Joaquin--even if it's
less than projected--is traffic that would have been on the 5 or the
405 or Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   I'll grant them that, but it's maddening when public officials
miss the mark so badly on what the public wants. The bottom line is
that the masses didn't want the San Joaquin nearly as much as the
developers.</TE>
<TE>   What we've got is a highway that operates more like a restaurant
that's only open at lunch and dinner.</TE>
<TE>   You couldn't blame the tollway opponents of yesteryear if they're
gloating now. They're not, however, because they know now what they
knew then:</TE>
<TE>   Once the canyon was carved away, it wasn't coming</TE>

<HD>Harold Hoyt Stilson, 101; Last Year Became Oldest Golfer to
Hit Hole in One</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Harold Hoyt Stilson Sr., 101, who last year became the oldest golfer
to hit a hole in one, died Saturday from complications of a viral
infection in Boca Raton, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Stilson, who took up golf in 1921, used a 4-iron to ace the
108-yard 16th hole at the Deerfield Country Club in May.</LD>
<LD>   The feat brought him invitations to appear on "The Tonight Show,"
"Live With Regis and Kelly" and ESPN's SportsCenter. He also threw
out the first pitch at a Florida Marlins baseball game and received
an invitation from Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to play a round of golf.</LD>
<TE>   Stilson's hole in one was not his first: He had made five others,
all since turning 71.</TE>
<TE>   A 27-handicapper who continued to play three times a week, he was
said to have a "classic, well-balanced swing."</TE>
<TE>   Stilson, who joined the Navy in 1917, played the saxophone and
clarinet in Detroit big bands before going into business.</TE>

<HD>Agatha Barbara, 78; Education Reformer and Former Maltese

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Agatha Barbara, 78, a former schoolteacher who became Malta's first
female lawmaker, minister and president, died Monday of a suspected
heart attack in Zabbar, Malta.</LD>
<LD>   Born in that town, Barbara was known as an education reformer who
brought full-time learning to Maltese children, who previously had
gone to school only a few hours a day. Her campaign required the
hiring and training of hundreds of teachers.</LD>
<LD>   First elected to parliament on the Labor Party ticket in 1947,
Barbara won every reelection until 1981.</LD>
<TE>   Barbara, who had been named minister of education in 1955, was
nominated president of the republic in 1982 and completed her
five-year term.</TE>
<TE>   In 1958, after the Labor Party resigned from office, Barbara was
sentenced to 43 days in prison for her role in a national strike
called by the party to protest the British government's plan to
reduce its presence in Malta.</TE>

<HD>50 Cited in Huntington Crosswalk Sting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Huntington Beach's first organized crackdown on motorists who fail
to yield to pedestrians, police said they cited 50 drivers at
Yorktown Avenue and Windward Lane in about two hours Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The motorcycle officer who supervised the effort said it is too
early to call the sting a success.</LD>
<LD>   "Just because we wrote 50 tickets doesn't mean it's a success. It
just shows the depth of the problem," Sgt. Mike Reynolds said. "Now
we have to figure out a way to educate the public about how dangerous
it is."</LD>
<TE>   Citing a 32% increase in pedestrian-related injuries in the city
last year, police set up the sting, choosing that intersection
because an 80-year-old woman trying to cross the street was killed
there in November.</TE>
<TE>   The sting involved eight motorcycle officers, three plainclothes
officers and several supervisors. With the motorcycle police nearby,
one of the plainclothes officers would step into the crosswalk.
Motorists who failed to yield or shot past a stopped vehicle were
cited.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very conservative with our interpretation of the vehicle
code," Reynolds said.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists Blew Through School Crossing</TE>
<TE>   Police also cited two motorists who failed to yield at a school
crossing on Yorktown near Newland Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds said crossing guards have complained about drivers who
speed and do not stop as children enter the crosswalk.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds said some violations were blatant. In one instance, when
the officer tried to cross the street, three cars failed to yield,
Reynolds said. The fourth car stopped, but the fifth shot around it.</TE>
<TE>   The minimum fines are $103 for failure to yield to a pedestrian
and $270 for overtaking a stopped vehicle at a crosswalk, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A few cited motorists became irate, Reynolds said.</TE>
<TE>   "The nice part was, we had a neighbor of the lady who was killed
who said she was glad we were there," he said. "That it was long
overdue."</TE>

<HD>Schools' Cell Phone Ban May End</HD>
<DH>Education: Lawmakers weigh two measures to allow students
to carry the mobile devices on campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some California students would be allowed to carry mobile phones, now
banned on public school campuses, under two bills making their way
through the state Legislature.</LD>
<LD>   Both bills would allow school boards to set policies on use of
cellular phones. Under current law, passed in a 1988 effort to limit
drug sales, the state forbids the possession of any electronic
signaling device on campus.</LD>
<LD>   But as any visitor to a high school campus soon notices, students
routinely ignore that law. Parents often provide the phones to keep
tabs on their children. Many administrators and teachers say cellular
phones are so common that they have stopped enforcing the ban.</LD>
<TE>   The prospect of legislative action comes after a public campaign
by the principal and students of Monroe High School in North Hills to
reverse the ban. The bills also appear to be a byproduct of the Sept.
11 attacks, when cellular phones allowed people on hijacked airplanes
and in the World Trade Center to contact authorities and loved ones
before they died.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the young people who are going to school today are
carrying cell phones on them or in their backpacks," said
Assemblywoman Carol Liu, a La Canada Flintridge Democrat, the sponsor
of one of the bills. "Times have changed, and many parents want their
children to have phones. This bill acknowledges that fact."</TE>
<TE>   Liu's bill passed the Assembly 73 to 0 last week. If it or a
similar bill introduced last month by Sen. Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont)
becomes law, California would join Kentucky, Oklahoma and Maryland in
backing away from cellular phone bans. School boards in several other
states--where local policies rather than state law have enforced
prohibitions--have reversed themselves and are permitting cellular
phone use.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators say a change in the California law is likely. Former
supporters of the ban, including teachers unions and child welfare
advocates, have raised no objections.</TE>
<TE>   In their details, the two California bills take different tacks.
Liu's proposal would keep the ban but would allow school boards to
opt out of the prohibition. It also would mandate that cellular
phones remain off during school hours and be used only for "purposes
related to protecting the health and safety of a pupil, district,
employee or other person on campus."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill goes further. It would strip the ban out of the
state code and give school boards authority to regulate mobile phones
"to the extent necessary to prevent the disruption of school
instruction or activities."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill was introduced two weeks ago and will probably be
debated in early spring.</TE>
<TE>   Students and administrators at Monroe High have campaigned for
lifting the ban since fall. And Liu and Figueroa say appeals from
other schools  prompted them to introduce legislation.</TE>
<TE>   A leadership class at Logan High School in Union City had urged
Figueroa to allow cellular phones. Liu was lobbied by the La Canada
school board president.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, local law enforcement urged the evacuation of La
Canada High School because of its proximity to NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, which was feared to be a target of a terrorist attack.
Students' cellular phones were essential to conducting an evacuation
of all 1,200 students in half an hour, administrators said. But they
worried that they were breaking state law.</TE>
<TE>   "In an emergency our paramount objective is to ensure our
students' safety," La Canada board President Virginia Dalbeck said in
a statement. "The law should give local boards the flexibility to
protect students as we see fit."</TE>

<HD>Riordan Backs Out of GOP Test Vote Among Party's Die-Hard
Members</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Richard Riordan has pulled out of
a straw poll set for this weekend's state GOP convention--after
trying unsuccessfully to kill it.</LD>
<LD>   In an open letter to delegates attending the three-day gathering,
which starts today in San Jose, Riordan campaign chief Ron Hartwig
said the straw poll threatened to divide the party when its main
focus should be defeating Democratic Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Further, Hartwig suggested the poll is not a true test of
Republican sentiment, since anyone paying the convention's $55
registration fee will be eligible to vote.</LD>
<TE>   "This will only result in campaigns spending tens of thousands of
dollars to bus in supporters and will only measure who spends more
money and rents more buses," Hartwig wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, however, Riordan's campaign pushed hard to
scrub the straw poll, viewing the balloting as a no-win prospect.</TE>
<TE>   As the overwhelming front-runner in campaign cash and public
opinion polls, a victory might seem preordained. But Riordan has run
well to the left of the party's grass-roots activists, the kind of
die-hard Republicans most likely to be in attendance this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   So rather than risk potential embarrassment, Riordan withdrew his
name from consideration.</TE>
<TE>   He will join his two main rivals, Secretary of State Bill Jones
and businessman Bill Simon Jr., at an hourlong debate Saturday at the
convention.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the second such meeting of the top GOP contenders. A
third and final debate is set for Wednesday at Cal State Long Beach.</TE>

<LD>Pacific Lumber Co. has withdrawn a controversial plan to log trees
near the Headwaters Forest Preserve in Northern California redwood
country.</LD>
<LD>   Company officials say they intend to conduct more research and
resubmit the plan. The firm wanted to thin redwoods and Douglas firs
used by the marbled murrelet, a rare bird protected by law.</LD>
<LD>   Although the trees grow on company land, they are protected by
conditions set in 1999 when the Headwaters preserve was acquired with
$480 million in public funds.</LD>

<LD>The wood-burning Soledad Energy plant that reopened during last
year's energy crisis has been fined $14,900 for smog violations.</LD>
<LD>   The Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District imposed
the penalty this week and ordered the plant to conduct inspections
because of more than 100 air pollution violations since November. The
facility must meet all requirements by July 1 or face more fines.</LD>
<LD>   The plant, which reopened in July, produces nine megawatts of
electricity, enough to power 9,000 homes. It closed in 1994 because
oil and natural gas were cheaper sources of fuel than wood.</LD>

<HD>English Testing Simplified</HD>
<DH>Education: The state removes some burdens of giving the
exam. One part is no longer an annual requirement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Board of Education voted this week to change some of
the most contentious portions of a new test mandated by the state for
students who are not fluent in English.</LD>
<LD>   The test, given for the first time last year, was designed to
evaluate the proficiency of students still learning English and track
their progress annually. About a quarter of California's 6 million
public school students do not speak English fluently.</LD>
<LD>   But many school administrators complained the test was too
time-consuming and costly.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly 2 million California students took the California English
Language Development Test, or CELDT, last summer and fall. The test
takes about 2 1/2 hours and costs $20 to $30 per student.</TE>
<TE>   Many school officials complained about the added burden on their
resources but agreed accountability was necessary. A state Department
of Education report found that 38 of 209 districts surveyed in 2000
lacked adequate English programs for their nonnative speakers, two
years after Proposition 227 curtailed bilingual education in
California.</TE>
<TE>   The state board, meeting in Sacramento on Wednesday, voted
unanimously to ease the burden on school districts.</TE>
<TE>   One portion of the test, for example, will no longer be an annual
requirement for students who show proficiency.</TE>
<TE>   The exam tests students' abilities in listening, speaking, reading
and writing. There are four versions of the test: one for students in
kindergarten through second grade, one for third through fifth grade,
one for sixth to eighth grade and another for high school.</TE>
<TE>   Students who score high in the listening and speaking portion
won't have to take it again until they reach the next test level.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very excited," said Jay Heck, supervisor of assessment and
registration for Garden Grove Unified School District, which tested
nearly 30,000 students and where about 60% of students are still
learning English. He estimated the move would cut the amount of time
his district spends administering the test by at least a third.</TE>
<TE>   Heck also welcomed the state's decision to allow testers  to stop
the exam once it is determined the student has very little grasp of
the language. Under the current design, districts must test students'
writing and reading abilities even when they can't answer the most
basic questions in the oral portion.</TE>
<TE>   "That took a lot of unnecessary time," Heck said.</TE>
<TE>   Future versions of the test also will include an answer sheet to
make it easier to score.</TE>
<TE>   Now that some of the chief problems have been addressed, education
experts hope the test will become a more useful tool.</TE>
<TE>   "Like most new assessments, the CELDT was first met with
skepticism," state Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Montebello), who sponsored
the bill calling for the test, told the board Wednesday. "Despite the
initial bumps in the road, what teachers are saying about this test
is that it is giving them new insights."</TE>

<HD>One Man's Hobby, a Culture's History</HD>
<DH>Tet: A mask collector turned trouper keeps dragon and lion
dancing a living tradition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Truong Ha is a man of many faces.</LD>
<LD>   A gold lion mask with Pepto-Bismol-pink eyebrows and orange hair
twisted with red ribbon. A lime green face with colorful, shaggy ears
and a long yarn goatee. And his personal favorite, a red dragon with
whiskers made of pompoms glued to springs.</LD>
<LD>   A hobby? Sure. But Ha's collection of dragon heads and lion masks
is also an effort to preserve a cultural icon and a traditional dance
that has withered in popularity as the years have passed.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to keep the Vietnamese tradition," said Ha, who grew up in
Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) and now lives in Westminster with
his wife. "I enjoy bringing good luck to others."</TE>
<TE>   His collection of 15 dragon and lion costumes--so bulky that he
stows most in friends' garages--is in demand throughout the year. The
festive masks are worn in performances to usher in luck at weddings,
during history lessons for students and at grand openings for
businesses. Business is brisk this month as Asians celebrate the
Lunar New Year, which falls on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ha's love for the regal and colorful masks began when he was a
child. He said he took kung fu classes but his family couldn't afford
the pricier dragon dance sessions. Still, Ha said, he attended annual
Tet celebrations and watched with interest, wishing that he were the
one carrying the mask at the head of the parade.</TE>
<TE>   He fled Vietnam in 1989 and joined his family in Yorba Linda,
where he landed a job as an assembler. One of his first purchases was
a red dragon mask he found in Chinatown in Los Angeles for $570. He
adds to the collection almost every year, a habit made necessary
because the fragile masks tend to deteriorate quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Ha now leads a dance group and teaches others the art of carrying
the cumbersome dragon heads.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a lot of strength, health and good acting," said Ha, who
works as a computer parts inspector. "The art is to act like a
dragon, to display its moods."</TE>
<TE>   The masks vary in size and color. Red, a lucky color, is the
standard pick during New Year's. White is the norm for a wedding, and
green for a school function.</TE>
<TE>   The masks are made of papier-mache and bamboo sticks and typically
weigh about 10 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   A performance is elaborate, a mixture of kung fu and dance. Two
people can perform the lion dance, but it takes a small team to pull
off the dragon dance, which involves squads of people handling the
head, the body and the tail; musicians, who lead the procession; and
a lone dancer who teases the dragon forward with a fan. The dance is
meant to expel evil spirits before a festival or celebration.</TE>
<TE>   But the craft's popularity is slumping. The teams are expensive to
maintain, the training is time-consuming and there is a shortage of
instructors. Historically, students begin training as young as 7 and
hone the skills until adulthood, said Binh Thieu Tran, who has taught
dragon dancing for more than 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a lot of time, so many people are afraid to get into
it," said Tran, 74. "Most students are young boys. The ones in their
20s and 30s can't jump and don't have the strength anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Ha admits that he is not as strong as he once was, but the ability
to entertain and display a sense of history and community keeps him
practicing daily. Ha and his group, Quang Linh Lion Dance Troupe,
will perform an opening show at the Tet Festival in Garden Grove on
Feb. 15.</TE>
<TE>   "It brings good luck to our community and pride in our culture,"
Ha said. "It takes a lot of practice and dedication to do it right,
but it's a great feeling to see everyone smiling."</TE>

<HD>Moody's Keeps Tollway Rating</HD>
<DH>Transit: Unlike another investor service, the firm won't
drop bonds of San Joaquin Hills turnpike to junk status.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The financially beleaguered San Joaquin Hills tollway got a bit of
good news Thursday when a Wall Street firm maintained its
investment-level grade rating for almost $1.8 billion in bonds sold
to build the controversial turnpike.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's Investors Service, based in New York, declined to lower
its Baa3 rating, its lowest investment grade, to speculative status,
the designation used for so-called junk bonds that have the highest
risks for investors. Another firm had reduced its rating on the bonds
to junk status earlier in the week.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts for Moody's said strong management by the toll road's
operators and the possibility of refinancing the road's debt
outweighed the fact that traffic and revenues continue to fall short
of projections by at least 20%. Moody's also cited a $12-million
federal line of credit that could be tapped to pay interest on the
bonds.</LD>
<TE>   "Since 1997, they have been keenly aware of the problem of [debt]
coverage and have indicated that the ultimate solution would be a
restructuring of the debt," analysts wrote in their ratings report.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills toll road, which runs from San Juan
Capistrano to Newport Beach, is part of a 51-mile network of tollways
operated by the Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies. The
other roads are the Foothill and Eastern tollways, along with a short
stretch of Highway 133.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very positive," said Walter D. Kreutzen, chief executive
of the corridor agencies. "We're happy a national ratings agency has
maintained its investment grade rating for the San Joaquin Hills."</TE>
<TE>   Moody's is one of three ratings services that evaluate the bonds
sold by the Transportation Corridor Agencies to build its tollway
system. The others are Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Ratings, which
have been steadily lowering their ratings of San Joaquin Hills bonds
over the past several years.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Fitch reduced its investment grade rating for the toll
road to speculative grade.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts for that firm said the road has continually failed to
meet projections and the gulf appears to be widening between actual
and forecasted revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Fitch downgraded the road's BBB rating to
BBB-minus, the service's lowest investment grade.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's also downgraded the corridor's bonds to the
lowest investment grade when the road was refinanced in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2000, the service changed its financial outlook on the
tollway from stable to negative. Standard &amp; Poor's has yet to review
its last bond rating.</TE>

<LD>Police were searching for a woman who they said shot a store clerk in
the hand during the second of two holdups committed within a 10-hour
period that ended Wednesday morning.</LD>
<LD>   The woman entered La Cuevita Market in the 100 block of 8th Street
about 7 p.m. Tuesday and demanded money from a clerk, said Santa
Paula Police Sgt. Michael Saviers. Witnesses said the woman was
wearing black clothing and a black beanie cap pulled down to cover
her face,</LD>
<LD>   At about 5:20 a.m. Wednesday, a woman matching that description
walked into a Chhina's USA Gas station in the 800 block of West
Harvard Boulevard and demanded money, Saviers said.</LD>
<TE>   The clerk hesitated and was shot in the right hand. He was taken
to an area hospital for treatment.</TE>

<HD>Redone Park No Longer a Home</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Riverside bars overnight stays by the homeless
in the renovated site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although his first visit to White Park in downtown Riverside was more
than 15 years ago, the city's parks and recreation director still
crinkles his nose in disgust at the memory.</LD>
<LD>   Terry Nielsen was trying to enjoy a bag lunch, he remembers, when
the homeless couple next to him began changing the dirty diaper
clinging to their baby. Then the woman washed the infant's soiled
diaper, right at the edge of an elegant fountain flowing near the
park's entrance.</LD>
<LD>   "And then they asked for the rest of my sandwich," Nielsen said.</LD>
<TE>   Such a scene is unlikely today, city officials proudly say.</TE>
<TE>   More than four years ago the city closed the park, which had
become a haven for the homeless, and gave it a $2-million make-over.
After years of delays, caused in part by extended waits for grant
money, the renovation was unveiled in November.</TE>
<TE>   Today the 112-year-old park, considered the city's first,
practically shines. The grass is greener than ever, there's a rose
garden, a cactus garden, a hummingbird garden. There will even be a
wedding at White Park come October.</TE>
<TE>   A new senior center, police storefront and Park and Recreation
Department offices also operate within the park.</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the rows of cardboard boxes that served as shelter for
dozens of the city's homeless. And to make sure it stays that way,
the city erected a stylish steel fence around the entire park.
Rangers shoo people out at dusk. The gates are locked.</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen said the gates were necessary to keep the park clean, to
protect the gardens from vandals, and, yes, to keep the homeless from
setting up camp. The homeless are still welcome, he said. Just during
the day.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone's entitled to come into this park and enjoy it," he said
during a recent walk through the park grounds. "What they won't be
able to do is set up tents or cardboard housing or misuse the park."</TE>
<TE>   But the homeless grumble that they are not welcome any longer
inside the park. Not even during the day, when the rest of the public
is invited inside.</TE>
<TE>   "They just don't want you in there," said Clitus Tripp, 62, who
was homeless for several months, but is trying to make a fresh start
in a small apartment in Mira Loma. Still, Tripp regularly comes back
to White Park in hopes of seeing some of his friends.</TE>
<TE>   "You can walk through there. But say you want to just sit out and
have a smoke and just talk about life. You can't do that. The park
rangers will come up and ask you to leave."</TE>
<TE>   Tripp and his buddies have taken to standing just outside the
gate, congregating at a nearby liquor store and looking in on the
grounds that used to be their makeshift home.</TE>
<TE>   "They said they shut down the park because the elderly were scared
of us," said Ron Harvey, 42, referring to the senior center on the
park grounds. "[But] we knew most of them. We used to walk them home
at night."</TE>
<TE>   White Park underscores the conflict between cities eager to create
areas where residents feel safe and comfortable and the rights of the
homeless, whose very existence can intimidate some.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside police said that before the make-over, calls for service
in the White Park area were constant. Lt. Mark Boyer, who oversees
patrol services in the area, said his officers were there 30 to 40
times a month.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd find people passed out drunk in the park," Boyer said.
"Transients took baths in the park, they were urinating,
defecating.... And then the subsequent problem was that they'd become
victims. They'd get robbed, beat up. The park was a consistent
problem going back 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   But now, calls for the park have "dropped to zip," Boyer said.
Seniors again use the center. They have tai chi classes, plant flower
and vegetable gardens. And there are plans for concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Boyer added that the park is "open to everyone." But park rangers
will chase out anyone with a shopping cart overflowing with their
life's possessions--a violation of a new city ordinance that forbids
anything with wheels, including skateboards and bicycles, inside the
park. Wheelchairs, walkers and strollers are exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Homeless advocates said they understand the city's dilemma. But by
gating a public park and creating laws to shuffle out the homeless,
city officials simply end up "criminalizing homelessness," said Linda
Boone, executive director of the National Coalition for Homeless
Veterans.</TE>
<TE>   "We get concerned about setting laws that penalize people for
being poor," Boone said. Such laws, she said, are attacks on the
symptoms instead of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "The real problem is that there aren't enough places for these
people to go. When the community doesn't provide enough shelter beds
to house these people, they can't help but sleep in public places,
and then they are breaking the law."</TE>
<TE>   Still, city officials are proud of the changes at the park and
hope to repeat the effort in other parks. The city has earmarked
about $27million for park improvements over the next few years.</TE>

<HD>Suspect in Standoff With Police Surrenders</HD>
<DH>Crime: During chase, shots are fired at LAPD helicopter.
Two are arrested, including barricaded man.</DH>

<LD>A man fleeing authorities fired several rounds at a Los Angeles
Police Department helicopter Thursday, triggering a daylong standoff
when one of two suspects barricaded himself inside a Tarzana
apartment complex.</LD>
<LD>   During the standoff, police evacuated residents of nearby homes
and 100 students in a private school on Lindley Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began at 9:10 a.m. when two men stole a car equipped
with an anti-theft device that helped police locate it in the 15000
block of Roscoe Boulevard in North Hills, Cmdr. Michel Moore said.</LD>
<TE>   A 15-minute chase through the San Fernando Valley began after
police tried to pull the car over. It eventually collided with
another car on Lindley beneath the Ventura Freeway, and the suspects
ran, Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   One of them ran south on Lindley past apartments and single-story
homes, and one fired several rounds from a handgun at a police
helicopter, police said.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear if the helicopter was damaged, Moore said. "We
pulled the helicopter out of the air to inspect it."</TE>
<TE>   Within an hour, police had detained one suspect. The other suspect
holed up in a second-floor apartment of a 40-unit complex before
surrendering just before 3 p.m., Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said one of the suspects knew someone who lives in the
apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   The incident interrupted an ice cream social and bingo game at the
nearby Encino Rivera Retirement Home, which has an assisted-living
center with 127 residents, according to Maria Luisa Avneri, an
administrator.</TE>

<HD>Experts See Area Growth Cooling</HD>
<DH>Economy: Analysts expect a slowdown in Ventura County this
year from robust expansion of past years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a national recession, Ventura County's economy will continue
to grow in 2002, though at a pace much slower than the robust
expansion of a couple of years ago and despite a housing shortage
that could curb business movement into the county, analysts predicted
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "[This year] will seem like a recession following the incredible
expansion years of 1999 and 2000," economist Mark Schniepp, director
of the California Economic Forecast, said at his annual Real Estate
and Economic Outlook Conference in Westlake.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to 240 local business and government officials, Schniepp
described a balanced, resilient Ventura County economy that has taken
only a small hit from the national recession and one that should
rebound by summer and be humming along by year's end.</LD>
<TE>   But lurking behind Schniepp's optimistic forecast is a housing
shortage that is only getting worse.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer-term outlook for the Ventura County economy is
generally positive," Schniepp wrote in a summary report.</TE>
<TE>   "But the shadow of the housing crisis will ultimately impact the
ability of the business sector to remain vibrant and dynamic due to a
shortage of affordable homes for the work force."</TE>
<TE>   Schniepp stressed that the largest unknown facing the local
economy is when or whether businesses will stop moving to Ventura
County because workers can't afford a place to live and would have to
commute from cheaper locales, such as the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "We may see more defections like Kinko's," he said in an
interview, referring to the Ventura-based copying company that is
moving to Texas. "And companies that really have to grow are going to
think twice about moving here. They're going to look to Texas,
Georgia, Nevada and to even other California counties."</TE>
<TE>   William Fulton, a planner who writes books and publishes an
industry newsletter, also stressed the need for housing policies that
require better use of the remaining land within urban boundaries
drawn by a series of local anti-sprawl initiatives since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Unless officials change development practices, Fulton said some
Ventura County cities will run out of space for apartments and houses
this decade--long before the Save Open Space and Agricultural
Resources initiatives expire about 2020.</TE>
<TE>   Fulton noted that backers of the SOAR measures said there was
enough vacant land within cities to build 60,000 residences, but that
a study by his Ventura research group found planning guidelines allow
a maximum of just 41,000 units. Further study of 126 housing projects
in nine local cities determined only about 50% of the allowable units
were being built.</TE>
<TE>   Noteworthy, he said, was that the cut in the number of dwellings
was not forced on developers by city councils, but instead proposed
by developers after discussions with city planners on what was
politically acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "These [densities] were not getting knocked down during the public
approval process," Fulton told the builders, brokers and developers
in the audience. "The developer was coming in with a plan already
knocked down."</TE>
<TE>   To provide homes for more people, Fulton said, cities should
change development plans and city zoning to allow more dwellings per
acre, while rezoning farmland within city boundaries so it can be
converted to housing tracts.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, he said, Ventura County can "live with the consequences
of being job rich and housing poor."</TE>
<TE>   Those consequences--the smog and traffic caused by a stream of
commuting employees who work here but live elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Offering a wider perspective, state Controller Kathleen Connell
said California faces a difficult year in 2002, as sagging revenues
leave the state budget billions of dollars in deficit and the Enron
meltdown affecting the state's largest employee pension fund.</TE>
<TE>   The California Public Employees' Retirement System has lost tens
of millions of dollars because of investments in Enron and its
partner companies.</TE>
<TE>   But Connell said "the monetary downturn we have now is nowhere
near the depression we had ... in the early 1990s." She described the
current situation as a "momentary recession" that is already passing.
"The recovery is underway," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Revenues from income taxes lag up to a year behind a turnaround,
she said. And, according to her figures, state receipts for January
alone were $1.3 billion below projections in the governor's budget.</TE>
<TE>   County government in particular may be hit hard this summer when
shortfalls force sharp reductions in funds that local agencies
receive from the state.</TE>
<TE>   "I really am very concerned about the counties in California,"
Connell said. "I don't know how they're going to be able to pay their
bills."</TE>

<HD>Selig Considers Tavares for Montreal Opening</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig moved closer Thursday to hiring Hall
of Famer Frank Robinson as manager of the Montreal Expos and former
Angel boss Tony Tavares as team president.</LD>
<LD>   Selig has been talking with baseball officials about putting
together a management staff for the Expos, a high-ranking baseball
official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The Expos are
being sold to the other 29 clubs as part of baseball's unusual
ownership shifts.</LD>
<LD>   While the baseball official said Selig had moved closer to hiring
Robinson and Tavares, the commissioner said speculation was
premature.</LD>
<TE>   "I've made no decision yet," Selig said. "I'm going to work my way
through it over the weekend."</TE>
<TE>   Tavares said Selig spoke to him briefly a few days after his
resignation as Angel president.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a passing comment saying, 'If contraction does not go
through, I may want to talk to you about the Montreal situation,'"
Tavares said. "[But] I have not had substantiative discussions with
anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Tavares didn't deny that the position would be something he would
be interested in.</TE>
<TE>   "While I wouldn't rule it out, I would not rule it in," Tavares
said.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson has spent the last two years as vice president of
on-field operations in the commissioner's office.</TE>

<HD>Honoring Negro Leagues</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Former major leaguers will play an exhibition
Saturday at Dodger Stadium.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major League Baseball has sought a variety of ways to rectify its
history of excluding African-American athletes from its game until
Jackie Robinson broke the modern-day color line in 1947.</LD>
<LD>   There have been turn-back-the-clock games with  teams wearing
Negro League uniforms. Robinson's  No. 42 was retired by  the major
leagues in 1997. Fourteen players who spent their careers in the
Negro Leagues have been voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   Ted Milner believes more can be done. The  former professional
baseball player  is close to seeing a five-year dream become a
reality.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, teams of African-American and Latin former major
leaguers will play an exhibition game in Dodger Stadium at 1 p.m. to
honor about 50 surviving Negro League players being flown into Los
Angeles for the event.</TE>
<TE>   Among those scheduled to play are former Dodgers Rudy Law, Derrel
Thomas, Pedro Guerrero and Mariano Duncan. Other former major
leaguers include Glenn Braggs, Darryl Boston, Vic Harris and Alvin
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The managers are Reggie Smith, who played and coached with the
Dodgers, and Enos Cabell, who spent 15 seasons with Baltimore,
Houston, San Francisco, Detroit and the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Milner--chief executive  of Executive Temps, which supplies
temporary clerical and professional workers for the film and music
industries--hopes the game does more than acknowledge players from
the Negro League.  He wants to spark a revival of interest in
baseball in the African-American community.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to do an event where you had major leaguers playing and
honoring the men who paved the way for them," said Milner, who played
five years in the minor leagues. "But if I was a major league owner,
I'd be looking for any opportunity to entice African Americans back
to the game."</TE>
<TE>   The event has been more than a labor of love. Although the Dodgers
donated the use of the stadium, Major League Baseball provided balls
and helmets, and five companies--Adelphia, Albertson's, Chevron Gas,
Coca-Cola and MasterCard--have provided various degrees of
sponsorship. Milner said he has spent $400,000 of his own money on
the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball is part of our history," Milner said. "You want African
Americans to look at our history and believe there will be a better
future for us and our people. The game sets the atmosphere for it to
be done."</TE>
<TE>   Milner sought the help of Hall of Famers Ozzie Smith and Dave
Winfield to contact former players. Neither is able to play in the
game today, but both were instrumental in getting the word out.</TE>
<TE>   Cabell, who grew up in Los Angeles, came on board immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to do two games this year," Cabell said.  "One in
Houston and one in Los Angeles. But the Houston people did not
approve the deal until the last minute. The Dodgers stepped up and
said they wanted to do this. Next year we hope to do more in other
cities.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing is to have the kids see the Negro League players.
Not too many are left anymore. And I hope baseball does come back
into the inner cities. Gangs and violence have a lot to do with why
it left, because parks weren't safe to bring families to. But if Ted
is successful with this, I hope he gets some more backing from Major
League Baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Other players see the event as something other than a reunion of
friends and competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "This is doing something for the guys who opened the door for us,"
said Harris, who played for six teams from 1972-80. "They didn't get
their respect for their playing. This is a day for them to get their
glory."</TE>
<TE>   John "Mule" Miles is one of the former Negro League players who
will be honored. A native of San Antonio, Miles played with the
Chicago American Giants from 1946-49. In 1951, his final professional
season, he was the only African American on the Laredo Apaches in the
Gulf Coast League.</TE>
<TE>   The honorees were to be feted at a dinner Thursday at Dorsey High,
and a reception today at Dodger Stadium</TE>
<TE>   "For us to be recognized at this time is great," Miles said. "I
hope it continues on. This is the first time I can recall someone
organizing a game. There's a lot of kids out there that don't know
about the Negro Leagues, so I'm proud to be part of it."</TE>

<LD>Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle poses some questions
concerning the Winter Olympics:</LD>
<LD>   * "If curling is truly an Olympic sport, why haven't scientists
found a way to develop illegal, high-performance brooms?"</LD>
<LD>   * "What if a ski jumper caught a rogue thermal updraft and didn't
come down?"</LD>
<TE>   * "No event has more mysteries than bobsledding. Over the years,
more than one American downhill slider has been busted for steroids.
Why would a bobsledder need steroids?</TE>
<TE>   "Answer: For the lodge."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What is the longest winning streak in the UCLA-USC
basketball series?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who was favored? Bob Halloran of ESPN.com on the Winter Olympics:
"An actual news story previewing the Games read: 'Pogue edges Klug
for Olympic berth.' Boy, that was a shocker! Didn't you really think
Klug was going to beat Pogue?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Party pooper: Gary Shelton of the St. Petersburg Times, commenting
on Super Bowl-winning Coach Bill Belichick:</TE>
<TE>   "[He] is so painfully dull the suspicion is that moss grows on his
north side.</TE>
<TE>   "The joke [in New Orleans] was that Belichick ventured onto
Bourbon Street, but a bartender asked him to leave so the place could
have happy hour.</TE>
<TE>   "And so what? Maybe the guy isn't fun at parties. Maybe the part
of his personality that tells jokes and dances on tables has been
replaced by breakdowns of football tapes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Belichick: Dave Hyde of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel: "He's
X to Bill Walsh's O."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tyson "tribute": Hubert Mizell of the St. Petersburg Times,
commenting on Mike Tyson: "Good for Nevada, putting a muzzle on Mad
Mike. Tell me that no state will stoop to licensing this
flesh-gnawing creep....</TE>
<TE>   "He's a boneheaded pig meriting nobody's sympathy. We should allow
him to slide, as quickly as possible, into oblivion."</TE>
<TE>   Don't hold back, Hubert. Tell us what you really think of Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Is it a trend? Brad Rock of the Deseret News in Salt Lake City:
"There's a lot of talk that the Patriots were destined to win the
Super Bowl because these are patriotic times.</TE>
<TE>   "It may even be true. In that case, I'm penciling in the George
Washington Colonials as NCAA basketball champs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A very big ouch: A couple of months ago during the installation of
hardwood floors in luxury suites at Safeco Field in Seattle, a
flatbed truck backed into the Mitt, a 9-foot-tall, 3,000-pound cast
bronze sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   Since the mishap, the dented thumb of the Mitt, mounted outside
the stadium, has been wrapped with tape provided by construction
workers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Trojans won 42 consecutive games from 1932 to
1943.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: After the Clippers rallied from an 18-point deficit
to beat the New York Knicks, 112-110, Tuesday night, the Knicks'
Latrell Sprewell said: "They're probably the youngest and most
athletic team in the league. They're just a bunch of young guys who
haven't been together a long time and they play real well. And you
know these guys are just going to get better."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Get Roughed Up</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: The Pistons, using tactics reminiscent of
the late '80's Bad Boys, prevail, 105-92, as L.A. ends trip with a
3-4 record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>The Detroit Pistons could not beat the Clippers when they played in
December at Staples Center, so they beat up on them and got away with
it Thursday night at the Palace of Auburn Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The Pistons hacked and slashed their way to a 105-92 victory
before an announced crowd of 15,146, seemingly clobbering the
Clippers on every drive and sending them home with a 3-4 record on
their trip.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers hit the All-Star break with a 25-26 record, hit being
the operative word on a night when the Pistons roughed up their
opponents.</LD>
<TE>   It's the Clippers' best mark at the break since they were 26-25 in
1992-93.</TE>
<TE>   Seven Pistons scored in double figures, led by Jerry Stackhouse,
who had 15 of his 17 points in the second half. Elton Brand had 25
points and 12 rebounds, and Jeff McInnis had 23 points to lead the
Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   On another night, with different referees, the Clippers might have
won by 20 points, shooting free throws endlessly. But with Bernie
Fryer, Tom Washington and Bill Kennedy overseeing this slugfest, it
seemed that almost anything short of assault was deemed within the
rules.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you hear the slaps out there?" Brand asked. "We can't use it
as an excuse, but there definitely were a lot of calls that didn't go
our way tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry, fined earlier this season for critical
comments about the officiating, at first refused to talk about the
lack of calls.</TE>
<TE>   "They've already got $7,500 of my money," he said. "I'm not going
to touch that. I'm not saying anything about the officials."</TE>
<TE>   Unable to resist, however, Gentry then added, "We usually do a
good job of taking the ball to the basket. We do a good job of
getting to the foul line in most games."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's game was an exception. The Clippers shot 20 free
throws, making 16. They believed they could have shot a lot more.
Detroit's game plan was obvious: play physically.</TE>
<TE>   When the Pistons played it the Clippers' way, they were outscored,
26-11, in the fourth quarter Dec. 16 and suffered an 82-77 defeat.
The Pistons promptly went into a 3-13 slide.</TE>
<TE>   Wanting no part of a similar slump, the Pistons contested every
shot the Clippers attempted Thursday. Brand got the worst of it,
although he managed to fight his way through the Pistons to make 10
of 18 short-range shots. He shot only seven free throws, making five.</TE>
<TE>   Powered by a 21-10 run in the fourth quarter, the Pistons raced
away from the Clippers. Detroit's reserves began the run, with Zeljko
Rebraca, Damon Jones, Jon Barry and Corliss Williamson igniting the
Pistons with baskets that would help turn a tie score into a 92-82
lead midway through the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Rebraca and Barry also ignited a scuffle late in the game, Rebraca
tossing an elbow that struck Quentin Richardson and Barry tossing a
few choice words at Richardson after a jump ball was called at the
Clipper end of the court.</TE>
<TE>   "He ran up in it," Richardson would later say of Barry. "It was
nothing to begin with, then the big boy [Rebraca] started pushing.
[Barry] ran up and said something. You say something to me, I'm not
going to back down."</TE>
<TE>   Cooler heads prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   Although a so-so defender, Barry was successful at tormenting the
Clippers offensively. He made three of five three-point baskets en
route to 11 points.</TE>
<TE>   Barry's no-look pass to a streaking Williamson on a fastbreak led
to a layup, a foul and a three-point play that pushed the Pistons'
lead to 95-82 with 5:33 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, road weary and nursing all manner of strains,
sprains, bumps and bruises, wilted down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons grew stronger.</TE>
<TE>   A last-ditch effort to maintain contact failed when the Clippers
began to foul Ben Wallace, a 45% free-throw shooter.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble was, Wallace made three of eight and the Clippers got only
a McInnis jumper during a 90-second sequence that had Piston fans
booing Gentry's tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Soon enough, the final buzzer sounded and the Clippers flew home
to mend their wounds over the All-Star break.</TE>

<LD>The Clippers always believed Elton Brand was an All-Star. Now the
rest of the basketball believes it too.</LD>
<LD>   The NBA picked Brand to replace injured Laker center Shaquille
O'Neal on the Western Conference team Thursday, making things right
in the minds of the Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   Brand, averaging 19 points and 11.2 rebounds, is a first-time
All-Star. He also is the first Clipper to play in the All-Star game
since Danny Manning in 1994 and 1993.</LD>
<TE>   Brand was resigned to spending a few days at home when he was
passed over last week for a reserve spot in voting by Western
Conference coaches.</TE>
<TE>   He seemed overjoyed Friday at going to Philadelphia for Sunday's
game.</TE>
<TE>   "It was always in the back of my mind, but I had moved on and
accepted it," he said. "I felt it just wasn't my year and I had moved
on. They still didn't have to pick me. They could have picked another
player. To go is an honor."</TE>
<TE>   It was an honor that seemed destined to bypass him for the third
consecutive season. Brand had averaged 20 points and 10 rebounds in
two seasons with the Chicago Bulls before he was traded in the
off-season to the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big reward for him because he's a blue-collar guy,"
Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said. "He doesn't have a flashy game, but
the results speak for themselves. To me, the fact that he's second to
Tim Duncan in double-doubles means he's got to be a tremendous
player."</TE>
<TE>   Brand had 25 points and 12 rebounds in the Clippers' loss Thursday
against the Detroit Pistons, his 35th double-double this season and
his 14th in the last 16 games. Duncan has 39 double-doubles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a no-brainer," Michael Olowokandi said, referring to Brand's
selection. "I told him on the bus a few days ago that it would
happen. It's good for him and it's good for our team. Hopefully, it
gives our team a little more exposure. But why didn't he make it in
the first place? It goes to show you that when you are deserving
things will work out for you in the end."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Brand, the Clippers will be represented by Darius
Miles and Quentin Richardson, who will play in a game between the
league's top rookies and second-season players Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Miles was added to the roster of the second-season players after
Stromile Swift of the Memphis Grizzlies could not play because of a
sprained right toe.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson also will compete in the three-point shooting
competition.</TE>
<TE>   The teaming of Miles and Richardson could produce a potent mix of
spectacular dunks by Miles and torrid outside shooting from
Richardson. Asked about the possibility of hooking up on lob passes
for dunks, Richardson smiled slyly.</TE>
<TE>   "If it happens, it happens," he said. "It's not something we plan.
It comes with the flow of the game. We'll laugh about it if it
happens."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers and Ishii Strike Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers and the agent for pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii agreed to terms
on a four-year, $12.2-million contract Thursday night, and the touted
Japanese left-hander will be introduced at a news conference this
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, according to a source, includes a $1.5-million signing
bonus and two option years that could push the total package to about
$18 million. A little more than a third of the contract, about $4.4
million, will be deferred with interest.</LD>
<LD>   There will be some no-trade protection--a list of teams Ishii
cannot be traded to--but not the blanket no-trade clause Ishii was
seeking, a negotiating point that agent Joe Urbon said was "the
hot-button issue for everybody."</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers will also pay the Yakult Swallows--Ishii's Japanese
team--$11.26 million, the fee the Dodgers posted to acquire exclusive
negotiating rights for the pitcher in early January, pushing their
total investment in Ishii to about $23.5 million. Had the deal not
been completed by 9 tonight, the Dodgers would have lost the rights
to Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans did not confirm the agreement,
but a source said that he and assistant GM Kim Ng have made
arrangements to fly Saturday to Tokyo for a Monday news conference
with Ishii in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a very productive day with Joe Urbon and Ishii's
advisors," Evans said. "As a result, we anticipate an announcement
very soon."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii will be guaranteed about $500,000 this season, $2.25 million
in 2003, $2.75 million in 2004 and $3.25 million in 2005. Team
options for about $4 million in 2006 and $3.25 million in 2007 can be
bought out for about $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, 28, spent most of Thursday undergoing an extensive physical
exam, which included an MRI test and blood work. Neither the MRI nor
the blood tests revealed any abnormalities, and Ishii passed the
physical.Ishii went 12-5 with a 3.40 earned-run average for Yakult
last season, and he had a 78-46 career record and 3.38 ERA with 1,266
strikeouts in 1,1731/3 innings in nine seasons in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to be the No. 2 or 3 starter in a rotation that
will include Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, if the two right-handers
recover from elbow surgery, and fellow Japanese right-hander Hideo
Nomo.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of Ishii gives the Dodgers eight potential starting
pitchers--Brown, Ashby, Ishii, Nomo, Omar Daal, Eric Gagne, Odalis
Perez and Terry Mulholland, providing Evans with some depth to trade
for a proven closer and Manager Jim Tracy some insurance if Brown and
Ashby suffer setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Infielder David Newhan, the son of Times Hall of Fame baseball
columnist Ross Newhan, has signed a triple-A contract with the
Dodgers. Newhan, 28, opened the 2001 season with the Philadelphia
Phillies but suffered a shoulder injury and underwent season-ending
surgery in late May. The former Anaheim Esperanza High, Cypress
College, Georgia Tech and Pepperdine standout also has played in the
major leagues with the San Diego Padres.</TE>

<HD>Bernstein's Goal: Finish in Fast Lane</HD>
<DH>Motor sports: At 57, pioneering drag racer hopes farewell
tour ends with his seventh title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are two things you must know about Kenny Bernstein. He is a
businessman, an entrepreneur credited with helping bring  the
National Hot Rod Assn. into the Fortune 500. He is also a drag racer,
the quickest quarter-miler in history.</LD>
<LD>   The businessman in him has a farewell  tour and marketing campaign
in front of him as he begins his final season driving the Budweiser
King Racing top fuel dragster in the Powerade NHRA drag racing
series.</LD>
<LD>   The racer in Bernstein promises he won't let the farewell tour
get in the way of his ultimate goal,  defending the championship he
won last season after more than two years of less-than-stellar
performances.</LD>
<TE>   Now 57 and successful beyond his wildest dreams, the beginning of
the end arrived Thursday at Pomona Raceway with the first day of
qualifying for the 42nd K&amp;N Filters Winternationals.</TE>
<TE>   It was an imperfect start with Bernstein encountering problems and
finishing 12th after the first of four qualifying passes.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't sunk in yet," Bernstein says of the impending finality
of his driving career. "The thought process now is the same as it is
every year, to win a championship. There's a lot of other stuff going
on with the tour and the fact that it's my last year as a driver....
But I'm focused on the fact that our race team is getting ready to
defend that championship."</TE>
<TE>   That championship, a duel with Larry Dixon that was decided at
Pomona in the final event of the season--which Bernstein won--was one
of Bernstein's most important accomplishments in a career that began
in the late 1960s and was funded by his door-to-door sales of
lingerie.</TE>
<TE>   Old enough to be a grandfather, Bernstein could have choked away
the title in the pressure-cooker with Dixon, 35. There was the
attention from the competing beer companies, Budweiser versus Dixon's
Miller Lite. There was Bernstein's experience versus Dixon's youth.
Even family relations were involved: Kim Richards, wife of Tim
Richards, the crew chief who masterminded Bernstein's turnaround, is
the daughter of Dixon's crew chief, Dick LaHaie.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was a big deal when I was watching 'SportsCenter' or
'RPM2Night' and they were talking about us and not John Force," Dixon
said. "And there's no love lost between the brewers. There was a lot
of pressure."</TE>
<TE>   It was exactly the kind of title Bernstein wanted to win, his
first since 1996 when his top fuel championship, coupled with four
funny car titles from 1985-88, made him the first driver in NHRA
history to win championships in both nitro divisions.</TE>
<TE>   But the 1996 championship was hollow  because of Blaine Johnson's
death. "I never accepted, never thought, never felt that [the 1996]
championship was ours," Bernstein said. "I felt it was more Blaine's
than mine. When it happened, he was ahead in the championship. I
never felt comfortable that that championship was really ours."</TE>
<TE>   Which is one of the reasons Bernstein relishes last year's title,
his sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "Last season was the best," he said. "I don't want to take
anything away from the early titles and all the efforts that were put
into them by the teams and crew chiefs, but this is the best for
several reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Among them was the arrival of crew chief Tim Richards three races
into the season, and the realization that a racing career that
included ownership of CART and NASCAR Winston Cup teams was nearly
over.</TE>
<TE>   "We had 21/2 years of not being competitive, winning one race, and
not being in the hunt for a championship was very frustrating," said
Bernstein, whose average reaction time of 0.490 seconds in 75 passes
was quickest in class.</TE>
<TE>   "You add those things together--you're 57 years old, you're in the
twilight of your career, you have a new crew chief who wasn't having
much success the last few years, and for all of us to raise up to
that level and stay at that level was very special. It's really the
kind of year you should quit on."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if he had known that he was going to win a career-best
eight races, an NHRA-record 61 rounds, and establish national elapsed
time (4.477 seconds) and speed (332.18 mph) records en route to a
sixth nitro championship, Bernstein says he would have quit. He won
the last three races of last season. But without a crystal ball,
Bernstein instead announced in June his return for 2002, capitalizing
on Budweiser's big send-off before turning over the driving duties to
his son, Brandon, 29. "He's intense every minute," Brandon Bernstein
said. "He definitely wants to go out on top. He wants to repeat as
champion, he wants to go out as champion."</TE>
<TE>   He also wants to satisfy Budweiser in its 23rd year as a Bernstein
sponsor, the second-longest relationship in motor sports next to
Richard Petty and STP.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein the businessman--and the racer--made 144 special
appearances last season, conducted more than 4,300 television and
2,700 radio interviews and generated more than 14,000 press
clippings. And with his final season ahead of him, interest will be
even more intense. But so will he.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing I still love most about this business is driving
the race car," Bernstein said.</TE>

<HD>Woods (66) Won't Let His Game Go South</HD>
<DH>Golf: Goggin (not Gogel) leads with 64 at Torrey Pines, but
there is a familiar name lurking two shots back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA JOLLA</DL>
<LD>Closing out a tournament with a winning number is one thing, but
getting started with a number low enough to hit that sonar octave,
well, that's something else indeed.</LD>
<LD>   Tiger Woods took off in pursuit of a pleasant Sunday finish at the
Buick Invitational when he opened with a six-under 66 Thursday at
Torrey Pines. Woods didn't have the low round of the day--Matthew
Goggin posted a 64 to lead--but it was the only 66 by a guy who has
won 29 times and six majors. If you're keeping score, it's Woods'
best opening round since September, when he began the Canadian Open
with a 65.</LD>
<LD>   As it turned out, the best way to get off to a good start on
opening day was to play the friendly North Course, not the newly
redone marathon called the South Course, which only Mark O'Meara, Lee
Porter and Jay Haas solved to some degree. Goggin's lead is one shot
over Jay Williamson and Luke Donald and two over Woods--and they all
played the North.</LD>
<TE>   Woods had six birdies, no bogeys and an adventurous par at his
closing hole, the par-five ninth, where he drove right and his ball
stopped under a tree. Woods decided the best play was to punch out to
the neighboring fourth fairway, where he knocked it on the green from
176 yards and two-putted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to get off to a good, solid start like that," he said.
"I didn't hit the ball all that great, but I made a lot of beautiful
putts.</TE>
<TE>   "I lipped out about six birdie putts. It could have been a really
low number. I just need to keep working on things I'm working on. I'm
being very patient on it and it's neat to see the game getting a
little bit better."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Goggin, a 27-year-old Australian who would have been
the second alternate this week except that he tied for eighth at
Pebble Beach, earned his way in and made it pay off with an
eight-under 64. Goggin finished with three consecutive birdies for
the early lead but stopped short of calling it a big deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like leading the first round of the Tour de France on the
flat, easy stuff," he said. "We have three days of high mountains to
go."</TE>
<TE>   At least Goggin recognizes the situation, something he has had a
problem with before. Actually, the problem was that people didn't
recognize him. They confused him with Matt Gogel, who won last week
at Pebble Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Said Goggin: "I'm hoping I get his check."</TE>
<TE>   The Goggin/Gogel connection reached a laughable level two years
ago after Gogel lost a seven-shot lead with seven holes to go at
Pebble Beach. Not long afterward, television analyst Peter Kostis
consoled Goggin, believing him to be Gogel. Goggin accepted the
condolences without comment. "I didn't have the heart to tell him,"
Goggin said.</TE>
<TE>   Donald, 24, from England, is a qualifying school graduate. He's
often mentioned with Charles Howell, David Gossett, Matt Kuchar and
Ty Tryon as one of the young guns earmarked for stardom. Donald tied
for 13th at the Sony Open and tied for 45th at Phoenix, but missed
the cut at Pebble Beach. After watching the success Howell had last
year when he won $1.78 million, Donald was inspired.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing so well out here, why can't I?" said Donald, who had a
65.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the best score that came out of the opening round was
produced by O'Meara. The 45-year-old, who hasn't won since the
Masters and the British Open in 1998, toured the beefed-up, elongated
South Course in a five-under 67. He's tied for sixth with David
Frost, Miguel Jimenez, Robin Freeman, Jerry Smith, David Sutherland
and Stephen Gangluff.</TE>
<TE>   "To shoot five under on a brand new golf course, it's not exactly
U.S. Open conditions right now, but it's a demanding course," O'Meara
said.</TE>
<TE>   Porter and Haas shot 68 on the 7,568-yard South Course and are
tied with 10 others, including Peter Jacobsen, who was reunited this
week with former caddie Mike "Fluff" Cowan.</TE>
<TE>   Woods began on the North back side and birdied the second par
five, the 18th, with a five-iron to 20 feet and a two-putt. He also
birdied the 469-yard No. 13 when he hit an eight-iron to 15 feet and
also the 397-yard No. 15 with driver, sand wedge to 12 feet.</TE>
<TE>   On the front side, his second nine holes, Woods two-putted from 25
feet to birdie the par-five No. 1, made a 10-footer to birdie No. 2
and made another 10-footer at No. 4 for another birdie. But his
errant drive at his closing hole, the ninth, cost him a chance to go
even lower.</TE>
<TE>   Woods now plays the South Course and he is sure some good scores
are going to be available, no matter how much tougher the course is
now. The South played to a 73.782 average while the North was 70.103.
Of the 73 players who finished at one under or better, 56 played the
North course.</TE>

<LD>The remaining months of 2002 won't make any difference. Engrave the
Fickle Owner of the Year Award and ship it to Roger Devenport in
Lexington, Ky.</LD>
<LD>   Devenport, 82, fired another trainer the other day. That's hardly
a horse racing headline anymore, because Devenport is always firing
his trainers. In fact, the latest conditioner to get the ax--the
capable Dallas Stewart--has been sacked twice by Devenport. Shades of
George Steinbrenner with his Yankee managers, before he and Joe Torre
struck the mother lode.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe I made a mistake last year when I rehired Stewart,"
Devenport said Thursday night. "Who knows?"</LD>
<TE>   That comment will be of little consolation to David Vance, another
trainer caught in Devenport's revolving door. When Devenport spirited
his well-bred filly, Unbridled Elaine, and the rest of his horses
away from Stewart in June, Vance took over the stock. He saddled
Unbridled Elaine for victories in the Iowa and Monmouth Oaks in July,
and was prepared to ship the filly to New York for the Breeders' Cup
in October when his phone rang, much as Stewart's had five months
before. It was Devenport, firing Vance and returning the horses to
Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Unbridled Elaine wasn't paying much attention. A week
after Vance was fired, the big gray, saddled by Stewart, won the
Breeders' Cup Distaff, at 12-1. Devenport, battling bone cancer, was
at Keeneland, his hometown track, where he bet $400 across the board
on the horse he named after one of his daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sad when Unbridled Elaine left, and happy when she came
back," Stewart said after the Breeders' Cup.</TE>
<TE>   When Unbridled Elaine left Stewart again, this week at the Fair
Grounds in New Orleans, it was for a trip back to Kentucky, where she
will soon be bred to the stallion Rahy. The rest of Devenport's
horses wound up with Tom Amoss at the Fair Grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Devenport, who picked out Unbridled Elaine as a weanling, buying
her for $230,000, said his beef with Vance was over shipping.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to get the filly to New York early, so she could get
used to the track," Devenport said. "The trainer didn't want to go
until the last minute."</TE>
<TE>   The second time around, Devenport dumped Stewart because he
thought the trainer hadn't detected an injury to Unbridled Elaine's
left front ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Devenport always has been a suspicious guy. Years ago, when he
raced quarter horses in North Dakota, one of his horses got away from
the gate badly and was beaten in a race he was expected to win. After
the race, Devenport said that he heard the trainer of the winning
horse promise the official starter a case of beer.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been very careful ever since," Devenport said.</TE>
<TE>   Devenport never raced his quarter horses in California but spent
time here as a Marine near the end of World War II. He hocked his
wristwatch and with a few buddies repaired to the Beverly Hills
Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the only way we were going to afford that place,"
Devenport said.</TE>
<TE>   One of their captains saw them there, felt they were cramping his
style and not too politely pointed toward the door.</TE>
<TE>   "Another guy saw we were having trouble, and came over and put the
captain in his place," Devenport said. "It was Errol Flynn."</TE>
<TE>   Back in his native Wisconsin, Devenport got in the butter business
and made his fortune. Cholesterol wasn't even a rumor then. Before it
was sold, his butter company was churning out 45 million pounds a
year.</TE>
<TE>   There is no need for Devenport to travel to Miami Beach for the
Eclipse awards dinner on Feb. 18. Despite winning the Breeders' Cup
race, Unbridled Elaine is not a contender for 3-year-old filly. The
finalists are Exogenous, who died of finjuries suffered when she
reared and fell before the Distaff; Flute, seventh as the favorite in
the Distaff; and Xtra Heat, second in the Breeders' Cup Sprint.</TE>
<TE>   Devenport scoffs at the vote, in the tone of voice he might
usually reserve for dispatching a trainer.</TE>
<TE>   "Did any of those horses earn more than my horse?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   No, they didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "Would the owners [of Flute and Xtra Heat] rather have their
horses than my horse?" he said. "Of course they wouldn't. Not a
shadow of a doubt."</TE>

<HD>Veteran's Day for the Kings</HD>
<DH>Hockey: After 16 years in the NHL, Buchberger scores 100th
goal in 2-1 victory over Carolina.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kelly Buchberger has never been known as a goal scorer. Thursday
night the 16-year NHL veteran became one, scoring his 100th goal and
giving the Kings a 2-1 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes in front
of 15,960 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Playing in his 1,013th NHL game, Buchberger stepped up when his
team needed him most with a third-period goal. The Kings also got
another strong game in goal from Felix Potvin, who finished with 17
saves to improve to 14-7-3 over his last 26 starts.</LD>
<LD>   The victory moved the Kings (26-20-7-2; 61 points) into a tie with
Edmonton for sixth place in the Western Conference. King Coach Andy
Murray just wants his team to continue to win and not worry about
what the other teams in the conference are doing.</LD>
<TE>   "It really doesn't matter [because] the only good feeling we
should have is after we win," Murray said. "There is no secret to the
games right now.... Most of the teams, with the exception of two or
three with ourselves being one of them, play the same style. The only
difference is player personnel."</TE>
<TE>   Winning at home is not something the Kings have figured out too
well this season, posting a 12-11-3-1 record at Staples Center. One
reason behind the Kings' weak home record has been their inability to
get off to quick starts.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't an issue against Carolina Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in his first game since Jan. 28, defenseman Mathieu
Schneider returned off injured reserve and put the Kings ahead, 1-0,
midway into the first period with a highlight goal from deep in the
right corner.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina goaltender Arturs Irbe, who entered the game with a weak
2.84 goals-against average, was the most amazed person in the arena
when Schneider squeezed home a shot from between the right circle and
the end line for his fifth goal of the season at 10:14.</TE>
<TE>   Murray was glad to have Schneider back after he missed two games
with a shoulder injury.</TE>
<TE>   "He is wearing bigger size shoulder pads," Murray said. "The ones
he was wearing were some little pads he had since he was a kid. He
looked like a body builder this week in practice."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings tried to add to their lead the rest of the first period
but their shooting touch was a off. Although the Kings ended the
period with an 11-7 edge in shots, they would have had plenty of more
if they were able to reach the net.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina, which owns a comfortable lead over Washington for first
place in the Southeast Division, was happy to be down by only by a
goal at the start of the second period. And the Hurricanes took
advantage of the Kings' first-period scoring woes by tying the score,
1-1, on a Shane Willis' power-play goal 9:21 into the second.</TE>
<TE>   With Adam Deadmarsh in the penalty box for slashing, Willis lifted
a shot from outside the left post that got underneath Potvin's right
arm for his seventh goal of the season.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, Buchberger and Potvin teamed up to make sure
the Kings did not allow another game to get away with a strong third
period.</TE>
<TE>   Buchberger knocked in his fifth goal of the season 3:33 into the
third period when he jumped on a loose puck in the slot and beat
Irbe, who finished with 26 saves.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings now play Phoenix (twice) and Dallas before the Winter
Olympics break.</TE>
<TE>   "These games coming up are very important to us," said defenseman
Jaroslav Modry, who had a hip-flexor injury and did not play. "With
the Olympics coming up, we want to get into a good position going
into the break. We have to approach this part of the season as if
these games are going to prove to make the difference for our
season."</TE>
<TE>   For Carolina, Thursday's game against the Kings was the first of a
three-game West Coast trip. After playing the Ducks tonight at the
Arrowhead Pond, the Hurricanes will play at San Jose on Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Shaq Is Back on the Sideline</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: O'Neal goes on the injured list. He'll miss
the All-Star game, next four Laker games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal will sit out Sunday's NBA All-Star game in
Philadelphia and the next four regular-season games, at least, as the
Lakers continue to deal conservatively with his arthritic big toe.</LD>
<LD>   The club put O'Neal on its injured list Thursday, retroactive to
Wednesday night's loss to the Chicago Bulls, which O'Neal watched
from the bench. Jelani McCoy was activated from the injured list.</LD>
<LD>   Elton Brand of the Clippers will take O'Neal's place on the
All-Star team.</LD>
<TE>   O'Neal, averaging 26.1 points and 10.8 rebounds, was on the
injured list from Dec. 25 to Jan. 3 because of the same ailment. If
he serves only the minimum five games, he would return Feb. 19
against Boston, having missed games against Chicago, Washington, at
Seattle, against Atlanta and at Portland in the meantime.</TE>
<TE>   The schedule will give O'Neal at least 15 days' rest, and stay a
course the Lakers hope will have their center healthy and capable by
the playoffs, which begin in mid-April. Laker General Manager Mitch
Kupchak said Thursday it is possible O'Neal would return to the
injured list at least once more during the regular season, depending
on the condition of his toe.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert Mohr, chief of podiatric surgery at UCLA Medical
Center, has taken over the treatment of O'Neal from the
organization's team of physicians. He has ordered a modification of
O'Neal's shoe, made by Starter, and a new orthotic device designed to
relieve the pressure on O'Neal's toe.</TE>
<TE>   The next step would be an injection into the toe, but only if the
previous measures did not bring relief.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were able to start the clock on O'Neal's five-game stay
on the injured list on Wednesday because Kupchak telephoned league
vice president Stu Jackson with the transaction before the Chicago
game.</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak called Jackson from Italy, then flew to Philadelphia on
Thursday via Paris. With assistant Ronnie Lester, Kupchak had spent
10 days in Europe on a scouting assignment, monitoring O'Neal along
the way.</TE>
<TE>   There is no sentiment--from Mohr or Kupchak--that O'Neal is
careening toward off-season surgery and that doctors and the
organization are merely keeping him propped up until then.</TE>
<TE>   Surgery is considered a final resort, however.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't script it," Kupchak said. "It has been discussed as a
possibility, although not in depth. We're not there yet, and to weigh
where we are going to be three or four months from now is premature."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who sat out last season's All-Star game in Washington
because of a sore right foot, will participate in most of the
festivities during this All-Star weekend.</TE>
<TE>   And while it is impossible to know O'Neal's second-half
availability--he has played in 14 of 23 games since the pain in his
toe became acute--Kupchak said he is no more likely to look for
front-line help in the days leading to the Feb. 21 trading deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to happen," Kupchak said. "There's nobody
available out there that would make sense to us."</TE>
<TE>   That means more of Samaki Walker at center, where he started
Wednesday night and in most of the games O'Neal has missed, and Slava
Medvedenko, Mark Madsen or Robert Horry at power forward.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their recent struggles--they are 17-12 since their 16-1
start--the Lakers are 33-13, three wins better than they were last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to minimize the regular season or the All-Star
game," Kupchak said. "That's not what this is about. But we are
trying to point to the postseason. We may get to the point in March
or April, where there's no improvement, and you have to go as long
and hard as you can go. There's no sense in doing that now."</TE>

<HD>Cheever Believes IRL Running in High Gear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eddie Cheever has been the Indy Racing League's biggest cheerleader
from the day Tony George's fledgling open-wheel racing circuit ran
its first race at Walt Disney World in 1996, and his enthusiasm is
running high again as the IRL prepares for its seventh season.</LD>
<LD>   "It is amazing the amount of progress this series has made already
this year," said Cheever during an IRL test at California Speedway in
Fontana. "You can see the level of the series lifting almost on a
daily basis."</LD>
<LD>   One of the most significant developments has been the defection of
Roger Penske and his Team Marlboro drivers Gil de Ferran and Indy 500
winner Helio Castroneves from CART, where De Ferran is a two-time
champion, to the IRL. A number of other CART drivers, including
Michael Andretti, Jimmy Vasser, Kenny Brack, Dario Franchitti and
Paul Tracy, have announced plans to run at Indy, the IRL's
centerpiece race.</LD>
<TE>   Another is the addition of California Speedway, Michigan Speedway
and Nazareth (Pa.) Speedway to their schedule, making 15 races, all
on oval tracks in the United States. The Fontana race will be March
24.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember, when we started we had only three races the first
year," Cheever said.</TE>
<TE>   Cheever won the 1998 Indianapolis 500 driving a Dallara powered by
an Olds Aurora engine, but the former Formula One driver switched to
a Nissan Infiniti power plant early in the 1999 season. In 2000, he
gave Infiniti its first IRL victory in the Radisson 200 at Pikes Peak
Raceway in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   With Olds no longer in existence, Chevrolet has taken over the
Aurora program, but Cheever, 44, remains steadfast in his loyalty to
Infiniti.</TE>
<TE>   "We want Nissan to be the first Japanese manufacturer to win the
Indy 500," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He'd better hurry. Toyota will join the IRL in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint Cars</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's short-track racing season begins Saturday
afternoon at Perris Auto Speedway with the opening event of the
Sprint Car Racing Assn. schedule. The race will match the two
champions of non-winged racing, Cory Kruseman of the SCRA and J.J.
Yeley of the U.S. Auto Club.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-lap main event will be the first daytime sprint car race on
the half-mile dirt oval since PAS opened in March 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Kruseman, 31, operator of a driving school in Ventura, may be
leaving the SCRA if all goes well with an IRL test Monday at Las
Vegas Motor Speedway. Kruseman, who won the Chili Bowl in 2000 and
the non-winged world championship in 1999, will take a rookie test
with PDM Racing.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Kruseman led the SCRA points race from the first event,
setting a single-season record of 15 main event wins. He finished in
the top five in 35 of 43 races.</TE>
<TE>   Yeley, 25, ninth-place finisher in the 1998 Indianapolis 500, won
the first sprint car race held at the Perris oval and held the track
record for more than four years. He will be in the No. 21J car owned
by Dwight Chaney in Saturday's race.</TE>
<TE>   Two-time USAC sprint car champion Tony Elliott of Kokomo, Ind.,
will drive a Gardner Motorsports car Saturday as a teammate of SCRA
veteran Troy Rutherford. The entry list will also include other SCRA
favorites such as former two-time champion Richard Griffin, Rip
Williams, John Scott, Mike Kirby and Tony Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Gates will open at 11 a.m. with the first race at 1:30 p.m. After
Saturday's race, all PAS events will be at night through Nov. 16.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 23, the Pennzoil World of Outlaws will make its only
Southern California appearance of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Supercross</TE>
<TE>   Who would believe, after five West Coast events, that seven-time
champion Jeremy McGrath would be in eighth place, 51 points behind
Yamaha's David Vuillemin, as the EA Sports Supercross season heads
east. Or that Ricky Carmichael, winner of the last 13 races last
year, would trail both the Frenchman Vuillemin and veteran Mike
LaRocco.</TE>
<TE>   In both Phoenix and last week's Anaheim race, McGrath looked like
his old self by getting the hole-shot and leading the first few laps
before fading back into the pack with "arm pump," a condition that
makes it nearly impossible to grip the handlebars of his Yamaha with
any strength.</TE>
<TE>   "My arms are a little better each week," McGrath said. "I had a
good rhythm going, but we've had a rough month." He was sixth in each
of the last two events, both won by Carmichael.</TE>
<TE>   The 16-race series will be in Indianapolis on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Fast Laps</TE>
<TE>   Dale Earnhardt is one of eight racing personalities who will be
enshrined in the Motorsports Hall of Fame on June 12, in Detroit.
Others are two-time Indy 500 winner Gordon Johncock, drag racing
record-breaker Eddie Hill, pioneer racer Gaston Chevrolet, engine
designer Fred Offenhauser, sports car veteran Brian Redman, world
motorcycle champion Eddie Lawson and stunt pilot Paul Mantz.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Michaelian, newly named president and chief executive officer
of the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, celebrated his new position
by co-driving a Porsche GT3 to 18th place in the Rolex 24 at Daytona
International Speedway. With Matthew Talbert of Templeton, Calif.,
Ludovico Manfredi of Key Biscayne, Fla., and Paul Daniels of Great
Britain, the team completed 618 laps, or 2286.6 miles, in the 24-hour
race.</TE>
<TE>   The NHRA Motorsports Museum will host an open house tonight, "A
Salute to Gassers," in which old-time drag racers such as George
Montgomery, Big John Mazmanian, Junior Thomson, K.S. Pitman and Bones
Balogh will be honored. Montgomery's famous '33 Willys, holder of
many speed records, will make its museum debut.</TE>
<TE>   Chevrolet's Corvette will be the pace car for the May 26
Indianapolis 500, making its fifth appearance at the head of the
33-car field.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Howard Handy, 84, boss of the pressroom at the Toyota Grand Prix
of Long Beach for the past 20 years, died Jan. 30 at his home in
Irvine. Handy had been sports editor of the Compton Herald-American,
a columnist for the Costa Mesa Daily Pilot and a member of the
Dodgers' public relations staff. Survivors include Lois, his wife of
61 years; sons Howard Jr., Burt, Daniel and Michael; 12 grandchildren
and two great grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 2
p.m. Saturday in the Meadows clubhouse, 14851 Jeffrey Road, Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Vernon "Gabby'' Garrison, one of the charter members of the
Pacific Racing Assn. in 1959, died Saturday in Long Beach. Garrison,
born in 1916, raced stock cars into his 70s.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota made its drag racing debut Thursday at the 42nd K&amp;N Filters
Winternationals, and funny car driver Gary Scelzi was giddy
afterward, placing the 2002 Celica sixth on the grid after the first
of four rounds of qualifying at the Powerade NHRA Drag Racing Series
opener.</LD>
<LD>   "I just let the light turn green and stayed on top of it," said
Scelzi, who clocked 4.934 seconds and 301.74 mph in only the second
full pass by the six-day-old car. "It did everything it was supposed
to do. We lost a blower belt at about 1,100 feet.... It's not that
far off to run an 80 [4.8-second range], and we probably would have
run an 89, which I believe would have been first until [John] Force
knocked everyone's blocks off the wall."</LD>
<LD>   Force, the series champion from Yorba Linda, was the top qualifier
in his 2001 Mustang. Alongside series runner-up Whit Bazemore, Force
ran 322.27 mph in 4.764 seconds, a time that would have won last
year's race. Bazemore was second at 4.815 seconds and 321.50 mph, and
Force's teammate, Gary Densham of Bellflower, was third at 4.891
seconds and 263.72 mph.</LD>
<TE>   Doug Kalitta was first in top fuel, clocking 4.593 seconds and
319.90 mph. He was followed by Doug Herbert in 4.653 and 315.93 mph,
and Tony Schumacher in 4.663 and 314.31 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's pro stock runner-up, Jim Yates, set a track record
of 6.825 seconds (201.85 mph) in a 2001 Grand Am. Kurt Johnson,
second in qualifying, set a track record by going 202.88 mph in a
2002 Cavalier.</TE>

<HD>No All-Star Game for Injured Carter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Toronto Raptors' latest victory came at a high price.</LD>
<LD>   Keon Clark scored six of his 17 points in overtime as the Raptors
overcame the loss of Vince Carter to an injury and defeated the San
Antonio Spurs, 80-74, Thursday night at Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   Carter, the leading vote-getter for the NBA All-Star game for the
third consecutive year, will sit out Sunday's All-Star game and at
least four Raptor games because of a left quadriceps strain.</LD>
<TE>   Carter was injured while driving to the basket with 1:31 left in
the second quarter. He is expected to be sidelined at least 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   "This was definitely a team effort," Clark said. "We have to play
defense like we did tonight. If they can't shoot, they can't score."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Duncan had 22 points on six-for-29 shooting for the Spurs, who
shot 24%.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably the worst game of my career," Duncan said. "This
one's on me."</TE>
<TE>   Washington 108, Sacramento 101--Michael Jordan said this week that
Popeye Jones "could take my place in the All-Star game." Jones
certainly put up All-Star numbers against the team with the best
record in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Jones survived foul trouble, made all eight of his shots from the
field--including his first dunk of the season--and finished with 18
points and 15 rebounds at Washington as the Wizards sailed into the
All-Star break with their biggest surprise yet.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' eighth double-double of the season, along with his
defensive job on Chris Webber and Vlade Divac, combined with Richard
Hamilton's 33 points and Jordan's 25 to put the Wizards five games
above .500, their best record at the All-Star break in 23 years. They
have won five in a row and seven of eight and their 26-21 record is a
14-win improvement over 12-35 after 47 games a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the type of emotion I always envisioned about this team,"
Jordan said, "where the young guys just feed off each other. I told
everybody before the game: 'We've got nothing to lose. Everybody
expects us to lose by 25 anyway, so just go out there and have fun
and play hard.'"</TE>
<TE>   Jordan made 12 of 30 shots and had nine assists and six rebounds
in 41 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings came out flat at the end of a four-game trip, having
traveled overnight after a victory at Boston. Webber returned to the
lineup after sitting out the Celtic game because of stomach flu.</TE>
<TE>   But Webber made only nine for 21 shots from the field and Peja
Stojakovic went six for 16.</TE>
<TE>   Webber, who had been 5-0 against the Wizards since they traded him
to the Kings in 1998, finished with 21 points and nine rebounds.
Stojakovic scored 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 100, Charlotte 93--Allen Iverson scored 36 points,
including two late driving baskets, to lead the 76ers at Charlotte.
Philadelphia's Corie Blount tipped in Dikembe Mutombo's miss to give
the 76ers a 91-89 lead with 3:43 left, and Iverson followed with two
off-balance runners to make it 95-89.</TE>
<TE>   Baron Davis, who had 23 points for Charlotte, missed a three-point
attempt with 23 seconds remaining and the Hornets trailing, 96-93,
then Philadelphia sealed the win at the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   New York 92, Atlanta 89--Allan Houston scored 32 points, including
a three-point basket with 2.1 seconds remaining at New York, helping
the Knicks end a three-game losing streak. Hanno Mottola missed a
three-pointer at the buzzer for Atlanta, which had its two-game
winning streak halted.</TE>
<TE>   Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 21 of his 29 points in the second half
for the Hawks.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 107, Memphis 103--Sam Cassell had 29 points and 10
assists just hours after signing a three-year, $17-million contract
extension and the Bucks ended a two-game losing streak with a victory

victory for the Bucks, who had lost five of six.</TE>

<HD>De La Hoya Will Retire After Three More Fights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five-time world champion Oscar De La Hoya has a simple plan--three
fights and out the door.</LD>
<LD>   Now that he has everything he has ever wanted, it's nearly time to
focus on life outside of boxing, he said.</LD>
<LD>   De La Hoya's personal single-elimination competition begins May 4
in Las Vegas when he defends his World Boxing Council
super-welterweight title against Fernando Vargas, a man he said he
truly dislikes and believes is bad for the sport he loves.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not going to go back on my word," De La Hoya said Thursday
from his home in Puerto Rico, referring to a longtime plan to retire
from boxing when he turns 30. "I can have three big fights this year
and call it quits, that's actually the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Boxing has been really good to me. Why stay in the sport any
longer, where I could really get hurt?"</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya, 34-2 with 27 knockouts, said he also hopes to fight
Felix Trinidad and Shane Mosley--the two fighters who've beaten
him--before he retires.</TE>
<TE>   "That's very personal for me, I want to avenge my two losses," De
La Hoya said.</TE>
<TE>   But what if he loses to Vargas?</TE>
<TE>   "My retirement plan comes earlier," De La Hoya said. "Oh yeah, of
course, there's no doubt about it. That's the easy way out, losing
and just retiring. Of course, I don't want that. That's a lot of
pressure there."</TE>
<TE>   The fight against Vargas, 22-1 with 20 knockouts, will be the
first for De La Hoya since he beat Javier Castillejo in Las Vegas in
June, and his first since he reconciled with promoter Bob Arum.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Tyson, barred from fighting WBC-International Boxing
Federation heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis in Nevada, applied for a
license to fight in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The Nevada Athletic Commission voted 4-1 on Jan. 29 to deny Tyson
a license to fight Lewis on April 6 in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation will process the
request despite a recommendation by the Assn. of Boxing Commissions
that states deny Tyson a boxing license, department spokesman Kevin
Ketchum said.</TE>
<TE>   Shelly Finkel, Tyson's advisor, has said seven states have
expressed interest in a Tyson challenge to Lewis.</TE>

<TE>   Football</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Raider defensive tackle Darrell Russell ran the video
camera that taped a 27-year-old woman being raped by at least one of
his friends, prosecutors alleged in Alameda.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they were unsure whether Russell had sex with the
woman but are charging him as an accomplice. Russell could be found
guilty of crimes committed by either friend if it is determined that
he did not intervene.</TE>
<TE>   Russell appeared in court Thursday for the alleged drugging and
rape of the woman that police say occurred last week at the Alameda
home of Raider defensive back Eric Johnson. Alameda County Superior
Court Judge Jeffrey Allen denied Russell's request to reduce his
$1.2-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   Russell, the No. 2 overall pick in the 1997 NFL draft, was charged
Monday with 25 counts.</TE>
<TE>   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers moved closer to making Baltimore
defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis their coach, discussing a contract
and working to assemble an offensive staff.... Charger Coach Marty
Schottenheimer hired four assistants, including his son, Brian, who
will coach the quarterbacks. The other additions are Jerry Holmes
(defensive backs), Greg Manusky (linebackers) and Dave Redding
(strength and conditioning).... Former Pittsburgh Steeler safety
Darren Perry was hired Thursday as the Cincinnati Bengals' safeties
coach.... Former NFL and college head coach Dan Henning was hired by
the Carolina Panthers as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks
coach.... The Green Bay Packers agreed to terms with free agent Josh
Heupel, who quarterbacked Oklahoma to the 2000 national championship.</TE>

Sweden on March 1, play England on March 3 and Norway on March 5. The
tournament also includes Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany,
Portugal, Scotland and Wales.</TE>
<TE>   Defending men's soccer champion Cameroon advanced to the African
Cup of Nations final, beating host nation Mali, 3-0, in Bamako, Mali.
Senegal upset Nigeria, 2-1, to reach Sunday's final.</TE>

<TE>   Monica Seles and Justine Henin will meet in the quarterfinals of
the Gaz de France tournament in France after both won second-round

<TE>   Seles beat Adriana Serra-Zanetti, 7-5, 6-2, while Henin needed two
hours to get past Nathalie Dechy, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (8). Fourth-seeded
Jelena Dokic and Elena Dementieva were among those who advanced.</TE>

<KH>With President Bush and World Trade Center Flag Present, and
Memories of Sept. 11 Fresh, Today's Opening Ceremony Promises to Be a
Show of ...</KH>
<HD>Power and Glory</HD>
<DH>Fanfare, Potent Symbolism Make Scandal a Distant Memory as
Games Begin</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The furor over the Salt Lake City Olympic bid scandal has largely
dissipated. Now, if only the fog would do the same.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 Olympic Winter Games will open today at Rice-Eccles
Stadium amid predictions of fog and cold, fanfare and flag waving,
and, perhaps, a few cautious glances at skies patrolled by military
planes. Today's opening ceremony, to be performed in front of an
audience that's expected to include President Bush and Secretary of
State Colin Powell, will look back to pay tribute to victims of the
Sept. 11 tragedies and honor heroes who risked their lives, while
also looking ahead to the athletic spectacle that will unfold over
the next 17 days.</LD>
<LD>   Central to the ceremony will be the entrance of the tattered U.S.
flag found in the rubble of the World Trade Center after the towers
were attacked. It will be carried by an honor guard of eight U.S.
athletes and two policemen from the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey, a gesture sure to spark an emotional response from
spectators who have paid as much as $885 to sit in evening cold.
However, the flag will not fly over the stadium because it was deemed
too fragile to withstand harsh weather.</LD>
<TE>   "This particular flag doesn't only represent the U.S. It
represents all the victims at the World Trade Center," said luge
competitor Mark Grimmette, one of the eight chosen to carry the
symbolic flag.</TE>
<TE>   Said short-track speedskater Amy Peterson, who will carry an
intact U.S. flag as she precedes the U.S. team into the stadium for
the traditional parade of nations: "It's part of each and every
American now. It's part of who we are.... It should be there."</TE>
<TE>   From the 211-athlete U.S. delegation to the one-person teams sent
by Bermuda, Cameroon, Cyprus, Fiji, India, Kenya, Nepal, San Marino,
South Africa, Tajikstan and Thailand, 77 nations will gather for the
first Winter Games in the U.S. since 1980. The 2,531 athletes--the
largest group assembled for a Winter Games--will celebrate youth and
vigor and the joy of competition. No matter that the festive air may
seem incongruous against a background of police and soldiers
safeguarding downtown streets and bomb-sniffing dogs nosing around
venues.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all athletes are very confident with the system that's in
place," said U.S. cross-country skier Nina Kemppel, a four-time
Olympian. "My biggest concern coming in here was that security was
going to be claustrophobic and distracting from what we need to do.
It really hasn't been that way. It's been very apparent, but it
hasn't been distracting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like when I crawl into bed at night and get under my down
comforter. It's the same kind of warm, fuzzy feeling."</TE>
<TE>   If the cold, hard steel of rifles slung over the shoulders of
soldiers is meant to produce a warm, fuzzy feeling, these Games will
generate a lot of heat.</TE>
<TE>   The ratio of security personnel to athletes is four to one, and
the security budget has reached about $310 million. That's more than
three times the cost of security for the 1996 Summer Games in
Atlanta, which involved four times as many athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Of the security budget, $240 million will come from the federal
government, which has stepped in since Sept. 11 to help minimize the
threat of terrorism striking again. The Secret Service has overseen
security preparations and the Games were designated a National
Special Security event, as was the Super Bowl five days ago in New
Orleans. That went off without a security hitch.</TE>
<TE>   The first test of the Olympic security net occurred Thursday after
an unattended white plastic bag was spotted in a downtown parking
structure, leading Salt Lake police to dispatch a bomb squad and
evacuate two nearby buildings. Sgt. Craig Gleason, a police
spokesman, said the bag contained red and white electrical wire and
fuses which alone could not be used to construct an explosive device.
However, authorities "blew it to smithereens," Gleason said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the package was not a threat, he said the test was
useful.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned we can all play together," Gleason said of the
multiple security layers that have been stitched together. "Let's
face it. You can't throw a rock around here and not hit someone from
a law enforcement agency."</TE>
<TE>   There are no guarantees everything will go perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation looms as a potential problem, especially moving
spectators to ski events in Park City in bad weather. And a
high-pressure weather system pressing a lid on cold air, auto
emissions and other pollutants over the area has obscured the
picture-postcard vista of the Wasatch Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   But other than last-minute security sweeps of the Salt Lake Ice
Center--site of figure skating and short-track speedskating--and
applying the final brushstrokes to the curling target on the Ice
Sheet at Ogden, Salt Lake City appears to be ready for its moment on
the global stage.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly we have noticed the degree of preparation is
excellent," said Francois Carrard, director general of the
International Olympic Committee. "It's like you have assembled
resources, human and technical and others. The whole thing must start
to work. We will see at the opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "Our main concern is that the athletes have the best conditions to
compete, and I am convinced such is the case."</TE>
<TE>   Rice-Eccles Stadium will be part of a "no-fly zone" today and
during the Feb. 24 closing ceremony, and general aviation will be
restricted. On the ground, metal detectors have been installed at
each venue and spectators have been advised to leave home backpacks,
tote bags and blankets to expedite the screening process.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Utah officials have stockpiled supplies of
antibiotics and vaccines to combat epidemics or bioterrorism. Some
Olympic delegations have brought their own supplies of water and
Cipro, the drug used to combat anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting in and out of the village is definitely tighter with
security checkpoints you have to go through, especially to get in. It
makes us feel a little bit less anxious," said U.S. men's figure
skating champion Todd Eldredge, another of the eight bearers of the
World Trade Center flag. He and Grimmette will be joined by hockey
defenseman Angela Ruggiero of Simi Valley, biathlete Kristina
Sabasteanski, skeleton competitor Lea Ann Parsley, curler Stacy
Liapis, speedskater Derek Parra of San Bernardino and freestyle skier
Chris Klug.</TE>
<TE>   "And I'm sure there are certain things they're doing we don't know
about," Eldredge added, referring to security precautions. "As long
as it's safe and everything goes off as it's supposed to, we'll be
fine."</TE>
<TE>   IOC President Jacques Rogge, presiding over his first Games, said
he was "very pleased" by the preparations of the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee "and we look forward to continuing that avenue."</TE>
<TE>   "We anticipate great competition," he added. "We believe the Games
will have special significance after 11 September. It is a very
strong signal, people coming together from different countries and
ethnic origins.... The security arrangements are of the highest
possible level, and we are very pleased with what the American
authorities have put in place."</TE>
<TE>   All is in place for a record 78 events to be contested. Added to
the Olympic program since the 1998 Nagano Games are women's bobsled,
men's and women's cross-country ski sprint races, an individual
sprint in Nordic combined and a 1,500-meter race in short-track
speedskating. In addition, the fields in curling and women's hockey
have been expanded, skeleton has returned for the first time since
1948, and snowboarding's giant slalom event was transformed into a
parallel giant slalom with racers competing side-by-side.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Olympic Committee officials have set a goal of winning 20
medals, seven more than the previous high total attained at the 1994
Lillehammer Games and matched four years later at Nagano. The
international successes of skiers Kristina Koznick and Bode Miller,
figure skater Michelle Kwan, short-track speedskater Apolo Anton
Ohno, bobsled driver Todd Hays and others puts that goal firmly
within the realm of possibility.</TE>
<TE>   But will the desire to root, root, root for the home team create
an uncomfortable environment for foreign athletes?</TE>
<TE>   Rogge believes Americans will find a balance between pride and
politeness.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been at the 1984 Los Angeles Games and the 1996 Atlanta
Games and I really look forward to these Games," he said. "We want a
warm, supporting public. Americans want fair play and I know
Americans will also cheer for other athletes. I am not concerned for
bias, jingoism or an excess of nationalism."</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Baldwin, president of the USOC, recalled being
congratulated by host Norwegians after U.S. skier Tommy Moe defeated
Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt to win the downhill at Lillehammer. She
hopes Americans will be as gracious toward visitors as Norwegians
were to her.</TE>
<TE>   "We all root for each other," she said. "We feel a special
patriotism at these Games, but that just adds to the passion. It
doesn't take away from sportsmanship."</TE>

<HD>Greeks Want Marbles Back by 2004 Games</HD>
<DH>Art: Sculptures and friezes have been in England for more
than 200 years. Museum would be built in Athens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The Greek government, intent on taking full advantage of the
unparalleled publicity platform the Olympic Games offers, on Thursday
renewed its long-standing claim for the British Museum to return to
Greece one of the world's most valuable art prizes, the Parthenon
Marbles.</LD>
<LD>   Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos, in an interview with The
Times, maintained that the series of sculptures and friezes "are not
independent archeological items but part of a single immobile
building, the main symbol of western civilization," and said they
ought to be returned to Greece, as a long-term loan, in time for the
2004 Summer Games.</LD>
<LD>   "It is not a claim of the Greek people or the Greek government
against the United Kingdom, but a necessity of the monument itself,"
Venizelos said.</LD>
<TE>   The marbles consist of 56 blocks of friezes and 19 statues. The
dispute over their proper place is so fierce that there is even
argument over what they ought to be called. The British don't call
them the Parthenon Marbles; they call them the Elgin Marbles, after
the earl who brought them to London some 200 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   For centuries before that, the marbles had graced the Acropolis,
the hill in downtown Athens on which the Parthenon sits.</TE>
<TE>   For decades now, the Greeks have pressed for the return of what
they believe to be one of the central icons of their national
culture.</TE>
<TE>   The British, meantime, have said they own the marbles, and that's
that. The marbles are without question one of the British Museum's
primary attractions.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the long-term loan first surfaced last May, in a
letter from Venizelos to the British government. He reiterated the
proposal Thursday and plans to make it again in the next few days
with reporters from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   He said here Thursday that the "new material element" in the
campaign is a museum dedicated to the antiquities of the Acropolis
that the Greeks hope to have built and operational by the opening of
the Summer Games on Aug. 13, 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The cornerstone of the museum is due to be laid this year. It
would be built on the south side of the Acropolis, and plans call for
a dramatic glass structure that would afford fantastic views of the
hill.</TE>
<TE>   The loan, as described by Venizelos, actually would amount to a
kind of trade. Greek officials stand prepared to offer the British
Museum their pick from collections in Greece of thousands of statues
and vases dating 2,500 years; they also are offering to post an
engraved sign in the new Acropolis museum stating unequivocally that
the British Museum owns the marbles.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problem with ownership by the British Museum if it can
achieve reunification of the marbles of the Parthenon," Venizelos
said.</TE>
<TE>   Given the state of construction projects in Greece--the building
of roads, rail lines and sports venues for the Games has been plagued
by delays--it remains highly uncertain whether the facility could be
ready in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Venizelos said the building would be ready because it had to be
ready.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>   Today's subject: anti-Americanism. Why are we so disliked by so
many people?</LD>
<LD>   Many Americans have asked that question in regard to much of the
Muslim world since Sept. 11, since we saw the chilling video of
Palestinians figuratively dancing on the graves of those killed in
terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The first time I asked that question was 19 years ago at the
opening ceremony of the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas,
Venezuela. When the U.S. team marched into the stadium during the
parade of nations, a large number of Venezuelan young people around
me chanted, "Cuba, si! Yanqui, no."</TE>
<TE>   I asked some of them why they were hostile toward the United
States and didn't get satisfactory answers. But all I had to do was
observe.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team marching in the opening ceremony was by far the
largest, even larger than the host Venezuelans' team. Although all of
those U.S. athletes had earned places in the Games, I'm sure to
people from other countries it seemed as if we were flaunting our
athletic superiority in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Our athletes made the situation worse in subsequent days with
constant complaints about conditions in the athletes' village, which,
in a nation devastated by depressed oil prices, didn't quite get
finished.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Olympic Committee responded by acquiring hotel rooms for
our athletes on the nights before they were to compete, a luxury that
wasn't available to athletes from most countries. They responded by
calling our athletes "Ugly Americans."</TE>
<TE>   It would not be the last time I heard that expression during an
international sporting event designed to harbor goodwill among
nations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anti-American sentiment within the sporting world is exacerbated
during Olympic Games in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   That is not because we are patriotic. Most people, no matter which
country they are from, are patriotic. It's not even because we are so
boisterously patriotic. I've never heard louder chants than the
"Ozzie, Ozzie, Ozzie, oy, oy, oy," from Australians when their
athletes were competing during the Sydney Games.</TE>
<TE>   It's because we so often allow our patriotism to blind us to the
achievements of athletes from other countries. When a U.S. athlete is
out of contention, the cheering stops.</TE>
<TE>   The worldwide impression of Americans is that we don't care who
wins if it's not an American, an impression confirmed by the U.S. TV
networks' emphasis on U.S. athletes to the exclusion of virtually
everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   That was the major complaint of foreign athletes about the 1984
Summer Games in Los Angeles, which, with the Soviet Bloc athletes
boycotting, became an orgy of jingoism as Americans won far more than
their fair share of medals.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the news that we also made a ton of money on the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the surplus stayed in Los Angeles with the Amateur
Athletic Foundation. The rest went to the U.S. Olympic Committee,
which, as part of a solidarity program, shared it with other nations.</TE>
<TE>   But to say that not all USOC board members were fond of the
program is an understatement.</TE>
<TE>   I recall one particular proposal to send $20,000 to Japan.</TE>
<TE>   George Steinbrenner bolted from his seat as though he had sat on a
tack.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty thousand dollars to the damn Japs," he exclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   Soon thereafter, the USOC elected Steinbrenner as a vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That brings us to Salt Lake City, where the Winter Olympics begin
today. There was a concern among foreign media before Sept. 11 that
this would be a festival of Americanism. Now, since Sept. 11,
visitors seem more than willing to cut us a little slack.</TE>
<TE>   That includes the International Olympic Committee. No matter what
you might think of IOC President Jacques Rogge and his band of
rogues, they, in conjunction with the USOC and the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee, arrived at the best solution for the inclusion
of the World Trade Center flag in tonight's opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC's coordination commission was correct to reject a USOC
proposal to have U.S. athletes carry the flag into Rice-Eccles
Stadium behind the U.S. delegation as part of the parade of nations.</TE>
<TE>   Not only was that a violation of protocol, the proposal suggested
that Sept. 11 was solely an American tragedy. Reasonable people from
the IOC, USOC and SLOC met late Wednesday night and arrived at a
solution enabling the entire world to feel a part of the moment.</TE>
<TE>   They had to divert from tradition, creating a grand entrance for
the flag that will represent the host country during the national
anthem. But extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.</TE>
<TE>   Eight U.S. athletes and two policemen from the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey will serve as the honor guard carrying the
flag into the stadium before the parade of nations. The plan was for
it to be raised onto a flagpole to fly during the national anthem,
but it was determined Thursday that the flag was too frail.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 77 countries here, and 80 countries lost people in the
World Trade Center," said Sandra Baldwin, USOC president.</TE>
<TE>   Consistent with that sentiment, SLOC President Mitt Romney
proposed that athletes from other countries serve as part of the
honor guard, but the IOC said that an American flag should be carried
by American athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, U.S. skeleton athlete Jim Shea Jr., who will deliver the
athletes' oath, said Thursday, "That flag belongs to the entire
world."</TE>
<TE>   So does Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grimmette, an American luge slider chosen to help carry the
flag tonight, said that he and his teammates placed a sticker on
their sled for the first World Cup event after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   It said, "Remember the Innocent Victims of Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of athletes from other countries approached us at the
next event and asked if we had some spare stickers for their sleds,"
Grimmette said. "By the time we came here, almost every sled had a
sticker."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Bobsledder's Drug Suspension Extended to Two Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a scathing verdict issued late Thursday, the International Court
of Arbitration for Sport denied U.S. bobsledder Pavle Jovanovic's
appeal of a nine-month drug suspension and extended the ban to the
maximum two-year sanction permitted by international bobsled
federation rules.</LD>
<LD>   Jovanovic, a candidate for the brakeman spot in Todd Hays' two-man
sled, tested positive for the banned steroid 19-norandrosterone at a
concentration above the limit. The North American Court for
Arbitration of Sport, taking into account Jovanovic's claim he had
unknowingly ingested the substance in a dietary supplement, suspended
him for nine months.</LD>
<LD>   Jovanovic, of Toms River, N.J., acknowledged he had used 31 food
supplements in the year before the test but appealed to the
international body in hope the suspension would be lightened on the
grounds he didn't realize he was taking banned substances.</LD>
<TE>   However, the international body instead recommended a stiffer
penalty and declared "if an athlete ingests a food supplement, which
contains within it a forbidden substance, he or she 'uses' the
substance as well as the other ingredients of the supplement. No
question of intent or knowledge is involved.... It is the panel's
view that 'use' is satisfied if an athlete ingests a prohibited
substance whether or not he or she knows that he or she is doing so."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling by a three-judge panel said it was negligent of
Jovanovic not to have heeded warnings about the risks of taking
supplements.</TE>
<TE>   "It is more likely, however, that he chose to ignore them," it
said. "If by his evidence he meant to deny that he has seen and read
them, we do not accept it. If he decided to be his own advisor on
these matters it was foolish of him to do so.... We are unimpressed
by, and do not accept, the appellant's evidence as to the care he
took about the taking of supplements."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Mesler will replace Jovanovic on the bobsled team. The U.S.
Bobsled and Skeleton Federation had been permitted to submit 11 names
for the 10-person roster until Thursday's ruling was made.</TE>
<TE>   Another bobsledder who tested positive for a banned substance,
Sandis Prusis of Latvia, was permitted to compete in the Games
despite a positive test in November.</TE>
<TE>   The International Olympic Committee tried to ban him, but that
decision was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on the
grounds the IOC charter forbids overruling a decision made by an
international governing body.</TE>
<TE>   The World Anti-Doping Agency introduced an athlete passport system
designed to combat drug use. Prince Albert of Monaco, who will
compete in bobsled, signed his passport during a ceremony Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Signing up for the passport is voluntary but  Dick Pound, the
president of WADA, said he hopes peer pressure will persuade athletes
to sign up. A registration system for athletes also affords them a
chance to access lists of banned substances and the potential harm of
those substances.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time Olympic luge champion Georg Hackl of Germany had the
fastest time on the first training run at Utah Olympic Park, with
Armin Zoeggeler of Italy recording the fastest time on the second
run. Hackl was timed in 44.826 seconds, with Zoeggeler clocked at
44.809 seconds.</TE>

<LD>They don't hand out Olympic medals for downhill training, yet
Thursday's first run on the Grizzly course at Snowbasin may have been
a pretty good sneak preview as to how Sunday's race may end up.</LD>
<LD>   Austrians Stephan Eberharter and Fritz Strobl,  the world's top
downhill racers, finished first and second in the first run while
American Daron Rahlves nailed his run to finish third.</LD>
<LD>   "That would be a good final standing," Eberharter joked afterward.</LD>
<TE>   Rahlves, too, thought it was a pretty good top three.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," he said, "but not in that order."</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter led training with a time of 1 minute 39.07, followed by
teammate Strobl at 1:39.19. Rahlves was .70 off the pace at 1:39.77.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic handicappers tend not to put stock in training runs, but
this one may have been different because it revealed what most
believe: That Eberharter and Strobl are the racers to beat and that
Rahlves has a puncher's chance at a medal even though he ranks No. 19
in the World Cup downhill rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a blast to ski such a fun hill," Rahlves, the reigning world
champion in super-giant slalom, said. "It definitely fits the style I
have. Big turns, big air, all that stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The men's downhill course, designed by 1972 Olympic downhill
champion Bernhard Russi, is shorter than most of those raced on the
World Cup circuit. It is a challenging but technical course, which
figures to play to Rahlves' strengths.</TE>
<TE>   Downhill training runs are scheduled for today and Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing sadder in sports than cut-down day for Team
Austria.  Hans? Coach wants to see you. And bring your ski book.</TE>
<TE>   Austrian skiers occupy eight of the top 12 spots in the World Cup
downhill standings, yet Olympic rules allow only four skiers per
event, meaning several of the world's top downhill racers won't even
get a chance to ski.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter and Strobl have clinched two of the four spots, leaving
seven top-notch Austrians to battle for the remaining two Olympic
slots.</TE>
<TE>   Austrian spokesman Robert Brunner said the final two roster
positions will be named after Saturday's final training run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bode Miller, one of the medal favorites in slalom and giant
slalom, is taking a bit of a risk racing in Wednesday's combined
event.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is skiing combined, which literally combines the times of a
same-day downhill and slalom, because he has a chance to win a medal.</TE>
<TE>   Miller does not normally race downhill, but has been so dominant
in slalom this year he could make up the time difference on his
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   The risk is that Miller could get hurt and ruin his chances for
gold in slalom and GS.</TE>
<TE>   That is exactly what happened in last year's world championships
at St. Anton when Miller tore knee ligaments in the downhill portion
of the combined and could not race in slalom or GS.</TE>
<TE>   "That's an element of skiing there's no avoiding," Miller said of
the injury factor. "To try and hide from it would be ridiculous.
Coming in here, there's no reason to be afraid of that. I'm going to
come in and ski the downhill hard and ski the combined as fast as I
can."</TE>
<TE>   Miller wasn't so fast in Thursday's downhill training run. His
time of 1:42.28 was a light-years 3.21 seconds slower than
Eberharter's pace time.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter will not participate in the combined event.</TE>

<DH>Games Are Romney's Biggest Project, but Not His Last</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>When Mitt Romney took over the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics three
years ago, the outlook was grim. The Games were embroiled in a
bribery scandal. Cost overruns were in the hundreds of millions.
Sponsors were steering clear. And volunteer spirit in Salt Lake and
Utah was--to be kind--low. Some wondered quietly whether the Games
could be held at all.</LD>
<LD>   Romney moved swiftly, relying on the skills and hands-on tactics
that made him one of the nation's most successful venture
capitalists. He balanced the $1.3-billion budgets by slashing all
nonessentials--including a popular youth camp and his salary. He
telephoned sponsors and coaxed them back. He spoke at pancake
breakfasts and chicken dinners in a bid to revitalize Olympic spirit,
and attracted more than 68,000 volunteers--for 26,000 slots.</LD>
<LD>   "We owe him a great deal," said Francois Carrard, director general
for the International Olympic Committee.</LD>
<TE>   The biggest challenge facing Romney, 54, still lies ahead as the
Winter Games get underway tonight amid terrorism fears and
unprecedented security.</TE>
<TE>   But if all goes according to plan--lots of red, white and blue and
without incident--the man who enjoys close ties to President George
W. Bush and once threatened to unseat Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.)
stands poised to become the next big thing on the nation's political
scene.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be a guy who made some tough decisions, saved some
businesses and then came in and made some tough decisions and saved
the Olympic Games," said Washington political consultant Charles E.
Cross, sketching out a potential political campaign. "There's a theme
there--making tough decisions and pulling it through."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Romney is a strategist's dream candidate. His father
was a longtime governor of Michigan. He is smart, affable, and
telegenic. A devout member of the Church of Latter-Day Saints--his
ancestors were Mormon pioneers--he doesn't drink or smoke. Close
aides say they've never heard him swear. He married his high school
sweetheart, Ann. Together they raised five sons and are now
grandparents to two girls and two boys. And together they are
fighting Ann's bout with multiple sclerosis.</TE>
<TE>   But if Romney the Boy Scout seems too good to be true, longtime
friend Gordon Bowen, a veteran of the cutthroat advertising business,
says he isn't: "Mitt is the real deal."</TE>
<TE>   Critics, though, question the aura that seems to surround Romney,
allowing him to emerge unscathed, whether it's from a bruising senate
campaign, risky business ventures or the worst crisis in the history
of the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most persistent critic has been Ken Bullock, a member
of the Utah League of Cities &amp; Towns who also sits on the Olympic
organizing committee board. He says Romney has failed to make the
Games accessible to ordinary Utah citizens and has accused him of
allowing the Games to become overly commercialized.</TE>
<TE>   Romney, who said he learned long ago that his success would depend
largely on ignoring the naysayers, shrugs off such remarks: "We will
never avoid having critics. The pioneers used to say, 'Let the dogs
bark. The caravan moves on.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From the very beginning, big things were expected of Willard Mitt
Romney.</TE>
<TE>   The first name comes from close family friend J. Willard
Marriott--of the hotel Marriotts. The middle name came from his
father's cousin, Mitt, who played in the 1920s for the NFL's Chicago
Bears.</TE>
<TE>   Public service, politics, faith, personal responsibility and
discipline animated the Romney household. His father, George Romney,
served three terms as governor of Michigan and contended in 1968 for
the Republican presidential nomination. His mother, Lenore,
unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate from Michigan in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Romney met his wife, Ann, while he was a senior in high school in
Michigan. After graduation, he went off to Stanford, then to France
on his Mormon mission. The day he returned--he hadn't seen Ann for 2
1/2 years--he proposed and they soon married.</TE>
<TE>   Romney finished college at Brigham Young and they moved to the
Boston area, where he earned graduate degrees from Harvard in law and
business in 1975. George W. Bush was a business-school classmate. The
Romneys stayed in the Boston area, in suburban Belmont, and from 1978
to 1984, Mitt was a vice president at Bain &amp; Co., a management
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, he organized Bain Capital, an unaffiliated investment
company, and became its CEO. It has since acquired or started more
than 120 companies, including Staples, Domino's, Brookstone, Totes,
FTD Florists and the Sealy Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Romney, by then a millionaire, returned to Bain &amp; Co. to
engineer a turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   The company had accumulated significant debt, but costs were cut
and confidence rebuilt--the company's co-founders agreeing to forgive
some notes as well as put $25 million cash back into the company.
Bain now has offices worldwide and more than 2,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows how to think practically and communicate those thoughts,
which gets people to accomplish results," said Orit Gadiesh, chairman
of the board of Bain &amp; Co., and one of the 15 who vowed then to stand
by Romney.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Romney took a leave from Bain to run for U.S. Senate
against the Kennedy dynasty.</TE>
<TE>   "What Mitt sees is that Dad had a legacy," said older brother
Scott Romney, a Detroit attorney. "And Mitt has an opportunity to
leave a legacy, to make the world a better place."</TE>
<TE>   Romney cast himself as socially moderate but fiscally conservative
Republican: Frugal on government spending. Insisting welfare
recipients work for their checks. Willing to ban assault weapons.
Supporting a woman's right to choose abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Early polls indicated Romney might well win. But Kennedy fought
back, launching a series of ads well-remembered by political
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign depicted Romney as a job-cutting corporate fat cat.
One accused him of making $11 million while his largest company,
Staples, "provided no health insurance to many workers." Another
accused Ampad Corp., a Texas company in which Bain had invested, of
slashing benefits, firing employees and provoking a strike at an
Indiana paper plant.</TE>
<TE>   In one ad, a laid-off worker said of Romney: "Basically, he cut
our throats."</TE>
<TE>   Romney challenged the ads. Staples, he said, provided health
insurance to full-time workers; only part-time workers were not
covered. Ampad, he said, bought the plant after he took leave from
Bain to launch his Senate campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But Kennedy won big, 58%-41%, and Romney says now that the
campaign taught him a key lesson--define yourself, or someone else
will define you.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Romney was recruited to take over the Salt Lake City Games in
February 1999, just a few months into the scandal that erupted after
disclosures that bidders had showered IOC members or their relatives
with more than $1 million in cash, gifts and other inducements to win
the 2002 Games for Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   The timing couldn't have been worse: Just weeks before, Ann was
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.</TE>
<TE>   Together, the couple decided Romney should take the job, even
though the demands would mean long hours away from home, and endless
travel. But playing host to a successful Winter Olympics in Salt Lake
City was a calling, they believed.</TE>
<TE>   "When we came out here, the first little while, it was so
intense," Ann Romney said of her symptoms. "It was so bad. He was
doing the grocery shopping, the cooking. If anyone had known how much
he was still taking care of me while holding all those balls in the
air--that was amazing to me."</TE>
<TE>   She said she now seems to be symptom-free.</TE>
<TE>   "I am here," Mitt Romney said the day he was introduced as SLOC's
president and CEO, "because I believe the Olympics are one of the
most important symbols for peace on the world stage, because they
show us heroic moments and occasionally reveal to our children true
heroes."</TE>
<TE>   He went on to define the mission: The "highest level of ethical
conduct." No unpaid bills for taxpayers. "We'll get it right," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But those first few months, Romney says now, he wondered if he was
wrong. The financial situation was so poor he questioned "if the
Games could be held or whether we would be unable to proceed."</TE>
<TE>   There also were disputes involving environmentalists concerned
about where the venues and infrastructure would be built. And there
were some Salt Lake City residents who felt overwhelmed, even
oppressed, by the scope of preparations for the Games. Animal rights
activists remain furious over plans to hold a rodeo in conjunction
with the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11, which prompted a thorough reevaluation of the
security plan for the Games. In all, security costs total $310
million with the U.S. Secret Service handling planning.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel confident that every source or risk has been addressed,"
Romney said. "That doesn't mean there's a guarantee.'</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, with the Games opening today, there have been other
areas of concern, such as the controversy triggered earlier this week
when an IOC subcommittee rejected a proposal to have U.S. athletes
carry the tattered ground zero flag into tonight's ceremony, as
Romney wanted.</TE>
<TE>   His response was classic Romney, those who know him say: Identify
a problem, don't fear taking a stand, propose a solution, see if it
flies. If it doesn't, start the process all over again. First, he
released a statement backing an IOC decision that the flag could be
raised at the ceremony but not carried by U.S. athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later he reconsidered, releasing another statement saying he
"respectfully disagreed" with the decision. Then, late Tuesday, as
the flap was becoming front-page news, Romney arranged a meeting with
IOC President Jacques Rogge. A compromise was hammered out: The
tattered flag would be carried into the stadium, but not during the
protocol-laden parade of athletes, and then given a place of honor
near the flagpole as the "Star-Spangled Banner" is played.</TE>
<TE>   "It was apparent to us that we had not found an ideal way to honor
the flag and victims," Romney explained Wednesday, "and that we
needed to work to find a way."</TE>
<TE>   As the Games begin, he said he fully expects "snafus,"
particularly early on in transporting thousands in and out of the
mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "In some respects we will be judged not by whether we have
problems but whether we're able to correct them quickly enough that
they don't interfere with the athletes' experience or the experience
of the world that watches them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well, he said, the Games could be "healing for the
nation," perhaps "magical."</TE>
<TE>   If so, Romney will have followed his mantra to redefine himself.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of corporate rich guy, political experts say, he will be
in position to pitch himself to voters as an Olympic-caliber
turnaround expert with compassion and soul.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about her husband's future, Ann Romney said, "I truly want
Mitt to fulfill his destiny and for that to happen, he's got to do
politics."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The bonito weighs only a pound, but it has relied on timing to give
its foes a fight they will not soon forget.</LD>
<LD>   The captain has foolishly positioned the small boat in the traffic
lane at the entrance of the small harbor and has been nearly lulled
into a state of hypnosis by the continuous casting of the angler.</LD>
<LD>   He snaps to when he realizes there is a flotilla of large
sailboats bearing down fast, en route to the open sea, not giving the
skiff a thought.</LD>
<TE>   There is the pull of the cord and the sputtering of the motor, and
a plan to make haste toward the safety of the breakwater, when all of
a sudden there is the cry, "I got one!"</TE>
<TE>   Thus, a fight is being waged by both the angler, to get his fish
in; and the captain, to avoid being keel-hauled by the sailboats
while at the same time moving slowly enough to enable a successful
catch.</TE>
<TE>   It is, after all, the only bonito the unlucky angler has managed
to hook, after hours of casting.</TE>
<TE>   And alas, the spirited little speedster is hoisted out of its
blue-green world just as the sailboats glide past, one after the
other, their crews visibly pleased to see that their wakes are nearly
swamping the skiff and its two forlorn souls, who have no business
being where they are.</TE>
<TE>   As for the silvery little bonito, shining so brilliantly in the
sun, it is admired for a few seconds, carefully unhooked and tossed
overboard.</TE>
<TE>   Pointedly but somewhat sheepishly, the captain repositions the
boat in a safer location. The casting and the occasional catching
continue throughout the course of a crisp winter day in a quaint
harbor buzzing with life.</TE>
<TE>   King Harbor in Redondo Beach is one of the smallest harbors in
Southern California. But for decades its sprawling basin has served
as a mecca for fly-fishermen and light-tackle anglers because of the
bonito that come in such large numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Acker, 55, remembers back to the late 1950s and '60s, when
you could catch 100 a day if your arms held out. Though the fish were
caught more often for sport than for table fare, children would
gather them up by the dozens and sell them to pier-top restaurants
(illegally, of course) for 25 cents apiece.</TE>
<TE>   For a variety of reasons, bonito fishing began to considerably
wane, inside and beyond the harbor, in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But while the "boneheads" have not yet made much of an impact on
the party-boat scene, they have returned to King Harbor, and those
getting wind of their return have mounted a comeback as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how many people have told me that this is really
cool because they used to come and catch bonito here as a kid," says
Acker, who for the last six years has owned Rocky Point Marine Fuels
and Skiff Rental. "Now these same people are bringing their kids to
fish for bonito. It's a real tradition."</TE>
<TE>   The disappearance of the bonito, and their return, can in part be
attributed to the operation of the power plant across the street from
the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   When the plant was fully operational, it released a steady flow of
warm water from outflow pipes into the harbor, and the warm water
attracted bonito, mackerel and other small game fish.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 years ago the plant scaled down its operation, and it
eventually shut down, only to be resold and reopened during the
recent energy crisis. The warm water is being pumped in anew, and for
the past two years it has been attracting wave after wave of bonito.</TE>
<TE>   The first wave arrived in June 2000. They were the smallest bonito
anyone can remember, measuring about eight inches, but they came by
the thousands and could be seen chasing bait fish all over the
harbor.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't spin your head around and not see one of them coming
out of the water catching bait," Acker says. "You could almost walk
on them and then, after about three weeks, they took off."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, incoming schools have included fish ranging from one
to about five pounds (bonito reach weights of more than 10 pounds)
and fishing has remained fairly consistent, although some days are
much better than others.</TE>
<TE>   This is somewhat strange because open-ocean anglers aboard fishing
boats up and down the coast have not experienced a rebound in the
bonito fishery.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are unable to explain exactly why the tuna-shaped,
silver-and-black game fish have become so scarce. It could be
cyclical--they were similarly scarce from the late 1930s until the
late '50s. But subtle changes in global weather patterns and
overfishing also could be factors.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case, they've found an avenue back to King Harbor,
its balmy confines--often 10 degrees above what it is on the
outside--representing a piscatorial spa of sorts.</TE>
<TE>   Albeit, a spa fraught with predatory sea lions, marauding pelicans
and, yes, those pesky fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   It's a busy day above and below the rippling surface. Boat traffic
into and out of the marina is moderate, this being a sunny Sunday.
Pedestrian traffic on the breakwater is brisk, as fishermen are
seeking strategic locations from which to cast their wares.</TE>
<TE>   Patrolling the shallow depths of the basin are the ever-vigilant
resident sea lions, a dozen or so in all and all of them glutenous
tubs of lard, monitoring the goings-on, traveling from skiff to
skiff, kayak to kayak. Should anyone hook up, these behemoths clue in
quickly, and strike fast.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of the game," Acker says.</TE>
<TE>   This is why he recommends a seven- or eight-weight fly rod with a
10- or 12-pound tippet, instead of something lighter. Or, for spin
fishermen, six- to 10-pound test monofilament. The quicker the fish
can be reeled in, the smaller the risk of having it serve as a sea
lion snack.</TE>
<TE>   Aboard the 13-foot skiffs Acker rents--$45 for half a day and $65
for a full day--are anglers young and old, fishing with either live
anchovies or casting shiny lures or glittery flies.</TE>
<TE>   Many are trailing bait sleds full of anchovies, which are highly
effective as bait and "chum." And highly attractive to dozens of
pelicans that have stooped to stealing as a way of life.</TE>
<TE>   On one skiff not far from the bait receiver, two young girls are
doing their best to fend off a white-headed pelican that is
repeatedly poking its head into their bait sled, emerging with beaks
full of bait.</TE>
<TE>   Their father is paying too much attention to his casting to
realize that the big bird has probably gulped $10 worth of anchovies,
and that his girls will never grow up to be scarecrows.</TE>
<TE>   Not far away is a fly-fisherman aboard a kayak. Mike Shearman is a
King Harbor regular, coming twice a week from Costa Mesa. "I caught
25 bonito two days ago, losing only five to the sea lions," he
boasts, whipping his fly through the air. "You should have been here
then."</TE>
<TE>   But the captain and the angler were not here then. They are here
now, frustrated by how slowly things are going, ultimately acting on
the advice of another passerby suggesting a move to the mouth of the
harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Much to their chagrin, a flotilla of sailboats was about to make
the same move.</TE>

<DH>Tennis: Americans face depleted Slovakia squad in first
round of Davis Cup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OKLAHOMA CITY</DL>
<LD>Pete Sampras already finished off half the country formerly known as
Czechoslovakia, so why not complete the job?</LD>
<LD>   The most recent Sampras-related memory from the Davis Cup is of
him running around the court with an American flag at the Forum in
April 2000, having won the decisive singles match against the Czech
Republic, playing for a captain named McEnroe.</LD>
<LD>   There will be some similarities here the next three days. Sampras
will be playing for the United States, this time against Slovakia,
also for a captain named McEnroe. And most likely, a flag will find
its way to his hands after a singles victory despite tight security.</LD>
<TE>   The McEnroe in the courtside chair has changed. Patrick McEnroe
replaced his older brother John last year, and the move, in part,
brought Sampras back into the Davis Cup family. Sampras, 30, said in
an interview in October that he was ready to resume representing his
country, realizing he needed the motivational challenge at this stage
of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it is met against Karol Beck rather than Dominik Hrbaty is
another question. Any real intrigue about this first-round match
against Slovakia evaporated when Hrbaty, a French Open semifinalist
in 1999, withdrew because of a foot injury and the often-troublesome
Karol Kucera pulled out because of an injured back.</TE>
<TE>   So, it will be Sampras and youngster Andy Roddick against
Slovakia's C squad. Sampras plays Beck in today's opening match at
the Convention Center, followed by Roddick vs. Jan Kroslak. Roddick's
injured right ankle, from two spills at the Australian Open, has
responded well to time off.</TE>
<TE>   "To lose Kucera and Hrbaty is a pretty big blow to them," Sampras
said. "On the other hand, these guys are going to come out here with
nothing to lose. The pressure is on us. We are the heavy favorite and
we just need to go out there and play well and take care of business.
You can't look ahead to the next round or to Saturday or Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   In moving toward a younger team, McEnroe has scheduled Mardy Fish
to make his Davis Cup debut in Saturday's doubles, playing with James
Blake against Beck and Kroslak. McEnroe could have selected
31-year-old Todd Martin. "Mardy's got a lot of energy and he's an
excellent doubles player," McEnroe said. "He's playing better and
better, and at singles as well. One of the things I said when I
became captain was that I wanted to get as many of the young players
in the team as quickly as possible."</TE>
<TE>   The depleted Slovakian side afforded him the opportunity. Beck,
19, won a couple of rounds in a Dallas challenger event recently
before losing to Chris Woodruff in straight sets.</TE>
<TE>   His best result last year was reaching the final of a Russian
challenger. Kroslak, 27, played in 16 events last year and did not
win consecutive matches until his 15th tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not favored in any match," Slovakia Coach Miloslav Mecir
said. "But we can surprise in any match."</TE>
<TE>   He joked about Roddick's recent injuries and the age of Sampras,
saying: "So, we know Roddick has retired a couple of times in the
past. Sampras, you also never know, so you may have two retirements
in the first day or two."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Enron Chief Testifies He Saw No Warning Signs</HD>
<DH>Hearings: Jeffrey K. Skilling says firm was 'solvent and highly
profitable' when he quit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<AU>RICHARD T. COOPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling testified Thursday
that he heard no warnings and saw no hint of trouble last year as one of
the nation's largest corporations careened toward disaster.</LD>
<LD>   While describing himself as "devastated and apologetic about what
Enron has come to represent," Skilling insisted before a House panel that
the company was "solvent and highly profitable" when he resigned Aug. 14,
only 3 1/2 months before the energy trader's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Enron, he said, was destroyed by "a classic run on the bank," a
suggestion that the company was not ruined by its failure to disclose
off-the-books partnerships whose losses helped trigger the Chapter 11
bankruptcy filing Dec. 2.</LD>
<TE>   Skilling's assertion that he never knew about improprieties and never
approved certain partnership deals that involved conflicts of interest
was met with skepticism and sarcasm by the House panel.</TE>
<TE>   As for fellow executives who made personal fortunes in off-the-books
transactions that contributed to the company's demise, Skilling said he
and others recognized the potential for conflicts of interest but thought
that special safeguards instituted to prevent problems were working.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling testified before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
on oversight and investigations in an atmosphere rife with outrage. The
hearing began at 10 a.m. and dragged on into the late afternoon. Nine
Enron executives and directors, as well as two other witnesses, appeared
before the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Four senior Enron executives, including former Chief Financial Officer
Andrew S. Fastow, invoked the 5th Amendment to avoid answering questions
from the committee. Fastow played a lead role in engineering outside
partnerships that created undisclosed financial vulnerability for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Subcommittee members vied with one another in denouncing the former
executives amid whirring cameras and an audience of former Enron
employees who lost their retirement savings.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you, in the dark night of your own souls, think about some of
the people who . . . literally lost their entire life savings and whose
lives effectively in many ways are destroyed because of your actions,"
Rep. Peter Deutsch (D-Fla.) told four former Enron executives.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional outrage appeared to be intensified by a sense of
betrayal. Many members had received over the years Enron's generosity as
a campaign donor--and had approved changes in financial and accounting
rules that helped open the way for its freewheeling business practices.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron executives were variously described as "economic
terrorists," "business cowboys" and just plain "crooks."</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed for bankruptcy protection less than a month after it
restated its earnings to account for previously unreported losses of $586
million during the previous 4 1/2 years. In mid-October, it disclosed a
$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity, related in part to the
secretive partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Chief Risk Officer Richard B. Buy, Chief Accounting Officer
Richard A. Causey and Michael Kopper, former managing director of Enron
Global, who reportedly reaped a $10.5-million return on a $125,000
investment in an Enron partnership, also invoked their constitutional
right against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   In earlier skirmishes with the subcommittee, David B. Duncan, the
fired Andersen partner who headed the Enron account for the company's
auditor, also invoked the 5th Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the invocation of the 5th Amendment by some witnesses and
Skilling's insistence that he had no hint of the gathering storm,
documents unearthed by subcommittee investigators and the testimony of
less prominent witnesses brought more sharply into focus exactly what
went on inside Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "Favoritism and chaos" reigned in Enron's global finance division,
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) said, calling it a "sorry, stinking mess."</TE>
<TE>   Some employees received paychecks from Enron and bonuses from the
partnerships. Two people who were engaged to be married negotiated
against each other in a supposedly arm's-length transaction.</TE>
<TE>   When Enron negotiators were too tough, Dingell said, they sometimes
received personal calls from Fastow. And Kopper, according to
subcommittee Chairman James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), violated Enron's code
of conduct by investing in partnerships and doing business with Enron
without board approval.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony Thursday of Jordan Mintz, an Enron attorney, offered
perhaps the most penetrating glimpse into the executive suite. Mintz
started raising concerns about conflicts of interest at the company about
a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Mintz described repeated efforts to express to his bosses the concerns
he had about Enron employees representing both the company and the
outside partnerships in which they had financial interests. He said that
when he suggested to Buy, the chief risk officer, that perhaps he should
take his concerns to Skilling, Buy told him, "I wouldn't stick my neck
out."</TE>
<TE>   Skilling resigned before the company's rapid disintegration for what
he called personal reasons. He shed no new light on his resignation
Thursday but continued to insist he had no inkling of the company's
underlying financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't for the life of me understand how we would go from where I
thought the company was to bankruptcy," he declared.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not believe that the company was in any imminent financial
peril," Skilling said at one point. At another, he said: "While I was at
Enron, I was not aware of any financing arrangements designed to conceal
liabilities or inflate profitability."</TE>
<TE>   But lawmakers expressed deep reservations about Skilling's denials,
shaking their heads in disbelief or laughing aloud.</TE>
<TE>   At one key Enron board meeting in 2000, directors discussed the
potential conflicts of having Fastow run the partnerships and were told
that Skilling would personally approve the deals, according to minutes of
the meeting. But Skilling insisted before the subcommittee that he did
not remember agreeing to approve such deals.</TE>
<TE>   When lawmakers held up the corporate minutes that recorded Skilling's
presence, he said the meeting occurred in a darkened room because of a
power outage and he might have stepped out briefly without being missed.</TE>
<TE>   After subpoenaing thousands of documents from Enron, the subcommittee
members were well-armed with records to dispute Skilling's claims of
ignorance. They quizzed him about one set of board minutes in which the
partnerships were described as vehicles for reducing volatility in Enron
profits, rather than as hedges against economic risk, which was the
purported reason for their existence.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers pressed Skilling about a March 2000 meeting with
then-Treasurer Jeffrey McMahon, who complained that the conflicts of
interest involving the Fastow partnerships had become "untenable."</TE>
<TE>   The partnerships were originally created to purchase assets from the
energy giant and enable it to improve its balance sheet. But they mutated
into Fastow-controlled entities that masked debt and inflated earnings.
Fastow, Kopper and others pocketed millions of dollars in profits and
management fees.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon, recently named the company's president and chief operating
officer, testified that he complained to Skilling in March 2000 that
Fastow, his boss, was pressuring Enron employees to make deals that
benefited the partnerships and hurt Enron shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked him either to remedy the situation or move me within the
company," McMahon said. Three days later, McMahon was moved to become
chief executive of another Enron unit.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling insisted that the transfer was unrelated to McMahon's
concerns, which he said chiefly dealt with the issue that Fastow would
reduce McMahon's bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling said he encouraged McMahon to "take a baseball bat" to the
negotiations with Fastow over partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Some testimony suggested that Skilling was kept in the dark about some
details. In particular, Fastow told Mintz to keep his compensation from
the partnerships a secret, Mintz testified.</TE>
<TE>   "He said if Jeff [Skilling] knew how much he'd made . . . he'd have to
shut down LJM," Mintz said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers also directed criticism at the two Enron board members who
testified, Robert Jaedicke and Herbert S. Winokur, for failing to uncover
the problems and protect shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe that a board of directors that is paid $300,000 [a
year per director] . . . did not know what was happening," Rep. Gene
Green (D-Texas) said.</TE>

<HD>Long Terms Voided in 2 Petty Thefts</HD>
<DH>Justice: Court did not reject three-strikes law, but ruling in two
cases will affect many others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court Thursday struck down two lengthy sentences
imposed under California's three-strikes law, saying that a
25-year-to-life term for petty theft constituted cruel and unusual
punishment.</LD>
<LD>   In a 3-0 ruling, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said explicitly
that it was not overturning California's three-strikes law against repeat
offenders, the toughest and most frequently used statute of its kind in
the nation.</LD>
<LD>   However, the decision states that a sentence has to be proportionate
to the last crime an individual committed. That principle could undermine
the statute because a long sentence would not be permitted solely because
the defendant had two prior convictions.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling almost certainly will affect 340 individuals now serving
25-year-to-life terms for petty theft under the state's three-strikes
law. And it could also affect a number of the other 6,400 people in
California who have received 25-year-to-life terms under the recidivist
statute, which was enacted in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The two men who prevailed Thursday are Earnest Bray Jr., who was
convicted in 1994 of shoplifting three videotapes from a Wherehouse store
in San Joaquin County, and Richard Napoleon Brown, who was convicted in
Long Beach in 1995 of stealing a $25 steering wheel car alarm from a
Walgreens store. Bray and Brown both had convictions for prior violent
offenses.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Marsha S. Berzon of the 9th Circuit wrote in Thursday's decision
that Bray and Brown's sentences were "grossly disproportionate" to the
crime and therefore violated the 8th Amendment, which prohibits "cruel
and unusual punishment."</TE>
<TE>   The lengthy terms "were contrary to and unreasonable applications of
clearly established Supreme Court law" on sentencing, Berzon added.</TE>
<TE>   The court ordered that the two defendants, whose cases were
consolidated for appeal, must be resentenced within 60 days or released.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was the second in three months in which the appeals court
has overturned a three-strikes sentence. In the earlier decision, the 9th
Circuit ruled 2 to 1 that a 50-year-to-life sentence imposed on Leandro
Andrade for stealing videos from two Kmarts in San Bernardino County was
grossly disproportionate to the offense.</TE>
<TE>   The new ruling, which is written in somewhat broader language, appears
to enhance the prospects that hundreds of inmates serving long terms
under the three-strikes law will be able to successfully challenge their
sentences.</TE>
<TE>   "Thursday's decision stands for the proposition that the punishment
has to fit the crime for which the person is sentenced," said USC law
professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who represented the defendants at the 9th
Circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "This means that the 340 people serving 25-to-life for petty theft
clearly have a basis for relief. Then the question would be what other
crimes are so trivial to be treated like petty theft" on a three-strikes
challenge, Chemerinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that since the Andrade decision was rendered, many lawyers
around the state have been citing it during trials and in state court
appeals of three-strike sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Late last month, the California attorney general's office asked the
U.S. Supreme Court to review the November ruling, because of its
"overarching importance" to state sentencing laws.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a spokeswoman for California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said
the office is studying the latest decision but has not decided what its
response will be.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope the U.S. Supreme Court will consider the Andrade decision
quickly," spokeswoman Hallye Jordan said. The attorney general's office
could amend its petition to the Supreme Court, in light of the new
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, California law treats petty theft offenses as misdemeanors,
punishable by up to six months in county jail and up to a $1,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Because Bray and Brown had been convicted of several prior offenses,
their thefts were enhanced to felonies under the state penal code. They
were then enhanced again under the three-strikes law, which mandates that
an offender convicted of two serious or violent felonies faces a 25
year-to-life sentence if convicted of a third felony of any kind.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie A. Mayoshi, an assistant attorney general, argued to the 9th
Circuit that the Bray and Brown cases could be distinguished from the
Andrade ruling because the minimum terms were only half as long.</TE>
<TE>   But Berzon, joined by judges Stephen Reinhardt and A. Wallace Tashima,
rejected that argument.</TE>
<TE>   Berzon noted that Andrade had been convicted of two separate thefts
from two Kmarts and got 25 years to life for each one, adding up to 50
years to life. In contrast, both Bray and Brown had been convicted of one
theft each. Consequently, the sentences were functionally equivalent and
thus the cases were indistinguishable, Berzon wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "If Andrade's 50-year-to-life sentence for two petty theft convictions
was grossly disproportionate, it follows that a 25-year-to-life sentence
is grossly disproportionate to one petty theft conviction," the judge
emphasized.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Berzon suggested that the Bray and Brown cases might be even
more inequitable because they ultimately could wind up serving life
sentences for one petty theft conviction, whereas if Andrade wound up
serving life it would be for two petty theft convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's decision is also noteworthy because both defendants had
been convicted of prior crimes of violence and appeared less sympathetic
than Andrade, who had no violent priors. That makes it likely that this
ruling will affect more inmates, Chemerinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Bray was convicted in 1980 on three separate counts of robbery,
according to the 9th Circuit decision. The first two convictions stemmed
from a 1979 incident in which Bray and a co-defendant stole a purse and a
briefcase from the driver of a car.</TE>
<TE>   "When the victim grabbed Bray, his co-defendant, who was brandishing a
gun, pointed it at the driver's head and threatened to kill her if she
did not release Bray. The victim complied," Berzon noted. Bray's third
conviction stemmed from a separate incident in which he and several
co-defendants stole a watch from a man who was hit in the face and kicked
by one of the co-defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has a total of five serious or violent prior felony convictions,
including two counts of second-degree burglary, two counts of assault
with a deadly weapon and a robbery, Berzon wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Both Bray and Brown appealed their sentences to a state appeals court
and their pleas were rejected in unpublished opinions. The California
Supreme Court declined to review either case. Then, the two inmates filed
writs of habeas corpus, challenging the constitutionality of their
sentences. Federal district court judges rejected their claims and the
inmates appealed to the 9th Circuit, setting the stage for Thursday's
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The three-strikes law was approved by California voters in 1994 amid a
huge furor over the kidnapping and murder of Polly Klaas, a 12-year-old
Petaluma girl. Eventually, Richard Allen Davis, who was on parole at the
time of the slaying, was convicted of Klaas' murder and received a death
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Although a number of prosecutors have said that the statute has been a
useful deterrent, numerous critics have said it has been used unjustly to
hand down severe sentences to individuals who have committed minor
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones, who authored the three-strikes law when
he was in the Legislature, defended the law and criticized the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "The court's decision today threatens to put more repeat murderers,
robbers, rapists and child molesters back in our neighborhoods," said
Jones, who is running for governor in the Republican primary.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's spokeswoman said Thursday that he "supports the current
three-strikes law," particularly in light of a 1996 California Supreme
Court decision which granted trial judges the power to overlook prior
convictions in a potential three-strikes case. Judges also have the
option of rejecting earlier offenses prosecutors seek to use as first and
second strikes.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday's decision represents "the other shoe dropping" on the
three-strikes law, said Franklin E. Zimring, a professor at UC Berkeley's
Boalt Hall School of Law.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an indication," Zimring said, "that the Andrade decision was
not an outlier, a single case."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Will Apply Geneva Rules to Taliban Fighters</HD>
<DH>Law: Bush's declaration still allows interrogation of detainees and
excludes Al Qaeda members. Decision follows weeks of criticism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush declared Thursday that the United States will apply
the rules of the Geneva Conventions to Taliban soldiers captured during
the war in Afghanistan but not afford the same recognition to members of
the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   The White House also said it will treat each group humanely but not
classify either as prisoners of war, a move that could permit U.S.
officials to interrogate the captives indefinitely and not have to
automatically repatriate them after the war has ended.</LD>
<LD>   The president reached his decision after weeks of criticism about how
the detainees were being handled and whether the U.S. was trying to
coerce them into betraying their homelands and make them stand trial in
U.S. military tribunals.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement also appears to settle a rift in the administration
over concerns raised by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that the
detainees fall under the protections of the Geneva Conventions, just as
any American soldier would expect if he was captured abroad.</TE>
<TE>   But the administration argues that the war on terrorism is
unprecedented and does not fit neatly into the parameters of the Geneva
Conventions. As such, the government says, the detainees don't meet the
conventions' definition of a POW.</TE>
<TE>   The decision drew quick fire from many human rights groups that said
it appeared the Bush White House was trying to have it both ways by
applying some rules of the Geneva Conventions and ignoring others.</TE>
<TE>   "Believing in the Geneva Convention principles and actually complying
with them are two different things," said Elisa Massimino, Washington
director of the Lawyers Committee on Human Rights. "There is no
in-between."</TE>
<TE>   Alistair Hodgett, a spokesman at Amnesty International, called it a
"willful misinterpretation" of the Geneva Conventions and said that there
should be no "arrogant policy of pick-and-choose with regard to the laws
of war."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement was made at the White House by spokesman Ari
Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the administration had determined that soldiers for the
Taliban were fighting for the government then in power in Afghanistan.
The administration noted that Afghanistan was a country that in 1949
joined the U.S. and other nations in backing the Geneva Convention for
the humane treatment of war captives and that therefore the Gevena
Convention should apply to the Taliban captives.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the Bush administration said, the Al Qaeda fighters are
viewed as rogue terrorists who are not a party to the Geneva agreement
and the rules of the conventions should not apply to them.</TE>
<TE>   Putting the Taliban fighters under the protection of the Geneva
Conventions appeared to be a show of good faith by the administration and
a signal that it would expect the same designation of any captured
American soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Fleischer said, both the Taliban and Al Qaeda captives
will be treated humanely, as prescribed by the conventions, but neither
group will be considered prisoners of war. If they were deemed POWs, then
the U.S. would not be allowed to question them beyond the basics of their
name, rank and serial number.</TE>
<TE>   Attempting to explain the apparent inconsistencies in the president's
decision, several administration officials stressed that the war on
terrorism is not like wars of the past.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said new ground is being broken
every day in how this war is prosecuted and that Thursday's decision over
detainees "could conceivably be considered a precedent for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said that in the current conflict, the old blanket
provisions from past wars do not always translate.</TE>
<TE>   "In this war," said Fleischer, "global terrorists transcend national
boundaries and internationally target the innocent."</TE>
<TE>   He added that the 50-year-old Geneva Conventions do "not cover every
situation in which people may be captured or detained by military forces,
as we see in Afghanistan today."</TE>
<TE>Decision Codifies Current Treatment</TE>
<TE>   In part, the decision codifies the way the U.S. already has been
treating the detainees. Until now, U.S. officials had no formal policy
except to assert that all of the captives were treated humanely but that
they were considered unlawful combatants, not prisoners of war, and were
therefore subject to interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Interrogations are vitally important to U.S. military and law
enforcement officials as they scramble to determine not only which
detainees are responsible for war crimes but also, more significantly,
whether any of the captives can warn them of future terrorist strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene R. Fidell, president of the National Institute of Military
Justice, said that the key element of the administration's announcement
is that interrogations can continue.</TE>
<TE>   While forced confessions are not allowed, Fidell said there are other
ways of getting information from captives, especially when they are held
for long periods of time.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot torture, coerce or starve them," Fidell said. "But you can
offer some incentives. You can tell them they can have two slices of
layer cake if they talk. You can tell them they can take two showers a
week."</TE>
<TE>   Fidell and other experts did not think any legal challenges to the
Bush decision would prevail but that the U.S. would be smart to allow the
International Committee of the Red Cross to make periodic inspections of
the detainees. The Red Cross has visited the prison and will continue to
do so, the administration said.</TE>
<TE>158 Detainees at Guantanamo</TE>
<TE>   Mark Tushnet, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center,
said he thought the decision would hold up legally. A detainee convicted
in a military tribunal could later appeal the verdict on the ground that
he should have been treated as a prisoner of war instead of an unlawful
combatant, but Tushnet said a successful appeal is very unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "In the real world," he said, "that is not going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   There are 158 detainees at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, who are being screened and interrogated, and they are being housed
in temporary, single outdoor cells at what is called Camp X-Ray. Each is
being questioned individually, and any decisions to prosecute them or
send them home will be made on a case-by-case basis.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, another group of about 30 captives was flown in from
Afghanistan on military aircraft, the first new contingent of arrested
individuals to arrive there in several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "There are going to be no changes in the way they are being treated at
Camp X-Ray," said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Ed Buclatin. "But as far as sorting them
out, as far as Taliban or Al Qaeda, we don't know how that's going to be
done yet."</TE>
<TE>   A White House "fact sheet" released Thursday said that all the
detainees are getting certain amenities guaranteed to POWs, including
three meals a day that meet Muslim dietary laws, clothing and shoes,
showers, foam sleeping pads and blankets, medical care and mail
privileges.</TE>
<TE>   However the detainees will not receive certain other privileges
afforded to POWs. For instance, they will not receive a stipend, have
access to a canteen to buy tobacco or extra food and soap, be allowed to
hold personal financial accounts or receive "scientific equipment,
musical instruments or sports outfits."</TE>

<HD>Haunted by Memories of Munich '72</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Organizers, Israelis wrangle over honoring slain
athletes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Allowing U.S. athletes to carry a highly symbolic American flag
during tonight's opening ceremony may go far to honor the heroes and
victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but it also stirs ghosts that
linger from the Olympics' worst tragedy: the 1972 Munich massacres.</LD>
<LD>   Previous attempts to memorialize the 11 Israeli athletes and officials
murdered at the '72 Summer Games have fallen short in the eyes of
prominent Jews and families of the slain. They want the International
Olympic Committee to make a formal gesture--such as a moment of
silence--dedicated to the victims. But the IOC has resisted, partly
because of concern about protests from Arab delegates.</LD>
<LD>   The plan to honor those who died in last year's terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center is highly appropriate, activists say, because
victims represented nations around the globe. But as the IOC did an
about-face this week to allow an official gesture, they could not help
but wonder: What about us?</LD>
<TE>   "In every subsequent Olympics, we asked for just a moment of silence,"
said Dr. Benjamin Berger of Shaker Heights, Ohio, whose son David was
among the athletes killed. "Not a great display, just a moment of
silence, to acknowledge the thing that occurred. That's all."</TE>
<TE>   IOC Director General Francois Carrard declined to comment. It has been
the contention of IOC leaders that they have repeatedly honored those
killed. They point to a memorial service the day after the Sept. 5, 1972,
attack and, more recently, comments during the closing ceremony of the
1996 Atlanta Summer Games as well as remarks by IOC President Jacques
Rogge's this week during an all-delegates session in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no reservations about doing more in the future," Rogge later
said. "I just want to say that we have honored the memory of these
athletes."</TE>
<TE>   Both publicly and privately, according to confidential minutes of the
IOC's policymaking Executive Board, the committee has struggled to
recognize this stark chapter in Olympic history.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC's oft-stated goal is to keep the Games focused on athletic
endeavors and on fostering goodwill between athletes. That desire played
a role earlier this week when a subcommittee, citing protocol, rejected a
proposal to have U.S. athletes carry a tattered flag recovered from the
World Trade Center site in tonight's parade of nations.</TE>
<TE>   But the IOC was unprepared for the controversy unleashed with its
decision and quickly compromised. Tonight, the flag will be carried into
Rice-Eccles Stadium before the parade and held during the playing of "The
Star-Spangled Banner."</TE>
<TE>   Efraim Zinger, director general of Israel's National Olympic
Committee, said that, despite the nearly 30 years separating the Munich
murders and the Sept. 11 attacks, there is much in common.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a chain in this series of never-ending terrorist events that
started in 1972," Zinger said. "Our feeling is the Olympic movement
should acknowledge its family members."</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles,
said the IOC has an obligation to honor the Munich dead because it
occurred at the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "When something occurs on your turf, when something violates the
Olympic spirit, something that was one of the most atrocious examples of
terrorism until 9/11, then it becomes the responsibility of the IOC to do
something," he said. "The IOC has an unpaid bill that they should pay . .
. and that is memorializing something that is part of the history of the
Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   But Toni Khoury of Lebanon, an IOC executive board member, said a
moment of silence to honor the slain Israelis at the ceremony would be an
unwelcome political intrusion.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, like all human beings I was--I am--sick about the deaths
of all the [Israeli] athletes. In my opinion, with all due respect . . .
for the opening ceremony, and the Olympic Games, it is best not to
interfere politically."</TE>
<TE>   Observers say the IOC is struggling to recognize the complexities of
the tragedy. Killed were Moshe Weinberg, Yoseph Romano, David Berger,
Eliezer Halfin, Yaacov Shpringer, Zeev Freedman, Yoseph Gutfreund, Kehat
Shor, Mark Slavin, Andre Spitzer and Amizur Shapira, in addition to five
Palestinians and one German policeman.</TE>
<TE>   Should the Israelis be memorialized to the exclusion of the others?
There are also internal Olympic politics to navigate. While Israel has
one IOC delegate, there are several from Arab states.</TE>
<TE>   The day of the murders was marked by confusion and misinformation.
Just before dawn on Sept. 5, 1972, eight Palestinians broke into the
Israeli living quarters in the Olympic Village. Shots were fired and two
Israelis were killed. The rest were taken hostage.</TE>
<TE>   At first, IOC President Avery Brundage, an American, said the Games
must go on. Then there was an about-face and the rest of the day's events
were canceled.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC executive board planned a memorial service for the dead--at
that point, two Israelis--for the next morning. And a little later, IOC
members were told that the rest of the hostages had been saved and the
terrorists had been killed or captured.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until the next morning that they learned all were dead.</TE>
<TE>   The confidential minutes show the IOC debated the following dilemma:
To halt the Games, it was felt by some, would be giving in to terrorists.
To continue, as others pointed out, smacked of arrogance and
insensitivity to the dead.</TE>
<TE>   At the memorial service held the morning of Sept. 6, the world's flags
hung at half-staff, except for those of 10 Arab nations, which had
insisted the night before that their flags be raised high.</TE>
<TE>   During the service, Brundage memorably declared, "The Games must go
on," although many disagreed and felt that comment insensitive.</TE>
<TE>   The 11 dead are now recalled in monuments and plaques at various sites
around the world. None has been dedicated at the IOC's instigation.
Israel's Olympic committee donated to the Olympic Museum in Lausanne,
Switzerland, a miniature replica of a statue in Tel Aviv that was
dedicated to the 11 who died.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1976 Montreal Games, however, relatives of the slain
Israelis and others have been lobbying the IOC to formally honor the
dead. The IOC has grappled with how to handle any references to Munich.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, when an Oscar-winning documentary about the killings,
"One Day in September," was to have its premiere in Lausanne, the IOC's
headquarters, there were questions about whether the premiere should be
held at the Olympic Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Then-President Juan Antonio Samaranch told the IOC to be "very
careful" about "becoming associated with a film that might be offensive
to some countries and was against doing so if it might lead to political
problems," according to the minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Before the 2000 Sydney Games, Samaranch told the executive board that
he was being asked by the Israeli National Olympic Committee to find a
way during the Games to commemorate the dead.</TE>
<TE>   During a series of meetings held that year, opposition was raised.</TE>
<TE>   An IOC staffer said the committee had received "threatening letters on
this question from six or seven different Arab national Olympic
committees," according to the minutes. The vice president of the
Palestinian National Olympic Committee, Rabie Al Turk, said: "If [the
Israelis] are going to have a plaque in a prominent place, then I want a
plaque. If they ask for a minute of silence, I ask for one."</TE>
<TE>   He also said that if the Israelis wanted to recall their victims,
Palestinians would show victims of young Arabs killed by Israelis. "I
have lots of victims."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to Al Turk's remarks, Rogge told the board in July that
while the Munich murders were "tragic," if the IOC "were to do anything,
it would cause a great uproar." He said he would hold "quiet talks" with
the Israelis to 'try to explain the difficult situation faced by the
IOC," according to the minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The issue arose again Sept. 14, 2000, the day before the Sydney Games
opened. Samaranch said he "had nothing against mentioning the killings
again but believed that if he were to do so, it would provoke outrage
amongst the Arab countries."</TE>
<TE>   Samaranch added, "The occurrence had happened in 1972; it was now
2000." Perhaps he could "make a general comment without specifically
referring to Munich."</TE>
<TE>   Rogge "totally agreed." The minutes note his explanation: "With all
due respect to the fallen athletes, he believed that the IOC had to avoid
any potential problems."</TE>
<TE>   Others though, feel an obligation to memorialize the Israelis slain in
Munich. "I see it as my duty to try and convince the IOC to find a way to
commemorate the Munich tragedy," Israel's IOC member, Alex Gilady, said
in a recent interview. "I do understand, however, the complexity of the
situation. And as I took an oath to accept the decisions of the IOC, I do
so hoping that one day I will manage to convince them."'</TE>
<TE>   For Berger and others, the IOC efforts to honor the deaths have not
gone far enough. The Sept. 6, 1972, memorial was scheduled when only two
of the 11 had been killed, and it served as the bridge to the resumption
of the Games. The 1996 speech also included a reference to the woman
killed when a bomb when off in Atlanta's Centennial Park, and the
comments made by Rogge earlier this week were to IOC members and invited
guests only.</TE>
<TE>   Berger said it is not asking too much to have a moment set aside in
time to recall only the murders.</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason things are different this year as opposed to last
year is that the terrorism that has occurred is our terrorism, on
American soil, against American citizens. All of a sudden, the whole
country becomes aware there are terrorists out there. I've been dealing
with this for 30 years."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>To the nieces and nephews he was helping support in Mexico,
Gilberto Rejon is a hero. In the eyes of the U.S. government, he is a
security threat.</LD>
<LD>   Rejon sneaked across the border four years ago and settled in Salt
Lake City, where he was earning $7.25 an hour loading cargo onto
airplanes. That is, until December, when he and 68 other undocumented
workers at Salt Lake City International Airport were arrested on federal
felony charges--a prelude to the blanket of security that has covered
this city in advance of the Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Latino leaders are furious over the indictments, which far exceeded
penalties imposed on most other airport workers in crackdowns across the
country since Sept. 11. Rejon spent 18 days, including Christmas, in
jail. Although it was never alleged that he had any terrorist
involvement, Rejon now is considered a criminal and is prohibited from
working in the U.S. While he awaits deportation, he tries to think how he
will support his wife and two daughters.</LD>
<TE>   "I came here with my family looking for . . . the so-called American
dream." Rejon said. "I don't own any guns. I don't drink. I don't do
drugs. I'm a law-abiding citizen here. I pay taxes, regardless of the
fact that I'm an illegal immigrant.</TE>
<TE>   "But they handcuffed me in front of my kids. Basically, my dream
vanished and my nightmare began."</TE>
<TE>   Latino populations are booming all over the American South and West,
but in few places has there been such a cultural fault line as in Utah,
where Latinos--90% of whom are Catholic--have stampeded into the world
headquarters of the Mormon church.</TE>
<TE>   And Rejon and the other airport workers have become a potential
political embarrassment as Salt Lake City welcomes tens of thousands of
visitors--nearly all of whom are staying in hotels and eating in
restaurants tended by the Latino immigrants whose numbers have exploded
in this overwhelmingly white state over the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   The Latino population in Utah was inconsequential only a decade ago,
but the boom that hit Utah's Wasatch Front in the last half of the 1990s
drew flocks of workers from Mexico and other Latin American
countries--some of them Mormon converts from church missions abroad. The
most recent census showed a 138% increase over the last 10 years, to more
than 200,000 people. At current growth rates, Latinos will make up 20% of
Utah's population by 2010 and 40% of Salt Lake City's. In such places as
Park City's Summit County, home to the major Olympic skiing venues, there
was an astounding 638% increase in Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "Utah now is undergoing what California underwent 20 years ago. We are
for the first time experiencing a non-Mormon migration," said Mike
Martinez, a Latino commentator and chairman of the Utah advisory
committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.</TE>
<TE>   The town of Ogden, which is looking at a potential 50% Latino
population in the next several years, is now about 75% Mormon, said the
Rev. Bob Bussen of St. Mary's Catholic Church in Park City. "Logan is
85%. Provo is 85% or 90%. And you start heading south from there, and it
goes up."</TE>
<TE>   "You have a very, very Mormon community that is interfacing with the
Latino community. This is hard stuff we're dealing with here," Bussen
said. "The Mormon church has always seen the immigrant population as
potential converts, and their whole thrust is to convert them. They've
kind of reached an impasse where the Mexican community doesn't want to
convert, the Mormon community doesn't really want them there, and they
don't know how to deal with each other.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that there's fighting or conflicts. It's just that there's
no real interface."</TE>
<TE>   Conservative Utah legislators have moved to accommodate the growing
non-English-speaking population, adopting one of the nation's first laws
that allows undocumented residents to obtain driver's licenses without
Social Security cards and debating measures that would allow children of
undocumented parents enrolled in college to pay resident tuition rates
and apply for legal residence.</TE>
<TE>   In the glare of Olympic publicity, Salt Lake City also signaled its
commitment to raising the profile of Latino issues by designating the
mayor's minority advocate, Robert Archuleta, as "mayor for a day" on
Monday at Olympic Village. (The city's school superintendent, Darline
Robles, former superintendent of the Montebello, Calif., school district,
also is Latino.)</TE>
<TE>   Yet only 2% of Utah's teachers are certified to teach
non-English-speaking students, although the number should increase
substantially in the next few years with efforts now underway. Latino
leaders complain of substantial under-funding for alternative language
programs in schools, which have been scrambling to maintain basic
programs for English-speaking students.</TE>
<TE>   There is only one Latino in the state Legislature, and of more than
100 state trial judges, only a handful are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   And in what some say was a reflection of Utah's attitude toward the
migration, 77% of voters in 2000 approved an English-only ballot
initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me say this," said Ken Thompson of South Ogden, head of an
anti-illegal immigration group, "this may be stereotyping, but, if you go
to an illegal Mexican working at the airport, and he has access to
airplanes, or he's manning a baggage check or whatever, and an Arab
terrorist walks up to him and says, 'I'll give you $10,000 if you plant a
9-millimeter on the airplane for me,' well, here's an individual who's
never stood up, held his hand over his heart and said, 'I pledge
allegiance to the flag and to the country for which it stands.' You think
that Mexican is going to head south with the 10 grand? You betcha."</TE>
<TE>   Just such a scenario is possible, said Paul Warner, the U.S. attorney
in Utah, who has weathered a storm of criticism for the airport
arrests--including statements of condemnation from Salt Lake City Mayor
Rocky Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "I make no apologies for it, then or now," Warner said. "We're not
going to allow anyone, as long as I'm U.S. attorney, to have access to
planes when they've lied about their INS status, they've lied on their
FBI application form, they've lied on their Social Security status.</TE>
<TE>   "This had nothing to do with targeting Latinos. It's about protecting
my airport. News flash: I've got the Olympics coming. I have got to have
an airport that's reasonably safe for hundreds of thousands of
international visitors coming. What would have happened if we hadn't done
this and then something happens?"</TE>
<TE>   Most of those indicted in the airport roundup face penalties of up to
40 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines, although sentences for
those who have pleaded guilty to a federal charge of making false
statements on their badge applications have been reduced in most cases to
a few weeks in prison and fines of about $100. The real penalty has been
the felony convictions (most immigration cases usually end in simple
deportation proceedings), which could mean an end to employment prospects
and a permanent bar to legal immigration to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Latino advocates say that's too harsh a penalty for people who have
come to take low-paying jobs in the belief that their hard work was
wanted. They have wondered publicly why employees, who had to sell their
cars, furniture and refrigerators to post bond, were arrested and the
employers who hired them were not.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, they've been told by the judge they cannot work and
they cannot leave. What are they supposed to do?" asked Frank Cordova of
the National Council of La Raza, a Latino advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests quickly became a human drama. Livia Reyes and her husband
were both arrested, leaving their 3-month-old baby with no one but a
neighbor to look after him. Some breast-feeding mothers and pregnant
women were among the arrestees. Warner moved to dismiss 14 such cases on
humanitarian grounds.</TE>
<TE>   But for others, there appears no hope of reprieve. "I look at my
cases. Did my client work with false documents? Yes. It's a very
difficult case to defend," said Mark Alvarez, a lawyer representing
several of the airport workers. "All I can do is make a moral argument
that the problem lies not with our people but with our system, the
hypocrisy of allowing people to work here when economic times are good
and then treating them harshly when economic times are not so good. A
wink and a nod becomes a smack and a kick."</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 ended political discussions of
amnesty for illegal Mexican workers in the U.S. But the subsequent
economic downturn had a more insidious effect, Alvarez and others
believe. "Some people who may have been willing to consider the
possibility of granting some kind of documentation are now no longer
willing to," Alvarez said, "because those workers are now seen as
competition."</TE>
<TE>   What, Latino leaders ask, is to become of the children of the arrested
airport workers, many of whom were born in the U.S. and are American
citizens?</TE>
<TE>   E. Ortiz, an airport window installer who faces criminal charges, says
his year-old son needs surgery and his wife plans to remain in Utah if he
is deported. His 5-year-old daughter stopped eating and her nose began
bleeding uncontrollably when she saw Ortiz's arrest on television, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The church has not spoken out on the airport indictments, but senior
leaders in recent years have issued strong calls for tolerance and
compassion in response to the changing face of the Mormon homeland.
Martinez believes this is, in part, a recognition of the substantial
growth of Mormonism in non-English-speaking countries.</TE>
<TE>   "The church understands in a way their members don't that more Mormons
speak Spanish now than speak English," Martinez said.</TE>

<HD>Crypts That Keep On Giving</HD>
<DH>* Beneath the new L.A. cathedral, a massive mausoleum will hold
thousands of remains, and generate an endowment to pay for operating
expenses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a starting price of $2,000 per square foot, it will be by far
the city's costliest address. And its most exclusive--residency is
strictly by invitation and based on one's personal goodness and
contribution to the community. On the downside, space is available in one
standard lot: 8 feet by 3 feet with a 2 1/2-foot ceiling. On the upside,
utilities are included and ownership is guaranteed for eternity.</LD>
<LD>   Beneath the Spanish marble floor of the almost-finished Cathedral of
Our Lady of the Angels is a mausoleum that promises to be the most
prestigious Catholic burial place in the city, if not the country. With
almost 1,300 crypts and 5,000 niches for cremated remains, it is one of
the largest cathedral burial vaults in the world, and certainly the
grandest premeditated design. The Basilica in St. Peter's may have more
graves beneath its floor, but that's because it was built above an
existing cemetery.</LD>
<TE>   Many Catholic cathedrals and churches have small crypts, often beneath
the altar, for bishops and other notable clergy and perhaps a few lay
people deemed extraordinary by the archdiocese: kings or queens, perhaps
a wealthy family that paid for the building, a great artist. But no
American cathedral has what amounts to a full-blown mausoleum in its
basement. St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, for example, has but
14 crypts; all the former New York bishops are buried there, as well as
Pierre Toussaint, a former slave who died in 1853 and is a candidate for
canonization.</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for the remains of five of California's bishops to be
interred in Our Lady; they are to be moved from their current resting
place in East L.A.'s Calvary Cemetery when the new cathedral downtown on
Temple Street is consecrated in the fall. St. Vibiana, the patroness of
the archdiocese of Los Angeles who also rests at Calvary, will also be
interred beneath the cathedral. She will have her own chapel, which is
adjacent to the mausoleum.</TE>
<TE>   But many crypts will be made available to select supporters of the
archdiocese, including those who made substantial donations to the
construction of the cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese says it does not have any sort of "A list" yet. But
officials acknowledge that major donors to the cathedral could be
considered. They include Sir Daniel Donohue, head of the Dan Murphy
Foundation, which contributed the initial $25 million; Rupert Murdoch and
his former wife, Anna, who gave $10 million; Betsy Bloomingdale; Roy and
Patty Disney; former Mayor Richard Riordan; former Dodgers owner Peter
O'Malley; comedian Bob Hope; and former talk show host Merv Griffin. Many
of them--Murdoch, Roy Disney, O'Malley, Hope and Riordan--were awarded
papal knighthoods, the highest honor a pope can bestow on a meritorious
lay person, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone can request crypt burial, but the selection rests with the
archbishop, now Cardinal Roger M. Mahony. Those chosen do not have to be
Catholic; church policy throughout the diocese allows an individual who
is married to a Catholic or who comes from a Catholic family to be buried
in consecrated ground, and that will hold true in the cathedral. But
those invited will have to pay for the honor. Considerably.</TE>
<TE>   There is not yet a price list for the resting places, but officials
say they are looking at the crypts as an ongoing fund-raiser. Revenues
would go into an endowment, which, they hope, will pay for the upkeep and
maintenance of the cathedral. How much will that be?</TE>
<TE>   "Until we have at least a year up and running, we really won't know,"
said Tod Tamberg, spokesman for the archdiocese of Los Angeles. Ballpark
figures, based on the budget of New York's St. Patrick's, run about $3.5
million a year. According to Tamberg, the suggested donations for the
crypts will be based on the needs of the endowment.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's put it this way," said another church official. "The crypts
cost us about $20,000 apiece. So they aren't going to be cheap." A
starting price of $50,000, he added, would not be unreasonable.</TE>
<TE>   For space in the semiprivate chapels, of which there are six, or a
crypt near the 26 stained-glass windows and lunettes brought over from
the original cathedral, the cost will be considerably more. The four
crypts in the sarcophagus directly under the altar are the most exalted:
When the name of one millionaire was mentioned, it was jocularly
suggested by one church official that he could not afford such an honor.</TE>
<TE>Like a 'Sky Box' for Deceased VIPs</TE>
<TE>   There is some uneasiness arising about commercial considerations in
such a sacred place. "It's the ecclesiastical equivalent of a sky box,"
said one theologian who declined to be named. On the other hand, making
the cathedral self-supporting certainly is an answer for those who
contend that the construction money could be better spent aiding the poor
and the suffering.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a great idea," said Lawrence Cunningham, a professor of
theology at Notre Dame University. "So many people are against spending
money on cathedrals that [selling crypts] makes a lot of sense."</TE>
<TE>   Neither the price of a crypt nor those eligible for burial will be
officially decided until after the cathedral's completion. "We need to
finish fund-raising for the construction before we get onto the marketing
end of things," Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   And, he added, it's important to remember that the cathedral is built
to last hundreds of years, so the crypts will not be filled quickly.
Still, people already are asking how they can reserve a space for
themselves or family members. The answer is, they can't. "Folks keep
asking me, 'How do I get in there?' " said one official. "I say, 'Well,
first, you have to die.' "</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Europe, the crypts of the great cathedrals are tourist
stops, often requiring an extra fee to view the marble slabs and
sarcophagi within which lie the remains of queens and geniuses, inventors
and stewards, the holy and the lauded, and the rulers and the rich.</TE>
<TE>   Westminster Abbey has its poets corner; 71 kings and queens are buried
beneath St. Denis in Paris; Michelangelo rests in Santa Croce in
Florence; and the crypt of Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin, one of the
largest in the British Isles, was recently refurbished to accommodate
receptions and other gatherings.</TE>
<TE>   But visions of Europe's mournful cherubim and cascading marble wreaths
do little to prepare a visitor for the crypts beneath Our Lady of the
Angels. Just as the cathedral itself challenges assumptions of
ecclesiastical design, so do its crypts, beginning with their sheer
number.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles always does things in a big way," said Cunningham, who
expressed surprise at the crypts' capaciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Many modern cathedral builders intentionally left space in their
crypts for dignitaries. But Cunningham said he could not think of another
cathedral that used, or planned to use, its crypts as a funding base.
"I've never heard of a link quite that intimate before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The original plans for the cathedral did not include such a large
burial vault. Digging into the ground adds millions to the budget of such
a project, and originally the archdiocese settled for the chapel and a
utility area beneath the vestry. But two years ago, when it was decided
that underground seismic work was necessary, officials leaped at the
chance to create the second floor, and Mahony soon gave the plan his
approval.</TE>
<TE>   Until the crypts are occupied by the noteworthy and the saintly,
pilgrims visiting the crypt of Our Lady will be drawn to two things: the
chapel of St. Vibiana and the windows from her former cathedral. A
stairway behind the baptistery of the main cathedral leads to the crypts.
To the right of the final step is the chapel, designed by cathedral
architect Raphael Mineo, where Mass can be said or visitors may pray or
meditate.</TE>
<TE>A Ray of Light for St. Vibiana</TE>
<TE>   The far wall of the chapel is of the same alabaster that forms the
cathedral windows; behind it will lie the sarcophagus of St. Vibiana. It
is the only portion of this basement floor bathed in natural light, from
a skylight cut a story above--a tribute to the saint, who will lie almost
directly across from the entrance to the crypts.</TE>
<TE>   The mausoleum follows the same cruciform floor plan as the cathedral
above it, acting as a symbolic foundation for the living church. From the
entrance just past the chapel, one looks down the main aisle, which
bisects the space to the far wall where a back-lighted stained-glass
window depicts Jesus as the Good Shepherd. Just in front of that window,
and also visible from the entrance, is a four-person sarcophagus situated
beneath the altar in the cathedral above.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being an underground mirror of the cathedral itself,
the mausoleum was also designed to accommodate the 26 windows and
lunettes salvaged from St. Vibiana's, which was damaged in the Northridge
earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first thing they decided," said Walter Judson of L.A.'s
Judson Studios, which removed, cleaned and restored the windows.</TE>
<TE>   The windows, which depict such biblical scenes as the Annunciation,
the Nativity, the Ascension and the Resurrection, were put in shadow
boxes and lighted by color-corrected fluorescent lights that shine
through plastic diffusers. The result is as close to natural daylight as
is technologically possible underground, which was very important given
the crucial role natural light plays in the design of the cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   "We paid a lot of attention to lighting," said John Gary, who oversaw
the design of the crypts. "There are soft vaults in the ceiling and
portions are lit at the edges, which, with the windows, gives the
psychological effect of natural light."</TE>
<TE>   Mineo approved all plans for the crypts, but he did not design them.
John Stuart Todd, a Houston design firm specializing in mortuaries, came
up with the original plans. Lead architect Barry Boudreaux worked toward
creating a space that was both consistent with the overall design and
particular to its purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the early design concepts was to use the beautiful windows to
incorporate the old and the new," Gary said. "But we tried to stay true
to the cathedral. It's very clean, no applied ornamentation."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the lines of the walls, the rows of crypts--five high and as
many as 20 across depending on the length of wall--the urn niches, and
even the small semiprivate alcoves are sleek and bright.</TE>
<TE>   The color palette is consistent as well. Marble artisan Louie
Carnevale designed the floors and steps for both the cathedral and the
crypts, as well as the walls of the crypt. He used a light-colored
Spanish marble in both, although the marble of the mausoleum comes from a
different quarry and is creamier, closer in hue to the stone shutters on
the crypts, which are French limestone.</TE>
<TE>Ornamentation Subject to Church Approval</TE>
<TE>   Even the sarcophagus under the altar will be simple and subdued in
design, although that, and the faces of any of the crypts, may change
once names are engraved and ornamentation added by the families. The
niches for the cremation urns also have stone shutters that can be
engraved. Strictures against cremation were loosened by the Second
Vatican Council in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   Any changes to the crypts would have to be approved by the
archdiocese. "It's like any subdivision," Gary said. "You need to have a
general design, a master plan."</TE>
<TE>   The altar sarcophagus is the premier space and, as yet, no one will
venture a guess as to who might be invited to be buried there. (Mahony, a
natural choice, has, according to Tamberg, already declined; he is
content to be among the other bishops for whom spaces are reserved to the
right of the altar crypt.)</TE>
<TE>   The entrance of the mausoleum is flanked by two alcoves in which
stained-glass windows are surrounded by full-length crypts--"sofa
coffins" in which the body is interred lengthwise, rather than headfirst
as in most of the crypts. The main window depicting the Good Shepherd is
likewise surrounded by crypts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think any of the spaces by the windows would be considered
premium," Gary said.</TE>
<TE>   The cremation niches come in a range of locations and positioning. On
the right side of the burial vault are several rooms devoted to niches,
one containing a large, free-standing cross in which two layers of urns
can be housed. In several of the semiprivate rooms, there are niches amid
the crypts, giving family members an option in form and price. The
niches, said officials, will obviously be less expensive than the crypts,
although, again, the cost will depend on the location. They, too, will be
by invitation only.</TE>
<TE>   And who knows? A hundred years hence, European tourists may be paying
a few extra dollars to see Southern California's saints and scholars, its
rulers and elite. The region might not have any kings, but undoubtedly
there'll be a celebrity or two. This is L.A., after all.</TE>

<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>A dingy, overcrowded cellblock in the bowels of New Delhi's Tihar
jail was the perfect spot for a merger between militant Islam and the
Indian mafia.</LD>
<LD>   Ahmad Omar Sayed Sheikh, a chess-playing Islamic radical, made common
cause with Aftab Ansari, an ambitious Calcutta gangster, when they did
time together behind Tihar's high walls in the late 1990s, according to
Indian police investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Their partnership provided groups linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
terrorist network with a new source of recruits and safe houses, along
with money from kidnapping, drug trafficking, prostitution and other
crime, the investigators say.</LD>
<TE>   Sheikh, a British citizen born to Pakistani parents, studied math and
statistics at the prestigious London School of Economics and then turned
to radical Islam. Ansari studied law and journalism in the Hindu holy
city of Benares and then decided to pursue a career in organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   They were young men from different worlds, but they shared a taste for
kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh, who confessed to kidnapping Californian tourist Bela Josef
Nuss and three British backpackers in 1994, now has been named as the
chief suspect in the abduction of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl in
neighboring Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The loose alliance between Islamic warriors waging jihad and organized
criminals looking for wealth, weapons and power received direct support
from Pakistan's military intelligence agency, Indian police and
intelligence sources charge. They cite seized caches of smuggled military
weapons and phony Pakistani passports as some of the evidence.</TE>
<TE>   With their expertise in money laundering, forgery, abduction and
killing, the criminal gangs' support for Islamic extremists complicates
the war against terrorism, but it also offers weaknesses for skilled
investigators to exploit.</TE>
<TE>   "Those with criminal backgrounds very readily share information with
us in custody," said a senior police investigator in Calcutta, who has
spent years trying to unravel the complex ties between gangsters and
Islamic militants, known here as jihadis.</TE>
<TE>   "But those with jihadi connections, it's very, very difficult to get
anything out of them. They're very well trained to handle interrogation.
They give just as much as necessary and buy time," he said. "They play
with us, and we play with them."</TE>
<TE>   The senior investigator was one of five police and intelligence
sources who agreed to discuss details of sealed court files and ongoing
investigations on the condition they not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Tihar jail is the largest lockup in South Asia, with more than 11,000
prisoners in cells built to hold fewer than one-third that number. The
cells are 10 feet by 8, and in some, four men have to share the bare
concrete slab that is the only bed, jailers said.</TE>
<TE>   There are six jails behind the institution's creaking steel gates,
which lead to a 400-acre complex holding alleged terrorists along with
petty criminals, and, in a separate wing, female prisoners with their
children.</TE>
<TE>   One of Tihar's most notorious inmates was Maulana Masood Azhar, leader
of Jaish-e-Mohammed, one of the most vicious groups fighting Indian rule
in the disputed Kashmir region. Azhar was transferred to Tihar's Jail No.
3 on terrorism charges in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Another prisoner who was in the same block from November 1994 until
July 1999 was Asif Reza Khan. One investigator called Khan the "chief
executive of Ansari's India operations" until police shot Khan dead Dec.
7. They said he was trying to escape custody while being moved in Rajkot,
in the western state of Gujarat.</TE>
<TE>   A police interrogation report sealed under court order claims that
Khan admitted receiving training in a camp run by the Islamic militant
group Lashkar-e-Taiba.</TE>
<TE>Numerous Ways for Prisoners to Meet</TE>
<TE>   Under interrogation, three other members of Ansari's gang who are
being held in Tihar jail said the merger between mafia and jihad was
clinched when Sheikh took up residence in Jail No. 1 in November 1998,
according to police.</TE>
<TE>   Although Tihar's primitive registry doesn't place Ansari in any of the
same cellblocks as Azhar or Sheikh, prisoners are routinely shifted from
one building to another without record and have numerous other ways of
meeting, jailers and police investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   "During trials, these prisoners were taken in vans to court, and there
is one police lockup there," the senior investigator said. "And there are
mealtimes and lots of other opportunities to communicate with each
other."</TE>
<TE>   Although terrorists in Tihar are imprisoned in high-security areas,
they can mingle with common criminals because cell doors are open for
most of the day to relieve crowding, prison officials and police said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't keep a single person totally blocked from other prisoners,"
said a jailer who has worked at Tihar for 21 years. "Total isolation is
not permissible."</TE>
<TE>   Jailers open most of the cells each day for at least 10 hours, from 6
a.m. to noon and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. High-security prisoners such as
terrorists are released from their cells for at least four hours a day,
leaving ample time to mingle.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Aslam, one of the kidnapping gang's members still in Tihar,
allegedly told police that he had trained at a Lashkar-e-Taiba camp in
Khowst, Afghanistan, where U.S. Special Forces troops are still trying to
root out Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Indian police say Aslam is a Pakistani citizen who was arrested with
Khan in New Delhi in October. They were charged with the abduction of
Calcutta shoe tycoon Partha Roy Burman.</TE>
<TE>   After eight days in captivity, Burman was released Aug. 2 for about
$830,000 in ransom. Indian police suspect that $100,000 of the ransom may
have been sent to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, where Sheikh
transferred it to Mohamed Atta, the alleged ringleader of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that the suspicion is only "an inference" drawn from the
timing and Sheikh's known Al Qaeda links, a senior Indian police official
said it was based on a series of intercepted e-mails in Hindi, which have
grown "to almost a booklet now."</TE>
<TE>E-Mails Shared With Interpol</TE>
<TE>   In an Aug. 8 e-mail, Ansari asked Khan "whether he agrees to part with
$100,000 for a 'noble cause' as requested by [Sheikh]," the investigator
said. The next day, Khan responded by e-mail "that he is agreeable and
has no objections," according to the police official.</TE>
<TE>   "On Aug. 11, Aftab Ansari communicated with Asif Reza Khan, and in
that e-mail he said, with reference to their previous correspondence, the
amount mentioned has been sent to [Sheikh]," the investigator added.</TE>
<TE>   Eight days later, Sheikh sent Ansari an e-mail that said: "The money
that was sent has been passed on," the police official said.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails have been shared with Interpol, where foreign law
enforcement agencies, including the FBI, have access to them. In New
Delhi, senior officers in the Central Bureau of Investigation, India's
equivalent of the FBI, say the links between organized crime and Islamic
extremists were also mentioned when FBI Director Robert Mueller visited
the Indian capital last month.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest inspiration for the gangsters, who are Muslims, to take up
jihad, or holy war, came from Azhar in Tihar jail, Indian police claim.</TE>
<TE>   "While in prison, they became virtual disciples of Masood Azhar,"
according to the senior police official.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, banned Azhar's
organization last month. Two weeks later, President Bush named it as one
of the world's most dangerous terrorist forces during his State of the
Union address.</TE>
<TE>   India's government wants Pakistan to hand over Azhar for trial, along
with 19 other terrorist and gangster suspects. India says Musharraf's
refusal to do so belies his commitment to the war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Although Indian police and FBI agents are now cooperating, Western
investigators may have missed a prime opportunity to probe the
connections between Al Qaeda and the Indian mafia by interrogating Sheikh
in jail. India has long complained that its warnings of a growing
terrorist network in South Asia were ignored--until the wake-up call of
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>No Questions About Terror, Jailer Says</TE>
<TE>   The large ledger where the names of Tihar jail visitors are registered
lists nine meetings between Sheikh, his lawyer and a British diplomat
identified as "Mr. Greenhall," the jail official said.</TE>
<TE>   They were all visits to check on Sheikh's "living conditions and
general welfare," not to question him for leads on terrorist groups or
their plots, said the jailer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because
he fears retribution.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents came to Tihar jail in 1996 to meet Azhar, but they were
escorting the wives and other relatives of tourists, including an
American, who were abducted in Kashmir. The agents wanted to make a
direct appeal to Azhar for the captives' release, the jailer said.</TE>
<TE>   On July 4, 1995, militants fighting Indian rule in Kashmir kidnapped
Donald Hutchings, a neuropsychologist from Spokane, Wash., along with two
Britons, a German and another American, John Childs, who managed to
escape.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, a Norwegian was kidnapped and his severed head was left on
a mountain path to warn that the kidnappers were serious. The body of one
of the Britons was found two years ago. The other hostages were never
found. Indian authorities blamed a group called Al Faran, a breakaway
faction of the radical Kashmir separatist group Harkat Ansar. Its leader,
Maulana Fazlur Rehman Khalil, co-signed Bin Laden's February 1998 fatwa
calling for attacks on Americans and Western interests.</TE>
<TE>   Azhar was a leader of Harkat Ansar until he formed his own terrorist
army, Jaish-e-Mohammed, after India released him from jail to free
passengers on an Indian Airlines flight hijacked to Kandahar,
Afghanistan, in December 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh also belonged to Harkat Ansar and demanded the release of Azhar
and several other alleged terrorists when he helped kidnap Nuss, the
American tourist, in 1994. Indian investigators believe that Sheikh is
now Azhar's deputy.</TE>
<TE>   Both men were freed in the hijacking swap. Indian intelligence sources
say the men crossed from Afghanistan into Pakistan, where they were
sheltered by the military's Inter-Services Intelligence agency.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh's second base is in Dubai, where his Tihar jail contact Ansari
is believed to be living--and running his organized-crime racket in India
by remote control.</TE>
<TE>   This easy cross-pollination of terrorist groups with strong popular
support in Pakistan is another reason Indian leaders remain skeptical
about Musharraf's promise to stop terrorists from using Pakistan, and the
area it controls in Kashmir, to launch attacks.</TE>
<TE>Seized Weapons Cited as Evidence</TE>
<TE>   Just as they have for years, Pakistan-based terrorist groups are again
changing their names and continue to infiltrate from Pakistan-controlled
Kashmir, the Indian government charges.</TE>
<TE>   The Central Bureau of Investigation says it seized two caches of
military weapons being smuggled to Ansari's Calcutta gang and calls them
evidence of support from Pakistan's military intelligence agency.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 12, Indian police uncovered a weapons dump buried in a village
near India's western border with Pakistan. They say the arms included
more than 11 pounds of RDX plastic explosives, electronic timers and
detonators, two antipersonnel land mines and various types of grenades.</TE>
<TE>   The Central Bureau of Investigation says there was "a printed letter
pad" of the Lashkar-e-Taiba in the cache, and the hand grenades and
detonator caps were wrapped in Urdu-language Pakistani newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ansari is an Indian citizen, he has passports from several
countries, including Pakistan, to go along with various aliases, Indian
investigators say. He changes his name so easily that the Tihar jail
didn't know his real name was Aftab Ansari until long after he was
released on bail May 23, 1999, and fled the country, the senior police
official said.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, he looks like a part-time jihadi and a part-time criminal,"
the senior officer said. "If his criminal activities are backed by jihadi
connections, it all becomes easier for him.</TE>
<TE>   "As a jihadi, he gets access to certain people and places. As an
ordinary criminal, he wouldn't find his way."</TE>

<HD>Powell Toes Hard Line on Haiti</HD>
<DH>Caribbean: Secretary tells his counterparts in the region that the
U.S. won't help free up aid for the nation until its political crisis is
resolved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NASSAU, Bahamas
</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell engaged in tough-love diplomacy
Thursday with the island nations of the Caribbean, resisting appeals to
free up $200 million in financial aid for the troubled government of
Haiti.</LD>
<LD>   The funds are being withheld by the Inter-American Development Bank
because of concerns about electoral irregularities and human rights
abuses under the government of Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a political crisis in the country that must be dealt with
before the international community will have confidence that money given
to Haiti through the government will be appropriately spent," Powell said
after a closed meeting with Caribbean foreign ministers. "In the absence
of a solid political system, there is good reason to have a lack of
confidence."</LD>
<TE>   Powell told the Caribbean ministers that the Bush administration won't
use its influence to help Haiti obtain the $200 million.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is a sensitive one. Haiti's political instability and
endemic poverty are creating problems for nearby island nations such as
the Bahamas, a frequent landing point for Haitian refugees who flee the
country in makeshift vessels.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's refusal to budge disappointed the ministers of the Caribbean
Community regional group, or Caricom, which adopted a resolution earlier
in the week urging the United States to end the funding impasse.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to withheld development bank aid and loans, Europe has
withdrawn $45 million in promised assistance. The United States is
channeling about $65 million in annual aid through nongovernmental
organizations not controlled by Aristide.</TE>
<TE>   "The release of the funds would assist in rebuilding democracy in
Haiti," said Guyanese Foreign Minister Samuel Insanally. "Not doing this
could lead to a deterioration in the situation. The U.S. assistance is
needed particularly with the independent financial institutions."</TE>
<TE>   The funding deadlock arose after disputed parliamentary elections in
May 2000 in which Aristide increased his political grip on the Haitian
Senate. The United States and other countries pressured Aristide's
government to address the alleged voting irregularities. In late 2000,
the outgoing Clinton administration presented Aristide's government with
a list of eight issues standing in the way of more international aid for
the impoverished nation of 8 million.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said too little progress has been made to justify
releasing the previously promised assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "We stand ready to assist," Powell told reporters. "We want to see
this matter resolved. As soon as it is resolved, there will be
opportunities for additional aid for the Haitian people."</TE>
<TE>   Haiti was not the only source of friction between the Caribbean
leaders and Powell. Caricom ministers expressed concern that their need
for more economic development assistance has been subordinated to U.S.
demands for tighter security and enhanced surveillance in the aftermath
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hoping that we would not through this process divert
development efforts to security efforts," Caricom Secretary-General Edwin
Carrington of Trinidad and Tobago said in an interview. "That is only
going to breed more poverty, more hopelessness, more instability and more
insecurity."</TE>
<TE>   The economies of several Caribbean nations have been hard hit by the
aftereffects of Sept. 11. Nearly 60% of the Bahamas' gross domestic
product, for example, is derived from tourism, which has fallen sharply.
The second-biggest sector is offshore banking and financial services, now
subjected to new restrictions designed to curtail illicit money flows.</TE>
<TE>   The ministers pressed Powell to increase the administration's
financial commitment to a "Third Border Initiative" launched last year by
President Bush. The initiative provided $20 million for HIV-AIDS programs
in the region, helped airports modernize safety and security, assisted
governments with natural disaster programs, established a teacher
training center in Jamaica and created a $1-million scholarship fund for
Caribbean students.</TE>
<TE>   Insanally, the Guyanese minister, commended the administration for
committing itself to the initiative but said the funding "seems like a
relatively limited amount" for projects that address only some problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it has to be considerably increased, maybe doubled, to really
meet our needs," he said. "The needs are urgent."</TE>
<TE>   On that and other issues, Powell made no specific promises or
concessions, the Caribbean officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The talks also addressed the need for more aggressive efforts to
combat narcotics trafficking and money laundering, Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   "Increasingly, narco-activities get mixed up with terrorist activities
and can provide a source of funding for terrorist activities," he said in
a radio interview. "Both of them are condemnable. We have to fight both
of them, and there are linkages between the two."</TE>
<TE>   Powell, whose forebears emigrated to the United States from Jamaica,
devoted a portion of his short trip to a meeting with young men and women
residing at two rehabilitation centers in Nassau, the Bahamian capital.
Employees at the U.S. Embassy in the Bahamas recently began mentoring the
residents, ages 10 through 16, in such areas as literacy tutoring,
physical education, computer use, carpentry skills and anger management.</TE>
<TE>   At their ages, Powell told the youths, he was not an exemplary student
and had no clear vision of where he was headed in life. Even though he
now occupies one of the highest positions in government, he said, he
still faces his fair share of failure.</TE>
<TE>   "Something goes wrong every day of my life," he said.</TE>

<HD>Co-Pilot Uses Ax to Stop Man From Invading Cockpit</HD>
<DH>Security: A Uruguayan bank employee is detained after allegedly
disrupting a United Airlines flight from Miami to Buenos Aires.</DH>

<LD>A passenger tried to force his way into the cockpit of a United
Airlines flight bound from Miami to Buenos Aires on Thursday, only to be
subdued after the co-pilot struck him over the head with an ax, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   Argentine authorities detained Pablo Moreira, 28, after the plane
landed here at its regularly scheduled arrival time. The incident
occurred five hours into the flight as the Boeing 777 flew over Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   Moreira, a Uruguayan bank employee, told Argentine air force
investigators who questioned him that he was returning home from a
marketing conference in the United States. He said he had no memory of
the incident and had no idea why he rushed the cockpit.</LD>
<TE>   "He says he feels very sorry about what happened," said Jorge Reta, an
air force officer here. Moreira told authorities he drank a glass of
whiskey and later passed out. "That's all he remembers," Reta said.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for President Bush's Office of Homeland
Security, said there was no information to suggest that Moreira's actions
were the latest terrorist attack on a U.S. airliner.</TE>
<TE>   The incident on United Flight 855 came amid a climate of heightened
security at world airports. In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, United
and other U.S. airlines have reinforced their cockpit doors with an
interior metal brace that makes it harder for intruders to gain access.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials and a United spokesman said Moreira kicked in a panel at
the bottom of the cockpit door and then tried to squeeze his head and
torso in. The co-pilot struck Moreira's head as it protruded through the
half-open door, using an ax provided to the crew for flight emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom panel of the door was penetrated, but it's my
understanding the rest of the reinforced door performed as it was
intended to," Federal Aviation Agency spokeswoman Laura Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA has issued new standards for further upgrading cockpit doors
to resist force and small-arms fire. Airlines are expected to begin
installing these new, even sturdier doors soon.</TE>
<TE>   Flight 855 carried 142 passengers and 12 crew members on an eight-hour
flight from Miami to Buenos Aires. Passengers described being
awakened--the incident took place about 3 a.m. Eastern time--by the sound
of the captain calling for help on the public address system.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard the voice of the captain yelling desperately for people to
come to the cockpit," passenger Lucia Pilia said. "The flight attendants
starting running like crazy."</TE>
<TE>   In five minutes, everything was back under control, passengers said.
Reta said the unruly passenger was restrained with plastic handcuffs.
Other passengers said Moreira was tied to a seat in business class.</TE>
<TE>   "They tied him up with seat belts, like a stuffed piece of beef,"
Pilia said. Officials said Moreira was treated for minor injuries after
the plane arrived in Buenos Aires and Argentine police boarded the
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the incident demonstrates that even a reinforced cockpit
door, such as the one on the United plane, can be vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact of the matter is that he got on the airplane and, once
aboard, he was able to breach the barrier from the cabin to the cockpit,"
said airline captain Tom Frazer, head of the Allied Pilots Assn. local in
Miami. "That is a major concern. What have we accomplished since Sept.
11? Supposedly we have been working to avoid this very situation."</TE>
<TE>   Airline pilots in the United States are petitioning the government to
be allowed to carry firearms. This latest incident is likely to bolster
their case.</TE>
<TE>   "The crash ax worked this time," Frazer said. "If there had been two
or three intruders, I doubt it would have."</TE>
<TE>   United spokesman Joe Hopkins took issue with criticism that the
incident revealed a weakness in security.</TE>
<TE>   "I think just the opposite," he said. "The redundancy built into the
security system worked. This person was not able to gain access to the
cockpit and carry out whatever he proposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   In Miami, FBI spokeswoman Judy Orihuela said Moreira is expected to be
flown back to Miami today. He faces the possibility of a 20-year prison
term on federal charges of interfering with a flight crew, she said.</TE>

<HD>Turkish Reforms Get Mixed Reviews</HD>
<DH>Law: EU-geared changes will curb torture but won't do much to
expand freedom of expression, human rights advocates say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey
</DL>
<LD>A set of long-delayed reforms aimed at bolstering Turkey's chances
for membership in the European Union will help reduce widespread torture
but do little to expand freedom of expression, human rights advocates and
legal scholars said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The package of constitutional amendments was passed by the 550-member
parliament Wednesday despite tough resistance from the ultranationalist
wing of Turkey's three-party coalition government, whose members said the
reforms would encourage Kurdish separatists and other enemies of the
state.</LD>
<LD>   Husnu Ondul, chairman of Turkey's Human Rights Assn., the country's
leading advocacy group, said the changes will dramatically improve human
rights in four Kurdish-dominated provinces where most abuses occur. Those
four provinces are governed by special emergency laws.</LD>
<TE>   Under the new law, detainees accused of so-called terror crimes can be
held without trial for a maximum of seven days.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, anyone accused of sympathizing with rebels of the outlawed
Kurdistan Workers Party, better known as the PKK, or of committing other
terror offenses--often with scant evidence--could be held indefinitely
without access to a lawyer. As a result, hundreds of prisoners are
languishing in jails throughout the four provinces.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear what will happen to current detainees under the new law.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency rule was introduced throughout the southeast to help quell
an insurgency launched in 1984 by the PKK, which sought to establish an
independent Kurdish state.</TE>
<TE>   Rebels declared a unilateral cease-fire following the 1999 capture of
their leader, Abdullah Ocalan, and an atmosphere of relative peace now
prevails. As the PKK began to scale down its attacks, the Ankara
government started phasing out emergency rule in the Kurdish regions.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Turkey became the first predominantly Muslim nation to be
added to the EU's list of official candidates for membership. But the
country's poor human rights record and its refusal to grant its estimated
12 million Kurds greater cultural rights are cited among the chief
reasons why Turkey has not yet been admitted to the bloc.</TE>
<TE>   Ondul said in a telephone interview that most of the reported abuses
occur during pretrial detention. Reducing the length of that period will
reduce torture, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge improvement," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say the reforms do not go far enough, noting that laws
against insulting or defaming the Turkish state remain on the books, even
though the maximum jail term has been cut from six years to three.</TE>
<TE>   "The broad interpretation of the law will continue to result in scores
of academics, journalists and politicians being prosecuted and jailed for
expressing dissenting views," said Nevzat Toroslu, head of Ankara
University's penal law department.</TE>
<TE>   "The interpretation of the laws is left in the hands of the judges,
and as long as the mentality of the judges does not change, there cannot
be progress," Toroslu said.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey is likely to face a new round of criticism Wednesday, when
Istanbul publisher Fatih Tas is to appear in court. Tas published a book
containing excerpts from a speech by American linguist and social critic
Noam Chomsky in which he accused Turkey of "brutal repression" of Kurds.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are seeking to send Tas to prison for a year. Chomsky said
in a telephone interview that he would travel to Istanbul for the trial
"to show support for this extremely brave individual."</TE>
<TE>   A senior Turkish official who declined to be identified acknowledged
that "Chomsky's presence would be hugely embarrassing," partly because
the trial coincides with a conference in Istanbul bringing together
foreign ministers from Islamic and EU countries. The forum is meant to
highlight Turkey's self-proclaimed role as a bridge between East and
West.</TE>
<TE>   "With Chomsky around, more likely they'll probably be focusing on our
human rights record," the official said.</TE>

<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>An air force colonel made a daring call for the resignation of
President Hugo Chavez on Thursday and was subsequently arrested by
military police. But he was quickly freed under pressure of a noisy
citizen protest.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of people cheered, sang the national anthem and chanted
"Chavez out!" as Col. Pedro Soto, wearing his uniform, stood atop a car
in Caracas' Altamira Plaza and waved the red, yellow and blue Venezuelan
flag after his release.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second anti-Chavez protest this week. On Monday, hundreds
protested Chavez's celebration of the 10th anniversary of his attempted
coup against then-President Carlos Andres Perez.</LD>
<TE>   Soto's call for Chavez to resign was the strongest sign yet of growing
resentment among the military toward Chavez. Soto made his remarks at a
forum on press freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a democratic government," Soto said. "We are here to tell
the president that freedom of expression is one of the most important
things . . . and no one is going to take it away from us. It cannot be
that the president is thinking we elected him to be the owner of
Venezuela."</TE>
<TE>   The government dismissed Soto's remarks as sour grapes for not having
been promoted. But Soto said he was also speaking for others.</TE>
<TE>   A weekend communique published by a group claiming to represent 3,400
soldiers lambasted the president. The government dismissed it as a hoax.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Releases Rights Advocate</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Fox frees ex-general imprisoned in 1993. Activists
say he was prosecuted on trumped-up charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>President Vicente Fox's government Thursday night freed an
imprisoned former army general who had become a champion of human rights
in Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   The government commuted the 28-year sentence of Jose Francisco
Gallardo after the former brigadier general had spent eight years and two
months behind bars. He was arrested in 1993, and a military tribunal
convicted him in 1998 of corruption and embezzlement.</LD>
<LD>   Rights groups said Fox's predecessors had trumped up those charges to
justify their persecution of Gallardo for having publicly advocated
creating an ombudsman post for the military to ensure that the armed
forces stop abusing human rights. Amnesty International adopted Gallardo
as a "prisoner of conscience."</LD>
<TE>   The nature of his release was certain to anger Gallardo and his sons,
who have campaigned relentlessly on his behalf. The order in effect
reduces his sentence to time already served, without declaring him
innocent. The general had repeatedly said from his jail cell that he
wouldn't accept quietly a pardon or any other measure short of acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   But political analysts said that by releasing Gallardo, Fox's
government demonstrated a new resolve to stamp its constitutional
authority over the military, which has long acted with relative autonomy.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue was the capacity of the civilian government to modify what
a military tribunal had ruled. This was the fundamental question," said
Sergio Aguayo, a longtime rights activist. "The fact that Gallardo is
freed means that civilian-military relations are redefined, in the sense
that the military is gradually being pulled and pushed into the workings
of a democratic society."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda joined Interior Minister Santiago
Creel in announcing Fox's decision. That suggested the sensitivity of
Gallardo's case for the Mexican government, which has worked hard to
polish its international image since Fox took office in December 2000 and
ended 71 years of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.</TE>
<TE>   The Inter-American Court of Human Rights had called for Gallardo's
release in a harshly critical report in 1996. A hearing by the court on
Gallardo's continued detention loomed Feb. 18, which could have proved
embarrassing for Fox.</TE>
<TE>   One of Fox's campaign themes was renewed respect for human rights.
With Gallardo's release, Fox now counts three significant advances on
human rights. He addressed partially the demands of Zapatista rebels in
Chiapas, including the release of nearly all of 97 political prisoners
jailed since the 1994 uprising in that southern state. He also released
two peasant ecologists from Guerrero state who had been arrested by the
army and later convicted on drug charges.</TE>
<TE>   Roderic Ai Camp, a political scientist at Claremont-McKenna College
who has written extensively about the Mexican army, said Gallardo's
release "is obviously a very positive step, not just as a human rights
issue but as a rights issue in terms of the military. It means Fox feels
strong enough to make a decision that neither of his predecessors wanted
to make."</TE>
<TE>   Camp noted that the issue was especially difficult because Fox's
attorney general, Rafael Macedo de la Concha, is an army general who was
the chief military prosecutor when Gallardo was convicted. The attorney
general's office had fiercely opposed Gallardo's appeal of his
conviction. A ruling on that appeal is still pending.</TE>
<TE>   But Camp added that the basic issues that Gallardo had raised have
still not been addressed. Gallardo had criticized the lack of
accountability of Mexican armed forces who abuse citizens rights while
carrying out police functions.</TE>
<TE>   Gallardo told a forum a month after Fox's July 2000 victory that the
new president would have to confront the military. "If the Fox
administration does not subject the army to institutional controls, it
runs the risk of not consolidating its political, economic and social
proposals," Gallardo said by telephone from his prison cell. "The army
must be respected, not feared."</TE>

<LD>The Roman Catholic hierarchy in Ireland gave its followers
permission Thursday to vote in favor of a government referendum amending
abortion laws to permit the practice only if the woman's life was in
danger.</LD>
<LD>   The amendment would exclude the threat of suicide as a sufficient
reason for obtaining an abortion.</LD>
<LD>   The March 6 referendum seeks to resolve differences between Ireland's
1983 constitutional ban on all abortions and a 1992 ruling.</LD>
<TE>   The Supreme Court ruled that abortion services should be legalized in
Ireland for cases involving women whose pregnancies were threatening
their lives. It specifically included cases of threatened suicide.</TE>

<LD>A matador's death blow--a sword thrust that severs a bull's spinal
cord--poses no risk of spreading "mad cow" disease, a government report
concluded, clearing the way for the lifting of a ban on selling meat from
fighting bulls.</LD>
<LD>   The ban was imposed last year, infuriating bull breeders and fight
organizers who rely on meat sales to make a profit.</LD>
<LD>   No cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy have been found in
Spain's fighting bulls. But there were fears that a bullfighter's blow
could release particles of nerve tissue and contaminate the meat.</LD>
<TE>   The government is poised to lift the meat sale ban, with some
restrictions, an official said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Refuses to Cut Arafat Ties Despite Pressure From Sharon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush resisted pressure from Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon on Thursday to sever diplomatic relations with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat, but Sharon did not budge from his view
that Arafat has become one of the "obstacles to peace."</LD>
<LD>   Continuing differences over Arafat became clear immediately after an
hourlong meeting between Bush and Sharon. Bush renewed his call on Arafat
to crack down on Palestinian terrorism and made it clear that the United
States will remain engaged with the Palestinian Authority and with Arafat
himself, at least for now.</LD>
<LD>   "I assured the prime minister that we will continue to keep pressure
on Mr. Arafat to convince him that he must take serious, concrete, real
steps to reduce terrorist activity in the Middle East," Bush said.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't be any more clear in my position, and that is that he must do
everything in his power to fight terror," Bush told reporters during a
brief Oval Office session Thursday evening, as Sharon sat beside him.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon reiterated his view that Arafat had become "irrelevant" to the
peace process.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat has chosen a strategy of terror and formed a coalition of
terror," Sharon said. "Therefore, we believe that pressure should be put
on Arafat. . . . I hope to have an alternative leadership in the future."</TE>
<TE>   As violence has continued in the region, Bush administration officials
have struggled to find a way to get Arafat to do more to curb terrorist
attacks on Israelis. But, while rebuking Arafat publicly and bluntly,
they have been reluctant to seek a solution without him.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's frustration has grown in the past two weeks, as
the Israelis have provided evidence that the Palestinian Authority was
involved in an attempt to smuggle in 50 tons of Iranian arms by ship, a
move that Bush has described as "enhancing terror."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said Thursday night, "One cannot get into compromise with
terror."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say they believe that if Arafat did not know about the
Palestinian Authority's involvement in the shipment, he should have.</TE>
<TE>   In their joint White House appearance, both Bush and Sharon also
acknowledged the plight of the Palestinians. Bush mentioned the $300
million in his new budget for nongovernmental organizations in the region
to help Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "We had an interesting discussion about how we can help the
Palestinians--those who aren't involved with terror," the president said,
adding, "I'm deeply concerned about the plight of the average
Palestinian, the moms and dads who are trying to raise their children, to
educate their children."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said he and Bush had discussed "steps that should be taken in
order to improve the life conditions of those Palestinians that are not
involved in terror. That's my intention--that was always my intention."</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Sharon also reiterated their belief that one day there will
be a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   The president's determination not to sever ties with Arafat did not
come as a surprise to Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said
that "the president believes Chairman Arafat knows what he needs to do,
and that's to fight terror. And the president is still waiting for
Chairman Arafat to take stronger actions to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer also told reporters that Bush would make it clear to Sharon
that "the United States will remain engaged in the region and engaged
with the Palestinian Authority."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have acknowledged that they are not optimistic that
Arafat will move the region toward peace in the current environment of
violence. Even so, some officials continue to argue that getting Arafat
to cooperate is the best chance they have.</TE>
<TE>   There was continued violence Thursday. Israel struck a Palestinian
government complex in the West Bank with missiles twice in retaliation
for an Islamic militant's assault on a Jewish settlement that killed
three Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon also used his U.S. visit to stress to Bush Israel's concerns
about Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials have charged that Iran has provided missiles to
Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militia in Lebanon, and has sent fighters to
Lebanon to encourage anti-Israeli activity.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials also said before Sharon's meeting with Bush that he
would ask Bush to exert pressure on Russian President Vladimir V. Putin
to cut off support for Iran's nuclear program, which Israel fears may
provide Iran with the materials and technology to produce nuclear
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Bush did not provide details of any such talks.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, who has imposed virtual house arrest on Arafat in the West
Bank, has visited the White House on three previous occasions. Arafat has
received no such invitation.</TE>

<HD>Soviet Nuclear Tests Altered DNA, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aboveground nuclear tests conducted by the Soviet Union from the
1940s until the early 1960s appear to have altered the DNA of people who
were living near the test site and exposed to fallout, new research
indicates.</LD>
<LD>   People living near the Semipalatinsk testing site in Kazakhstan passed
mutations along to their children at a rate that was almost double what
is normal, according to the new study, published in the journal Science.</LD>
<LD>   The study, conducted by scientists in Britain, Kazakhstan and Finland,
looked only at selected pieces of DNA chosen as markers. It does not
directly show that the people affected were more likely to suffer
diseases such as cancer as a result.</LD>
<TE>   But the findings underscore the risks borne by civilian populations
living near testing sites during the early years of the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   Other studies have documented increased rates of medical problems in
the region, including birth defects and stillbirths, said Nailya
Dyusembayeva, head of the Medico-Genetic Center in the Kazakh city of
Karaganda.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1949 and 1989, the Soviet Union conducted 470 nuclear tests at
the Semipalatinsk site in the far eastern part of Kazakhstan. Before
1963, when the Soviet Union, United States and Britain signed a treaty
banning all but underground tests, many of the explosions were conducted
aboveground.</TE>
<TE>   As much as 85% of the fallout exposure came from four large surface
tests conducted between 1949 and 1956.</TE>
<TE>   The United States also conducted aboveground tests but primarily on
isolated islands in the South Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the region near the Soviet test site were, over the
years, exposed to radiation from fallout that was several times greater
than the average exposure of survivors of the atomic bomb dropped on
Hiroshima, Japan, said Robert Ullrich, a professor at Colorado State
University in Fort Collins and an expert in radiation-induced cancer.
Genetic abnormalities of the sort seen in Kazakhstan have not been found
in the Hiroshima population, Ullrich added.</TE>
<TE>   To see whether radiation from the Soviet tests had left a measurable
mark on the DNA of local residents, geneticist Yuri Dubrova of the
University of Leicester in England and colleagues collected blood samples
from 40 families living in the Beskaragai region near the test site,
which was exposed to particularly high levels of fallout.</TE>
<TE>   Blood was taken from three generations; all members of the oldest
generation were alive at the time of the most contaminating blasts.</TE>
<TE>   Dubrova and colleagues analyzed eight small pieces of DNA in the
grandparents, children and grandchildren to see if any mutations had
occurred and had been passed on to the next generation.</TE>
<TE>   For comparison, the scientists also studied 28 three-generation
families living in a similar rural region of Kazakhstan that had not been
exposed to fallout.</TE>
<TE>   The grandparents exposed to radiation passed on almost twice as many
mutations to their children as did the grandparents from the unexposed
area, the scientists found.</TE>
<TE>   The second generation, many of whom had also been exposed to the most
serious blasts, also passed on more mutations than normal.</TE>
<TE>   Dubrova and colleagues also found that the rate of mutations appeared
to be linked to the amount of exposure--implying that the nuclear tests,
and not some other unknown factor, were indeed to blame.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists knowledgeable about the biological effects of radiation
said that the study's findings are significant and important, albeit not
altogether surprising.</TE>
<TE>   "The population was exposed to a pretty high dose of radiation,"
Ullrich said.</TE>
<TE>   The doubled mutation rate fits well, he said, with what has been found
in studies on animals exposed to radiation.</TE>
<TE>   But the medical significance of the types of changes detected by
Dubrova and colleagues is unclear, scientists said. The DNA regions that
were tracked by the team are not in genes but in structures known as
"mini-satellites"--areas of the genome where short bits of DNA are
repeated over and over. Mini-satellites were chosen for the study because
they tend to mutate faster than normal genes.</TE>
<TE>   Changes in mini-satellites are not of themselves likely to be harmful.
"Logic tells you that if you see something going on at one part of the
genome you may also expect the same sort of thing is happening all over
the place," Dubrova said. But, he added "this is only a guess."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists and activists in Russia and Kazakhstan say the many health
problems found in the region do not appear to be going away.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, other studies, including research done on animals exposed to
radiation from the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in
Ukraine, suggest that the effects of radiation can cause rates of
congenital abnormalities to persist through many generations, said Alexei
Yablokov, president of the Ecological Policy Center of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   In lab experiments, scientists have detected a genetic instability
that persists over many generations, said Tom Hei, professor of radiation
oncology and public health at Columbia University. The cause is not well
understood.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it is true that now the rate of inherited mutations is
declining, but the research I conducted with my colleagues and the
situation around Semipalatinsk testing grounds is far from being anywhere
normal," Dyusembayeva said.</TE>

<HD>Setbacks at Afghan Tunnel Added to Blizzard Problems</HD>
<DH>Asia: Traffic had been backed up even before the deadly snowfall,
and the passage's avalanche protection structures are in dire need of
repair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>It was an accident waiting to happen.</LD>
<LD>   The strategic Salang Tunnel in northern Afghanistan had been reopened
only a few weeks, a symbol of the reunion of the war-divided country,
before the fatal avalanche struck Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Traffic through the tunnel had already started backing up a few days
before, as the snow began to fall high in the Hindu Kush mountains. With
no money coming in to fuel the only snowplow for the area, the plow's
operator had been begging, car to car, for gas to continue clearing the
road, civil servant Mohammed Mukhtar said in Kabul, the capital. Mukhtar,
35, oversees the many private transport vehicles that travel from Kabul
to the northern part of the country via the tunnel.</LD>
<TE>   Making matters worse, most of the avalanche protection structures that
hang over the road leading to and from the tunnel had been destroyed by
years of fighting.</TE>
<TE>   So when the blizzard sent snow cascading down the mountain just south
of the tunnel, trapping scores of cars, the Afghan government turned to
international aid groups for help.</TE>
<TE>   They rushed to the scene, rescuing 300 people trapped in 57 vehicles.
Five people died, including two children. Three of the victims apparently
were asphyxiated inside the tunnel as drivers kept their car engines
running to stay warm, U.N. spokesman Yusuf Hassan said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Seven others were seriously injured and evacuated to Kabul. All the
victims appeared to be Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   It took rescuers about 12 hours to reach the first cars, fighting
blinding snow and biting temperatures as low as 40 degrees below zero.
The tunnel is the highest in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the first group on the scene, HALO Trust, happened to be
relatively close by, albeit for not-so-happy reasons: The area is loaded
with land mines, which the group clears. The tunnel used to mark the
dividing line between Northern Alliance-held territory to the north and
Taliban-held land to the south.</TE>
<TE>   For fear of land mines, the rescue vehicles couldn't leave the
pavement, making it all the more difficult to get through.</TE>
<TE>   Also lending a hand were about 160 members of the multinational
peacekeeping mission, the International Security Assistance Force, which
is helping to police Kabul. The force sent ambulances, medics and
soldiers to the Hindu Kush pass to assist, mission spokesman Jonathan
Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   As of Thursday night, Turner said, the men were still trying to help
those trapped farther south on the road, which was slick with ice. Many
drivers had simply abandoned their vehicles and were being picked up and
taken to warm, dry places.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't clear when the road will reopen. Even before the avalanche,
traffic was allowed to travel only one way each day so that in case of an
accident or bad weather, the second lane would allow rescue vehicles to
pass.</TE>
<TE>   For at least two years, the tunnel was only passable on foot. Those
wishing to travel to the north had to get out of their cars, walk 40
minutes through the tunnel to the other side and somehow procure another
vehicle there.</TE>
<TE>   After the fall of the Taliban late last year, Afghans, with the help
of Russians, repaired the Soviet-built tunnel, reopening it with great
fanfare Jan. 19.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday afternoon, dozens of passengers were stuck in northwest
Kabul waiting near the capital's transportation hub, frustrated in their
attempts to head north. All around, stalls were selling items ranging
from meat to auto parts. Boys carried around batteries, selling "jumps"
for those that wouldn't start.</TE>
<TE>   The small hotels around the transportation hub for the north were
full, said Mukhtar, the government worker. Women in particular were
having a difficult time finding places to sleep, because most hotels
don't allow them to take a room, especially if they are unaccompanied.</TE>

<HD>Philippines to Restrict U.S. Troops</HD>
<DH>Asia: Manila says Americans training soldiers to fight Muslim
extremists will stay at camps and won't patrol.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MANILA
</DL>
<LD>U.S. military advisors training Philippine soldiers to fight
against the Abu Sayyaf Muslim extremist group will remain at heavily
guarded field camps with little chance of coming under fire, Philippine
army officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Gen. Diomedio Villanueva, the army chief of staff, said the U.S.
troops will accompany Philippine officers and provide advice at tactical
headquarters during the six-month mission.</LD>
<LD>   "They will not be permitted to patrol," Villanueva told a Philippine
Senate inquiry probing allegations that the joint exercise violates a
constitutional clause limiting the presence and activities of foreign
troops. "My guidance is that they will not join combat operations."</LD>
<TE>   Vice President Teofisto Guingona also outlined the terms for the
exercise that were drafted by the Philippine government but not yet
approved by the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Although the mission formally began last week with a ceremony,
training on the southern island of Basilan--an Abu Sayyaf base--will not
begin until the U.S. approves the terms, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The draft gives the Philippine government command of the exercise,
bars U.S. troops from combat operations, fixes the U.S. presence at a
maximum of 660 soldiers, prohibits permanent U.S. military facilities,
and limits training to Basilan island and the nearby city of Zamboanga on
Mindanao island, where most of the U.S. soldiers are staying.</TE>
<TE>   It also states that the mission can last no longer than six months and
allows the Americans to fire back in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Guingona said self-defense must be "proportionate to the threat, and
the right to self-defense ends when there is no more threat."</TE>
<TE>   The United States has reportedly objected to any terms that could give
a foreign government authority over U.S. troops and to a strict limit on

<TE>   On Wednesday, Brig. Gen. Donald Wurster, senior officer for the more
than 260 U.S. military personnel already in the Philippines for the
exercise, said his troops are ready to take casualties to help vanquish
the Abu Sayyaf, which has abducted Martin and Gracia Burnham of Wichita,
Kan.</TE>
<TE>   About 160 U.S. Special Forces soldiers are expected to travel to
Basilan, where about 100 Abu Sayyaf members are believed to be holding
the Burnhams.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the U.S. mission have said conflict in the southern
Philippines, a hotbed of Muslim separatism, could escalate if U.S. troops

<HD>Committee Starts to Organize Grand Afghan Council</HD>
<DH>Politics: Preparations begin for a loya jirga, at which ethnic,
regional and religious leaders will select a transitional government this
spring.</DH>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A 21-member commission charged with organizing a loya jirga, or
grand council, formally convened Thursday in this capital, with interim
Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai offering best wishes.</LD>
<LD>   "Do good work," Karzai told the panel members and an audience of
diplomats attending the ceremony. "God bless you, and be successful."</LD>
<LD>   The panel is led by Ismail Kassim Yar, an expert in constitutional
law. Notable members include women's rights activist Soraya Parlika. It
has already held several informal sessions, but Thursday's ceremony
marked the official start of its work.</LD>
<TE>   Karzai called the undertaking an important step in Afghanistan's
transition to democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "We want Afghanistan to have a better future--that's your job," he
said. The commission, he said, "must make sure the Afghan common man gets
his representation in the loya jirga."</TE>
<TE>   The nation's ethnic, regional and religious groups will participate in
the council. They will choose a transitional government to rule for 18
months in the run-up to elections. The council must convene before the
interim government's six-month term expires in June.</TE>
<TE>   Having a council select the transitional government was approved at a
power-sharing summit held in Germany last year, which also paved the way
for the creation of Karzai's government.</TE>
<TE>   Some fear that the council could become a lightning rod for
Afghanistan's many tribal and regional rivalries.</TE>
<TE>   The loya jirga is expected to be convened by Afghanistan's exiled
monarch, Mohammad Zaher Shah. The last council he convened was in the
1960s, and many Afghans regard it as the last legitimate one, despite
attempts to hold councils in the 1980s and 1990s.</TE>

<DL>TEHRAN
</DL>
<LD>Iran has detained a number of non-Afghan Taliban supporters caught
trying to cross its territory and may put them on trial, Intelligence and
Security Minister Ali Yunesi said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Yunesi did not specify how many Taliban supporters Iran is holding,
but he said none are members of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
network, which is blamed for the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials have accused Iran of seeking to destabilize
Afghanistan's new interim government and of harboring Afghan
militants--charges that Iran vehemently denies.</LD>
<TE>   Yunesi said the men were caught near where the borders of Iran,
Afghanistan and Pakistan meet. They were headed for a third country,
which the minister did not identify.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, we arrested them, and we'll either try them in Iran or
do whatever international law calls for," Yunesi said on state radio.</TE>

<HD>Raid Killed 7 Al Qaeda Suspects, Afghan Says</HD>
<DH>War: U.S. confirms the attack but not the toll. Franks says much
work remains for troops.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A missile fired by a CIA-operated drone aircraft in eastern
Afghanistan killed seven suspected members of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
terrorist network, an Afghan leader said Thursday. Bin Laden was not
among the dead, the official said.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. official acknowledged the attack but said it was uncertain
whether it killed any leaders of Al Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   No mention of the attack was made during an appearance before the
Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday by the U.S. war commander,
Gen. Tommy Franks. The general told panel members that much remains to be
done in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   In eastern Afghanistan, Wazir Khan, a brother of regional warlord
Bacha Khan, said bad weather in the mountainous region in Paktia province
had hampered efforts to get to the attack site. He said seven people were
killed in the attack Monday but that "Osama is not among those people." A
U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least one
person was killed, possibly a top Al Qaeda figure.</TE>
<TE>   In his Senate testimony, Franks said the U.S. military will play a
role in creating an Afghan national army, but that does not mean American
troops will become part of an international peacekeeping force there.</TE>
<TE>   Franks said much work remains to be done by the U.S. military in the
country, including the review of documents and other evidence found at
sites suspected of being involved in the development of chemical,
biological or nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Franks said he will not recommend to President Bush that U.S. military
operations in Afghanistan be phased out "as long as there is a credible
threat from puddles or pockets of Al Qaeda or residual hard-core Taliban"
forces.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners arrived from Afghanistan at a
special U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Thursday, two
weeks after the Pentagon suspended flights as it built more space for
prisoners.</TE>

<HD>Red Cross Shifts, Rejects Pioneering Stem Cell Grant</HD>
<DH>Science: A distaste for controversy leads the group to turn down
money it applied for, some experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In an unexpected twist to the stem cell controversy, the American
Red Cross has decided to turn down what would have been the first federal
grant devoted to research using stem cells from human embryos.</LD>
<LD>   The decision suggested that stem cell research, widely touted as the
greatest hope for new cures for disease, has become so controversial that
some major research institutions might be scared away, research advocates
said.</LD>
<LD>   After a bitter debate over the morality of the research, the
government has finally cleared the way for scientists to receive federal
money for stem cell experiments this year. However, the promise of the
research depends on scientists stepping forward to apply for the grants,
advocates for the work said.</LD>
<TE>   A Red Cross scientist applied for a grant last year, and the National
Institutes of Health announced Thursday morning that it was the first
award to be approved. But Thursday afternoon, the Red Cross said it had
decided not to accept the grant in order to focus on other areas of
research.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jerry Squires, chief scientific officer at the charity's
biomedical division, said the decision was based on new scientific
priorities and had nothing to do with a desire to avoid controversy that
might scare away donors.</TE>
<TE>   But some research groups said they feared the reversal was due to
other reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you can assume from this decision that the political debate
has a chilling effect on scientific pursuits," said Sean Tipton,
spokesman for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. "If you
depend on funding from the goodwill of politicians or the goodwill of the
public, then you stay away from controversy."</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Mazzaschi, assistant vice president for biomedical research at
the Assn. of American Medical Colleges, said it was "a rare event" for a
research group to turn down a grant after asking for it. "I find it very
disturbing, because it sends a bad message," he said. "The winds may have
shifted at the Red Cross, but the needs of patients and researchers to
cure disease have not."</TE>
<TE>   The research is controversial because human embryos must be destroyed
to obtain the stem cells, which are medically valuable and may guide
researchers to new cures for disease. Some large charities, such as the
American Heart Assn., have decided not to give prominent support to the
research, fearing that it will anger donors. Some observers say the Red
Cross already faces a risk to its donor base, thanks to widespread
criticism of its handling of blood and monetary donations after the Sept.
11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists and patient groups mounted a massive lobbying campaign last
year to persuade President Bush to allow federal funding for the
experiments. In a televised address Aug. 9, Bush said he would allow
federal funds to be used for research using cells from about 60 embryos
that had already been destroyed at private laboratories. But Bush said
the government would not fund any research that requires new embryos to
be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the NIH said it had approved a $50,000 grant on Jan. 15
to Robert Hawley, who studies the growth and regulation of blood and
immune cells at a Red Cross laboratory in Rockville, Md.</TE>
<TE>   Hawley already has an NIH grant to study how blood stem cells--the
precursors to blood and immune-system cells--are produced in mice.
Squires said the grant totaled at least $1 million. The additional grant
was to allow him to do similar work with human cells.</TE>
<TE>   The grant would have marked the first time federal money had gone to
research that depended on the destruction of human embryos. But Hawley
would not have worked with embryos himself. He planned to obtain stem
cells from WiCell Research Institute Inc. of Wisconsin, which had
dissected human embryos to produce stem cells before Aug. 9, in
accordance with Bush's policy.</TE>
<TE>   Squires said Hawley had requested the grant last summer. But in late
July or August, Squires became chief scientific officer and charted a new
direction for the research group, Squires said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Squires said he wants Hawley and other researchers to focus on stem
cells from umbilical cord blood, which can help people with leukemia,
certain metabolic diseases and those who are undergoing chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   "We really need to focus our resources, our attention, on those areas
where we could most likely provide, in the shortest period of time, some
therapies for patients," Squires said. "And since we already had a very
strong program in cord blood research and were already providing some
therapies in that area, it seemed appropriate to me to enhance our
abilities in that area."</TE>
<TE>   Squires said that in Hawley, the Red Cross was already making a
substantial effort to understand how blood stem cells arise in the bodies
of mice. But for Hawley to begin working with human cells "gets us into a
different area using different kinds of cells."</TE>
<TE>   "Human embryonic stem cells have the capacity to fray and disperse our
focus. . . . It isn't fitting with our mission," Squires said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision appeared to take the NIH by surprise. Dr. Wendy Baldwin,
an NIH official responsible for grants to off-campus researchers, said
early Thursday afternoon that the Red Cross grant showed that the agency
was "making real progress" at implementing the stem cell policy Bush
outlined in August.</TE>
<TE>   "We've made our first award. . . . I am very pleased at how this has
gone on," Baldwin said, apparently unaware of the Red Cross reversal.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for several research groups said the Red Cross
decision did not suggest a lack of enthusiasm for stem cell research
among scientists. NIH spokeswoman Anne Thomas said Thursday evening: "We
have a funding process in place. Scientists know how to use that process,
and we're looking forward to funding research along these lines."</TE>

<HD>Senate Votes to Cap Farm Subsidies</HD>
<DH>Congress: Measure aims to help smaller family operations and take
the wealthy off the dole.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In an effort to rein in large payments to corporate agriculture,
the Senate voted Thursday to cap annual federal subsidies at $275,000 per
farm family.</LD>
<LD>   The amendment--approved on a voice vote after an effort to derail it
was defeated, 66 to 31--also would make the nation's richest farmers
ineligible for federal crop support.</LD>
<LD>   The amendment represents an effort by senators to target assistance to
small and mid-size family farms, as well as to change the image of
agriculture subsidies, which have become increasingly viewed as another
form of corporate welfare.</LD>
<TE>   "Capping farm payments will restore integrity to farm programs," said
Sen. Charles. E. Grassley (R-Iowa), one of the amendment's authors.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate also heeded a request from President Bush and voted to
restore food stamp benefits to legal immigrants who have been in the
country at least five years.</TE>
<TE>   The votes came as part of the debate on a five-year farm bill that
would undo a 1996 law that aimed to wean farmers off federal subsidies.
Overall, the bill would expand federal financial support for farmers,
many of whom have been struggling through tough economic times for years,
and would increase agriculture funding by $45 billion over five years.</TE>
<TE>   A final vote on the Senate bill is expected next week.</TE>
<TE>   A bill passed by the House last year would almost double the payments
to farmers allowed under the Senate version. If the Senate bill passes,
lawmakers will have to work out differences between the two versions
before sending the legislation to the president.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's debate, senators from the South fiercely fought the
amendment to cap crop subsidies, saying it would devastate farmers in the
region who have had to enlarge their operations to remain competitive in
a global market.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know what this farm bill says to the South? 'Hold still,
little catfish, all I'm going to do is just gut you,' " said Sen. Zell
Miller (D-Ga.).</TE>
<TE>   "Farmers need more support and higher prices because their costs are
forever rising," said Sen. Blanche Lambert Lincoln (D-Ark.). "Farmers are
going out of business, and rural towns are heading for the abyss."</TE>
<TE>   Some California crop associations lobbied the state's two
senators--Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, both Democrats--to oppose
the amendment. The lobbyists argued that it would hurt the state's large
agricultural enterprises, such as rice producers, which rely heavily on
subsidies. But Boxer and Feinstein voted against the effort to derail the
amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment establishes an annual limit of $275,000 in subsidies to
a couple working a farm. In an effort to stop subsidies for wealthy
individuals who have so-called hobby farms, it requires that an owner
actively manage or work a farm to qualify for subsidies. It also bans
subsidies for individuals with incomes exceeding $2.5 million three years
in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "There have to be limits," said Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.). "If not,
we are going to allow people to make millions off of these programs."</TE>
<TE>   The amendment was accepted despite Congress' usual reticence about
capping subsidies. Support was spurred by a Web site that listed names of
those who have received farm subsidies, set up by the Environmental
Working Group, a Washington-based watchdog organization.</TE>
<TE>   Recipients of hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal farm
payments over recent years have included such Fortune 500 companies as
Chevron Corp. and International Paper Co., and wealthy urbanites
including Charles Schwab, who heads a nationwide brokerage firm, lives in
San Francisco and owns a rice and cotton farm in Northern California's
Glenn County, according to the database.</TE>
<TE>   "This vote showed the power of information can energize citizens to
overcome special interests," said Ken Cook, president of Environmental
Working Group.</TE>
<TE>   The funds saved by the new restrictions, $1.3 billion over 10 years,
would be used to extend eligibility for food stamps, particularly for
low-income families with high rent costs.</TE>
<TE>   The food stamp amendment approved Thursday would revise a portion of
the 1996 Welfare Reform Act. Under that law, most legal immigrants were
prohibited from receiving food stamps.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Congress restored benefits for some of those affected by
the law, such as children and the elderly who arrived in the country
before the act went into effect. The amendment would expand eligibility
to legal immigrants who have lived in the U.S. five years.</TE>
<TE>   "Making this change is the right and the humane thing to do," said
Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.).</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists also praised the amendment because, in another
provision, it would seek to remove the incentive for landowners to
convert grasslands to cultivated fields by barring farmers from receiving
subsidies on such fields. In part because of the lure of federal
subsidies, farmers plowed 22 million acres of grasslands from 1982 to
1997 to grow crops.</TE>

<LD>A judge entered a not guilty plea for Vincent Gigante on charges
that the convicted Mafia boss, known as the "Oddfather" for behavior such
as walking city streets in a bathrobe, was running the Genovese crime
family from prison.</LD>
<LD>   Gigante's attorney, Gary Greenwald, told a Brooklyn federal court that
his client was unable to enter a plea "because of his state of mind."
Greenwald indicated he would seek a hearing to determine his client's
competence to stand trial.</LD>
<LD>   The government has argued that Gigante feigned mental illness to delay
prosecution. Gigante is serving a 12-year sentence for a 1997
racketeering conviction.</LD>

<HD>Bush Blesses Charity Plan</HD>
<DH>Giving: A bipartisan coalition of senators renames the initiative
for faith-based social services and limits its scope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A coalition of Democratic and Republican senators won White House
support Thursday for a compromise version of President Bush's proposal to
give religious groups a bigger role--and more federal aid--in providing
social services.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement revives the plan, which stalled last year in the Senate.
Its passage would put in place one of Bush's domestic priorities, one of
the first he advanced after his inauguration.</LD>
<LD>   The program has a new name that tones down its religious aspect. What
the White House originally called the Faith-Based Initiative has become
the Armies of Compassion Initiative. And it has a more modest reach.
Rather than being open-ended, most of its provisions would have a
two-year life unless renewed.</LD>
<TE>   The compromise proposal also eliminates controversial elements of the
plan that passed the House last year on a largely party-line vote.</TE>
<TE>   The House measure would exempt religion-based programs from civil
rights laws and would let them make personnel decisions, based on
religion, in programs operating with federal assistance. They would be
exempt from local laws protecting the rights of gays and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   Those elements are not included in the Senate measure.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. (R-Okla.), sponsor of the measure that the House
approved, called the Senate proposal a "good start." He called for
greater leeway for religious organizations but said he is confident that
differences between the Senate measure, if approved, and the House
legislation can be overcome.</TE>
<TE>   During a photo session in the Oval Office with the senators who helped
negotiate the compromise, Bush said: "This legislation will not only
provide a way for government to encourage faith-based programs to exist
without breaching the separation of church and state, it will also
encourage charitable giving as well."</TE>
<TE>   He called the measure "a big step" toward harnessing the nation's
compassionate nature.</TE>
<TE>   The measure is intended to allow religious organizations to use
federal support to take part in such activities as tutoring, helping the
homeless, helping the families of prisoners and meeting other social
needs without running afoul of the constitutional prohibition on the
mingling of religion and government.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said the measure "breaks
down barriers where the federal government previously did not provide
help to community or faith-based groups that were doing good works in
their neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would allow groups receiving federal aid to display
religious symbols on walls or use religious phrases in their names. That
sparked criticism from the Rev. Barry Lynn of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State.</TE>
<TE>   "It is simply wrong for a publicly funded job-training facility to
post a banner that reads, 'Only Jesus saves,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several senators said they hope the measure will help overcome what
some are calling a crisis among smaller charities. The agencies have
reported a slump in gifts after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks because
many donors are contributing to charities created to help the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Catholic Charities, for example, reported in December that
contributions in the Los Angeles metropolitan area had declined 50% to
60% since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials and the senators said one of the measure's key
elements would let people who do not itemize deductions on their income
tax returns to deduct up to $400 in charitable contributions--or $800 for
those filing joint returns--in 2002 and 2003. The administration says
approximately 75% of taxpayers do not itemize deductions.</TE>
<TE>   This provision, administration officials said, would encourage
charitable deductions among a wide swath of low- and moderate-income
people.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), a chief sponsor of the bill, said,
"That should unleash billions of dollars of charitable giving."</TE>
<TE>   Another leading sponsor is Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.).</TE>
<TE>   Under Senate projections, the measure would cost the federal treasury
from $11 billion to $13 billion, most of it through the tax deductions.
The White House put the cost at $10 billion to $12 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Among other provisions, the legislation would increase the tax breaks
for corporate donations to charities. It also would allow donations from
individual retirement accounts without tax penalties after the taxpayer
reaches age 67.</TE>

<HD>Florida Investigating Enron Stock Purchases in Pension Fund</HD>
<DH>Probe: Money manager continued buying shares in the ill-fated
energy firm despite accounting disclosures, leading to $325 million in
losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stung by $325 million in Enron-related losses, Florida lawmakers
Thursday began examining why the state's pension fund kept buying the
ill-fated energy stock late last year despite signs that the company was
in deep trouble.</LD>
<LD>   The fund's Enron loss is the largest for any governmental agency, and
Florida officials are especially interested in the actions of money
manager Alfred Harrison of Alliance Capital Management Corp., who bought
2.7 million shares of Enron stock for the pension system in October and
November. The purchases came as the share price dropped from $22 to $9,
Enron disclosed huge losses and federal regulators started a probe.</LD>
<LD>   Harrison has business ties to an Enron board member, prompting
lawmakers to wonder whether the connection influenced the purchases, said
Rep. Mark Flanagan, a Republican from Bradenton who chairs the 10-member
select House Banking Committee, which is holding hearings on the pension
system. Flanagan said he also wants to question whether Harrison was
dumping Enron stock from a private mutual fund he controlled at the same
time he was loading up on Enron for the state. The questions were
prompted by Alliance Capital's financial reports.</LD>
<TE>   "We are very concerned about the actions of this investment manager
and what appears to be a major conflict of interest," said Flanagan, who
also is an investment advisor.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody, even the little old lady who dabbles in buying and selling
stock, knew that Enron was in big trouble," Flanagan said. Harrison could
not be reached for comment. A spokesman for New York-based Alliance
Capital said the firm was fooled by the company's glowing financial
statements.</TE>
<TE>   "We believed Enron's management and we believed they audited their
financial statements and obviously, it appears that neither of them were
accurate," spokesman John Meyers said. "It seems clear that like a lot of
other investors, we were misled."</TE>
<TE>   Meyers said it was "absolutely untrue" that Harrison was dumping Enron
for his private clients while purchasing it for the state. Even with the
Enron losses, Harrison earned a 1,513% return over 17 years as a money
manager for the pension fund--better than the 997% return of the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 over the same period, Meyers said.</TE>
<TE>   The select committee held its first hearing Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to uncover any inadequacies of the Florida retirement
system and whether anybody is to recover the $325 million and put it
back," Flanagan said.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida loss amounts to only one-half of 1% of the pension fund
and doesn't threaten the savings or retirement for 650,000 state
government workers, officials said. Still, the Enron transactions have
sent waves of consternation through Tallahassee, the state capital.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the size of the loss, state officials have petitioned to
become the lead plaintiff in a massive civil suit filed against Enron in
Houston. The state attorney general has issued subpoenas to Alliance
Capital as part of an Enron-related racketeering investigation, and Gov.
Jeb Bush has suggested filing a civil suit against the investment firm.
Harrison was fired as a contract money manager handling a $3.3-billion
slice of the $92-billion fund.</TE>
<TE>   Although Florida sustained the largest single Enron-related
governmental loss, it isn't alone. The University of California is out
nearly $145 million from the Enron collapse, as are the pension plans for
Georgia ($127 million), Ohio ($114 million) and New York ($110 million).</TE>
<TE>   According to State Board of Allocation records, Harrison began buying
Enron stock in November 2000, when shares topped $82. The purchases
continued through 2001, unabated by the sudden resignation of Chief
Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling in mid-August.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1.4 million shares were purchased in October, after Enron
reported a $638-million loss for the third quarter and disclosed a
$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity. The purchases also came
after the company disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry
and as share prices slid from $22.82 to $12.23.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison bought an additional 1 million shares in November--days after
Enron had shocked Wall Street by disclosing it had overstated earnings by
$586 million since 1997. By then, the share price was lingering at $9.</TE>
<TE>   During the two months, Harrison collected more than $110,000 in
commissions before selling the retirement system's 7.6 million shares, at
28 cents each, on Nov. 30. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection two days later.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison's purchases accounted for about $284 million of the
retirement system's $325-million loss from Enron, records indicate. Other
managers also made investments for the system.</TE>
<TE>   The sell-off and loss spurred Board of Administration officials to
hold a Dec. 11 meeting with Harrison, who said he "made a judgment and he
was wrong," according to notes taken from the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison told officials that, in hindsight, Skilling's resignation was
a turning point for Enron but said he continued to buy the stock because
he believed the company was fundamentally sound. During the final days,
he hoped a merger with Dynegy Inc. would turn things around. "If the
Dynegy deal had gone through, they would have made a killing," the
meeting notes say.</TE>
<TE>   But Dynegy backed out of the merger, and Harrison sold the pension
system's shares rather than risk getting nothing through bankruptcy, the
notes say. Harrison said he was pleasantly surprised to get 28 cents a
share "because at the time he though we might get 10 cents the way things
were going," the notes say.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison agreed that the investment was a "blot on his record," and
Board of Administration officials terminated his contract Dec. 13. "His
performance had been steadily declining, but Enron was the straw that
broke the camel's back," said Lee Baldwin, the board's investment
communications manager.</TE>
<TE>   During the meeting, Harrison also faced questions about whether his
ties to Enron board member Fred Savage affected his decision to buy the
company stock.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison said he didn't realize Savage was on the Enron board until a
few weeks ago and that Savage, who sold life insurance products overseas,
played no role in picking Alliance investments.</TE>

<HD>Former Enron CEO's Decision to Testify a High-Stakes Strategy</HD>
<DH>Law: Experts say Skilling took a risk in discussing his role before
a House panel and denying he knew of events.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Jeffrey K. Skilling's appearance Thursday before a House committee
evoked Sgt. Schultz--the "Hogan's Heroes" TV character who famously
insisted "I know nothing." But legal experts expressed skepticism and
said the former Enron Corp. chief executive took a big gamble by agreeing
to testify.</LD>
<LD>   In testimony, Skilling stressed that he "was not aware of any
financing arrangements designed to conceal liabilities or inflate
profitability" at the company before he resigned Aug. 14.</LD>
<LD>   He said he did not recall key details of the off-the-books
partnerships that helped trigger Enron's collapse when their losses were
disclosed.</LD>
<TE>   Skilling's assertion that he was unaware of the company's underlying
problems came after mounting evidence compiled by congressional
investigators that Enron executives were warned of potential problems.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a major mistake for him to testify, and he painfully proved
it," said T. Gerald Treece, associate dean of South Texas College of Law.
"I'm sure his lawyers were bashing their heads in the wall as he was
talking."</TE>
<TE>   Skilling, Treece said, may have believed he was merely defending
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "But there are real lawyers at the Justice Department and real lawyers
who are civil litigators who now have sworn testimony from him that they
don't have from any of the insiders who took the 5th Amendment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron lawyer Jordan Mintz and Jeffrey McMahon, previously Enron's
treasurer and now its president, testified Thursday that they had alerted
Skilling to trouble in the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   But Skilling, they said, brushed aside their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Grilled about this by the lawmakers, Skilling said he did not receive
a series of memos from Mintz and disputed McMahon's account of a March
2000 meeting in which, McMahon said, he approached Skilling with concerns
about the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Brian O'Neill, a veteran Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer,
indicated that he would have not have let Skilling testify unless there
was an extremely good reason.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't use a strategy like this unless the stakes are pretty high.
The stakes in this case are getting close to life-ending," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   Another longtime Los Angeles lawyer, Mark Geragos, said the success of
an "I didn't know" defense "depends on the document trail."</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, I think he's got a better shot than most because some
of these documents were not signed by him," Geragos said.</TE>
<TE>   In Enron's heyday, Skilling explicitly modeled the company on General
Electric Co., which put him in the role of GE's legendary Jack Welch: the
all-knowing, all-powerful chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   But Skilling gave a contrary impression at least once. Talking in
April 2000 to two University of Virginia business school professors who
were writing a study of Enron, Skilling depicted himself as isolated in
the executive suite.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are closer to the transaction, or closer to the business we're
doing, and have a problem with it, how do you expect me to know what that
problem is? I'm up here in the 50th floor in the library. I have no idea
what's going on down there" in other offices, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling's claim that he was unaware of the financial time bombs was
derided Thursday on Capitol Hill. Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) called
it the "Sgt. Schultz defense: 'I see nothing. I hear nothing.' "</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert R. Whitaker, dean of the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of
Management at Rice University, called the explanation plausible.</TE>
<TE>   "But whether it's believable is another story," he said. "Most chief
executives pretty much have their finger on the pulse of everything
that's critical."</TE>
<TE>   So why did Skilling, unlike four of his former colleagues, testify?</TE>
<TE>   Treece had an explanation: "He thought he could talk his way through
this."</TE>

<HD>Baxter 'Heartbroken' by Events, Skilling Testifies</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Ex-Enron CEO breaks his composure discussing colleague who
committed suicide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With Enron Corp. insiders facing angry accusations from members of
Congress and others for apparently walking away with millions while
ordinary workers lost their life savings, it's not easy to evoke sympathy
for a senior executive.</LD>
<LD>   But there was a moment Thursday when that happened--during a daylong
hearing before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight
and investigations.</LD>
<LD>   It occurred during a bruising question-and-answer session when former
Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling was asked to describe a
conversation with J. Clifford Baxter, the former Enron vice chairman who
reportedly objected to some of the accounting maneuvers that ultimately
pushed the company into bankruptcy.</LD>
<TE>   Baxter, whom Skilling had described as a close friend, shot himself to
death Jan. 25. An autopsy report released this week said that Baxter, who
left Enron in May, had taken a pain reliever, an antidepressant and a
sleeping aid before shooting himself in the right temple.</TE>
<TE>   As Skilling began to answer the question about Baxter's concerns, he
seemed to lose the composure that otherwise characterized his several
hours of testimony. He hesitated, and his voice cracked with emotion.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is anyone who knew Cliff and spent time with
Cliff toward the end that didn't realize--and I don't think this is
betraying any confidence with the family--that didn't realize he was
heartbroken by what had happened," he told the committee.</TE>
<TE>   "He believed that his reputation, my reputation, the reputation of the
board of directors . . . were ruined by what had happened to the
company--and the treatment of what had happened to the company by the
press."</TE>
<TE>   Baxter, 43, spent a decade at Enron during the years it grew from a
middling operator of natural gas pipelines into the seventh-largest U.S.
company. Baxter zoomed up through the company behind Skilling, who
resigned as Enron's CEO in August for unexplained personal reasons.</TE>
<TE>   A former Air Force captain, Baxter cashed out $28 million in stock
gains from the sale of nearly 800,000 Enron shares from 1998 to early
2001, according to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics.</TE>
<TE>   "He believed, as I believe, that we had created a great company . . .
and to have a lifetime of work denigrated as it was in the press was very
painful," Skilling testified.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling paused and addressed an aside to Baxter's wife. "Carol, if
you're out there, I hope you're OK with this," he continued.</TE>
<TE>   He said that Baxter came over to his house about a week before he
died. The two men spent almost three hours talking, and Baxter expressed
deep concerns about his reputation since Enron's collapse.</TE>

<HD>Olympic Torch Sets Town Aglow</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HEBER CITY, Utah
</DL>
<LD>The Olympic flame swept through mountainous, rural Utah on
Thursday, then made a downhill run into the Salt Lake Valley on the eve
of tonight's opening ceremonies of the Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   Despite frigid temperatures, thousands of people, including members of
school and military bands, stood along streets and historic railroad
tracks to greet the flame. Some were so moved by its sight that they
cried, while others cheered loudly and raucously shook cow bells to
signal the torch's arrival.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an absolutely great sight for this valley," said Terry
Shoemaker, superintendent of the Wasatch County school district. "We are
all very patriotic here."</LD>
<TE>   Heber City has about 5,000 people and is situated in the middle of
alpine countryside dotted with horse and cattle farms. The town was a
late entry into the Olympic Games. Soldier Hollow, a rolling and partly
wooded sheep pastureland about 5 miles west of here, was the last of the
venues to be identified for the Winter Games--the site for cross-country
skiing and the biathlon.</TE>
<TE>   Residents have since spruced up the town's main street with banners,
repaired sidewalks and constructed a 15-foot-high caldron in front of
Rocky Mountain Middle School to remind the community of its role in the
Games. The caldron resembles an outdoor patio heater topped with the
Olympic snowflake symbol.</TE>
<TE>   The flame got here from Soldier Hollow by hitching a 20-minute ride in
a caldron atop a railroad flatcar pulled by three century-old steam
engines. At every rural crossing, motorists got out of their vehicles and
lined the tracks, waving not just at the flame but at the various
dignitaries and schoolchildren who were invited to ride on what's
affectionately known here as the Heber Creeper.</TE>
<TE>   When it arrived in town, the flame was transferred to schoolteacher
Mary Clark, who after her 0.2-mile walk passed it on to her daughter,
Celeste Clark, 18, who has Down's syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been preparing to let go of her, and now that she's 18, the fact
that she is carrying the Olympic torch is so very symbolic," the mother
said. "I cried most of the way before I gave the flame to her. I just
kept shouting, 'Go, Celeste, go!' "</TE>
<TE>   The next torchbearer also cried.</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Hardy, 50, another school district employee, said she carried
the flame in memory of her deceased brother, David Simpson, who 20 years
ago campaigned for freestyle skiing to be included in the Olympics, as it
is now.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the highlight of my life, and emotionally it's hard to talk
about it," Hardy said. "I see the Olympics bringing the nation together,
and for me to have a small part of that is more than I can believe."</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Smith, 46, a horse trainer, said she was thrilled to hear the
whistle of the steam engine, her signal to drop everything and watch the
flame pass. "What it tells me is that the Olympics are really here! It
came from Greece and now it's going through our town!"</TE>
<TE>   Into the dark and cold of night, the flame was being carried toward a
downtown park in Salt Lake City, where city officials hosted a free
festival with music and fireworks. Paralympic champion skier Chris
Waddell ignited a caldron in downtown Salt Lake to trigger the fireworks
before tens of thousands of people.</TE>
<TE>   The torch relay was launched Dec. 4 from Atlanta, the last U.S. host
of the Olympic Games, and covered 13,500 miles in 46 states. About 11,500
torchbearers were selected through contests, lotteries, nominations and
corporate sponsors. The flame also traveled by automobile, airplane, dog
sled, skier, sleigh, snowmobile, ice skater and covered wagon.</TE>

<HD>As World Stage Awaits, Curtain of Haze Drops on Salt Lake City</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>It's all here for Olympic visitors to view: an impressive downtown
skyline and an equally stunning ring of snowy mountains. If only they
were visible.</LD>
<LD>   Just when civic boosters hoped that the host city would sparkle, the
meteorological phenomenon known as "temperature inversion" hit town. The
condition has gripped the Salt Lake basin for more than a week--trapping
frigid air and pollution into a murky mass of cold and foul air. The
inversion has enveloped the region in a viscous haze that has obscured
the city's pride and joy, its view of the magnificent Wasatch Range.</LD>
<LD>   The filmy outlook is made up of fog, haze and pollution--with a strong
dollop of arctic air. It's not common this late in the season, and it has
made for a less-than-welcoming atmosphere for thousands of international
visitors: Air quality officials issued alerts for four consecutive days
this week, warning of unhealthful conditions. Those venturing out gird
themselves for daytime temperatures in the teens. The sun has rarely been
glimpsed.</LD>
<TE>   Forecasters are tentatively predicting a storm for the weekend. That
should eliminate the stubborn layer of warm air that acts as a lid on
colder air. A rind of ice and snow on the ground makes it all worse.</TE>
<TE>   The mountains ringing Salt Lake City turn the cold and murky mess into
a dingy blanket covering the city. Such conditions are a regular feature
of mountain cities in winter; Denver is notorious for its "brown cloud."</TE>
<TE>   The severe weather is evidence that these are, indeed, the Winter
Olympics. Officials are warning those attending tonight's opening
ceremony to bundle up. Snow is predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "If you pay $885 for your opening ceremony ticket and go to the
stadium in tennis shoes, you are in trouble," said Olympic organizer Mitt
Romney. "You are going to have to make a decision: Your toes or your
ticket investment. It's not a choice you want to have to make."</TE>
<TE>   Romney made the comments at an unusual news conference in which he
lectured on meteorology and displayed props that included thermal
underwear and heavy boots.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the worst," said Larry Dunn, the meteorologist in charge of
the National Weather Service office here. "If you could think of weather
conditions that would give a visitor the worst impression of Salt Lake,
this is it. If the storms come in as expected, it would be very dramatic.
All of a sudden you would see the Wasatch in all its glory."</TE>
<TE>   Dunn said that inversion normally occurs in December and January and
that the timing and the length of the current condition are atypical. The
region has been hit with an unusually cold and snowy winter: In November,
20 feet of snow fell in Cottonwood Canyon, and 100 inches fell in 100
hours at the Alta ski area, both to the southeast.</TE>
<TE>   Along with trapping cold air, inversion also allows polluted air to
collect, rendering the atmosphere hazy and unhealthful.</TE>
<TE>   Dianne Neilson, executive director of the Utah Department of
Environmental Quality, said her office has issued at least five days of
"red burn" alerts, meaning no wood may be burned in fireplaces or wood
stoves.</TE>
<TE>   She has also issued an alert in two counties to advise young children
and the elderly to stay indoors and for healthy individuals to limit
strenuous outside activity.</TE>
<TE>   All of which could be problematic for the thousands of
high-performance endurance athletes here. Anyone with asthma or a
respiratory condition--even a cold--is susceptible to the crummy air.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Dan Carr, head physician for the U.S. Olympic Team, is well versed
in the vagaries of Salt Lake's climate. He was a self-described ski bum
here before attending medical school and later served his surgical
internship here.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm aware of inversion, and at this stage we are not concerned," Carr
said. He pointed out that many Olympic events take place out of the
valley murk and in the mountains where the air is thin but clear. Those
athletes competing in Salt Lake do so indoors, where air is filtered.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the picture anyone here wanted to present to the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gross and I hate it," said Liz Fitzgerald, who works at a local
deli. "It's too bad this is what people think Salt Lake looks like. If
they can see it."</TE>

<HD>2 Men Charged After 4 Freed in Homicide</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Two men have been charged with killing a medical student in 1986, a
crime that four other men spent years in jail for before they were
exonerated last year, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Duane Roach, 46, and Eddie Harris, 38, were arrested Monday in
Chicago. It was not immediately clear whether they had attorneys.</LD>
<LD>   Cook County prosecutor Dick Devine said police immediately began
investigating the case anew after DNA evidence cleared the other four and
charges were dropped in December.</LD>
<TE>   "We owe no less to the community and to the family of Lori Roscetti,"
Devine said. "We are satisfied that these two individuals are
responsible."</TE>
<TE>   He said a witness tipped authorities to Roach and Harris, but he
refused to release further details.</TE>
<TE>   Roscetti, 23, was abducted as she drove home from school after a night
of studying. Police say she was taken to a railroad trestle and was
sexually assaulted, kicked and bludgeoned to death with a chunk of
concrete.</TE>
<TE>   The four men cleared in the case--Marcellius Bradford, Omar Saunders,
Larry Ollins and his cousin Calvin Ollins--have sued police, prosecutors
and crime lab workers who convicted them. Three of the men spent more
than 14 years in prison and were serving sentences of life without
parole; Bradford served more than six years after testifying against the
others in what he said was a deal made to spare him a life term.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the initial investigation linking the men to
Roscetti's slaying was based on the best evidence available. A crime lab
analyst testified that semen found on Roscetti's body could have belonged
to the men.</TE>
<TE>   But a DNA expert later found that none of the four men had a blood
type matching the samples. DNA tests ordered last spring found that hairs
and semen stains on Roscetti's jacket were not from any of the
defendants.</TE>

<HD>Appeals Court Nominee Faces Trouble Over Cross-Burning Case</HD>
<DH>Senate: Mississippi judge lobbied Justice Dept. for a lighter
sentence for one defendant in the 1994 incident, panel finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush's nomination of a Mississippi trial judge to the
U.S. Court of Appeals ran into trouble Thursday when Senate Democrats
revealed that the judge took unusual steps to win a lighter sentence for
a man convicted of burning a cross at the home of a mixed-race couple.</LD>
<LD>   It also was revealed that the nominee, U.S. District Judge Charles
Pickering, an ally of Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), organized a
letter-writing campaign on his own behalf in October.</LD>
<LD>   The judge acknowledged that he asked local lawyers, including those
who appeared before him, to write letters to the Senate in support of his
nomination. The judge said he collected the letters in his chambers and
faxed them to Washington.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't tell them what to say," Pickering said when asked about the
letters during a contentious hearing Thursday before the Senate Judiciary
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite an impressive outpouring of support," said Sen. Russell D.
Feingold (D-Wis.).</TE>
<TE>   But it "creates an appearance of coercion," he added, to have a
powerful trial judge solicit support from local lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Pickering's nomination has emerged as the first
judicial confirmation battle of the Bush administration. In a closely
divided Senate, a series of ideological disagreements over judges is
likely this year.</TE>
<TE>   Pickering was nominated to move up to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of
Appeals in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats still are chafing over the makeup of that court, as
Republicans had refused to hold hearings on three of President Clinton's
nominees to the 5th Circuit. Two were prominent Latino lawyers and one
was African American.</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights and women's rights activists say Pickering, 64, is a
staunch opponent of abortion and has made skeptical comments about
federal laws concerning job discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, Pickering played a key role in getting the Republican
National Convention to adopt a strong anti-abortion stand.</TE>
<TE>   But Pickering said his personal and political views would not affect
his judicial decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's hearing focused instead on the issue of race. Sen. Mitch
McConnell (R-Ky.) praised Pickering for his "moral courage" during the
1960s.</TE>
<TE>   As a young lawyer, Pickering testified against an imperial wizard of
the Ku Klux Klan and worked with the FBI to arrest Klansmen.</TE>
<TE>   "In the mid-1960s, in rural Mississippi, this took courage," McConnell
said.</TE>
<TE>   James Charles Evers, the brother of slain civil rights leader Medgar
Evers, appeared with several African American leaders from Mississippi to
show their support for Pickering.</TE>
<TE>   However, in a surprise development, committee Democrats turned their
attention to the judge's handling of a 1994 cross-burning case.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes before the hearing began, the Justice Department turned over
files compiled during the Clinton administration. They showed that
Pickering was upset about the seven-year sentence proposed for Daniel
Swan, then 20, who drove his pickup to the home of a mixed-race couple
and joined two other men in burning an 8-foot-tall cross. The men also
shouted racial epithets and fired shots into the house. One of the
bullets narrowly missed the couple's baby.</TE>
<TE>   Pickering spoke of Swan's action as a "drunken prank," but he also
called it a "despicable act" that deserved jail time. But the judge
clashed with a Justice Department civil rights lawyer about whether Swan
deserved the seven-year prison term called for by federal sentencing
guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought there was a tremendous disparity," the judge said, because
Swan's co-defendant had pleaded guilty and obtained a minimal sentence.</TE>
<TE>   But he did not stop with expressing his opinion in the courtroom.
According to the files, Pickering met privately with the prosecutors and
threatened to order a new trial unless they agreed to a lesser sentence.</TE>
<TE>   When they refused, Pickering contacted a top Justice Department
official in Washington and said that Atty. Gen. Janet Reno should
intervene.</TE>
<TE>   In pointed questioning, Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) suggested that the
judge appeared to have violated the judicial code of conduct, first by
meeting privately with one side of the case and then by intervening at
the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very much outside the ordinary," Edwards said, based on his
20 years in law practice.</TE>
<TE>   Pickering admitted he had met privately with the lawyers in the case
but said he "had no recollection" of threatening to order a new trial.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not minimize the seriousness of cross-burning," the judge
replied. He finally sentenced Swan to 27 months in prison.</TE>

<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.
</DL>
<LD>President Bush declared a disaster in 33 northern Missouri counties
and 35 counties in Kansas on Thursday to assist in cleanup from last
week's snow and ice storm.</LD>
<LD>   The declaration means individuals in the counties will be eligible for
government assistance. Federal assistance will also be available to state
and local governments in some counties.</LD>
<LD>   Bush issued a disaster declaration for 28 Oklahoma counties last week.</LD>
<TE>   "This assistance will be a tremendous boost for local governments who
have been burdened by the costs of restoring power and stability to the
region," Missouri Republican Sen. Christopher S. Bond said.</TE>
<TE>   The storm was blamed for more than 25 deaths as it crashed through the
southern Plains and stretched to New England.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 412,000 Missouri customers were without electricity,
225,000 homes and businesses were blacked out in Oklahoma and about
435,000 Kansas residents had no power.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri's cleanup cost has been estimated at more than $22 million,
and Kansas officials reported $17 million in damage in two counties
alone.</TE>

<HD>Bush Pressed to Delay Waste Site Approval</HD>
<DH>Nevada: Officials want safety issues resolved before building Yucca
Mountain facility to store spent nuclear fuel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Nevada officials made a last-minute plea Thursday to President
Bush, trying to dissuade him from approving construction of a nuclear
waste site in their state until safety issues are resolved.</LD>
<LD>   "Yucca Mountain should not go forward at this point," Sen. John Ensign
(R-Nev.) said after a 25-minute, closed-door meeting in the Oval Office.</LD>
<LD>   The president gave no indication of how or when he will decide on
whether to move ahead with the site 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, said
Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.).</LD>
<TE>   But the senators and Republican Gov. Kenny Guinn viewed their meeting
as the last chance to get Bush to hold off on any decision.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is expected to decide in favor of the Yucca Mountain site as
early as next week, congressional and administration sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham endorsed the site Jan. 10 but by law
has to wait 30 days to give a formal recommendation to the president.
That waiting period expires Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham called it a "scientifically sound and suitable" place to bury
the nation's used reactor fuel now kept at nuclear power plants.</TE>
<TE>   But Guinn said the group's main pitch to the president was that too
many questions remain unanswered to move ahead now. Any decision, Guinn
said, should be "predicated on sound science that will last for thousands
of years."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jim Gibbons (R-Nev.) said he made essentially the same point at a
morning meeting with Bush senior advisor Karl Rove.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons acknowledged that the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon had clouded the issue. He said that, during the
meeting, Rove said nuclear plant safety and national security
implications are weighing heavily on Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "I said the lack of adequate science should weigh heavily too,"
Gibbons said.</TE>
<TE>   With Nevada officials saying they will try to prevent the shipment of
as much as 77,000 tons of nuclear waste into their state, a final
decision will be up to Congress. Nevada can block a presidential
decision, but Congress could then overrule the state.</TE>
<TE>   Even after a presidential decision, it will be at least 2010 before
the site--once it is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission--would
be ready to take any of the waste now kept in spent fuel pools and
concrete bunkers at nuclear power plants around the country.</TE>

<HD>Cash-Strapped States Favor Cutbacks Over Tax Hikes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Revenues are down and expenses up in almost every state in the
union, but only a handful of statehouses will consider targeted tax
increases to fill the gap, according to a study released Thursday by the
National Conference of State Legislatures.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, state officials are delaying construction projects, tapping
reserves, laying off workers and cutting social services.</LD>
<LD>   The latest figures on the deepening fiscal crisis in the states were
released three days after President Bush presented to Congress a federal
budget proposal that would require some new spending by the states.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday's report shows why officials in California and some other
states doubt whether they will be able to come up with the money needed
to match federal funds even for programs they support, such as
prescription drug coverage for low-income seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Revenues have fallen below projected levels in 45 states and the
District of Columbia, while spending is above budgeted levels in 28
states and the district, according to the survey of state legislative
fiscal directors.</TE>
<TE>   "And for some states, it's going to be even worse next year," said
Corina Eckl, fiscal program director for the conference of legislatures.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, 37 states and the district face budget gaps in fiscal 2003. In
California, where spending is on target but general fund tax collections
for this fiscal year are expected to fall $5.5 billion short, an
$8-billion budget gap is projected for next year.</TE>
<TE>   The legislatures of California, Oregon and Arizona are holding special
budget-cutting sessions this month. Already, 39 states have imposed
budget cuts or spending delays and 25 have tapped their reserve funds.
Thirty states have employed other cost-saving measures, including hiring
freezes, debt refinancing and requiring state employees to pay more of
their health insurance premiums, the survey found.</TE>
<TE>   The most common source of spending overruns is Medicaid, the
state-federal health insurance program for the poor. Increased need and
spiraling health-care costs busted the Medicaid budgets of 28 states,
according to the report, and the federal government expects demand only
to increase.</TE>
<TE>   This year, 39 million Americans were eligible for Medicaid; next year
the number is expected to be 40.4 million--adding still more stress to
state budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Only four states--North Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming--are
expected to meet both their spending and revenue targets this year.</TE>
<TE>   While the budget gaps differ in size from state to state, they are
caused in large part by the same economic cycle.</TE>
<TE>   As early as December 2000, the downturn in the national economy began
generating a decline in state sales tax and income tax collections, which
account for an average two-thirds of state revenues, Eckl said. Then came
the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, "and the bottom fell out," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, corporate layoffs raised demand for state government
services, especially health care and temporary assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The downturn hit states particularly hard because they had already cut
revenues, Eckl noted. Because of tax cuts enacted by every state over the
last seven years, states have lost a total of $35 billion in tax revenue,
Eckl said.</TE>

<HD>Firm Cheney Once Ran Settles Fraud Case</HD>
<DH>Halliburton: Subsidiary Brown &amp; Root, accused of overbilling on Ft.
Ord project, agrees to pay government $2 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A company formerly overseen by Vice President Dick Cheney agreed
Thursday to pay the federal government $2 million to settle allegations
that it engaged in massive overbilling in the closure of the Ft. Ord
military base in the mid-1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Department attorneys alleged that Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, a
subsidiary of Dallas-based energy giant Halliburton Inc., defrauded the
government in its billings for more than 200 job orders during the
closure of the Northern California base.</LD>
<LD>   "Brown &amp; Root failed to deliver what the Army thought it was getting,"
Michael A. Hirst, a federal prosecutor in Sacramento, said in an
interview. "The company exploited the [purchase order] system by
inflating the apparent cost of the projects. In doing so, it increased
its profits at the government's expense."</LD>
<TE>   The Ft. Ord contract became an issue during the 2000 presidential
campaign after The Times disclosed that a federal grand jury was looking
into criminal allegations that Halliburton had engaged in fraud during
the time Cheney served as the firm's chairman and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Although no evidence surfaced to suggest that Cheney knew about the
alleged overbilling, Vice President Al Gore's campaign demanded in
October 2000 that Cheney "answer questions about his company's alleged
rip-off of taxpayers." The Bush-Cheney campaign responded by accusing the
Clinton administration of manipulating the grand jury system for its own
political gain.</TE>
<TE>   The civil settlement reached Thursday between Kellogg Brown &amp; Root and
the Justice Department appears to head off any further criminal
investigation into the case.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's office could not be reached for comment. Halliburton denied
any wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "Although it believes that it properly administered the contract at
Ft. Ord, Kellogg Brown &amp; Root settled the lawsuit in order to resolve
this matter and to avoid further litigation," Halliburton said in a
prepared statement. "It expects to continue its work as a major
contractor to the United States government in numerous projects."</TE>
<TE>   The allegations in the case first surfaced several years ago when
Dammen Gant Campbell, a former contracts manager for Brown &amp; Root
Services Corp., turned whistle-blower, charging that his firm had engaged
in a massive scheme to fabricate its billings. He alleged that the firm
promised to use high-quality goods in closing the Ft. Ord base and
converting it to government and civilian use, but instead substituted
products of lower quality.</TE>
<TE>   As a whistle-blower in a government fraud case, Gant will receive
between 15% and 30% of the $2-million settlement, with the final amount
still to be determined, said his attorney, Daniel P. Schrader of
Monterey.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, I'm very happy with the settlement," Schrader said. Justice
Department attorneys "did a good job of carrying this through to
closure."</TE>
<TE>   Schrader alleged that the overbilling amounted to as much as $6
million--much more than the Justice Department's calculation. Still,
Schrader said, "this is a fairly reasonable compromise."</TE>

<HD>Budget Plan Sparks Fire Between Sen. Byrd, Treasury Secretary</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Tensions between Congress and the White House over the president's
budget exploded Thursday when a debate over congressional prerogatives
turned into an unusually bitter and personal exchange involving two of
Washington's most powerful figures: Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.) and
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill.</LD>
<LD>   The spat rocked an otherwise routine Senate Budget Committee hearing,
where the normal dance of senatorial courtesy--and polite groveling by
administration witnesses--suddenly vanished. O'Neill, telling Byrd he
wouldn't "cede to you the high moral ground of not knowing what life is
like in a ditch," seemed to struggle with his emotions by often taking
deep breaths.</LD>
<LD>   Byrd, 84, chairs the powerful Appropriations Committee and is arguably
the fiercest defender of Congress' interests. He spent 15 minutes
berating O'Neill, a straight-talking former corporate executive, for a
speech the secretary made last year asserting that congressional rules
"created by just ordinary people" are "like the Lilliputians tying us to
the ground."</LD>
<TE>   Byrd noted that the administration's glossy new budget document
includes a cartoon of Gulliver tied down by Lilliputians. He denounced
the cartoon--one of several illustrations of White House sentiments and
criticisms--as "nonsense" that belittled how Congress represents the
interests of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Since Monday's release of President Bush's budget plan, which vividly
pokes fun at alleged congressional pork, lawmakers from both parties have
bristled at the administration's rhetoric. The chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, Rep. C.W. "Bill" Young (R-Fla.), sent a tart
letter Wednesday to the White House budget director, saying that "all
wisdom on the allocation of grant funding does not reside in the
executive branch."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of us were here before you came," Byrd sternly told O'Neill at
Thursday's hearing. He noted that he'd seen many secretaries of the
Treasury during his half century in Congress and that no one elected
O'Neill. "With all respect to you, you are not Alexander Hamilton," Byrd
said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, 66, paused about 20 seconds before answering, his eyes
appearing to glisten. His voice cracked as he spoke. He took deep breaths
between sentences, repeatedly clenching his hands, seeming to collect his
thoughts to try to hold his temper.</TE>
<TE>   He said he stood by his statements. "What I had in my mind and what I
deeply believe is this," he said, taking a deep breath. "That where we
have rules made by men that restrict the realization of human potential,
they should be changed."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill then took two more deep breaths before adding pointedly: "We
had rules that said, 'Colored don't enter here.' That was a man-made
rule." Byrd, in his youth, was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd glared at O'Neill. "I've been here a long time," he said. "I try
to live by the rules," noting that the rule O'Neill had criticized as
Lilliputian is known in Congress as the Byrd Rule. The rule generally
requires 60 votes in the 100-member Senate on key elements of tax bills
and is the main reason why the president's tax cut expires in 2010.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, who earned $59 million as Alcoa chairman in the year before
he became Treasury secretary, said he resented Byrd's earlier suggestion
that he'd been born to wealth.</TE>
<TE>   "Senator, I started my life in a house without water or electricity,
so I don't cede to you the high moral ground of not knowing what life is
like in a ditch," said O'Neill, whose father was an Army sergeant and
then a veterans' hospital attendant.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, Mr. Secretary," Byrd responded, "I lived in a house without
electricity too. No running water, no telephone, a little wooden
outhouse."</TE>
<TE>   "I had the same," interjected O'Neill.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, O'Neill was asked if he had tears in his eyes.
"That was fire," he said.</TE>

<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.
</DL>
<LD>Five Montgomery police officers have resigned and three have been
put on unpaid leave following allegations of police brutality, officials
said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   An internal police investigation was begun Monday after an officer
fought with a juvenile suspect he was transporting. City officials said
the probe has uncovered questionable police conduct dating back several
months.</LD>
<LD>   Seven of the officers are white and all the victims are black, said
Larry Armstead, assistant to Mayor Bobby Bright. "Obviously . . . that's
something that concerns me," Armstead said.</LD>
<TE>   The officers are accused of abusing their positions of authority,
mistreating citizens and falsely reporting incidents. Specifics of the
allegations were not released, pending completion of the probe.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Michael Clark, 32, who resigned Wednesday, has been charged
with criminal use of Mace after scuffling with a 17-year-old prisoner he
was transporting. Police said an argument prompted Clark to stop the car
and a shoving match ensued.</TE>

<HD>2 Suits, 6 Priests Add to Child Sex-Abuse Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>Two more lawsuits were filed Thursday accusing the Archdiocese of
Boston of failing to stop its priests from molesting altar boys even
though it knew what was happening.</LD>
<LD>   The new allegations came as the archdiocese, complying with its recent
promise to report past accusations, revealed the names of six more
priests who have been suspended amid charges they molested children, and
forwarded more names of accused priests to prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   A lawsuit filed in Middlesex Superior Court accused Cardinal Bernard
Law personally of failing to protect a 13-year-old boy from abuse by
now-defrocked priest John Geoghan in 1989. In the suit, Christopher
Fulchino, now 25 and living in Maine, alleges Law knew or should have
known about the abuse and instead relied on "a veil of silence."</LD>
<TE>   Geoghan, who was recently convicted of sexual abuse, faces 80 civil
lawsuits and two more criminal cases. In all, 130 people claim he abused
them.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Law apologized for moving Geoghan to a church in Weston,
Middlesex County, even though he knew of allegations of abuse against the
priest.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a lawsuit filed in Suffolk Superior Court on behalf of four
former altar boys accuses the archdiocese of failing to protect them and
accuses the Rev. Paul Desilets of molesting them when he was assigned to
Assumption Parish in Bellingham in the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, two other former altar boys filed a separate
lawsuit against Desilets, now 78, with similar allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Bellingham police, who have been investigating the allegations against
Desilets for the last two weeks, said they expect the list of people
accusing Desilets of abuse to grow to 15 to 20.</TE>
<TE>   Police have not yet interviewed Desilets, who lives in a nursing home
in Quebec.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he told Associated Press the charges against him in the
first lawsuit were exaggerated.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese is facing other lawsuits by people alleging abuse by
Geoghan and the victims of former church worker Christopher Reardon, who
was sentenced to 40 to 50 years after pleading guilty last year to
molesting 24 boys.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the archdiocese announced a new policy of reporting even
past allegations of abuse by priests after documents in the Geoghan case
showed at least some officials knew of the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the archdiocese had turned over the names of at least 58
priests accused of sexually abusing children over the last 40 years,
including 14 names forwarded to prosecutors Thursday. It has not released
all the names to the public.</TE>

<HD>Right Track for Amtrak Is Private Sector, Split-Up, Congress Told</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Countering Amtrak's pleas for more money, a congressional advisory
panel said Thursday that private companies should be given a chance to
make passenger trains more efficient and successful.</LD>
<LD>   The Amtrak Reform Council called for competition in passenger rail,
currently the exclusive domain of Amtrak. Two companies expressed some
interest.</LD>
<LD>   "The system we have today, the old Amtrak, has not worked and is not
working," said Gilbert Carmichael, chairman of the reform council.</LD>
<TE>   The council finished nearly four years of work by sending a 111-page
report to Congress and briefing officials from the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak, in a statement, said the report sidestepped questions about
what kind of rail system Americans want or how much it will cost.</TE>
<TE>   The council said Amtrak, created in 1971 to relieve freight railways
of the burden of carrying passengers, should no longer make policy or own
land. It would break Amtrak into three pieces.</TE>
<TE>   One would make policy and another would oversee the tracks, property
and stations Amtrak owns in the Boston-Washington Northeast Corridor.</TE>
<TE>   The third would conduct train operations. After a transition of two to
five years, it would accept bids for franchises to run various routes.</TE>
<TE>   "The council believes that, as is the case throughout our free-market
economy, competition would drive down costs and improve service quality
and customer satisfaction," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   The council voted, 9 to 1, in a mail ballot to approve the report.
Charles Moneypenny, who represented rail labor on the council, voted no.
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta, the Bush administration's
representative, abstained.</TE>
<TE>   The next step is up to Congress, which is due to vote this year on
whether to authorize Amtrak's continued existence. The House
Transportation Committee has scheduled a Feb. 14 hearing on the report.</TE>
<TE>   The plan faces a hostile reception from Amtrak supporters on and off
Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "By choosing to ignore the fundamental problem . . . of chronic
federal underinvestment, the ARC report has proposed a magic wand
solution that misses the mark," said Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.).</TE>
<TE>   "I think this report should be rejected out of hand," said Amtrak
Chairman Michael S. Dukakis, the former Massachusetts governor.</TE>
<TE>   Dukakis called decentralization "a prescription for bureaucratic
paralysis" and said the real issue is money.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak, which lost a record $1.1 billion in 2001, says it has a
$5.8-billion backlog in work needed on its trains, tracks, rail yards and
stations.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Amtrak said it will cancel long-distance routes unless it
receives $1.2 billion in the 2003 budget year, which begins Oct. 1.
President Bush has proposed $521 million.</TE>
<TE>   Carmichael said Amtrak's problems stem not from funding but from "an
organization that is obsolete, can't do all the things it is supposed to
do and has to change."</TE>
<TE>   The council's vice chairman, Paul Weyrich, president of the Free
Congress Foundation, warned that if Congress resists change, "the day
will come when there will be no Amtrak."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.), an Amtrak critic who has proposed spinning
off two profitable routes, said the report does not go far enough. He
said Amtrak's successor should be required, not just permitted, to turn
over train routes to the highest bidder.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have questioned whether private companies would be interested
in entering the passenger train business. But there was some early
interest.</TE>
<TE>   "What we heard today is certainly encouraging for the private sector
to enter the market," said Scott Spencer, president of Railway Service
Corp., a Delaware company seeking to break into intercity passenger rail.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts-based Peter Pan Bus Co. has also expressed interest in
taking over Amtrak's operations in the Northeast.</TE>

<HD>Ohio Backed on Abortion Ban</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI
</DL>
<LD>In an unusual move, the Bush administration backed Ohio's effort to
revive its law that forbids a controversial late-term abortion procedure.</LD>
<LD>   In arguments filed this week, the Justice Department urged the 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to hear the case as soon as possible. No
date has been set.</LD>
<LD>   "The question is one of great interest as a matter of public policy
and of constitutional law," Justice Department attorneys argued, "and it
turns on several significant U.S. Supreme Court decisions interpreting
the states' authority to regulate abortions."</LD>
<TE>   A federal judge ruled that the state's ban on dilation-and-extraction
procedure--called partial-birth abortion by opponents--was
unconstitutional and could not be enforced. The state is appealing.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department rarely files arguments in circuit court cases
when it isn't directly involved or invited to weigh in.</TE>
<TE>   The move came a week after the Bush administration said it would make
embryos and developing fetuses eligible for a government health care
program, saying they qualify from the moment of conception.</TE>
<TE>   "This latest move by the administration should alarm the majority of
Americans who believe that personal reproductive health care decisions
should remain between women and their doctors," said Vicki Saporta,
executive director of the National Abortion Federation.</TE>
<TE>   Alphonse Gerhardstein--lawyer for abortion provider Dr. Martin
Haskell, who filed the lawsuit--said the Justice Department action
wouldn't strengthen the case for the ban.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, U.S. District Judge Walter Rice ruled the state ban
unconstitutional because it prohibits the dilation-and-extraction
procedure even when it is safer for a patient.</TE>

<HD>Conn. Capitol Shut Over 'Gun' Report</HD>
<DH>Security: A camera spooks onlookers and provokes a lock-down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.
</DL>
<LD>A seven-hour lock-down of the state Capitol complex was triggered
when a film crew's camera was mistaken for a gun, Capitol police said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Neal Thomassen and Eric Bailey, employees of a state teachers union,
were on the top level of the Legislative Office Building parking garage
about 1 p.m. Wednesday, shooting footage for a cable TV show.</LD>
<LD>   That's when two women, who were sitting in the legislative building's
cafeteria, told police they saw a man dressed in dark clothes on the roof
with what appeared to be a machine gun.</LD>
<TE>   The reports came on the first day of the annual legislative session,
minutes after Gov. John Rowland finished his State of the State speech,
and led police to lock down portions of the Capitol complex for more than
six hours.</TE>
<TE>   No weapon or gunman was found, said Sgt. J. Paul Vance, a state police
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Thomassen, who was wearing a black peacoat, said he shot 38 seconds of
footage from the garage using a hand-held camera. He and Bailey had
registered with the Capitol police.</TE>
<TE>   After the lock-down began, the Connecticut Federation of Educational
and Professional Employees called police to say their cameraman may have
been mistaken for a gunman, Rowland said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers, including House Majority Leader David Pudlin, accused
police of overreacting. Dozens of officers responded to the incident,
which made national news.</TE>
<TE>   But House Speaker Moira Lyons said police did an excellent job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always easy to criticize after the fact, but the first issue is
safety," Lyons said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the false alarm, the women who reported the incident did the
right thing, Rowland said.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope people will still be on their toes and still report anything
suspicious they see."</TE>

<HD>Norton Set to Testify on Indian Funds</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Interior chief will be asked to explain the handling of
trusts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge wants to hear from Interior Secretary Gale A.
Norton before he decides whether to hold her in contempt of court for
failing to fix a system of Native American trust funds.</LD>
<LD>   Government attorneys wrapped up their defense of Norton on Thursday in
a contempt hearing before U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth that
started nearly two months ago.</LD>
<LD>   To counter the government's argument, attorneys for Native Americans
claiming the government mismanaged the trust money said they would call
Norton to testify.</LD>
<TE>   Lamberth has ordered Norton to prove the Interior Department did not
commit a fraud on the court by concealing the failure of key Indian trust
fund accounting systems.</TE>
<TE>   Although much of the alleged wrongdoing occurred during the tenure of
her predecessor, Bruce Babbitt, Norton is on trial as the current head of
the department.</TE>
<TE>   Norton's attorneys argued she should not be forced to testify, but
Lamberth scheduled her to take the stand Wednesday. A hearing Friday will
determine the scope of her testimony.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Lamberth held Babbitt and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin
in contempt and fined them $600,000 for failing to turn over documents in
the five-year-old class-action lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The suit stems from a century of mismanaged mining, grazing and timber
royalties from 45 million acres of Indian land held in trust by the
Interior Department.</TE>
<TE>   Money intended for Native American beneficiaries was lost,
misappropriated, stolen or never collected. Attorneys claim the
government owes 300,000 Indian account holders more than $10 billion.</TE>
<TE>   They want responsibility for the trust assigned to a receiver outside
the Interior Department. Norton has proposed creating a bureau within the
department to manage the money, but tribal leaders have fought the
proposal.</TE>

<HD>4 Texas Jail Escapees Arrested in Oklahoma</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ARDMORE, Okla.
</DL>
<LD>After more than a week on the run, four escaped inmates from Texas
were captured at a convenience store, where two of them had holed up with
a hostage Thursday for hours so they could fill up on beef jerky, chips
and beer.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities arrested two of the inmates Wednesday night. The other two
gave up before dawn Thursday after eating, drinking and smoking through
the night as they talked with FBI negotiators, their relatives and their
captive, George West.</LD>
<LD>   "They weren't out to hurt anybody," said store owner West, 65. He was
released unharmed. "They were just looking for something to eat and a way
out of here. I don't believe I've ever seen five men eat as much as those
two boys did."</LD>
<TE>   The four inmates--two convicted murders and two murder
defendants--broke out of the Montague County Jail in Texas on Jan. 28,
overpowering a female guard with a homemade knife and fleeing in her
sport-utility vehicle. The escape set off a manhunt across the southern
Plains, with authorities suspecting Oklahoma might be their destination
because two of the men grew up in the state.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, the inmates were linked to two burglaries and the
theft of a truck; a rifle was taken in one of the burglaries. In the end,
the inmates were captured just 50 miles from the jail they fled. The FBI
said the men spent several days hiding in a state park and were tired and
hungry.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Jordan, 30, was using a pay phone at the combination gas
station-convenience store when an FBI agent and a sheriff's deputy
arrested him. Chrystal Soto, 22, came out and gave up, setting up the
standoff with the last two inmates, Curtis Gambill and Joshua Bagwell,
who had been serving a life sentence for killing a high-school
cheerleader.</TE>
<TE>   West said Gambill, 23, and Bagwell, 24, ate voraciously during the
standoff, and he began to feel sorry for them. Through the evening, the
conversation turned to the fugitives' dreams of going to Canada and their
love of the outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   The surrender was the result of "a very skillful agent developing a
rapport" with the escapees, FBI agent Richard Marquise said. "There was
discussion about hunting and fishing and what life was in prison."</TE>
<TE>   West's wife, Rita, said her husband's calm personality helped keep
things from getting out of control. "He just used a little common sense.
He just kept his cool."</TE>
<TE>   The arrests were a relief to Soto's stepfather, John Christmas: Soto
and Jordan are charged with killing Christmas' father and stepmother in
Bowie, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "I was glad it ended peacefully," Christmas said. "They were hungry
and cold and were already killers, so everybody was pretty fortunate."</TE>

<HD>'Arming America' Under Fire; Historian Will Undergo Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Literature: Accused of misleading statements, professor says his
book is fundamentally sound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A disputed, prize-winning book about the role of guns in the U.S.
will undergo a formal inquiry from Emory University, where author Michael
Bellesiles is a professor of history.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement released this week, Emory official Robert A. Paul said
the Atlanta-based school has initiated a process for "addressing
allegations of misconduct in research."</LD>
<LD>   "Both the history department and Michael Bellesiles have now requested
that we initiate this process, and we have done so," said Paul, dean of
Emory College, an undergraduate division of the university. "Professor
Bellesiles says that he welcomes the review by his faculty colleagues and
other scholars in this forum."</LD>
<TE>   Bellesiles, on a fellowship for the academic year, did not immediately
return telephone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Bellesiles spent 10 years working on "Arming America," published by
Alfred A. Knopf in 2000. The book challenges the idea that the United
States has always been a gun-oriented culture and that well-armed
militias were essential to the Revolutionary War.</TE>
<TE>   Relying on numerous sources, Bellesiles wrote that only a small
percentage of people possessed firearms in colonial times and that
militias were mostly ineffective. Only after the Civil War, he contends,
did guns become important to the culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Arming America" was praised by the New York Times and the New York
Review of Books, and won the Bancroft Prize for history. Many cited it as
a devastating statement against the country's alleged historical love
affair with firearms.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we think about guns and violence in America will never be the
same," wrote Michael Zuckerman, a professor of history at the University
of Pennsylvania. "Michael Bellesiles is the NRA's worst nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   Gun advocates quickly attacked the book, with National Rifle Assn.
president, actor Charlton Heston, complaining that Bellesiles had "too
much time on his hands."</TE>
<TE>   But scholars and critics also became skeptical. Bellesiles has been
accused of ideological bias, selective scholarship and misleading
statements. He has acknowledged some errors, but defends his book as
fundamentally sound.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Garrett, Bellesiles' editor at Knopf, said Thursday in a
statement that some corrections already have been made in the paperback
edition. She added that "other corrections will be made in subsequent
printings with regard to the few additional factual errors that have been
discovered."</TE>
<TE>   "We hasten to point out, however, that the majority of the matters
that have been raised are matters of interpretation," Garrett said.</TE>
<TE>   In a highly anticipated forum appearing in the upcoming issue of the
William &amp; Mary Quarterly, four leading historians evaluate "Arming
America," and Bellesiles provides a lengthy defense. Many in the academic
community believe his reputation depends on how effectively he responds.</TE>
<TE>   The statement from Emory referred to the William &amp; Mary article and
said that "questions remain concerning his research."</TE>
<TE>   The participants in the William &amp; Mary forum, which comes out next
week, criticize "Arming America." Gloria L. Main, a history professor at
the University of Colorado, says in the quarterly that Bellesiles greatly
underestimates the level of gun ownership in colonial times. Randolph
Roth, professor of history at Ohio State University, finds Bellesiles
guilty of letting his theory guide his research, rather than the other
way around.</TE>
<TE>   Bellesiles' response in the forum is aggressive yet cautious. He
defends his scholarship, and worries about the public's belief in the
power of militias. But he also emphasizes that his book offers no
definitive proof and notes the uncertain nature of historical
scholarship.</TE>

<DL>DALLAS
</DL>
<LD>A man whose wife and adopted son died in the crash of American
Airlines Flight 587 sued the airline Thursday, alleging it was negligent
in inspections.</LD>
<LD>   Reyna Brito Prospero, 49, and Wilberto Pablito Brito, 9, were among
the 260 people on the plane that crashed Nov. 12 in a New York City
neighborhood. All the passengers and crew and five people on the ground
were killed.</LD>
<LD>   The plane had just taken off from John F. Kennedy International
Airport en route to the Dominican Republic.</LD>
<TE>   Wigberto Prospero of New York filed the lawsuit in federal court in
Dallas, where American is based. The lawsuit alleges the airline failed
to properly inspect the mechanical and structural components of the
Airbus A300 series aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Safety investigators have said the tail fin, or vertical stabilizer,
on the plane fell off before the jet slammed into the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   An American Airlines spokesman would not comment on the suit. A
similar lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles in November on behalf of another
passenger.</TE>

<HD>With Concern, U.S. Cites Boom in Fertility Efforts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>Fertility procedures in the United States jumped by 27% in just two
years, according to government researchers who said they are worried
about the risks for mothers and children.</LD>
<LD>   The number of procedures increased from 64,724 in 1996 to 81,899 in
1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday in its
first comprehensive look at the topic.</LD>
<LD>   Assisted reproductive technology includes procedures such as in vitro
fertilization, where both egg and sperm are handled outside the body.
Artificial insemination was not tracked for the report.</LD>
<TE>   CDC doctors declined to say why the popularity of the procedures is
growing so quickly, but other experts attributed it to older couples
trying to have children and a population more confident of fertility
technology.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC warned that assisted fertility carries risks: The nearly
82,000 procedures in 1998 led to only about 20,000 live births, and when
there were live births there were multiple babies 56% of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Women with twins, triplets and higher numbers of children are at
significantly higher risk for pregnancy complications, and the babies
themselves are at risk for low birth weight and long-term disability.</TE>
<TE>   Multiple births happen only about 3% of the time for women who become
pregnant naturally.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope the information will provide a starting point for patients to
discuss some of these risks with their providers when they're planning
the specifics of the treatment," said Laura Schieve, chief of the CDC's
assisted reproductive technology unit.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the increase in the number of procedures can be explained by a
jump in the number of clinics offering the services: There were 390 in
1998, up from 330 two years earlier, according to the CDC.</TE>
<TE>   But the rise in popularity is mostly a reflection of couples who are
more confident the process will produce children--and willing to take the
risks, said Dr. Jamie Grifo, president of the Society for Assisted
Reproductive Technology.</TE>
<TE>   "They're incredibly highly motivated, and highly intellectual," he
said. "They're well aware of this, and on top of that, they're
well-counseled about these risks."</TE>
<TE>   Grifo said he believes the number of fertility procedures is rising in
part because more couples who want children are waiting until later in
life, when women have more difficulty conceiving.</TE>
<TE>   California led the nation with 10,615 fertility procedures in 1998.
The CDC said none was performed in Alaska, Idaho, Maine or Montana
because there were no clinics in those states.</TE>

<LD>San Francisco (11-10, 6-2) at Pepperdine (15-6, 8-0), 7, KPLS
(830)--The Waves' 10-game winning streak is the longest in 10 years.
Improved rebounding and balanced scoring have keyed Pepperdine. Six
players average in double figures, led by junior forward Jimmy
Miggins' 14.9 points. Pepperdine has defeated USF seven consecutive
times. Junior forward Darrell Tucker averages 19.2 points and 10.1
rebounds to lead the Dons, who have won three in a row and eight of
11.</LD>

<LD>   St. Mary's (6-15, 1-7) at Loyola Marymount (9-13, 2-6), 7, KXLU-FM
(88.9)--Loyola Marymount has lost five in a row, including
consecutive West Coast Conference setbacks to Pepperdine last week.
The Lions were beaten, 84-59, then played the Waves close, 89-79, on
Saturday. Forward Keith Kincade is out two to three weeks because of
a severe ankle sprain. St. Mary's ended a 22-game WCC losing streak
on Saturday by defeating San Diego, 63-60. Loyola defeated St.
Mary's, 75-64, on Jan. 12 at Moraga.</LD>

<HD>Riverside Poly Turned It Around After Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Ortega</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was humiliating, embarrassing and disappointing.</LD>
<LD>   But a 6-1 loss to Irvine Woodbridge on Dec. 11 was far from
devastating to the Riverside Poly boys' soccer team.</LD>
<LD>   The loss marked a turning point for a Poly team that finished the
regular season with a 22-3-1 record after a 1-0 victory over Moreno
Valley Valley View on Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "I took it very personally," Coach Tom Tilson said of the whipping
by Woodbridge. "I was in a depression for a couple of days.... But
then I started to think that maybe this was the best thing that could
have happened to us because Woodbridge really exposed our weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We had gotten away with a few things up to that point in the
season, but that game showed us where we needed to improve."</TE>
<TE>   Defense was where Poly needed the most improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Tilson, who began the Poly boys' soccer program 29 years ago, said
his team had some solid defenders but they were young and
inexperienced.</TE>
<TE>   So he moved three senior offensive players--David Adame, Diego
Iriarte and Daniel Bishop--and a versatile sophomore, Alex
Pitruzzello, to sweeper, stopper, left fullback and right fullback,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Poly has not lost in 18 games since, posting a 17-0-1 record while
outscoring opponents, 46-4.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's worked because we just communicate real well," said
Bishop, a starting left halfback on a Poly team that lost in a
shootout to La Puente Nogales in the quarterfinals of the Southern
Section Division II playoffs last year. "It wasn't like the guys who
were playing [defense] before were bad players, but there wasn't a
lot of communication between them."</TE>
<TE>   Iriarte, a four-year varsity player, said he and his teammates
figured they'd turned a corner when they won their first nine games
after the lineup changes. But the real proof came in a nonleague game
Jan. 14 when they beat visiting Santa Margarita, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really big to come back from losing to Woodbridge to
beating Santa Margarita," he said. "It let us know that we had made
some correct changes."</TE>
<TE>   Double trouble: Goalkeeper is one position that Tilson and
assistant Manuel Rodriguez have not tampered with.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor Neece and Adam Aaron are each talented goalies so they've
split duties. Neece typically tends goal in the first half of games
and Aaron plays in the second.</TE>
<TE>   "We left it up to them about how they wanted to handle things,"
Tilson said. "We said one guy could play one game and the other the
next, but they liked the idea of splitting halves."</TE>
<TE>   The set-up might seem unconventional, but Tilson had a two-goalie
rotation during the 1993-94 season when Poly won the Southern Section
Division III title.</TE>
<TE>   No regrets: Long Beach Millikan's Southern Section-record league
unbeaten streak ended at 53 games Friday in a 3-2 loss to visiting
Compton, but Coach Rod Petkovic had no misgivings about sitting out
all of his starters so they could be as sound as possible for the
start of the Division I playoffs next week.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided to give our players an opportunity to heal," Petkovic
wrote in an e-mail. "And not worry about anything except the welfare
of our players.... Win or lose, this is the right decision."</TE>

<HD>Stanford's Jacobsen Scores 41</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Casey Jacobsen had 41 points and he and Curtis Borchardt combined to
make five free throws in the final two minutes of overtime to lift
No. 20 Stanford to a 90-87 victory over No. 13 Oregon on Thursday
night at Palo Alto.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second time in three games Jacobsen scored at least 40
points. He had 49 against Arizona State a week ago.</LD>
<LD>   Stanford (14-6, 7-4 Pacific 10) was eight of 11 from the foul line
in the overtime.</LD>
<TE>   Borchardt had 24 points, 15 rebounds and five blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick Jones matched his career-high with 36 points as the
Ducks (17-6, 9-3) had their three-game winning streak ended and fell
to 3-5 on the road. He also had 10 rebounds. Luke Ridnour scored
eight of his 18 points in overtime, while Luke Jackson had 17.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Johnson also recorded a double-double with 10 points and 13
rebounds as Oregon lost to a ranked opponent for the first time this
season.</TE>
<TE>   A layup by Johnson put the Ducks ahead, 76-75, with 44 seconds
remaining in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford worked the clock down to 23 seconds before calling a
timeout. The ball was inbounded to Jacobsen, who worked his way free
for a shot that bounced off the front of the rim and Jones grabbed
the rebound. He was immediately fouled.</TE>
<TE>   After Jones made both free throws, the Cardinal couldn't get the
ball to Jacobsen. That left it up to Tony Giovacchini--Stanford's
only senior--who sank a three-pointer with four seconds left to tie
it at 78.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon couldn't get off a shot before time expired in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Marked by stubborn play on both ends of the court, neither team
could gain a stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon opened a four-point lead four minutes into the second half
on a three-pointer by Jones, but the Cardinal took the lead four
minutes later when Jacobsen drove the lane twice in succession to put
Stanford up, 47-45.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Duke 80, Florida State 49--The Blue Devils avenged their
only loss of the season with a victory over the Seminoles.</TE>
<TE>   Duke (21-1, 9-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) rebounded from its
worst half of the season-- 30.6% shooting and 14 turnovers--and
pulled away by outscoring the Seminoles, 36-11, over the final 12:39
at Durham, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   All-American guard Jason Williams had one of his worst games of
the season for Duke. The ACC's scoring leader (21.9) had seven points
on three-for-13 shooting. Mike Dunleavy led Duke with 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Joiner had 13 points for the Seminoles (10-11, 3-7), who
beat Duke, 77-76, on Jan. 6.</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 Gonzaga 84, Santa Clara 69--Dan Dickau scored 22 points at
Santa Clara, the Bulldogs' sixth straight win and 18th in 19 games.</TE>
<TE>   Zach Gourde scored 16 points and Cory Violette added 14 for
Gonzaga (21-3, 8-1 West Coast Conference), which scored 15 of the
game's final 22 points.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Bailey had 22 of his career-high 30 points in the second half
for Santa Clara (9-13, 4-5), which got within 59-54 with 11:11 left
on a three-pointer by Justin Holbrook.</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Arizona 91, Washington 82--Salim Stoudamire had 14 of his
17 points in the second half at Tucson and Jason Gardner scored 11 of
his 13 in the final 20 minutes for the Wildcats (16-6, 9-3 Pac-10).</TE>
<TE>   Doug Wrenn had a career-high 35 points for the Huskies (8-14,
2-10), who rallied from a 19-point deficit to get within seven in the
final nine minutes but lost their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Luke Walton had 21 points for Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Illinois 68, Michigan 60--Brian Cook scored 19 points,
including his team's first 12, and the Illini (16-7, 5-5 Big Ten)
ended a three-game losing streak by winning in an opponent's gym for
the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Leon Jones had 14 points for the Wolverines (9-11, 4-6) who led by
as many as 13 points in the first half but were outscored, 11-3, to
close the game.</TE>

<LD>This is a case where familiarity didn't breed contempt. It produced
goals.</LD>
<LD>   Left wing Mike Leclerc knew where to pass the puck before he
spotted teammate Paul Kariya during Wednesday's come-from-behind
victory over Philadelphia. Twice he fed Kariya for goals in the 5-4
victory.</LD>
<LD>   "Paul is notorious for letting you know when he is open," Leclerc
said. "You here this 'Ya ya ya ya ya' in a high-pitched little voice
and you know it's him."</LD>
<TE>   Simple explanations may be too easy for the Ducks' recent success,
but they are scoring more goals than the other team.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, offensively challenged much of the season, are
averaging 3.7 goals during their season-best six-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the combos are better right now," Coach Bryan Murray
said. "We were juggling everybody around, trying to find somebody to
score goals earlier this season. Whatever we tried, it was easy to go
to the next combination, simply because of not winning."</TE>
<TE>   Kariya had a hat trick in Wednesday's game, but Leclerc and center
Andy McDonald created the opportunities. Center Matt Cullen had two
goals in the final 42 games last season. Skating with Marty McInnis
and German Titov, Cullen has four goals in the last five games.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some solidarity with the lines, guys are getting used to
playing with each other," Leclerc said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kariya's hat trick came on an important night. Besides being his
500th NHL game, it was the first time his father, T.K. Kariya, had
seen him play for the Ducks outside of his hometown of Vancouver,
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good game," said T.K. Kariya, who has every game the
Ducks have played at Vancouver. "It's nice to see the team have a
good game."</TE>
<TE>   Like father, like son--understated and team first.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a real low-key guy," Paul Kariya said. "I don't think his
pulse rate ever gets above 40."</TE>
<TE>   T.K. Kariya, a high school math and physical education teacher in
Vancouver, retired in June. He traveled to Southern California last
week to see his son play in the All-Star game.</TE>

<LD>The $75,000 Sham Stakes, which will be run for only the second time
this afternoon, is a prep for the $750,000 Santa Anita Derby on April
6.</LD>
<LD>   Hopefully, today's race will be of more significance than the 2001
running.</LD>
<LD>   Not one of the six 3-year-olds who participated in last year's
Sham made it to the Santa Anita Derby.</LD>
<TE>   Wild And Wise, part of the 9-10 favored entry, won what was an
ugly race, beating Swordfish by a half-length in 1:502/5 over 11/8
miles.</TE>
<TE>   Special Times, the other half of the entry, was third.</TE>
<TE>   The likely favorite this year is Cottonwood Cowboy, a son of
Meadowlake who has won two of five for owners Lorraine and Rod
Rodriguez and trainer Chris Paasch.</TE>
<TE>   A chestnut purchased for $110,000 a year ago, Cottonwood Cowboy
exits the best race. He finished third in the Santa Catalina behind
Labamta Babe.</TE>
<TE>   Those who will be trying to run him down are Shah Jehan, a
$4.4-million yearling who had a win and a second in four turf starts
in Ireland, France and England and will be making his dirt debut for
trainer Wayne Lukas; Puerto Banus, a half-brother to Spain who was
fourth in his first race around two turns nine days ago; Hot Contest,
who beat maidens at 25-1 on Dec. 30; U S S Tinosa, the 5-2 second
choice who most recently was third in the Golden Gate Derby on Jan.
12, and Definite Edge.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The $100,000 Sabin Handicap at Gulfstream Park in
Hallandale, Fla., drew a large field of fillies and mares, including
Gulfstream specialist De Bertie, Grade I winner Miss Linda and Acorn
Stakes winner Forest Secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Call Me A Prince. The 7-year-old gelding has won three
of his last four at Golden Gate Fields and steps up a level in search
of his 13th lifetime victory in today's first.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Tricky Sister. The Tricky Six filly has been beaten by
a combined 541/2 lengths in her first two starts and drops into a
claimer in today's fourth at Oaklawn Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick three singling Casual Queen in the
first, using Test The Waters and Westmead Empress in the second and
Sheza Jazzy Slew, Please Be Seated, Mickey's Hot Stuff and Romantic
Won in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/97. Money: previous day/meet
total: $13/$595.20. Total money bet: $544.</TE>

<HD>Murray Has 'Nice Problem'</HD>

<LD>Imagine having a better goals-against average than Patrick Roy and
Dominik Hasek but you can't get off the bench long enough to rank
among the top goaltenders in the league.</LD>
<LD>   For Jamie Storr, who has not played in 11 of the Kings' last 12
games, including Thursday night against the Carolina Hurricanes,
that's reality.</LD>
<LD>   Despite having a 1.89 goals-against average, Storr has found
playing time tough to come by because Coach Andy Murray has stuck
with No. 1 goalie Felix Potvin, who had a 1.98 average over his
previous 25 games before Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "We have one guy who wants to be in there for every one and
another guy who has the best goals against in the league right now
... and he's played well every time he's been in there," Murray said.
"That's a nice problem to have."</TE>
<TE>   Storr's 729 minutes fall short of the 780 needed to qualify
statistically among league goalies.</TE>
<TE>   With the Kings playing at Phoenix tonight, Storr would be a
logical choice to start. But because the Kings' next game isn't until
Monday against Dallas at Staples Center, Murray will wait as long as
possible to make his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much on the line right now with every game," Murray
said. "I don't think you want to do something that you may feel
different about later. I would rather not tell a guy until later."</TE>

<HD>Blues Make the Most of 14 Shots in 3-1 Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Blues weren't held back by a season-low 14 shots
against the Edmonton Oilers.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Tkachuk scored two goals as the Blues made the most of their
limited chances in a 3-1 victory over the Oilers on Thursday night at
St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   "Once you get your chances, you've got to bear down and crash the
net," Tkachuk said. "And that's what we did. It turned out to be
pretty good."</LD>
<TE>   The Blues got 27 saves from backup goalie Fred Brathwaite and won
for the second time in six games. Although they didn't reach double
figures in shots until about four minutes remained in the second
period, they compensated with three goals in the first eight shots
against Tommy Salo.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's disappointed," Edmonton Coach Craig MacTavish said.
"We didn't give them many chances all night, and what few chances we
gave up cost us."</TE>
<TE>   Tkachuk has 10 goals, seven assists and three game-winning goals
in the last 12 games. He gave the Blues an early lead, capitalizing
on a giveaway by Ryan Smyth for an unassisted goal at 1:03 of the
first period.</TE>
<TE>   Tkachuk made it 3-1 when he tapped in Pavol Demitra's shot during
a three-on-two break at 5:15 of the second. On replays, it appeared
as if the puck might have gone in without Tkachuk deflecting it.</TE>
<TE>   Brathwaite got a rare start in place of Brent Johnson, who had
started 14 of the previous 15 games, and got his first victory since
Dec. 30. Brathwaite, who started against the Mighty Ducks on Jan. 28,
robbed Tom Poti with a sliding save in the first period and Ethan
Moreau in the second.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 4, Toronto 1--Shawn Bates scored New York's
league-leading 15th short-handed goal and Michael Peca had three
assists for the Islanders at Uniondale, N.Y. Tomas Kaberle scored for
Toronto, which was without top-line defenseman Dmitry Yushkevich and
second-leading scorer Alexander Mogilny.</TE>
<TE>   Mogilny sat out his third consecutive game because of back spasms,
and Yushkevich could be out for the rest of the season because of a
blood clot in his leg. Yushkevich, a member of the Russian Olympic
team, probably will miss the Salt Lake City games.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 1, Pittsburgh 0--Jose Theodore recorded his second
consecutive shutout and Shaun Van Allen scored with 6:28 remaining in
the second period for the Canadiens at Montreal. Theodore, who also
held New Jersey scoreless in a 1-0 win Tuesday, stopped 30 shots for
his sixth shutout of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal captain Saku Koivu said that the stomach cancer that has
sidelined him this season was in full remission. Koivu, 27, said he
planned to start working out and could return by the end of the
season in April.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3, New Jersey 3--Ray Ferraro stuffed in a rebound with two
seconds remaining to help the Thrashers rally from a two-goal
third-period deficit at East Rutherford, N.J. Ferraro's goal capped a
wild final 15 seconds in which the Thrashers took four shots. Jiri
Slegr also scored for Atlanta in the period, when the Thrashers took
eight shots on goal, one more than they had in the first two periods
combined.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Arnott, Patrik Elias and Randy McKay scored for New Jersey,
which was soundly booed by its fans after squandering the lead
against the NHL's second-worst team.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 3, Tampa Bay 1--Roberto Luongo made 36 saves at Tampa,
Fla., for the Panthers, who ended a six-game winless streak.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the 550th of Coach Mike Keenan's NHL career.
Luongo's bid for his fifth shutout of the season ended when Vincent
Lecavalier scored with 2:45 left in the third period.</TE>

<HD>Shipp Leads California to Another Home Win</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Shipp scored 12 of his 18 points in the second half as California
beat Oregon State, 73-58, Thursday night at Berkeley.</LD>
<LD>   Amit Tamir added 14 points and five assists and Brian Wethers had
12 points for Cal (16-5, 7-4) in its first game without starter
Dennis Gates.</LD>
<LD>   Gates was hurt in practice Monday and is expected to miss two
weeks because of a wrist injury, but a balanced attack allowed the
Bears to improve to 14-1 at Haas Pavilion this season.</LD>
<TE>   Oregon State's Philip Ricci scored 23 points, while Joe See came
off the bench to add 15 points for the Beavers (10-12, 3-9).</TE>
<TE>   It was the fifth straight game and the 17th time in 21 games this
season that Shipp has scored in double figures for the Bears.</TE>
<TE>   Held to only six points in the first half, Shipp made three
consecutive shots midway through the second half, then helped seal
the win by making four free throws in the final three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Cal shot 63% from the field in the first half but never got into a
scoring rhythm in the second half. That allowed Oregon State, which
had shot 35% in the first half, to close to within 54-51 with 7:33
left to play.</TE>
<TE>   A.J. Diggs and Shantay Legans also combined for six free throws as
Cal was 10 for 10 from the line down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State played without Brian Jackson, the Beavers'
second-leading scorer. He sat out the game because of a strained
groin and abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State 96, Washington State 45--Chad Prewitt scored all of
his 16 points in the first half for the Sun Devils in Tempe, Ariz. It
was the Sun Devils' largest margin of victory in a Pac-10 game.</TE>
<TE>   Donnell Knight had 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Sun Devils
(12-9, 5-7).</TE>
<TE>   The 51-point margin surpassed the Sun Devils' 38-point victory
over Oregon State in 1994-95 and was the largest in Coach Rob Evans'
four-year tenure. Every Arizona State player scored, except Awvee
Storey, who missed the game because of a lower back strain.</TE>
<TE>   J Locklier scored 14 points for Washington State (5-15, 1-11),
which has lost 13 of 14. The Cougars shot a season-low 26% from the
field.</TE>

<HD>This Is No Winter Wonderland</HD>
<DH>Yachting: Crews face freezing temperatures, dangerous
conditions in Volvo Ocean Race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICH ROBERTS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Far from the TV cameras and the revelry--far from anywhere, in
fact--97 men and women from several nations are experiencing their
own version of the Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   The calendar says it's summer in the Southern Hemisphere, but they
would never know it with the freezing and perilous conditions they
have been facing every day.</LD>
<LD>   They are the fatigued and frequently fearful crew members of the
eight 64-foot boats in the Volvo Ocean Race, currently on the fourth
leg through the Southern Ocean from Auckland, N.Z., around Cape Horn,
graveyard of ancient mariners, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</LD>
<TE>   Excerpts from this week's log:</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: "Amer Sports One came close to disaster as they lost
control of their overpowered yacht when charging toward two large
icebergs right in front of them. When the yacht wiped out, they
shredded the storm spinnaker."</TE>
<TE>   And sailed on.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: "News Corp hit a growler while sailing at 21 knots of
boat speed. Fortunately, the boat appeared to be sound and the crew
were all safe. Ross Field, navigator and helmsman, reported: 'I am
bloody worried. This is dangerous. There are icebergs everywhere.'"
(A "growler" is a broken-off hunk of iceberg, often larger than a
bus, lurking little higher than the surface, undetectable by radar
and virtually invisible at night.)</TE>
<TE>   News Corp too sailed on.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Thursday, worse news: "The Swedish entry SEB in the Volvo
Ocean Race this morning lost her [mast]. The boat and crew are not in
danger."</TE>
<TE>   How reassuring. The 1979 Fastnet Race off Great Britain, when 15
sailors died, and the 1998 Sydney-Hobart Race off Australia, where
six lost their lives, were relatively close to land within range of
reasonable, if difficult, air rescue efforts. SEB was 1,250 nautical
miles (1,439 statute miles) from the nearest land.</TE>
<TE>   "You are on your own, absolutely," said Dee Smith, the Amer Sports
One navigator/helmsman who is sitting out this leg in Novato, Calif.,
after shoulder surgery. "There's nothing anybody can do for you.</TE>
<TE>   "You rely on the other [race] boats."</TE>
<TE>   If they happen to be nearby. But Amer Sports Too, the all-woman
team led by American skipper Lisa McDonald, was nearly 500 miles
behind the leader--Germany's Illbruck--and 400 from the nearest boat,
the Rupert Murdoch-sponsored News Corp, running sixth--not counting
SEB, which had its own problems.</TE>
<TE>   Turning around to go back should Amer Sports Too need help would
mean heavy pounding upwind in winds to 30 and 35 knots, a seemingly
impossible scenario.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, SEB's struggling crew, which actually includes only two
Swedes--skipper Gurra Krantz and trimmer/helmsman Magnus Woxen--cut
away the carbon fiber mast, which had snapped a few feet above the
deck. They arranged a jury rig from the boom and other parts so they
could continue on at a slow six knots to the southern tip of
Argentina where they would get a new rig installed.</TE>
<TE>   Even when the sailing is under control, the crew labors through
four-hour watches, not only hoisting, trimming and lowering sails but
shifting everything that will move, such as unused sails and food
stores, to the windward side of the boat every time they tack or
jibe. "It is fatigue that causes the crew errors that cause the
breakdowns," Smith said. "As soon as you break one thing, then
something else goes down.</TE>
<TE>   "It's physically hard, it's mentally hard--and it's a yacht race."</TE>
<TE>   For these efforts in miserable conditions, they are paid salaries
upwards from $60,000. But they will receive no medals and no prize
money.</TE>
<TE>   Sailors call regions below Latitude 40 the "Roaring Forties" and
below Latitude 50 the "Furious Fifties." Some of these boats, seeking
stronger winds, invaded the Insane Sixties.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at sailing down there without the ice, it's hard
enough," said Smith, who was there with Chessie Racing in '98.
"Throwing the ice on top, it just throws you over the edge."</TE>
<TE>   Did he wish he were back there?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes and no. Yeah, I'm glad I'm not there but, yeah, I wish I was
there. That is the best sailing you can do.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a survival situation. It is difficult and scary--scarier
than you could ever believe. But it's so incredibly intense that it's
good."</TE>
<TE>   For this breed of adventurer, it's irresistibly intoxicating.
Excitement, danger, fear--the world's ultimate thrill ride.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Hayles, navigator on Tyco: "Wives and girlfriends please
take note that when we start talking about coming back down here in
four years' time we should be locked away until we come to our
senses."</TE>
<TE>   They couldn't keep Paul Cayard away. With Rudiger at his side, he
was skipper for EF Language's victory in '97-98 but was committed to
Larry Ellison's Oracle America's Cup campaign this time. Then Ellison
inexplicably demoted him from sailing director to administrative
work, so Cayard was restless in limbo when a replacement was needed
for Smith. Ellison gave him leave, and there he was, reveling in the
Southern Ocean experience again.</TE>
<TE>   A few days into the leg he wrote: "The guys have the 'tomahawk
chop' going on deck, trying to shake the blood into their fingertips.
Below you have the steam of your breath visible at all times. We are
living in a wet refrigerator."</TE>
<TE>   And loving it.</TE>
<TE>   One day after complaining that he had been gripping the wheel so
tightly to control the boat that tendinitis had claimed 25% of the
strength in his left hand, Cayard, 42, was his old self.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the wind has died off, the situation is tame," he said. "No
more beautiful icebergs to look at. I am sad. I am afraid the ride is
over.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not written a lot about the cold and the dampness and
[lack of] comforts because honestly, I am hardly aware of them. Of
course, when I pay attention to it, I realize that I stink
incredibly.... But so what? That is nothing when compared to the
unbelievable ride."</TE>

<LD>Marvin and Markisha Lea of Martin Luther King High have become
Riverside's most intriguing brother-sister sports duo since Reggie
and Cheryl Miller were the king and queen of basketball at Riverside
Poly in the 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   Marvin, a 6-foot-3 senior point guard, is averaging 23.8 points,
8.5 rebounds and 7.2 assists. Markisha, a 6-0 junior forward, is
averaging 22.5 points and 11.9 rebounds.</LD>
<LD>   Because King's boys' and girls' games are played on the same day
during league play, the Lea family must split up. Mom goes to one
game, Dad to the other. But if there's a blowout, they make the quick
decision to reunite at the other's game.</LD>
<TE>   There's no playing favorites in the Lea household. Whether you're
a boy or girl, you take turns cleaning dishes, which is a good way to
teach responsibility while reminding everyone that life isn't always
about pleasing spectators in the stands.</TE>
<TE>   "My kitchen is always more clean," Marvin said. "The key to doing
good dishes is before putting them in the dishwater, you have to
rinse them off. That's how you get them real clean."</TE>
<TE>   Marvin doesn't get into a defensive stance while doing dishes, and
he doesn't mind trying out his cake recipes in the kitchen, either.</TE>
<TE>   "I've become one of the best cooks in the house," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His specialty is a poundcake with nuts, sour cream and brown
sugar, which he might make to celebrate his 18th birthday on
Saturday. Markisha's expertise is cheesecake. Maybe they will open
their own bakery.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball, though, has made them the most recognizable athletes
at King, which opened in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "They're such great kids," boys' Coach Tim Sweeney said.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin transferred to King from Riverside Poly after his sophomore
season. He was involved in a very public dispute with his former Poly
coach. Markisha was already a freshman at King.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a disagreement that escalated," Marvin said. "It shouldn't
have been that serious."</TE>
<TE>   Marvin led King to the Sunkist League championship as a junior,
averaging 31.4 points. His scoring average dropped this season, and
the big news is he doesn't care. That's an indication of growing
maturity. His assists and rebounds are up, and he's doing the little
things needed to make the Wolves (23-3) a Southern Section Division
II-A title contender.</TE>
<TE>   "He can score just about any time he'd like," Sweeney said. "He's
a relentless offensive rebounder. He's an incredible passer. He
throws passes which you have to be ready for."</TE>
<TE>   Markisha is clearly the most improved Lea. She didn't start
playing until eighth grade. Marvin has been her teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the best feelings seeing her play," he said. "She's
grown so much as a player, like night and day. She's making threes.
She shoots jumpers. She dribbles down the court. She's becoming an
all-around player."</TE>
<TE>   The little sister has similar praise for her brother.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just like, 'Wow, he shoots so well,'" she said. "Every game,
you're on the edge because you don't know what's going to come next.
I get so excited."</TE>
<TE>   The Leas are separated by 18 months. They have a 27-year-old
brother and an 11-year-old brother, who one day might be the best
basketball player in the family. Their parents are teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a competitive spirit at our house," Marvin said. "Nobody
wants to lose. There's always battles, even when we play Scrabble."</TE>
<TE>   Marvin and Markisha are expected to receive college scholarships
for their basketball skills.</TE>
<TE>   Neither would trade these last two years together in high school.
They've influenced each other in many ways.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody's there to look out for me and look out for her," Marvin
said. "She taught me to stay focused on school work and be more
social."</TE>
<TE>   Now, if only Markisha would volunteer to do Marvin's dishes, he'd
really feel indebted.</TE>

<LD>Adam Parada scored a career-high 24 points Thursday and UC Irvine
overcame its worst shooting performance of the year in defeating
Idaho, 52-38, in a Big West Conference men's basketball game at
Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Parada, a seven-foot sophomore center from Alta Loma, surpassed
his previous high of 20 with a dunk midway through the second half,
giving the Anteaters a 40-26 lead.</LD>
<LD>   Parada made nine of 16 shots. The remaining Anteaters made only
nine of 39 shots, missing all 10 of their three-point attempts.</LD>
<TE>   Idaho (7-14, 4-8), which doesn't have a player taller than 6-6,
was outrebounded, 48-25, including 21-6 on the offensive end. Parada
led the Anteaters with 13 rebounds and J.R. Christ had 10 in 14
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   No player scored in double figures for the Vandals, who produced
the lowest point total for a UC Irvine opponent in the history of the
Bren Center. Jerry Green scored 19 points for league-leading Irvine
(17-6, 10-2), which hosts second-place Utah State on Saturday night.</TE>

<LD>Utah State 60, Long Beach State 53--Utah State extended its winning
streak to four games with a Big West victory before 1,793 at the
Pyramid.</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach (8-15, 4-8) was without center Rudy Williams, who
averages 11 points and seven rebounds and had played the last two
games despite a wrist injury suffered during an 80-52 loss at UC
Santa Barbara on Jan. 26.</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach Coach Wayne Morgan called the loss of Williams, "a
crippling blow," and said the 6-9, 240-pound senior might be out for
the rest of the season.</LD>
<TE>   Utah State (17-4, 9-3) took advantage of Williams' absence and
swarmed Long Beach forward Travis Reed, who was coming off 30- and
31-point performances in victories over Cal State Fullerton and UC
Riverside last week. Reed had nine points and six rebounds against
the Aggies.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach led, 27-26, at halftime, but fell behind, 43-33, when
Utah State guard Ronnie Ross scored with 9:46 left. The 49ers pulled
to within 45-44 on Ron Johnson's three-point basket with 6:30 left,
but that was as close as Long Beach would get.</TE>
<TE>   Utah State forward Toriano Johnson provided the decisive basket
when he made a three-pointer from the left corner with 1:34
remaining. It was the Aggies' only three-pointer of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Desmond Penigar had 15 points and 11 rebounds, and Johnson
and Ross each had 11 points for Utah State.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Johnson scored 13 points and Chris Jenkins had 10 for Long
Beach.</TE>

<LD>   Following the opening ceremony and the 11 o'clock edition of
Channel 4 news will be NBC's late-night Olympic show, which is now
being called "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno."</LD>
<TE>   There had been some confusion regarding Leno's involvement. The
NBC schedule originally made it appear as though Leno was being
preempted by the "Olympic Late Night Show."</TE>
<TE>   But Leno will be very much involved in those shows, and this week
NBC changed the name to reflect that.</TE>
<TE>   Although Leno will do his regular monologue from Burbank, there
will be nightly reports from Salt Lake City by comedians Dave
Chapelle and Howie Mandel, as well as Ross "The Intern" Matthews.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the shows will feature appearances by Olympic athletes,
musical performances from Salt Lake City and medal ceremonies hosted
by Pat O'Brien. There also will be a 10-minute nightly recap by Dan
Hicks at the end.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Leno will check in with Costas and Couric in Salt Lake
City after his monologue.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, Leno's guests include First Lady Laura Bush and Britney
Spears on Monday, the U.S. women's bobsled team Tuesday and Picabo
Street on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   All or Nothing</TE>
<TE>   One of the highlights of tonight's opening ceremony will be the
lighting of the caldron. Who will light it is anybody's guess.</TE>
<TE>   One person it won't be is Eric Heiden.</TE>
<TE>   The five-time gold-medal winning speedskater, a guest on the
Sporting News radio network Thursday morning with Jay Mariotti and
Jim Litke, said, "They asked if I'd be one of the guys carrying the
torch, and I told them I wanted to be the last guy.</TE>
<TE>   "They said they couldn't do that, and I said, 'Well, then I have
other things to do.' So I turned them down."</TE>
<TE>   Heiden said he was disappointed. "I thought it'd be an honor," he
said. "I thought I was a pretty good candidate."</TE>
<TE>   New Radio Show</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson has agreed to do a one-hour radio show for the
Sporting News network, beginning next week. It will be broadcast
nationally and carried locally on KMPC (1540) Mondays at 3 p.m. Chris
Myers, who will serve as the host, said, "It will be about a lot more
than just hoops."</TE>
<TE>   Motor Sports</TE>
<TE>   Speedvision, now owned by Fox, is being re-launched as Speed
Channel on Monday. Fox has spent the last six months revamping the
channel. A big plus is that Speed Channel will have NASCAR
programming. Also, according to channel President Jim Liberatore,
there will be a lot more live racing than before.</TE>
<TE>   The new channel's lineup will include the popular "Inside Winston
Cup" on Mondays at 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The channel is available in 46 million homes, and Liberatore said
that number should increase to 60 million within the next two to
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, this weekend's Winternationals at Pomona mark the
beginning of the second year of a five-year partnership between the
NHRA and ESPN. The first year was regarded a success, and ESPN and
its family of networks will devote more than 110 hours of programming
to the 23-event, $50-million Powerade drag racing series this
year.... TNT has hired Tony Stewart as a special contributor for its
Daytona 500 coverage, beginning with Sunday's Bud Shootout.... Cross
promotion: A Daytona 500 promo NBC will be running during the
Olympics next week has Dale Earnhardt Jr. driving a zamboni at a
hockey venue.</TE>
<TE>   Flexibility Needed</TE>
<TE>   ABC has been trying to get the NFL to give it some flexibility
with its "Monday Night Football" schedule, and it now has some more
facts to back its case.</TE>
<TE>   The New England Patriots were not on "Monday Night Football" this
season, and that makes the third time in four years the Super Bowl
champion wasn't on the schedule. And of the last eight Super Bowl
teams, six weren't on the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Volleyball News</TE>
<TE>   The Assn. of Volleyball Professionals will be back on NBC for the
first time since 1997 with live coverage of two tournaments this
summer--the Manhattan Beach Open on Aug. 11 and the Chicago Open on
Aug. 25.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have this potential to build this relationship with
[NBC] if we can prove the sport is hot again," said AVP chief
executive Leonard Armato, who purchased the AVP last year. "It's
uplifting to see them willing to get involved with the sport again."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Announcers</TE>
<TE>   The Angels announced their new radio broadcast team this week.</TE>
<TE>   Rory Markas, who will be the lead announcer, is from the San
Fernando Valley and is familiar to most sports fans.</TE>
<TE>   His new partner, Terry Smith, 46, comes from Columbus, Ohio, where
he was the announcer for the Columbus Clippers for the last 19 years.
The Clippers are the New York Yankees' triple-A affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   Smith also did Ohio State football and basketball from 1986-97.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, a native of Philadelphia, attended Temple for two years and
then Jones College in Jacksonville, Fla. During his junior year at
Jones he began his broadcasting career as an announcer for the
Jacksonville Suns, a double-A team.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the selection process said nearly 70 applicants
and their audition tapes were reviewed before Markas and Smith were
hired.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net will be moving its regional offices from the
Westside to downtown L.A. at 1100 Flower in early April. At the same
time the "Southern California Sports Report" will begin broadcasting
from a new studio inside Staples Center.... Former Playboy playmate
Lisa Dergan, a sports reporter for Channel 2, has moved to Fox Sports
Net.</TE>
<TE>   Here's good news for NBC, which is hoping to attract young viewers
to the Olympics: The just-concluded Winter X Games on ESPN and ESPN2
drew a record number of viewers. Sunday's telecast on ESPN got a 1.04
cable rating.</TE>
<TE>   As part of NBA All-Star weekend, Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson
will be interviewed by Roy Firestone on the 8 a.m. edition of ESPN's
"SportsCenter" on Sunday. On the same show, Dick Vitale will present
his All-Will Smith team of versatile players. UCLA's Jason Kapono is
on the team.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN's "The Block" on Sunday begins at 5 p.m. with the first of a
two-part documentary, "The Season: Behind Bars." It's about a Texas
football team made up of juveniles in maximum-security detention.</TE>
<TE>   At 6:30 p.m. will be "SportsCentury: 1980," the first of a series
of year-by-year reviews. At 7 p.m. will be "Sidelines: L.A. Hoops,"
which offers a behind-the-scenes look at the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   John Wooden, a guest on KSPN (1110) Thursday with Joe McDonnell
and Doug Krikorian, was asked what he'd do differently if he were
coaching today. "I guess I'd have to let the players have tattoos,"
he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA is often preoccupied with offense and dismissive of the dirty
work of defense, like someone who loves to cook but refuses to clean
up.</LD>
<LD>   But against USC on Wednesday, the opposite was true. The Bruins
wanted to avoid a season sweep by the Trojans so badly they clamped
down, holding USC to 38.7% shooting in the 67-65 victory.</LD>
<LD>   There were flaws. Center Dan Gadzuric was timid early because he
wanted to avoid fouls, and Sam Clancy scored 12 of the Trojans' first
14 points, all on shots inside five feet.</LD>
<TE>   And the Bruins were so focused on stopping seniors David
Bluthenthal and Brandon Granville, who were four of 18 shooting, that
previously unknown Gennaro Busterna was left open to make three
three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   But overall, this was UCLA's best defensive game. Rico Hines took
charges on consecutive possessions, Matt Barnes took a charge and
Gadzuric blocked two shots. On several occasions USC had trouble
getting off a shot in 35 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, so did the Bruins. All the attention to defense left
them less focused with the ball--witness their 18 turnovers and the
dry spell in the last eight minutes that resulted in an 11-point lead
evaporating.</TE>
<TE>   Had Billy Knight not made the winning shot at the buzzer, the
offensive disarray would be a more pertinent topic. As it is, the
Bruins noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "We played defense and rebounded because we knew that would be the
key," Barnes said. "But we lost our flow on offense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kapono made all eight of his free throws against the
Trojans, stretching his streak without a miss to 20. He has made 30
of his last 31, improving to 87.4% for the season.</TE>

<HD>Bibby Prescribes Rest for His Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of Wednesday night's shocking, last-second 67-65 loss to
UCLA, USC took Thursday off. The scheduled break allows the Trojans a
chance to regroup after their third loss of the season on a
last-second three-point basket.</LD>
<LD>   No. 25 USC (16-6 overall, 8-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference) has an
eight-day break between games, and Coach Henry Bibby plans to lay low
with Arizona State coming to town next Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "What we try to do as a staff is to monitor as much as we can in
terms of playing time and practicing," Bibby said of the lull. "We'll
really cut back and not go as hard and try to eliminate injuries.</LD>
<TE>   "It will be important that we monitor the kids more, be more
conscious of what they eat and their rest than we've probably done in
the past. And probably cut down on the practice times, [have] more
skull sessions, more film, more shooting, more walking through things
... try to eliminate injuries and fatigue."</TE>
<TE>   With his program still in the fetal stage of being a national
power, Bibby frowns upon playing what he says are needless
nonconference games immediately after facing UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Only once since Bibby was named coach in 1996 have the Trojans
played a non-Pac-10 opponent after meeting the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati pummeled the Trojans, 100-81, in 1997 and Bibby has
since opted to take a break after each UCLA game.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins, meanwhile, will travel to Philadelphia to face
Villanova on Saturday. Earlier this year, the Bruins upset then-No. 1
Kansas at Pauley Pavilion less than 48 hours after losing to USC at
the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't do that," Bibby said of UCLA Coach Steve Lavin scheduling
nonconference games against "name" schools after the intra-city
rivalry game.</TE>
<TE>   "But everybody has a different opinion. I'm not right or wrong,
Steve Lavin's not right or wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "My thinking is I think the kids get tired so you back off them. I
don't need Brandon Granville hurt in a nonconference game. The most
important thing to me now is rest and the Pac-10."</TE>

<HD>No. 2 Stanford Stops Oregon</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanford finally figured out how to beat Oregon at MacArthur Court:
Make free throws.</LD>
<LD>   Lindsey Yamasaki scored 24 points, and second-ranked Stanford
overcame an early deficit to beat Oregon, 77-72, Thursday night at
Eugene, Ore. and remain unbeaten in the Pacific Conference.</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinal made 17 of 19 free throws in the final 3:58 to end a
three-year winless streak at Oregon.</LD>
<TE>   The game was tied at 58 when a layup by Yamasaki put the Cardinal
ahead for good. That was Stanford's last field goal. Nicole Powell,
who made eight of 11 free throws, scored 20 points for Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (23-1, 13-0) led, 38-31, at halftime. But Oregon (12-11,
7-7), led by Shaquala Williams with 22 points, made its first seven
shots of the second half to take a 45-44 lead with 16:03 left.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's Alissa Edwards made a layup, a three-point basket and a
jump shot to put the Ducks ahead, 50-46, with 12:42 left before
Stanford rallied.</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Tennessee 93, Arkansas 65--Kara Lawson scored a career-high
30 points, including 19 in the second half at Knoxville, Tenn., for
the Lady Vols (19-2, 8-1 SEC).</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Duke 83, Wake Forest 60--lana Beard scored nine of her 15
points during a 16-2 run in the first half, and the Blue Devils
clinched a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference title at
Winston-Salem, N.C. Duke (20-3, 12-0) has won 10 in a row and 16 of
17.</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Purdue 80, Illinois 69--Shereka Wright tied a career high
with 26 points and the Boilermakers (19-3, 10-2 Big 10) used a 9-0
run down the stretch to pull away at Champaign, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Louisiana Tech 82, Hawaii 53--Cheryl Ford had 17 points and
12 rebounds at Ruston, La., leading the Lady Techsters (17-3, 12-0)
to their 75th consecutive Western Athletic Conference victory.</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 South Carolina 64, No. 22 Georgia 59--Shaunzinski Gortman
scored 18 points and led a pressing attack that forced 26 turnovers
as the Gamecocks won at Columbia, S.C. With the game tied at 47,
South Carolina (19-3, 7-2 Southeastern) turned on the pressure,
forcing five Georgia turnovers in three minutes to spark an 11-2 run.</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Colorado State 58, Utah 53--Ashley Augspurger had 19 points
and seven rebounds, and Angie Gorton made four free throws in the
final minute for the Rams (18-4, 7-1) at Fort Collins, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 Minnesota 79, Ohio St. 64--Janel McCarville had 14 points
and 15 rebounds for the Gophers (18-4, 8-3) at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa 76, No. 21 Wisconsin 64--Jennie Lillis and Jerica Watson each
scored 18 points for the Hawkeyes at Madison, Wis. Iowa handed
Wisconsin its sixth consecutive loss after a 16-1 start. Iowa is
14-8, 7-5 and Wisconsin is 16-7, 7-6.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama 92, No. 25 Mississippi St. 86--LaNisha Cartwell had 19
points and the Crimson Tide (14-8, 4-5) overcame 33 points by the
Bulldogs' LaToya Thomas at Tuscaloosa, Ala.</TE>
