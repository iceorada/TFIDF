<HD>Caught in the Act</HD>
<DH>RAPTURE, By Susan Minot, Alfred A. Knopf: 122 pp., $18</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS CURWEN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What do men and women think about when they're making love? Some
things, it seems, are better not known, especially in the case of
Benjamin Young and Kay Bailey. In a physically intimate moment that
she initiates, their thoughts collide. God, he is lovely, she revels.
I don't understand women, he concludes.</LD>
<LD>   Simple conceits seem to be the strength of the fiction of Susan
Minot, whose highly acclaimed novel, "Evening," published in 1998,
was the reconstructed memory of a woman lying on her deathbed. As a
protracted interior monologue, "Evening" is really no different than
"Rapture," only "Rapture" is a duet played in the minds of Benjamin
and Kay in flagrante delicto one June afternoon in an apartment in
New York City. While the action may be simple, what lies beneath is
most certainly not.</LD>
<TE>   His breath on her skin, the clasp of his arms around her--and the
important fact that his on-again, off-again fiancee, Vanessa, might
finally be out of the picture--were too much for Kay to bear. He had
just come over to her place for lunch and now this: a distraction
made all the more distracting by the fact that it has nothing to do
with love or with lust. By jumping the story from her mind to his,
Minot has taken what might have been a sexy, even comic,
romp--similar to other repasts taken by such writers as John Updike,
Erica Jong and Harold Brodkey--and turned it into something far more
serious and far less fun.</TE>
<TE>   As their thoughts unwind, "Rapture" becomes a story about the
rationalizations that drive men and women together, for between Kay
and Benjamin there is no chemistry, no animal magnetism, only the
thinking that once made it so. "Rapture" is, as the title ironically
suggests, less about ecstatic transport than it is about
powerlessness: As much as Kay wants to be in control, as much as
Benjamin wants to speak his mind, neither is able to.</TE>
<TE>   Playing off the role of the imagination and memory in maintaining
erotic momentum, Minot lets Benjamin and Kay reveal their histories,
starting with the day when she walked into his office to apply for a
job as a production designer for his fledging film company. Three
years and so many broken resolutions later, Benjamin and Kay are a
man and a woman fumbling together in a moment of one-sided desire. It
isn't a grand moment. It isn't a romantic moment. It is a
particularly ordinary moment--as much about them, as it is about
Benjamin and his inability to disconnect (or even connect) with
Vanessa.</TE>
<TE>   In another world, Benjamin and Kay might have been the couple who
kept us awake in the throes of their passion, but today their screams
are mute. Lust has dropped off as the human condition crept in, and
the difficulties of being a man and a woman in this world--both
dependent and independent, in need and autonomous--fix the tenor of
the story. Here sex is the illusion that you know someone and are
connected to that person, while love is "a road at first wonderfully
lush and appealing which very quickly [deteriorates] into an
impenetrable mass of brambles." If the flesh is certain, the mind
never is.</TE>
<TE>   Minot has not taken her notions about sex and love much
further than she did in her 1989 collection, "Lust," in which men are
predators and women are ripe for disappointment. In this case,
Benjamin is passive and self-centered, unable to tell the truth or
recognize the price that his own needs exact upon others, and Kay is
the perfect pawn, a woman whose resolve melts under the heat of her
own wishful thinking.</TE>
<TE>   By the end Kay thinks she has done something to bring them closer.
She says the only words spoken in real time: "That was worship," a
phrase as selfless and hollow and forlorn as the episode itself.
Benjamin's response--the moment upon which the suspense of the entire
story breathlessly hangs--is sadly predictable. Either Kay needs to
improve her technique, Benjamin his focus or Minot should have
realized that sex, as a narrative device, is a flimsy pretext for a
story. In the sealed air of this room, so crowded by hope, fear,
guilt and misgivings, one begins to beg for a breeze from the outside
world.</TE>
<TE>   "Rapture" might have been more effective at half its length
or with that breeze brought in. Although the tendency may be to leap
from the confines of this story into some broader realization about
the meaning of love and sex, Minot writes her characters with such
particulars that we walk away knowing no more than what we suspected
in the beginning. Which is the real disappointment of this story.</TE>

<LD>DAYS OF WONDER</LD>
<LD>   New &amp; Selected Poems</LD>
<LD>   By Grace Schulman</LD>
<TE>   Houghton Mifflin: 160 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   There are only a handful of poets who are "recognized," that is to
say, acknowledged as influential presences in the art. Of this
handful, most are men. Women who write, from Carolyn Kizer to
Kathleen Fraser (to name just two who've influenced my life as a
poet), are often relegated to the waiting room of critical opinion.
There should be more poets in the contemporary pantheon. There should
be more poets (deserving writers of both sexes) whose work is
followed with the attention we owe to poetry.</TE>
<TE>   Grace Schulman is a writer of mature power and passion. Her later
work confirms, as Harold Bloom says, her "emergence into authentic
eminence." Her book, "Days of Wonder," offers selected poems from her
four earlier books as well as new work.</TE>
<TE>   In the book's epigraph, Schulman quotes Chaucer: "The lyf so
shorte, the craft so long to lerne." This sentiment informs her
perspective, from the whimsical humor of "Poetry Editor" (She was
poetry editor at The Nation for many years) to the dark beauty of
"Notes From Underground: W.H. Auden on the Lexington Avenue IRT."</TE>
<TE>   The excitement of witnessing this poet's growth from poem to poem
and book to book belongs to the reader following the "altering light"
of the earthly to the presence of the miraculous, from sonnets to
ghazals, to "the blue wonder of what might be."</TE>

<TE>   CASCADIA</TE>
<TE>   By Brenda Hillman</TE>
<TE>   Wesleyan University Press:</TE>
<TE>   78 pp., $12.99 paper</TE>
<TE>   William Wordsworth said (in his famous Preface) that it is assumed
that when an "Author" writes that "he will gratify certain known
habits of association," thus defending his own writing against the
judgments of readers used to John Dryden, Alexander Pope and Samuel
Johnson. As another famous poet noted in an essay on Obscurity, it is
necessary to defend the "modern poet" against the reader accustomed
to Wordsworth. Obscurity is a charge leveled against a good deal of
contemporary poetry--and not without justification. For each (rare)
authentic and original poet, there rises up a mob of imitators--and
much "disjunctive" and "experimental" poetry easily falls into the
category of boring, self-conscious, "subjectless" brain drone. At
first glance, Brenda Hillman's "Cascadia" seems precious--with its
words falling out of the text and landing on the bottom of the page
or in the side margins--as if its syntax were spun in a centrifuge.</TE>
<TE>   most natives A poem floats</TE>

<TE>   an impasse</TE>
<TE>   Better not to</TE>
<TE>   blame</TE>
<TE>   The loved one</TE>
<TE>   for a slip</TE>
<TE>   However, "Cascadia" has a subject. Or rather, two subjects:
geology and heroin addiction--the shifting prism of the two
preoccupations (and the flashing distractions of style) draw the
reader away from known "habits of association."</TE>
<TE>   Cascadia, Hillman tells us, is what California was called when it
was underwater.</TE>

<TE>   merge it floated</TE>
<TE>   Tulelake Why did the</TE>
<TE>   chicken cross</TE>

<TE>   I recommend this book to all who doubt poetry's capacity to
reinvent itself. Hillman is making language dance for her. In the
words of "Shirley"--an eccentric, inventive doctor's wife whom
Hillman "recreates," along with Shirley's 1851 California--"I never
did care much for water in the abstract, though it's useful to make
coffee."</TE>

<TE>   CHANGEABLE THUNDER</TE>
<TE>   By David Baker</TE>
<TE>   University of Arkansas Press:</TE>
<TE>   104 pp., $16 paper</TE>
<TE>   David Baker's "Changeable Thunder" is an original and haunting
collection of poems. Notions of thunder as both the voice of the
jeremiad and Old Testament judgment, reference to Hesiod and magical
ion-charged air are woven by Baker throughout the book.</TE>
<TE>   The level of attentiveness in these poems, which build on the
American vernacular and a developing sense of American "identity" is
inspired and unflinching. Here he gives us Midwest Georgics:</TE>
<TE>   The wind is the weather. The worst will blow</TE>
<TE>   off the surge in a matter of</TE>
<TE>   moments--</TE>
<TE>   the best is a blessing, less rain</TE>
<TE>   or ruin</TE>
<TE>   but no less a shock for the</TE>
<TE>   suddenness.</TE>
<TE>   Baker introduces Thomas Carlyle, Roland Barthes, Ann Carson and
Paul Celan to the Rev. Edward Taylor and the struggling Ohio
farmer--and he makes the "conversation" last.</TE>

<DH>THE CAT FROM HUE: A Vietnam War Story, By John Laurence,
PublicAffairs: 864 pp. $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY KARNOW</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The shelves in my study are crammed from floor to ceiling with
Vietnam volumes--novels, poetry, memoirs, photographs, sketches. It
seems that every Army, Marine, Navy and Air Force unit has put out
its own history. Veterans deluge me with recollections of their
exploits; periodically I receive a now-it-can-be-told manuscript by a
former covert agent. Bookshops and libraries are congested with
retrospective, frequently self-serving analyses by officials,
diplomats, generals and admirals. The previously secret tapes of
presidential conversations are being published. The war is the
subject of movies and documentaries, even a musical. It is taught in
schools and colleges by instructors who weren't born when it began to
students who weren't born when it ended. Lately enemy soldiers have
been relating their experiences, which are remarkably analogous to
those of our own grunts.</LD>
<LD>   Given this surfeit, you might wonder whether there is more to be
said about Vietnam that we don't already know. But, judging from John
Laurence's phenomenal account, "The Cat from Hue," we have only
scratched the surface.</LD>
<TE>   The conflict lured a plethora of ambitious young journalists
hoping to launch their careers, Laurence among them. He arrived in
Southeast Asia in August 1965, as U.S. involvement was escalating;
and, with interruptions for other assignments, remained for five
years. As a correspondent with CBS he was present at such pivotal
episodes as the battle of the Ia Drang Valley, the siege of Khe Sanh,
the fight for Hue and the American incursion into Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   Several of his over-eager colleagues died trying to make their
reputations, but he survived, which could explain the cryptic title
of his book, "The Cat From Hue." It alludes to the filthy, forlorn
kitten he picked up in the rubble during the horrendous struggle for
the imperial city of Hue in February 1968. I construe it to be a
metaphor for himself--as if he, like the animal, was endowed with
nine lives.</TE>
<TE>   With some notable exceptions, print reporters tended to cover the
action only occasionally, as I did. But TV correspondents and
cameramen were required to capture the images that their audiences
could view in the comfort of their living rooms. Thus they had to be
in the field constantly. And Laurence was in the thick of it,
day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month, courting extraordinary
risks. Friends accused him of obsessively nurturing a death wish. For
him, it was his job.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to many of his contemporaries, who usually gathered
just enough information to produce the brief sound bites that
accompanied their footage, he accumulated more material than he could
possibly use on the air. So his narrative is a catalog of detail,
some of it numbing, most of it vivid, all of it significant. He was a
combined audio and video system.</TE>
<TE>   His delineation of infantrymen edging forward is not merely an
inventory but illustrates the way heavily equipped American troops
operated in the hostile terrain. They were an interminable human
conveyor belt sweating in the suffocating tropical heat and humidity
as they carried "rifle ammunition, machinegun bullets, mortar shells,
hand grenades, rockets, tank gun canisters, high explosives, food,
water, batteries, mail, medicine, morphine, IV fluids, bandages, body
bags."</TE>
<TE>   He portrays the wounded and dying as they lay on tiers of
blood-soaked stretchers in airplanes and helicopters, traumatized and
sobbing in pain as they waited to be evacuated to hospitals. "Some of
them had lost entire arms and legs, some only fingers, hands, feet,
ears, eyes, pieces of skull." Implicit in his description of this
grotesque scene is the message that we were not the invincible Rambos
depicted by Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing, however trivial, eludes Laurence's keen vision. When he
seeks shelter in a house in Hue during the height of the battle, he
notices that the garden in the rear is "tangled with tall vines" and
"fat leafy plants," and hears beneath the foliage a "gurgling stream"
and the screeching of "invisible insects."</TE>
<TE>   Enclosed in a courtyard, the pastel stucco, tile-roofed villa was
"graceful, harmonious and elegant," and probably belonged to an
upper-crust Vietnamese clan. Laurence pictures the parents and
grandparents and great-grandparents as they convened weeks before
with their progeny to celebrate Tet, the lunar New Year, the sacred
holiday. Their house would have been decorated with "bright-colored
flower blossoms, lanterns and handmade prints," and smelled of
fresh-baked pastries and other delicacies. They would have assembled
to exchange gossip, and observe such ancient rituals as tending
family tombs and honoring ancestors. The elders would sit with the
children, laughing and regaling them with folk tales. Then, while
they slept off the festivities, the war burst upon them with the
"convulsions of a volcano." The sudden Communist attack--aggravated
by the cataclysmic American bombings--killed thousands, whose mangled
cadavers were bulldozed into mass graves.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to the canard that the press corps opposed America's
intervention in Southeast Asia, virtually all the journalists who
covered the conflict during its initial phase firmly believed that
the commitment was necessary. David Halberstam, invariably cited as
an early critic of the war, commented in 1964 that Vietnam was "a
strategic country in a key area [and] perhaps one of only five or six
nations in the world that is truly vital to U.S. interests."</TE>
<TE>   Other reporters, myself included, echoed the same thesis until we
perceived that the American forces, despite their overwhelmingly
superior firepower, faced adversaries prepared to accept unlimited
losses to achieve their goal. We witnessed their corpses piled up
like cordwood following every clash and saw that the enterprise was
fruitless.</TE>
<TE>   It is unsurprising that Laurence would ultimately discover after
slogging through the snarled jungles, mangrove swamps and flooded
rice fields that the U.S. crusade to obstruct the spread of communism
was not only futile but catastrophic: "America came to Vietnam to
save it from evil," pulverized the land and "ended up sacrificing its
own soul."</TE>
<TE>   He predictably excoriates President Lyndon B. Johnson, Defense
Secretary Robert S. McNamara, Gen. William Westmoreland and the rest
of the U.S. leadership for their "blind plunge into a maelstrom of
anguish." Nor does he spare the slick spokesmen insulated in their
air-conditioned Saigon offices who blatantly lied or contorted the
truth in their endeavor to persuade the public at home to support the
campaign in Vietnam even though they knew that it was failing badly.
Their daily news conferences, a litany of phony statistics and rosy
forecasts, were eventually lampooned as the "Five O'Clock Follies."
The phrase "credibility gap," which skeptics applied to the
calculated policy of deception subsequently practiced in Panama,
Grenada, Somalia and the Persian Gulf, originated in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately Laurence resists the temptation to bloviate on the
global consequences of Vietnam though he concludes on a banal note,
suggesting that the "best legacy" of the horrendous venture would be
a "deep and sincere love between people of the two countries" based
on "where we have been together [and] what we have endured." But that
lapse is a minor flaw in a dramatic personal chronicle that will
stand as a unique contribution to the colossal array of Vietnam
literature.</TE>

<HD>Not Another Teen Novel</HD>
<DH>THE ROTTERS' CLUB, A Novel, By Jonathan Coe, Alfred A.
Knopf: 422 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN LEVI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are many--Yanks and Brits alike--who think of England in the
1970s as a nation stuck in an eternal teatime of irrelevance,
desperately struggling for a smidgen of historical attention through
the Dada antics of Monty Python and David Bowie. They forget that the
island nation was still paying for its once-mighty empire. They
forget (if they can even remember) the 1972 flight of Ugandan Indians
from the brutal regime of Idi Amin. They forget the abominable
reception of the refugees in a country in which the racist,
ultra-nationalist National Front proved a far stronger force than
many had imagined (and they certainly forget that demigod Eric
Clapton's drunken attack upon immigration on the stage of the
Birmingham Odeon in 1976). They forget the IRA.</LD>
<LD>   Here comes Jonathan Coe, however, to remind us of all the above,
and particularly to tell us that, in that far-off decade, there was a
city called Birmingham. This Birmingham--long before Simon Rattle
civilized it with a baton--was a city with a British Leyland
automobile factory that had management and a union. It was a city
with many pubs, some of which were destroyed by IRA bombs. Most
importantly, it was a city that housed a middling public school, King
William's, "the toffs' school," as one automobile worker called it,
that, fortunately for this novel, also admitted children of other
classes and colors on scholarship.</LD>
<TE>   "The Rotters' Club" is the story of four of those children--Sean
Harding, an anarchic comedian; Philip Chase, a confused artist; Doug
Anderton, radical son of a British Leyland shop steward; and Ben
Trotter, the son of Doug's father's boss--as they muddle through the
"forgotten" part of the '70s, from factory strikes and pub bombings
to the acquisition of A-levels and the loss of their virginities.</TE>
<TE>   The novel takes its title from a song by the band Hatfield and the
North, also the name given to young Ben Trotter and his sister Lois,
whose names are wickedly mispronounced (as only adolescents can) as
Bent Rotter and Lowest Rotter. Hatfield and the North, along with
other forgotten bands of the '70s like Henry Cow and Curved Air,
provide a confectionery nostalgia that Coe sprinkles occasionally
upon the narrative for the reader to snort up when the tempo begins
to lag.</TE>
<TE>   Sad to say, the tempo not only lags but has all the canned appeal
of a mid-1970s rhythm machine. Coe fails quite completely to create
real characters to drive his historical novel. His gang of four and
their supporting cast are less 1970s British equivalents of the
American teenagers who populate "American Pie," "Bring It On" and
"Ten Things I Hate About You," than the cartoons of "Not Another Teen
Movie" with its pastiche of broad-band teenage stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   There is the token black who is good at sports, the token racist
who gets his comeuppance, the token beautiful, self-involved girl who
turns out (amazingly!) to have a soul, the token self-doubting writer
who nevertheless gets into Oxford, the nerd, the politico, the town
drunk, the innocent girl suffering from shock and depression, even
the token unpronounceable Welsh town. Worst of all, there is even
(thanks to a random Trotter family trip to Denmark) a token, tragic
tale of the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   Coe earnestly dredges the archives of the '70s from Lonely Hearts'
ads to T.S. Eliot's "Burnt Norton" and Jonathan Wood's definitive
"Wheels of Misfortune: The Rise and Fall of the British Motor
Industry" (his acknowledgments run to 21/2 pages.) And much of "The
Rotters' Club" is redolent with the byproducts of that dredging. Time
and again, Coe chooses history over drama, fact over fascination. On
the basis of "The Rotters' Club," a teenager looking backward in the
year 2003 might well believe that the third dimension passed
Birmingham by in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rotters' Club" finishes not with a bang but with a threat:
"There will be a sequel to 'The Rotters' Club,' entitled 'The Closed
Circle,'" says an author's note at the end, "resuming the story in
the late 1990s"--by which time, it is devoutly to be wished, the
characters may have acquired some substance.</TE>

<DH>SOUNDS OF THE RIVER: A Memoir, By Da Chen, HarperCollins:
320 pp., $25.95</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Colors of the Mountain," Da Chen recalled his childhood in a
small Chinese village during the brutalizing years of the Cultural
Revolution. By the end of the memoir, Mao Tse-tung had died and the
dark chaos of those years had just begun to dissipate. "Sounds of the
River" picks up the story with 16-year-old Chen standing on a train
platform with the equivalent of $1.50 in his pocket, waiting to catch
the express to the capital where he has received a full scholarship
to study English at the Beijing Language Institute.</LD>
<LD>   During the Cultural Revolution, knowing English was grounds for
public self-criticism or worse--being labeled a lover of the West and
therefore suspect, being beaten. But as an old roue on the train
tells Chen, English-language majors are suddenly "hot." They not only
have their pick of jobs but they're like honey to girls. More
important, English is the one language that can offer a way out of
China. Chen arrives in the capital with his goals set: graduate at
the top of his class and go to America. Easier said than done.</LD>
<TE>   Chen may have been the brightest English student back in his home
village, but it takes him weeks before he begins to understand the
English that's spoken in his classes. Furthermore, he's from the
countryside, which means that the Beijing dialect his professors and
fellow students speak is also nearly unintelligible to him. To make
matters worse, Chen is very poor in a city of many temptations. And
it's China, so although it's supposedly an egalitarian society, the
Chinese students aren't allowed to mingle with the foreign students,
share in their better food or have anything remotely resembling their
comfortable living arrangements. As a result, the kids in Chen's
dormitory are prone to hepatitis B, must stand in line once a week to
share a spigot in the communal shower and are constantly reminded not
to fraternize.</TE>
<TE>   One other aspect of Chinese life makes Chen's situation
precarious: In a country of more than a billion people, everyone
knows everything about everyone else. So just when things begin to go
well, the dean calls Chen in to chastise him for not attending
political studies class, then, knowing full well what the impact will
be on the young man before him, maliciously notes that Chen is from a
landlord's family, one of the lowliest of the nine categories of
enemies of the revolution and therefore open to all manner of
persecution. "It was a dirty secret," Chen writes, "a skeleton, a
disgrace, an incurable handicap, an ugly birthmark." This black mark
has chased Chen from the countryside to Beijing, where model students
now secretly report on his daily conduct. As Chen puts it, the campus
is "just an old drama with a new cast, and politics [are] still the
deadliest toxin" threatening his dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Undaunted, Chen follows his father's motto: Diligence will defeat
the biggest foe. He works harder than any other student. He receives
spiritual sustenance from his "pathetically powerless but enormously
resilient" family. He embraces humanity right down to what might be
termed bathroom humor. Despite numerous hardships and struggles--the
debilitating illnesses, the constant worry about funds, the payment
of bribes with no results and the mysterious death of a
roommate--Chen maintains great optimism and humor.</TE>
<TE>   He loves language and wonders about the meaning of "But-Why-Sir?"
(Budweiser beer.) On a visit home, he gives his old buddies copies of
Western girlie magazines with amusing results. He temporarily embarks
on a side career as a translator for the first NBA tour to China in
1982. Suffice to say that back then China had neither tour buses nor
hotel beds large enough to accommodate Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's legs.
Through it all, Chen, like so many immigrants before him, stays
focused on getting to America. He never becomes bitter or cruel.
Rather, his kindness is remembered and rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese emigre literature has brought to these shores many new and
interesting voices--the haunting lyricism of Ha Jin, the harsh
worldview of Anchee Min, the righteous indignation of Adeline Yen
Mah. Da Chen's voice comes from the soil of China. He is
earthy--perhaps too earthy for some readers--and sometimes his
chronology wavers, but his exuberance for life and its possibilities
set him apart from others in the genre.</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds of the River" ends in 1985 with Chen saying goodbye to his
parents yet again. This time he's about to fly to America with $30 in
his pocket and a mind filled with enough stories--and dreams--to fill
many more volumes.</TE>

<DH>THE POWER OF BABEL: A Natural History of Language, By John
McWhorter, Times Books: 328 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY NUNBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Man invented language!" That was the thesis that Johann Gottfried
von Herder advanced in a famous 1772 essay that won the prize offered
by the Berlin Academy for the most satisfactory answer to the
question, "Left to their natural faculties, would men be capable of
inventing language?" It was a claim that might have stood in for the
whole of the intellectual program of the Enlightenment in its
confident certainty that the most pervasive of human institutions
could have originated out of the exercise of human reason, rather
than from divine imposition. Not surprisingly, other writers of the
age expatiated on the topic. The Abbe Condillac saw the origin of
language as a paramount step in the transition from nature to
culture. For Jean Jacques Rousseau, the earliest language was
indistinguishable from the dance and arose out of gestures expressive
of human passion, which was why gesture still played such an
important role in the languages of "southern peoples" like the
Italians, who were still ruled by their emotions.</LD>
<TE>   By the 19th century, though, language was no longer regarded as an
institution invented by humans and evolving from a primitive to a
developed state. Rather, it was a faculty that was unchanged since
"the first dawn of human life and human thought," as the philologist
Max Mueller put it in 1861, and the business of scientific
linguistics was to trace its development "in exactly the same spirit
in which the geologist treats his stones and his petrifactions." The
unscientific speculations of the 18th century philosophers were set
aside; as the British linguist Albert Ellis wrote in 1873: "We shall
do more by tracing the historical growth of one single work-a-day
tongue, than by filling wastepaper baskets with reams of paper
covered with speculations on the origins of all tongues." And indeed,
when the Linguistic Society of Paris was incorporated in 1866, it
adopted a charter provision that banned "any paper concerning the
origin of language." That was the time when the concerns of the
science of linguistics began to diverge from the concerns of ordinary
people, and the field has never looked back. Now, as in the 19th
century, historical linguistics focuses on the patterns of change
that are always at work on languages, which operate with the
relentless obduracy of scientific laws. It's a discipline with
neither patience nor place for the notions that most people have
about language change: that language is the direct expression of
culture and changes in response to cultural pressures, that languages
evolve from primitive to developed stages, and that change can happen
for the better or the worse.</TE>
<TE>   John McWhorter's "The Power of Babel" is an entertaining and
informative exposition of the scientific view of language change,
which ought to do for historical linguistics what Stephen Pinker did
for general linguistics with his 1994 bestseller, "The Language
Instinct." McWhorter has an engaging, personal style and a bottomless
trunk of metaphors to draw from--at various points he compares human
languages to cloud formations, dinosaur species, bushes, lava lamps
and Rodgers and Hart musicals. And he has a wide knowledge of the
world's languages: His examples are drawn not just from familiar
Western languages such as English, French and German, but from
languages such as Cantonese, Xhosa, Welsh, Maori, Russian and Hindi.
(Some readers are apt to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of
examples, but McWhorter is clearly a writer in love with his subject
matter and readers who aren't taking the course for credit will find
it easy enough to skip around.)</TE>
<TE>   Language changes in multiple ways. Sounds change, as "shut up"
morphs into "shaddup." Grammar changes, so that we no longer use verb
forms such as "speaketh" and "speakest." And meanings change--while
Ginger Rogers could use "make love" in the 1935 musical "Top Hat" to
mean simply "woo," the implication today would be a bit more direct.
Languages can split into multiple dialects. (However, like most
linguists, McWhorter holds that the distinction between "languages"
and "dialects" is political--from the linguistic point of view, as he
puts it, "dialects are all there is.") And on occasion, two languages
can blend to form a new one, called a creole, through a process that
McWhorter describes as linguistic macrame. That process gave rise to
the ancestor of the variety that we call Black English, and
McWhorter, a specialist in creoles, gives a very lucid explanation of
the evolution.</TE>
<TE>   Along with other linguists, McWhorter holds that processes of
change are as inevitable as biological evolution or continental
drift; those who imagine they can oppose or retard the course of
change are merely "shaking their fists at the rain." Nor does change
have much to do with the ebb and flow of the culture that language is
swimming around in. It's a mistake, he says, to suppose that there's
"anything inherently French about 'taking' a beverage ... instead of
drinking it or inherently English about 'taking' a nap, whereas the
French 'make' one." And he gives short shrift to the notion that
change can be evaluated as progress or decay, or that some language
varieties are "better" than others. From the linguistic point of
view, he says, it's "all systems normal"; "standard" languages are
simply dialects that happened to be in the right place at the right
time. It's the larger themes such as these that make McWhorter's book
recommended reading even for people with only a limited interest in
the technical details of language change. Along the way, he scores
some nice points about other cherished beliefs about language
change--for example, the idea that English's triumph as a world
language was abetted by its inherent "flexibility" in assimilating
loan words from other languages, when the truth is any other language
would have looked just as flexible if it had had an equally
cosmopolitan history.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's unlikely that McWhorter's book will do much by way of
dispelling any of these notions. Over the years, linguists have
turned out any number of lively popularizations of their science,
including a few bestsellers such as "The Language Instinct." Yet
people have shown no readiness to abandon their traditional notions
about language and language change in the way they've been willing to
shed their prescientific ideas about evolution, say. One reason for
this is that for a real understanding of the nature of language, you
have to focus on features of language that ordinarily escape notice.
It comes as a disappointment to most people to learn that linguists
spend most of their time discussing such words as "the" or the
intricacies of English helping verbs such as "do" rather than the
colorful and exotic words that fill most of the treasure-troves of
word-lore that populate the language shelves at the back of the
bookstore.</TE>
<TE>   There's a curious irony here, since the reason we can get away
with ignoring the nuts and bolts of language is that it is one human
institution that never really fails us. Critics may decry the
degeneration of English, but in the end a language can't fall apart
the way an economy or a polity can: We know that we'll be able to
order lunch 50 years from now, even if we're not able to pay for it.
But there's another reason for the public's failure to appreciate the
linguist's point of view: The science often takes too broad a
perspective to have much relevance to the items that really matter to
us. When we consider the structure of English from on high, words
such as "incentivize," "to dialog" and "disinterested" have little
importance. And when the last English speaker has ceased to
distinguish between "imply" and "infer," the language as a whole will
be scarcely altered. But even if these are small things, people
aren't wrong to take them as the harbingers of broader social
changes. And since the 18th century, critics have taken language
change as the occasion for a debate--often exasperating, occasionally
illuminating--about cultural tendencies that might otherwise be hard
to put a finger on.</TE>
<TE>   The 18th century philosophers weren't entirely wrong about
language. From one point of view, McWhorter and other linguists are
clearly right to think of language as a deep cognitive faculty that
may very well be hard-wired in the human brain. But language is also
a social institution, which flutters back and forth in response to
the slight atmospheric currents in the room. We may not be able to
trace its origins in as direct a way as we can the origins of our
political and economic systems (though in recent years, some
scientists have begun to revisit the questions of origin that Herder
and Rousseau raised). But we can sometimes talk about change in
language the way we talk about change in the other institutions we
count on. It isn't easy to keep both points of view simultaneously in
mind. Speaking as a linguist, I realize that the tendency to refer to
problems as "issues" is a perfectly normal example of semantic
change, and that people a generation from now will no doubt wonder
why anyone ever bothered to object to it, in the same way I'm at a
loss to understand why mid-20th century critics objected to the use
of "contact" as a verb. But speaking as a somewhat crotchety
inhabitant of the first decade of the 21st century, I find the usage
a little smarmy--for the moment, at least, it feels like a way of
keeping personal responsibility at arm's length. So I raise my
umbrella, knowing full well it won't do much to keep the sidewalk
dry.</TE>

<LD>Surrounded by the Coconino National Forest in Arizona, a mountain of
cinders called Sunset Crater rears above the pinon pines much as it
must have done after the decades of eruption that started in 1064.
The red tint at its summit could almost be the rocks still glowing.
On either side of the smooth black road, the scrubland is eerily
perfect and unbroken. The earth, the rocks, the plant life are
beautifully themselves: "Unspoiled" is the word we use for these
shrinking zones of the Earth. No grazing, mining or building is
happening here. No fence posts, no advertisements, no flapping shreds
of indestructible plastic disfigure this place. After the scruffiness
of the land outside the forest, it is like stepping back into Eden
before the Fall--that is, nature before the human race.</LD>
<TE>   For the last 250 years, our writers have constantly visited such
tracts of nature to refresh themselves, to understand the cosmos more
fully and sometimes to see themselves reflected in the mirror of the
great lakes and little ponds, the broad rivers and high snowfields.
Once, before the Renaissance, nature was seen by artists more as a
frame or stylized setting than as a thing in itself. No writer in
English before Shakespeare seemed to be able to tell one flower from
another, or at least considered it significant. A beetling crag or
two, some leafy branches, even a rainbow might just be visible round
the edges of a picture whose subject and center was the adoration of
the virgin and child or the passion of a sainted martyr.</TE>
<TE>   As telescope and microscope showed us nature in ever-sharper focus
and travelers brought back less fanciful and more realistic accounts
of the great wildernesses, writers became more and more enthralled by
nature in all its teeming particulars. Explorers such as Meriwether
Lewis and William Clark published sober records of what they had
seen, for example at the headwaters of the Missouri between 1804 and
1806. The more visionary writers found in nature an unlimited
confirmation of the majesty of the created world. This could run to
self-conscious and rather sermonizing rhetoric, as in Emerson, or to
inspirational images of glaciated mountains with their waterfalls and
flowery meadows, as in John Muir.</TE>
<TE>   The entire gamut of such writing is sampled with wonderful
thoroughness and intelligence in Robert Finch and John Elder's huge
anthology. As we journey through it and come near to the present, a
keener and keener lament arises, in the voices of Edward Abbey and
Wendell Berry, Gary Snyder and Wallace Stegner and Thomas Merton.
Their simple burden is: See how we are trashing Paradise. We are
reminded once again that our best writers find it hard to celebrate
the health and comfort of modern civilization. They love the species,
all of them (even the scorpions and the lice?), and they are
anguished by the tendency of our own species to wipe out even what we
enjoy or admire, for example the tiger and the cod.</TE>
<TE>   The chief glory of the anthology lies in its evocation of the
natural life which still swarms around us in spite of the clearing of
the forests and the fouling of the rivers. A peregrine falcon flies
across Essex, England: "Pouring away behind the moving bird, the land
flows out from the eye in deltas of piercing color." Hellebores
flower in Tuscany, Italy, with "a peculiar wintry quality of
invisibility, so lonely rising from the sere grass, and pallid green,
held up like a little hand-mirror that reflects nothing." Water
ouzels in Yosemite National Park "swoop down the inclines of
cascades, dropping sheer over dizzy falls amid the spray ... the
streams tracing the ancient glaciers, the ouzels tracing the
streams." Elephants wallow in a swamp in Tanzania: "Even at rest the
herd flowed in perpetual motion, the ears like delicate great petals,
the ripple of the mud-caked flanks, the coiling trunks--a dream
rhythm, a rhythm of winds and trees."</TE>
<TE>   Even the dumbfounding silence of the universe beyond Earth's
atmosphere turns into a marvelous vision as writer Chet Raymo broods
after an accident on Boston Common: "The Milky Way flows across the
dark shoals of the summer sky without an audible ripple.... The
universe fattens and swells in a Big Bang, a fireball of Creation
exploding from a pinprick of infinite energy, the ultimate
firecracker; there is no soundtrack. The membrane is ruptured, a
child flies through the air, and the universe is silent."</TE>
<TE>   Reading this book is like a trek through the whole accessible
world back and forth in time: from the lagoons of Florida swarming
with trout and roaring alligators (in 1791), to the Columbia River in
the Northwest where silver coho salmon leap (in 1968) from polluted
water that coats the shore "with what looked like dead human skin for
miles"; from the street in Puerto Limon, Costa Rica, where nine
three-toed sloths brachiate in slow motion along the power cables, to
the caves in Bali where spiders test the tautness of their webs by
dancing on the new-spun strands a few inches away from gushing
monsoon torrents. Read this book with an atlas at your elbow, and you
are drawn into the beautiful crannies and the exposed harsh uplifts
of the Earth, from the little valleys in Sussex, England, where a
clergyman (in 1770) shouts out lines of Latin poetry to test the
distinctness of an echo, to the Eagle Tail Mountains of western
Arizona, in which a grindstone sits on the floor of a cave where it
may well have rested for 800 years.</TE>
<TE>   Because nearly all of these 133 writers are fine observers, they
take us most intimately into the bays and cliffs and meadows where
life flourishes in its dizzy variety. Because they are used to
spending hours and days and weeks in intent, often solitary
contemplation, they are expert at teasing out the implications of
what they see and touch. These concern the relationships of our
species to the other species, and because we have so often cruelly
harnessed them, imprisoned them and slaughtered them and wiped them
out, the upshot is often painful. We injure and deform our own
natures as much as we damage the nature that is "out there."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most important single revelation of the book is that
not everyone's experience of nature is the same, that a person of
color's experience, for instance, may well be quite different from a
white person's. Alice Walker describes the changing look in the eyes
of a horse, called Blue, which is briefly allowed a mate to share his
meadow, then sees her taken away again when she has duly become
pregnant. Walker gives him an apple; he half-crunches it, then lets
it fall: "I dreaded looking into his eyes ... but I did look. If I
had been born into slavery, and my partner had been sold or killed,
my eyes would have looked like that." So an experience of nature for
an African American woman can't help being deformed by historic
cruelties.</TE>
<TE>   This is most strikingly discussed in Evelyn White's "Black Women
and the Wilderness." For me, for many of us, the wilderness is
delightful. It troubles me only when a rock-hold breaks off in my
hand or a blizzard covers my footprints and the way back home becomes
uncertain. White was brought up in Indiana. When she was 9, she was
terrified by the 1963 bombing that killed four black girls in
Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala. In her house were
copies of JET magazine with photos of Emmett Till, the Chicago
teenager who was battered and hanged in Mississippi for allegedly
whistling at a white woman. As she grew up, she became "speechless
and paralyzed with heart-stopping fear" whenever she crossed paths
with tough white loggers or went out into the countryside: "I
imagined myself being captured in a swampy backwater" by white-robed
klansmen with bloodhounds. She became reconnected with "the comfort
my ancestors felt in the rift valleys of Kenya and on the shores of
Sierra Leone" only when she went rafting with a friend and was swept
downriver, enchanted by the rapids and the tall trees and repeating
to herself a rhapsody by Langston Hughes on the rivers of the
tropics.</TE>
<TE>   Nature is even less innocent for people who have been enslaved
than for those of us who have been privileged by a comfortable life,
enabled to treat nature as a sort of Elysium in which we can holiday
and lose ourselves--as it is often called--although what this
anthology expresses again and again is the enhanced sense of self
that people can experience when they hear a crane calling above the
Wisconsin marshland or "listen" to the silence in the Escalante
Canyon north of Lake Powell in Utah or help a starving lioness die
among the grasses in the Serengeti.</TE>
<TE>   Those examples come from Africa and from what Meridel Lesueur
calls "the guerrilla soil of the Americas." It is natural that Finch
and Elder should favor terrain where the life of wild creatures is
most striking, the raptors and carnivores most handsomely toothed and
winged, the floods and lightning most spectacular. It is a shame that
their sense of "The Tradition in English" excludes all non-American
writers born since 1940 and that the last quarter of their anthology
has nothing from any book originating in the United Kingdom since
1979. This imbalance excludes, for example, Jim Crumley, the best
nature writer now working in Great Britain, who has produced
extraordinary evocations of the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland where
the flight of ptarmigan defines the great hollows of the corries and
the cry of wild geese flying at 6,500 feet is the only sound in the
Great Moss, the Moine Mhor. It excludes Richard Dawkins, Oxford
professor of public understanding of science, whose work on animal
behavior and on "the selfish gene" has brought us closer to the core
of human nature than any other writer. Canada is well enough
represented, Australia and New Zealand scarcely at all. The work of
American pioneers such as William Bartram and Lewis should surely
have been balanced by the best early Australians, especially Ernest
Giles, who evoked in piercing detail the impact of the Red Center on
the first white men to set foot in it. African writing is represented
by Isak Dinesen and Laurens van der Post. Was it high permission
fees, which the editors mention in their introduction, that prevented
them from using Doris Lessing's rich descriptions in "African
Laughter" of her childhood among the bush animals in what was then
Rhodesia?</TE>
<TE>   Some valuable things are missing from "Nature Writing." What is
included is almost wholly excellent. The book feels as abundant as
the nature it reflects. Of course it isn't: Nature will always exceed
our perceptions and our language. We aspire to express it all and the
energies we devote to this are what gives "Nature Writing" its
pulsating vitality.</TE>

<DH>A HAZARD OF NEW FORTUNES, By William Dean Howells, Penguin
USA: 450 pp., $14 paper</DH>

<AU>VIVIAN GORNICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The republication of William Dean Howells' 1890 novel "A Hazard of
New Fortunes," by Penguin Classics (as well as The Modern Library),
brings back into focus a career in American Letters that has
periodically, over the last 75 years, raised an issue that often
presses on the national life; that is, the consequence of liberal
devotions as contrasted with radical necessities. I myself have just
reread the book for the first time since graduate school. I remember
thinking then that Howells had intended to use New York in the same
way that George Gissing was using London, and Emile Zola, Paris (as
settings for large social novels in need of an urban landscape), and
that a major difference among these writers, equally devoted to
realism in the novel, was that the Europeans wrote out of a bitter
socialist ardor, whereas Howells was writing as a middle-class
liberal whose sentiments were strong, clear and tempered. The
difference seemed crucial then and even today seems wonderfully
telling.</LD>
<TE>   Howells was born in 1837 in a small town in Ohio and educated to
the age of 10. After that he worked for, and beside, his printer
newspaperman father, becoming so good a journalist that at 23 he
wrote a campaign biography for Lincoln that earned him a consulate
post in Venice. The newsman from Ohio spent four years abroad, making
himself into a literary man; upon his return to the United States in
1865, he headed for Boston, where he quickly found favor with men
such as James Russell Lowell and Oliver Wendell Holmes and, under
their sponsorship, went to work at the Atlantic Monthly.</TE>
<TE>   In time, Howells was to become one of the greatest and most
influential of American editors, "blessed," as Phillip Lopate puts it
in his richly useful introduction to the Penguin edition, "with
catholic tastes, generosity toward other writers, and not least, a
gift for friendship. The term 'the Age of Howells' had as much to do
with his bridging function as it did with his clout." Among his best
friends were two men who had no use for each other: Mark Twain and
Henry James.</TE>
<TE>   Howells was himself a writing machine: novels, stories, essays,
reviews poured from him for 50 years and more. From the beginning, he
championed and practiced realism in the novel, urging American
writers to concentrate on the commonplace and to describe it not
through a glass darkly as the French or the Russians would, but in
light of "the smiling aspects of life." The phrase became infamous,
causing the literati to scorn him as a quintessential middlebrow, and
leading ultimately to Edmund Wilson's dismissive phrase "the
comfortable family men [in American literature] of whom Howells was
chief." Yet in the 1940s, Alfred Kazin wrote admiringly of him as the
''first great domestic novelist of American life," and in the 1950s,
Lionel Trilling wrote an essay called ''William Dean Howells and the
Roots of Modern Taste."</TE>
<TE>   Howells' novels are divided between those set in family life--the
greatest of which is "A Modern Instance," a remarkably forthright
account of a failing marriage that ends in divorce--and those in
which Howells struggled to put on paper his own unhappiness with the
injustices of American capitalism. In all cases, the work is shrewd,
honest, vividly intelligent; and in all cases the prose, somehow,
fails to deepen; the lively, interesting surface remains oddly
unbroken.</TE>
<TE>   Take "The Wedding Journey," for example, the one everyone was
reading in 1872. The setting of this novel is a honeymoon trip to
Niagara Falls. The protagonist, Basil March, is enamored of his new
wife, Isabel, but he thinks her ignorant, and he resents the sexual
hold on him that makes him bow to what he sees as the natural
pettiness of a woman's character.</TE>
<TE>   One day the couple walks out across a series of small bridges
hanging over the falls and, suddenly, Isabel experiences a terror she
cannot bring under control. Unnerved by the torrential floods of
water, she sinks down, declaring that she cannot walk back. Howells
writes that Basil "stared at her cowering form in blank amaze." At
last, she recovers and walks ashore, but thereafter Basil "treated
Isabel ... with a superiority which he felt himself to be very
odious, but which he could not disuse."</TE>
<TE>   The novel is open in its depiction of the power struggle beneath
the calm, wedded surface; once married, one would be living
intimately with judgment for years to come. This view of the
"commonplace" was Howells at his best: knowing and grown-up. Yet the
novel feels innocent; its touch is light, too light; it fails to
achieve the power of its own insights.</TE>
<TE>   "A Hazard of New Fortunes" takes up the Marches 20 years later
when they move from Boston to New York so that Basil can leave his
deadening job in insurance to fulfill an old literary ambition by
becoming the editor of a magazine being started by a huckster named
Fulkerson and bankrolled by an arriviste named Dryfoos.</TE>
<TE>   Around these three, Howells gathers a large cast of socially
prototypic characters--the immigrant socialist Lindau, the aloof
artist Beaton, the do-gooder society girl Margaret Vance, the
feminist Alma Leighton and the doomed man of conscience, Conrad
Dryfoos (son of the magazine's owner).</TE>
<TE>   Stepping out of his Boston parlor into the streets of New York,
Howells sets these people in motion against the alluring upstart city
of the 1890s and has them encounter one another often enough that a
moral crisis is provoked at the magazine, and a transportation strike
brings the action to a melodramatic head.</TE>
<TE>   In this novel the city is a great creation, a richness of
description and response: the food, the immigrants, the
neighborhoods; the elevated trains. Ah! the elevated trains. They say
it all. "I don't care if it is the ugliest place in the world,"
declares Basil. "It shrieks and yells with ugliness here and there;
but it never loses its spirits ... [It's] as gay as an L road....
Those bends in the L that you get at Washington Square, and just
below the Cooper Institute--they're the gayest things in the world.
Perfectly atrocious, of course, but incomparably picturesque! And the
whole city is so ... or else the L would never have got built here.
New York may be splendidly gay or squalidly gay, but prince or
pauper, it's gay always."</TE>
<TE>   The Marches are an essence of middle-class liberalism--"there was
no good cause that they did not wish well; they had a generous scorn
of all kinds of narrow-heartedness; if it had ever come into their
way to sacrifice themselves for others, they thought they would have
done so, but they never asked why it had not come in their way"--and
it is their needs and interests that are at the heart of "A Hazard of
New Fortunes." (The novel is justly famous for its six hilariously
realistic chapters on apartment hunting: In 1890, the ads were as
full of lies as they are today.) Together, Basil and Isabel see it
all--the color, the motion, the brutishness; and on every side the
wealth and the desperation. The inequities are appalling. In Boston
they could insulate themselves against such knowledge, in New York
they cannot. And they respond accordingly; that is, moderately. Like
decent people everywhere, they are distressed at the sight of hunger,
ignorance, discrimination. They feel their distress, indeed they do,
and to some extent they respond. Then they go about their business.
Emotions digress, anxieties cannot stay concentrated. Sympathies move
them but do not overtake them. Neither do they overtake their
creator.</TE>
<TE>   "A Hazard of New Fortunes"--precisely because it is so
worthy--presents the reader with a central dilemma in literature. The
writing is a pleasure: expansive, intelligent, good-spirited. The
opinions are wonderfully full, and the characters speak them
beautifully. But these people remain unimagined; and, in an odd way,
so does the prose. It is not that the characters are shallow, it is
that the author of their being cannot inhabit their shallowness. The
narration itself remains unimagined.</TE>
<TE>   In his essay on Howells, Lionel Trilling observes that he "was a
man of principle without being a man of heroic moral intensity."
Moral is Trilling's buzz word for many things, including depth of
engagement, that lack of which liberals are always being charged
with. What it comes down to is: The liberal and the radical both
perceive the pain of worldly circumstance, but the liberal can live
with it, the radical cannot. It is the inability to live with it that
drives the radical deeper into the heart of things.</TE>
<TE>   I think in literature the writer must be a radical. The insight
that guides the work must go the limit of felt thought, and then
beyond. This, perhaps, is what Keats meant when he said, "Art takes
its goodness from the ardor of the artist." It's that missing ardor
that made Howells a great editor and a problematic novelist.</TE>

<TE>   Somewhere in Africa, a girl has been raised by her mother, an
ex-opera singer, in a walled compound, visited infrequently by the
girl's father, a wealthy playboy who never lived with his wife and
child, though he loved them both. The mother is beautiful, wretched
and fueled by hatred, by some accounts a madwoman. When her daughter
is 17, envisioning nothing but life on the verandah with her mother,
her father's cousin kidnaps her, marries her and takes her to live on
a remote island in a palace on the cliffs. The girl learns that her
father lost her in a bet with his cousin when she was only 6. Since
then, the cousin has been waiting to collect. She alternates, in her
captivity, between succumbing to him and fighting him--and longing to
return to her mother, though he will not let her. Lynn Freed's "House
of Women" is a gauzy novel with loose particulars flapping in the
breeze that blows through these rarified lives. The mother-daughter
relationship is rich and complex, and certainly the strongest in the
novel, but it has the feel of a medieval tale. It verges on parable;
the characters seem at times like ornate chess pieces, nothing more.</TE>

<TE>   THE CAPRICES</TE>
<TE>   Stories</TE>
<TE>   By Sabina Murray</TE>
<TE>   Mariner Books: 160 pp., $13</TE>
<TE>   Sabina Murray's stories about colonialism and war glitter with
juxtapositions: the white shirt on the dark Indian man at dinner in
the colonialist's club in India; the Italian and the Irishman, two
soldiers walking out of the jungle in New Guinea, arguing about Joe
DiMaggio; the lazy midafternoon on a village street emptied by war;
the strange normalcy of the old woman's flowered shift and the
abnormality of a child's life in a war-torn city. Murray's stories
are set in the Philippines, India, New Guinea and Sumatra in the
1920s through 1950s. Headless victims make a ghostly appearance in
many of the stories, set in steamy landscapes or dusty villages with
brackish water. "The dripping water punctuated the day's waning with
its steady beat. On the mainland, the trees rose up like a purple
wall, muted and unreal." She writes of the relationships between
soldiers. The decay of colonialism, its steady drip like the melting
of an icicle, is Murray's true theme: "Your time has passed," says a
young Indonesian to an old Dutch settler. "You have profited in
another's country, which is equivalent to theft, and I would rather
see you leave, but could easily kill you and feel justified."</TE>

<TE>   SELKIRK'S ISLAND</TE>
<TE>   The True and Strange Adventures of the Real Robinson Crusoe</TE>
<TE>   By Diana Souhami</TE>
<TE>   Harcourt: 246 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Lest you harbor the illusion that Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel, "The
Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe" sprang
purely from the author's imagination, here is the true story of
Defoe's inspiration, Alexander Selkirk, who was marooned for four
years and four months, 1704 to 1709, on an island off the coast of
Chile now called Robinson Crusoe Island.</TE>
<TE>   He was 23, and by all accounts a violent-tempered but resourceful
young Scotsman when he signed on in Kinsale, Ireland, under the
sleazy, greedy and equally ill-tempered Capt. William Dampier on the
ship Cinque Ports for a voyage of piracy to unload French and Spanish
galleons and to find gold in South America. He wanted freedom from
his parents and their small town; what he got, after Dampier left him
on the island for attempting to start a mutiny, was a prison
surrounded by a 10,000-mile moat. A prison that turned out to be a
paradise. Selkirk raised goats, built a hut, survived without alcohol
or tobacco on lobsters that grew to 3 feet long, herbs and plums and
beautiful sunsets. His 2,280,000 minutes on the 12-mile-long, 34-
mile-wide island, a Biosphere Reserve since 1966, turned out to be
the best of his life. The rest was drinking and brawling and running
away from the law.</TE>
<TE>   The first account of his life, written by one of the men who saved
him in 1709, Woodes Rogers, painted a pearly picture of Selkirk as a
man who read psalms every day and found God on the island. Defoe's
version, published in 1719, in which Crusoe lives for 28 year on the
island, is somewhere in between. Diana Souhami relies on Selkirk's
scant journals, petitions of two women claiming to be his wife and
accounts of the crew of the Cinque Ports, as well as seafaring
histories from the period. She also spent three months on the island,
which gave her its true flavor and the same love for the place that
made Selkirk regret his return to England. Selkirk did not
understand, she writes, "that the true experience of being marooned
was elusive, monumental, that it was in his eyes perhaps, but not his
words. That the Island had cast him in on himself to the point where
no time had passed, except for the silence between breaking waves."</TE>

<LD>THE IVORY COAST</LD>
<LD>   By Charles Fleming</LD>
<LD>   St. Martin's Minotaur:</LD>
<TE>   416 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   "That's Pearl Bailey, over there. And that's Frank Sinatra, at the
bar, with that drunk Dean Martin. And Joey Bishop, who you met
before." This is Deacon, a trumpeter who blows like Chet Baker,
squiring a girl named Anita around Las Vegas, pointing out the local
color. Like Deacon, Charles Fleming, in "The Ivory Coast," offers an
impressive tour of Vegas in the '50s, a place that has as much to do
with rat finks as it does with the Rat Pack.</TE>
<TE>   It's not only as a player that Deacon resembles Baker: Like Gerry
Mulligan's legendary sideman, Deacon is handsome, slightly haunted
and addicted to junk. But this neo-noir exploration of the Strip's
underbelly also gives Deacon some Philip Marlowe qualities: He's
tough, stoic and as handy with weaponry as he is with "Stardust."
When the town's first black-run casino is set to open, operated by
former boxer Worthless Worthington Jones but backed by an imperious
white casino lord, Deacon finds himself swept up in a swirl of danger
and falling hard for Anita, a 17-year-old truck-stop waitress. Amid
all the hard-boiled James Ellroy-inspired drama--of crooked cops, mob
payoffs and tabloid-ready perversion--what emerges here is a
surprisingly sensitive story about the historic daringness and
personal sacrifices that made integration possible. Yet Fleming,
whose previous book was a biography of the notorious Hollywood
producer Don Simpson, never loses sight of the neon-lit sleaze of Las
Vegas, making this sure-bet thriller as satisfyingly sordid as it is
socially responsible.</TE>

<TE>   THE STARS CAN WAIT</TE>
<TE>   By Jay Basu</TE>
<TE>   Henry Holt: 180 pp., $21</TE>
<TE>   Jay Basu's debut novella is a delicate fable that unfolds during
the German occupation of Poland. It's about 15-year-old Gracian
Sofka, growing up in the sooty mining village of Male{nacutel}kowice
in the region of Upper Silesia. As a German bureaucrat tells
Gracian's older brother, Pawel, when he applies for a job in a
German-run mine, "Silesians and your countrymen do not exist.
Historically they have not existed, for they inhabited a nation so
weak and confused in itself as not to exist. They have always been
nothing but vessels--empty glasses--for the filling and discarding of
others."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it is this feeling of neither-nor-ness, so ruthlessly
enforced by the Nazis, that drives Gracian to his obsession with
stargazing and the patriotic Pawel to his shadowy anti-German
exploits as a dealer in smuggled goods. When Pawel gets hold of a
telescope for Gracian, it is this generous gift that begins to
transform Gracian's relationship to the universe. Gazing through this
powerful tool, Gracian discovers his faith in the fixity of the stars
beginning to waver, and he develops new ways at seeing Pawel's
formerly invisible and potentially deadly exploits. If "The Stars Can
Wait" seems metaphorically pat and excessively lyrical, it is, in the
end, a seductive meditation on fraternal love amid the larger
disintegrations of war.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WAVEMAKER II</TE>
<TE>   By Mary-Beth Hughes</TE>
<TE>   Atlantic Monthly Press: 224 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Mary-Beth Hughes' enigmatic and challenging debut manages to
dovetail the numerous improbable story lines generated by the Clemens
family, well-heeled suburbanites living outside New York City in
1964. There's father Will, who takes the fall for some unspecified
wrongdoing related to the odious crony of Joseph McCarthy, Roy Cohn,
and is sent upstate for a year in prison. There's son Bo, putting up
a brave fight against the cancer he's barely old enough to
understand. His younger sister Lou-Lou, meanwhile, is shunted off
with a neighbor family where she endures misunderstandings,
loneliness and sexual predation from the other kids. At the heart of
it all is Kay, Will's beautiful 29-year-old wife, trying to keep
everyone's life from falling apart.</TE>
<TE>   This is a novella that reads like an epic: part prison story,
hospital-ward drama, family tragedy and historical flight of fancy.
Like Kay, Hughes manages--barely--to keep things together with
understated will and undefeatable elegance. At times, the tension
Hughes creates is unbearable, as "Wavemaker II," named after a
pleasure boat, steers its jagged course between "marital whispers and
judicial torpedoes."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes' habit of leaving out important information only drives the
reader deeper into the odd realm of this novel of stem-cell
therapies, Scotch-fueled Memorial Day parties, sentencing hearings,
grammar-school politics and the conniving machinations of Cohn, who
continues to achieve larger-than-life status here, even as he's
relegated to a supporting role. But Cohn's presence cannot be
underestimated: As the Clemens family's secret ally, he embodies
"Wavemaker II's" disturbingly ambivalent notions of loyalty and love.</TE>

<DH>ALEXANDER ORLOV: The FBI's KGB General, By Edward P. Gazur,
Carroll &amp; Graf: 606 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN SCHWARTZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lev Lazarevich Feldbin, alias Alexander Orlov, was the
highest-ranking KGB officer ever to defect to the West. Born in 1895,
Orlov had been head of the Soviet secret police in Republican Spain,
during the civil war in that country. He fled to the United States in
1938, claiming to have abandoned his duties out of fear of the
Stalinist purge machine. He adopted an underground existence in the
U.S. from which he did not emerge until Stalin was safely dead. He
then published a book, "The Secret History of Stalin's Crimes," and
became a leading informant for the Central Intelligence Agency.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the nature of Orlov's defection has always been controversial.
As it happens, Orlov told the CIA very little about Soviet
intelligence operations in the West. Two decades after his death in
1973, the book "Deadly Illusions" by John Costello, an English
writer, and Oleg Tsarev, a KGB officer, argued that Orlov's passing
to the side of the West had never been sincere. That book was widely
considered a disinformation product from Moscow intended to
demoralize U.S. intelligence functionaries by showing them up as
naive fools. Edward P. Gazur was Orlov's FBI control agent, and
Gazur's "Alexander Orlov: The FBI's KGB General" is a response to
Tsarev and Costello's book, defending the defector's honesty in
joining the Western cause and the U.S. intelligence agencies'
handling of him.</LD>
<TE>   But Gazur's book also runs up against another controversy
entirely. From the moment he went public in the 1950s, questions were
asked about Orlov's role as head of the KGB Rezidentura in Republican
Spain, in the suppression of the anti-Stalinist Partit Obrer
d'Unificacio Marxista, known as POUM and based in Catalonia. This was
the party in whose militia George Orwell served during the Spanish
war. In particular, that movement's veterans wanted to know the
details of Orlov's involvement in the murder of their party's leader,
Andres Nin, the Catalan literary essayist, translator, labor
organizer and theoretician of national independence.</TE>
<TE>   Orlov was tetchy about this matter, flatly denying any complicity.
Nobody among the Spanish anti-Stalinist exiles--anarchists,
syndicalists, socialists and liberals as well as party members who
left their native land at the end of the war in 1939--believed him
for a second. Burnett Bolloten, author of "The Spanish Civil War:
Revolution and Counterrevolution" and widely recognized as the
greatest historian of the Spanish war, did not believe Orlov. Nor did
Bertram Wolfe, the former American Communist leader who went to Spain
during the civil war.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, any claims of innocence for Orlov in the attacks on Nin
and his movement would seem to have been thoroughly demolished by the
publication of "Deadly Illusions," which included a convincing
discussion of the Nin murder. The same year in which that book was
published, a striking documentary on the Nin affair appeared on
prime-time television in Barcelona, "Operacio Nikolai." Both "Deadly
Illusions" and "Operacio Nikolai" benefited from the opening of KGB
archives in Moscow. These primary sources showed that Orlov directly
supervising the murder of Nin and his burial in June 1937. Gazur's
book, although it swipes at the Costello-Tsarev project, does not
offer a detailed analysis of their various errors or their claims
about Orlov's disputed loyalties. However, Gazur has inexplicably
sprung to the impassioned defense of Orlov, in the matter of the
POUM, its persecution and the martyrdom of Nin.</TE>
<TE>   It would be hard to imagine a more outrageous, nightmarish
development in the historiography of the Spanish Civil War: an FBI
agent attempting to vindicate the Stalinist butcher who sought to
kill Orwell and his comrades. Gazur seems to have realized that he
could not exculpate Orlov by answering the citations on Nin in
"Deadly Illusions," and he never heard of the Catalan TV documentary.
Instead, Dick Tracy-style, Gazur set out to "investigate" the role of
the movement and Nin in the war. After some hasty reading of
secondary sources, he adopted as his own the infamous Stalinist
slanders issued against the anarchists and POUM in Barcelona in 1937
and refuted in Orwell's classic "Homage to Catalonia." Gazur declares
that Nin was killed at the insistence of the Spanish Communists out
of personal spite, with the Soviets, including Orlov, uninvolved.
Such an argument runs against the whole of the Soviet documentation
on the war, not just the KGB files on Orlov.</TE>
<TE>   The wider materials on this episode were surveyed in recent books
published by Yale University Press, including "Spain Betrayed,"
edited by Ronald Radosh, Mary Habeck and Grigory Sevastianov, and
"Enemies at the Gates," edited by William J. Chase. The weight of the
Soviet archives unequivocally sustains the charge that the
suppression of the anti-Stalinist party, the pursuit of Orwell and
the murder of Nin were ordered by Moscow and carried out by its
agents, under Orlov's supervision. Gazur's whitewash of a Stalinist
terrorist, only because after he committed his crimes he collaborated
with the West, is truly shameful. The publication of "Alexander
Orlov: The FBI's KGB General" should embarrass Gazur and his former
employers.</TE>

<HD>Survival of the Greediest</HD>
<DH>THE GILDED AGE And Later Novels, By Mark Twain, The Library
of America:  1,054 pp., $40</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS VON HOFFMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though Mark Twain may or may not have written the Great American
Novel ("Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"), he is the Great American
Writer-Personality-Folk Figure with enough tang to have a book of his
occasionally banned or burned. In spite of the bonfires in the years
since his death in 1910, he has been elevated to a place of his own
on the virtual Mt. Rushmore. Revered by millions who read him and,
apparently, also by millions who haven't, Twain is a part of the
American landscape where the red, white and blue is richly displayed
and young people chant, "USA! USA!"</LD>
<TE>   Hence the danger to his posthumous reputation is that he might be
dropped into the cultural Cuisinart and turned into an ingredient in
the consensus, the American national pudding. But faithful readers of
Twain know that he is an unhomogenizable ingredient in any confection
cooked up to set minds at ease and allay suspicion that things may
not be as they ought. Doubt about Twain's enduring indigestibility
will be erased by the Library of America's new edition of "The Gilded
Age and Later Novels," which contains Twain's first novel, written
with his friend Charles Dudley Warner (1829-1900). Collaborations of
this sort were not uncommon, and though there's dispute over how this
novel came about--did Twain propose or agree to the project?--Twain
appreciated Warner's humor and prose, though succeeding editions have
often underplayed his contributions. (Hamlin L. Hill, who edited The
Library of America volume, has helpfully included notes on who wrote
what.)</TE>
<TE>   At bottom, Twain was God's angry man. "The Gilded Age" has been
borrowed, applied and reapplied whenever America gives way to another
spell of gluttony and the sounds emerging from the nation's capital
are of mastication, eructation and the expulsion of wind from the
lower parts, as each new generation of bribe-givers and bribe-takers
succeeds the previous one. We can certainly see our age reflected in
the fate of Si Hawkins, his wife and their two adopted children, Clay
and Laura, all hoping for fortunes in post-Civil War 1870s America.
Their hopes are lifted, then dashed, by the optimistic but
unsuccessful visionary Colonel Beriah Sellers, whose speculations
never strike gold.</TE>
<TE>   If Twain were alive during this, our most recent gilded age, he
would have enrolled in Sen. John McCain's campaign finance reform
effort--as many instances from the novel make clear. When Harry
Brierly, an engineer who becomes entangled with Laura, approaches a
water company president, he's given an education in the costs of
"persuading" politicians, as the president explains:</TE>
<TE>   "'A Congressional appropriation costs money. Just reflect, for
instance. A majority of the House Committee, say $10,000 apiece--
$40,000; a majority of the Senate Committee, the same each--say
$40,000; a little extra to one or two chairmen of one or two such
committees, say $10,000 each-- $20,000; and there's $100,000 of the
money gone, to begin with. Then, seven male lobbyists, at $3,000
each--$21,000; one female lobbyist, $10,000; a high moral Congressman
or Senator here and there--the high moral ones cost more, because
they give tone to a measure--say ten of these at $3,000 each, is
$30,000; then a lot of small-fry country members who won't vote for
anything whatever without pay--say twenty at $500 apiece, is $10,000;
a lot of dinners to members--say $10,000 altogether; lot of jimcracks
for Congressmen's wives and children--those go a long way--you can't
spend too much money in that line--well, those things cost in a lump,
say $10,000--along there somewhere; and then comes your printed
documents--your maps, your tinted engravings, your pamphlets, your
illuminated show cards, your advertisements in a hundred and fifty
papers at ever so much a line--because you've got to keep the papers
all right or you are gone up, you know. Oh, my dear sir ... the total
in clean numbers foots up $118,254.42 thus far!'"</TE>
<TE>   The bill in question is for money to buy the land to build the
Knobs Industrial University where former slaves, the grafters tell
the public, will be educated for their new life in freedom. Much of
the book's sardonic plot revolves around this scheme and, if reading
"The Gilded Age" reminds you of certain modern benevolent
appropriations on behalf of the diversely downtrodden which turned
out to be a form of racketeering, you are as much of a cynic or an
infuriated idealist as Twain himself.</TE>
<TE>   Twain knew the entertainment value of thieving hypocrisy and
bold-faced varletry. He rollicked in civic villainy, as in this
passage in which Laura propositions Congressman Trollop to vote for
the spurious university:</TE>
<TE>   "'Now there is no use in you and I dealing in pretenses and going
at matters in roundabout ways,'" she tells him. "'We know each
other--disguises are nonsense. Let us be plain. I will make it an
object to you to work for the bill.'</TE>
<TE>   "'Don't make it unnecessarily plain, please. There are little
proprieties that are best preserved. What do you propose?'</TE>
<TE>   "'Well, this.' She mentioned the names of several prominent
Congressmen. 'Now,' said she, 'these gentlemen are to vote and work
for the bill, simply out of love for the negro--and out of pure
generosity I have put in a relative of each as a member of the
University incorporation. They will handle a million or so of money,
officially, but will receive no salaries. A larger number of
statesmen are to vote and work for the bill--also out of love for the
negro--gentlemen of but moderate influence, these--and out of pure
generosity I am to see that relatives of theirs have positions in the
University, with salaries, and good ones, too. You will vote and work
for the bill, from mere affection for the negro, and I desire to
testify my gratitude becomingly. Make free choice. Have you any
friend whom you would like to present with a salaried or unsalaried
position in our institution?'</TE>
<TE>   "'Well, I have a brother-in-law--.'"</TE>
<TE>   As for the chances that congressional malefactors will get what's
coming to them, there is this speech about that odd contradiction in
terms called the Senate Ethics Committee: "They appoint a committee
to investigate, and that committee hears evidence three weeks, and
all the witnesses on one side swear that the accused took money or
stock or something for his vote. Then the accused stands up and
testifies that he may have done it, but he was receiving and handling
a good deal of money at the time and he doesn't remember this
particular circumstance--at least with sufficient distinctness to
enable him to grasp it tangibly. So of course the thing is not
proven--and that is what they say in the verdict.... It has taken a
long time to perfect our system, but it is the most admirable in the
world, now." Please note that, 130 years ago, Americans had already
made the practice of self-praise a national characteristic.</TE>
<TE>   Washington intrigue and sex scandals were also a familiar part of
the landscape to Twain and Warner's audience. Laura's involvement
with several unscrupulous senators, and a murder and spectacular
courtroom trial that follow should be a pleasant surprise for any
good student of American politics in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Reading this volume, which includes another story of Col. Sellers
in "The American Claimant," as well as the further adventures of Tom
Sawyer and a dark fantasy called "The Mysterious Stranger," is like
taking a trip around a theme park called Nowland. It is as if Twain
were still with us, as in this description of the legal process in
"The Gilded Age": "A jury of inquest was impaneled, and after due
deliberation and inquiry they returned the inevitable American
verdict which has been so familiar to our ears all the days of our
lives--'NOBODY TO BLAME.'" And today, be it the crime of dishonest
brokers filching their clients' retirement money or the failure of
the FBI to prevent the Sept. 11 disaster, no one gets thrown in jail
or fired, as we are all admonished not to play the "blame game."</TE>
<TE>   Twain's gilded age and ours are indistinguishable. Nor is our
sense of defeatism in any way modern. After it was suggested he might
think of running for Congress, Twain's hero Harry replies: "The
chances are that a man cannot get into Congress now without resorting
to arts and means that should render him unfit to go there.... Why,
it is telegraphed all over the country and commented on as something
wonderful if a congressman votes honestly and unselfishly and refuses
to take advantage of his position to steal from the government."</TE>
<TE>   "The Gilded Age" sets a reader thinking about why it is the crimes
of other times seem so blatant and those of our own--though no less
obvious--are so hard to see. A romp through the knaveries of Warner
and Twain's "The Gilded Age" in this invaluable collection may assist
some readers in finding those of our own times.</TE>

<HD>The Unvarnished Stories of His Life</HD>
<DH>In his extremely independent films, Caveh Zahedi turns the
camera unblinkingly on himself--embarrassing flaws and all.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Caveh Zahedi, an independent filmmaker whose fans are few but
passionate, can be summarized most simply as the Woody Allen of some
parallel cinematic universe in which being awkward, funny, highly
intelligent and neurotically confessional gets you almost nowhere.</LD>
<LD>   This scrawny San Franciscan has made a career--although no steady
living--of dumping his hang-ups, fears, lusts, romantic contretemps
and intellectual passions before the camera. But while Allen's
on-screen self is a persona, a fictional construct, what Zahedi
reveals is nearly unvarnished reality.</LD>
<LD>   It is a brand of reality that, even though essentially comic and
devoid of scenes of sex and violence, can easily violate a viewer's
comfort zone. That, say some Zahedi supporters, is why he is
important--and why he has labored in obscurity and near-poverty.</LD>
<TE>   "A Little Stiff," an offbeat love story Zahedi co-directed with
classmate Greg Watkins while at UCLA's film school, was screened at
Sundance in 1991 and earned a modicum of recognition. It was picked
up by 16 film festivals. Two subsequent features, "I Don't Hate Las
Vegas Anymore" (1994) and last year's "In the Bathtub of the World,"
were rejected by most of those same festivals--although a screening
at the Los Angeles Film Festival did lead to "Bathtub's" acquisition
by the Independent Film Channel. The film, a video diary of a year in
Zahedi's life, will be screened Thursday at UC Irvine's Film and
Video Center. Zahedi will be there to answer questions afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "Las Vegas" and "Bathtub" play more like quasi-documentaries than
stories. Zahedi rolled the camera on unscripted episodes of his life
as they unfolded. He was guided by his conviction that film's
greatest glory is its ability to show reality. Therefore an
interesting and truthful story would take shape from filming real
life.</TE>
<TE>   "Caveh sort of obliterates the layer between fiction and reality,"
says director Richard Linklater, a friend and fan of Zahedi's since
they met at Sundance in 1991. Linklater, the Texan whose films
include "Slacker" and "Dazed and Confused," says it irks him when he
hears Zahedi's self-referential style being dismissed as
narcissistic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not easy to find the universal in your own life, and he's
intuitively picking what hits a universal chord. When people say, 'I
don't get Caveh's stuff,' I just smile. They're not ready at this
time, but I just know it'll be there long-term."</TE>
<TE>   If a larger moviegoing public knows of Zahedi at all, it is
probably because of his appearance playing himself in Linklater's
recent film, "Waking Life." Into this strange dreamscape of a movie,
in which live actors and their surroundings turned wavery, unstable
and surreal through animated effects, Linklater inserted his friend
to hold forth, unscripted, about the nature of film. In a
much-remarked-upon episode dubbed "The Holy Moment," Zahedi was seen
expounding on the spiritual implications of film's power to capture
reality. Then he turned into a billowy talking cloud.</TE>
<TE>   In his films, Zahedi, the 41-year-old son of Iranian immigrants,
has bared flaws, feelings of inadequacy and episodes of questionable
behavior that would send most people running for cover rather than
risk revealing themselves.</TE>
<TE>   His use of hallucinogenic drugs, especially psychedelic mushrooms,
as a path to hoped-for insight and enlightenment has been a recurring
motif. Perhaps the most disquieting sequence in a Zahedi film comes
in "I Don't Hate Las Vegas Anymore" when he pressures his 62-year-old
father and his 16-year-old half-brother to join him in taking the
drug Ecstasy. Zahedi's parents divorced when he was 8. He says that
left him feeling abandoned and estranged from his father, an
insurance salesman. The film shows his attempt to bond with his dad
and his half-brother during a weekend trip to Las Vegas. Zahedi also
conceived of it as a test of his cinematic credo: that filming a
slice of unscripted reality could yield a coherent and involving
movie.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Bathtub of the World" (the title comes from a poem by John
Ashbery) focuses mainly on Zahedi's tempestuous relationship with his
girlfriend, Mandy Field. Repeatedly, we hear her weeping in her
bedroom after one of their arguments--and, repeatedly, we see Zahedi
barge through her closed door with tape rolling.</TE>
<TE>   Zahedi makes a multitude of admissions that don't reflect well on
him. He can come off as selfish, comically neurotic or just plain
pitiful. He confesses for the camera that he slapped Mandy once
(after she slapped him), that he feels unqualified to teach the
college film courses he takes on to earn money, and that he feels
compulsive about everything from sex to reading. He obsesses guiltily
over his habit of starting books and never finishing them. He also
allows himself to be shown deep in despair. "Something's wrong with
my life," he tells the camera near the end of the film. "I don't know
how to live. I really don't know what to do. I'm lost."</TE>
<TE>   "Caveh is daring to show himself as clumsy and embarrassingly
off-putting," says Ray Carney, a Boston University film professor and
author whose specialty is independent film. He considers "A Little
Stiff" one of the great films of the 1990s and is devoting a chapter
to Zahedi in his next book, "The Real Independent Movement: Beyond
the Hype."</TE>
<TE>   "With the Woody Allen schmo, you are able to stand outside and
say, 'This is all a joke,'" Carney said. "In Caveh's films, you
really are in pain for the clumsiness of the character, the ineptness
that is not laughed off. These films are comic, but in a very subtle
way, where the comedy does not soften the emotion."</TE>
<TE>   Zahedi grew up in Granada Hills and won a scholarship to Yale,
where he majored in philosophy and became enthralled with film. After
graduating, he moved to Paris. His plan was to apprentice himself to
his hero, French New Wave legend Jean-Luc Godard, and blaze a path as
a politicized filmmaker. "I thought it would be easy just to talk my
way into whatever I wanted. I quickly came up against the brick wall
of reality," Zahedi said in a recent phone interview from the tiny
San Francisco apartment he shares with Field, a literary magazine
editor who has stuck with him despite his art's intrusions on their
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Ignored by Godard, he settled for film school, which he financed
with student loans. Zahedi says he stayed five years at UCLA,
accumulating a $100,000 debt that still stands, because he wanted to
prolong his time making movies without having to face the economic
exigencies of the movie industry.</TE>
<TE>   Figuring that the everyday reality he knew best was his own, he
made "A Little Stiff," a reenactment of his unrequited crush on a
UCLA art student. Actors would not suffice for Zahedi's vision of
reality. He not only cast himself, but persuaded the woman who had
rejected him and the man who had been his romantic rival to play
themselves. And he resolved to try to show himself as he was, without
airbrushing the flaws and insecurities.</TE>
<TE>   "Our flaws are as important as our good qualities," says Zahedi, a
quietly intense talker with a reedy voice and the ability to fling
terms such as "mediated" and "dialectic" without sounding
pretentious. "To deny them is to deny a fundamental truth of the
human condition. In our society so much is hidden that it creates a
false notion about what it is to be human.</TE>
<TE>   "People suffer under a false ideal that nobody can live up to.
Whenever people have been honest about their failings, it has made me
feel it's OK to have failings as well. It's a weird, almost
sacrificial thing, but by copping to these things, I'm doing it for
everyone. Some [viewers] don't forgive [the failings] in me or in
themselves. But the more I do it, the more I feel it gives people
power."</TE>
<TE>   Zahedi says his most embarrassing on-camera admissions are yet to
come, in a film called "I Am a Sex Addict." It will chronicle his
compulsive visits to prostitutes and the resulting havoc on his
relationships during his post-collegiate years in Paris and Los
Angeles. Zahedi says he spent six years trying to raise money for the
film and was willing to give way to a name actor if that would have
attracted the $2-million budget he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   He struck out and has settled instead for shooting it on video.
The $100,000 budget comes from a Bay Area businessman whom Watkins,
Zahedi's film-school buddy and still his frequent creative sidekick,
befriended while studying for his doctorate in religious studies at
Stanford. The same backer, Richard Clark, paid for "A Sign From God,"
a 2000 release that Watkins directed. It featured Zahedi--as himself,
of course--reenacting various career and relationship traumas he
suffered during the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins finds little difference between the on-camera Zahedi and
the everyday man. "His art is really about putting himself on
screen." Watkins thinks that "I Am a Sex Addict," which they hope to
finish by year's end, gives Zahedi his best shot so far at taking
their shared vision of reality filmmaking "over the hump" to a bigger
audience, noting, "It has more promise for the simple fact it's about
sex."</TE>
<TE>   Zahedi admits that his lack of commercial success, even by modest
indie standards, has caused him deep anguish--as do such continuing
everyday realities as a stomach problem that has gone untreated
because he has no health insurance. At one point, Zahedi tried to
reflect his lot in a pseudo-documentary called "A Portrait of Caveh
Zahedi as a Complete Failure." In it, he played a documentarian
interviewing people about Caveh Zahedi, a failed filmmaker who has
given up and dropped out of sight. He shelved it when the cash came
through to make "Sex Addict."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he's really thinking about quitting," says
Linklater, who gave a mock interview for "Complete Failure" during
1999, while Zahedi was in Texas to shoot his scene in "Waking Life."</TE>
<TE>   "I think he is compelled to create, which is the good news,"
Linklater added.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice if it were made a little easier for him. His
body of work at the end of the day will be like a lengthy Walt
Whitman poem. It will be a 'Song of Myself.' It will be one of the
greatest poems ever written, because it applies to everybody."</TE>

<DH>Rebels of the '60s and '70s see no hypocrisy in their new
roles as rock's elder statesmen: They're artists first.</DH>

<LD>Retirement is not forced on the aging lions of literature or on art
gallery heroes. Classical composers, film directors and architects
see no job jeopardy written in their wrinkles. In jazz, folk and the
blues, performers seem only more elemental as they perform on into
their autumn years.</LD>
<LD>   Ah, but for rock stars, the passing decades present a thornier
proposition. Rock was born in the 1950s as the most rebellious,
disposable and youthful squawk of them all, and by the end of its
first decade it boasted a considerable streak of debauchery and
generational antagonism--not the type of forum that seemed likely to
someday create its own wealthy elder statesmen. But somewhere between
Bill Haley and Bill Gates, that is exactly what happened.</LD>
<LD>   And it has led to something no one would have envisioned in the
Summer of Love: the world's first relevant 60-year-old rock star.</LD>
<TE>   Bob Dylan's "Love and Theft" is nominated for best album at the
44th annual Grammy Awards this week and was just named the best album
of 2001 in a Village Voice poll of more than 600 U.S. music critics,
a good number of them half his age. Dylan, as he has done so often,
is leading the way among his peers in an artistic quest; this time
around, it's to fashion later-in-life success in a field that
traditionally has found its axis in youth.</TE>
<TE>   Live fast and die young? Don't tell the Rolling Stones, now
gearing up for their 40th anniversary tour, or 54-year-old Carlos
Santana, now looking to follow up the biggest success of his career,
or 56-year-old Neil Young, who has become a touchstone figure to a
new generation of rock collaborators. And right behind those
1960s-era names is an even larger horde of 1970s stars. The situation
creates an intriguing generation gap between the genre's older voices
and its younger ears.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course age has to do with the way we're going to hear music
and the way someone one is going make it," says Christian Hoard, a
22-year-old freelance journalist in New York who was among the
younger voters in the Voice poll. Hoard included Dylan's disc on his
ballot, along with far younger artists Jay-Z and the White Stripes,
but says Dylan is not the norm among classic rock figures. "I don't
listen to a lot of people in Dylan's age bracket. They're talking
about things I don't necessarily relate to and drawing on styles I'm
probably not terribly interested in."</TE>
<TE>   Hoard also admits he views many of the aging rockers with a
jaundiced eye and echoes many peers his age with this take: "Mick
Jagger looks great for his age, but there's something a little
ridiculous about him being waifishly thin and just trying to rock out
all the time.... I'm not saying that's off-limits to these people,
but trying to recapture youth may not be the right way to go about
continuing your rock 'n' roll career."</TE>
<TE>   It has become common to mock the rock graybeards and use their
famous youth anthems against them ("Hope I die before I get old" is
now a rote reference in any Who concert review), and in many cases
it's appropriate, with the glut of "classic" rock tours chugging from
arena to arena on the wispiest fumes of nostalgia. But there is also
a case to be made that Dylan and his most talented peers are
exceedingly fascinating artists to watch today because they are
trying to reconcile their youthful view of rock and their current
career status.</TE>
<TE>   "I viewed rock as a young person's music," says the Eagles' Don
Henley, reflecting with a chuckle on his worldview as a teen. "I was
young and rebellious. I thought I would be well done before I was the
age of 30.... Somewhere in the 1960s, the motto became 'Live fast,
die young.' If you wanted to be elevated to that great pantheon of
artists that are eternally young, then the thing to do was OD. I
consider myself lucky. So do my bandmates. We came out the other
side. Now I much prefer the idea of getting old. I want to be around
to see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   No one begrudges Henley, 54, and other veteran performers long
lives, but there are a number of observers who would rather see them
put down their guitars and drumsticks--or at least abstain from
renting "Baba O'Reilly" and other classic songs of age angst to
computer and car companies for advertisements. The tenor of the
criticism is usually mocking. An example: When the Rolling Stones
launched their "No Security" tour a few years ago, it was instantly
and widely nicknamed the "Social Security" tour--not just by
naysayers, but by people working on the tour.</TE>
<TE>   Whole books have been written on the topic, including "Rock 'Til
You Drop," by John Strausbaugh, which argues that the Stones and
other maturing icons are betraying the rock ideals they once
personified and, worse, have become cultural criminals by presenting
themselves in increasingly nostalgic and corporate settings.</TE>
<TE>   For Bonnie Raitt, those criticisms simply ring hollow, especially
when applied to the most ambitious of the veteran rock artists. The
52-year-old singer has longtime ties to the blues and folk worlds,
where performers have the reverse problem--youth has the credibility
challenge. How, she wonders, could anyone want a 56-year-old Eric
Clapton or 60-year-old Paul Simon to take a seat because they have
passed some arbitrary age limit?</TE>
<TE>   "There's strong ageism in rock," Raitt says. "When people write
about other parts of culture, about Philip Glass or Jackson Pollock
or Allen Ginsberg, the preeminent thing said about them through the
years is not about their age. With poets no one says, 'Wow, even
though you're an old geezer, you came up with a good rhyme.'</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it has to do with sex and rebelliousness and when people
become the establishment they're no longer able to be rebels or they
seem like they're hypocritical. But I disagree. The counterculture
has to do with state of mind, not the number of wrinkles you have.
Rock has always had a sexuality to it, and as a culture we've had
some problems viewing people as sexual beings as they move on in
life, which is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Merlis, the dean of record label publicists before he left
Warner Bros. Records last year, remembers a cartoon he saw decades
ago in the back pages of a magazine. It showed a sad-looking,
mop-topped, wrinkled fellow and a caption: "A 40-year-old rock star."</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, that was a ludicrous concept, and now Bono and Axl
Rose are [past] 40," he says. "Twenty years ago, even, the idea of a
60-year-old rock star was something to ridicule, something that
wasn't even plausible. But you have to remember the stars aren't the
only ones maturing. You have 60-year-old rock fans now too."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a considerable number of the music fans of the 1960s did
not turn away from their music passion in the way that previous
generations "outgrew" the music of their youth. Surveys by the
Recording Industry Assn. of America, for instance, show that one in
three rock music buyers is older than 35 and that 14% of the genre's
consumers are older than 45. That is due in large part to the
cultural legacy of Dylan and the Beatles. More than any other
performers, they raised the artistic ambition of rock and pop, and in
doing so led a movement that made the music less disposable.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, most of the top rock stars tried to recycle and
repackage their hits, and restricted their subject matter to the most
inane of themes. Their approach was not unlike that of jingle
writers, although the spirit and energy of their music cannot be
discounted, says Phil Ramone, the veteran record producer who has
helmed projects for Billy Joel, Simon and others. "The beat of the
business was that you were going to get thrown away at 30," Ramone
says. "Only the Sinatras and Crosbys and jazz performers were
expected to stay around."</TE>
<TE>   The stakes changed in the mid-1960s, and down the road members of
the "My Generation" generation are not willing to let go of the big
sensation of their youth. They also have the money to pay for
triple-digit concert tickets, lavish boxed sets of CDs and
coffee-table books that present their beloved rock music in trappings
more black tie than tie-dyed. "Whether that's good or not," Merlis
says, "depends on if you're a fan."</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of fans, no doubt, but how many of them are kids?
The most avid music consumers today remain young people. The sales of
Britney Spears and 'N Sync and Eminem far outstrip those of any of
the 1960s-era stars still on the scene. "Love and Theft," for
instance, has sold about 610,000 copies since its release on Sept.
11, a total that the Backstreet Boys have been known to match in a
single day. While a healthy number of thirtysomethings buy, say,
Sting's recent hit album, the general rule is that the older the
artist, the older the audience.</TE>
<TE>   The most noticeable and telling exceptions to that marketplace
trend are "Supernatural" by Santana and "1" by the Beatles, two of
the best-selling albums in the past five years (there is also the
forever-young audience of Aerosmith, but more on that later).
"Supernatural" teamed guitar hero Santana and his band with an
eclectic mix of young artists for clever duet duty that gave the
veteran an easier time with radio programmers and invaluable airplay
in a range of formats. Armed with radio hits such as "Smooth,"
Santana found that his age was suddenly a boon, creating a comeback
story and career coronation that, in this case, climaxed with a
Grammy for best album (it also apparently inspired veterans Mick
Jagger, Run-DMC and Willie Nelson to each assemble new albums of
their own featuring a raft of young collaborators).</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "1," the Beatles' package of No. 1 hits, the
consumers buying the disc included a fair-sized contingent of fans in
their 20s and 30s, which suggests (as does the success of classic
rock radio) that old rock ages far better in our culture than old
rockers.</TE>
<TE>   As a concert endeavor, the most famous 1960s and 1970s music acts
enjoy business that is typically steady and, in some cases,
spectacular. The top-grossing tours in recent years are almost all
veteran acts from the 1960s and 1970s (the Stones, 54-year-old Elton
John, 52-year-old Joel, 52-year-old Bruce Springsteen, etc.), and a
whole middle tier of the concert business is devoted to classic-rock
acts, even ones with lineups that bear little resemblance to their
glory-days memberships.</TE>
<TE>   The economics and allure of nostalgia can be stifling for the more
restless artists among the veteran acts, such as David Bowie, 54, who
for a time tried to quarantine his past by refusing to play his
oldest and most defining hits in concert. Henley observes that on
some nights, singing "Desperado" one more time is akin to "sharp
needles in the eyes," although he adds that the guaranteed emotional
response from the audience for the forlorn Eagles hit quickly takes
the pain out of the process.</TE>
<TE>   To blunt those artistic needles, a segment of the performers who
first rose up in 1960s and 1970s has also pushed off into exotic
sonic frontiers, be it the world music safaris of Simon and
52-year-old Peter Gabriel, 50-year-old Sting's explorations of jazz,
or the stranger, darker landscapes mapped by 52-year-old Tom Waits
and 59-year-old Lou Reed. Those are all artists who get serious
inspection and respect from critics and fellow musicians of all ages,
but there is considerable reason to suspect none of those artists
will again match the commercial or cultural impact achieved by their
work in past decades. The pursuit of relevance and/or sales takes the
veteran artists in very different directions. One of the most
interesting trajectories has been that of Aerosmith, the 1970s band
that survived the life of rock excess and, by the 1990s, had salvaged
its career by allying itself with young producers and songwriters and
embracing the 1980s music video boom.</TE>
<TE>   Aerosmith may draw more of today's young fans than any other 1970s
act and is a still-familiar part of the MTV culture that defines
today's pop. Guitarist Joe Perry credits that to the band's
willingness to change with the times, even if it meant tamping down
their egos to allow young collaborators to shape their songs. It
hasn't always been easy, though, for Perry, now 51, to wear a young
man's clothes for a living. "I was about 35 when it hit me," Perry
says. "Is this any way for an adult to behave? What kind of role
model am I to my kids? Does this mean anything? I felt stranded."</TE>
<TE>   The band's comeback success sustained him, but sometimes the
countless performances of the old familiar hits are a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "If I have to play 'Walk This Way' on another national broadcast,
I'll probably throw up," Perry says. "I mean, if all we got to do was
sing those old songs, I don't know if I could do it. The fans love
it, and when we play them, it's almost a tribal thing that goes
beyond the notes played. That I don't get sick of. And where would I
be without those songs?"</TE>

<TE>   Don't get up gentlemen</TE>
<TE>   I'm only passing through</TE>
<TE>   --"Things Have Changed" by Bob Dylan</TE>
<TE>   Those lyrics are from the Oscar-winning song that served as a
centerpiece in 2000 in "Wonder Boys," a film that is not about aging
rock stars but does hold some insights into the challenges they face.
When director Curtis Hanson set about adapting the Michael Chabon
novel to the screen, he knew he wanted a song that would capture the
"emotions, frustrations and fears" of the central character, a
middle-aged literary professor grappling with writer's block, an
unraveling personal life and a quirky protege who reminds him of his
own robust creative past. Hanson's first hope was to get Dylan to
provide the music, and after seeing early cuts of the movie, the
singer signed on.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on the lyrics, Hanson hears threads of meaning about
age and art and withstanding the rigors of the years. He also calls
Dylan the "quintessential wonder boy."</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted a song that applied to all of us, all of the wonder
boys, male and female and every age--everyone who is trying to retain
through the years the capacity to care and to be our best no matter
how things conspire to wear us down," Hanson says.</TE>
<TE>   "The themes at the heart of this movie dovetail with this
discussion [of aging rock stars].... Rock has changed as far as what
it means and what it's an expression of. Obviously when you have
somebody who has been doing it that long, it is no longer the
so-called music of rebellious youth that's misunderstood by the
parents as it was when it came up. It's a different part of our
culture now."</TE>
<TE>   Is there any downside to having an old guard redefine what was
once so edgy? "I don't think there's a downside to artists that
continue to challenge themselves and their audience," Hanson says. "I
mean, why shouldn't Neil Young be writing new songs?"</TE>
<TE>   The new songs by the best of the veteran artists are adding
later-in-life themes to the rock songbook, and there is no clearer
example than the recent work of wonder boy Dylan. "Love and Theft"
not only challenges the mundane definitions of rock (it creates a
feel of vintage Americana with its country, bluegrass, and blues
shadings), its core messages and images are darkly honest about a
life nearly four decades removed from "Highway 61 Revisited." If
Dylan's previous disc, "Time Out of Mind," winner of the best album
Grammy for 1997, was about an aging troubadour who saw no end to the
road ahead, the newer, more challenging work presents a man who
suspects he may be running out of pavement but reacts, in turns, with
playfulness, soulful reflection and intellectual edge.</TE>
<TE>   Dylan is not the only veteran who infuses current work with the
long-view of middle age and beyond. Be it Paul McCartney's recent
musical farewell to his late wife, Clapton sharing his maturing view
of his relationship with his father, or Henley's ruminations on
marriage and parenting, the artists are accompanying their fans on
the walk of life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to have music as an outlet," Henley says. "Just because
people turn 30 or 40 or 50 doesn't mean they should stop listening to
music. There are still things out there that can be searched out.
Things that give pleasure and even spiritual nourishment to some
degree. Music is good for more than just partying.... You have to
write what you know. That was the wonderful thing about the Beatles.
They grew and they brought their audience with them. We grew with
them. We went on spiritual journeys with them."</TE>
<TE>   The journey continues. This summer, McCartney joins Dylan and
Simon in the 60s (the age group, not the decade), and Jagger and
Keith Richards will reach the milestone age next year. In 2013,
perhaps, the world may see Jagger shimmying to "Start Me Up" to
celebrate his 70th birthday. If so, some fans will smile and marvel
at the years gone by, and others will cringe and wonder where rock
went wrong. And there will also be more than a few musicians cheering
the old boy on for purely personal reasons. "Hey, I'd love it,"
Aerosmith's Perry says. "As long as the Stones keep going, that means
we aren't the oldest ones out there."</TE>

<DH>David Friedman is proud of the schlock he's inflicted on
the public over the years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FREDERICK BURGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ANNISTON, Ala.</DL>
<LD>As he approached his 78th birthday late last year, David Friedman,
the godfather of movie gore, had come through an extended rough patch
in his life. His beloved wife died in May, just weeks shy of their
50th anniversary. His eyesight was slowly fading with age. Routine
conversations were becoming harder for him to hear.</LD>
<LD>   Yet there was no mistaking the mischievous twinkle in his eyes and
the mirth in his voice. As he approached the big day, Christmas Eve,
David Frank Friedman, with the mind-set of a carny pitchman and the
look and demeanor of a TV grandfather, was back hustling another B
movie, this one a sequel to his 1963 cult classic "Blood Feast," the
first of the blood-and-guts horror genre.</LD>
<TE>   The original "Blood Feast" movie poster boasted there had been
"nothing so appalling in the annals of horror," a claim in which
Friedman takes great pride. He always has loved writing the
breathless promotional copy for his movies and producing the
previews. He takes considerable delight in having foisted a whole
series of low-budget, lowbrow movies on an eager ticket-buying
public. Between 1958 and 1984, Friedman produced and/or directed 58
largely tasteless, feature-length movies, he notes in his 1990
autobiography, "A Youth in Babylon: Confessions of a Trash-Film
King." The sequel to his classic, expected to be released in 2002,
includes a subtitle: "Blood Feast 2: All You Can Eat."</TE>
<TE>   "I am probably guilty of promulgating more of the most disgusting
garbage on the American public than anyone has ever done," he once
gleefully confessed to the authors of "Sinema: Pornographic Films and
the People Who Make Them." His horror and "sexploitation" movies were
hardly pornographic, at least by today's standards, but they enticed
audiences with material that teased and titillated and seemed to
offer glimpses of the taboo.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Friedman is one of the last of the old-time hucksters. His
history dates to the original movie conmen of the 1920s and 1930s,
businessmen-turned-fast-buck moguls who whimsically called themselves
the 40 Thieves and produced movies that made sensational claims, drew
big crowds and, not coincidentally, made imposing profits. (Itinerant
showman Kroger Babb--who made a fortune with a clinical childbirth
movie called "Mom and Dad"--was Friedman's mentor.) Their cinematic
efforts were cheaply made, often crudely produced, and had thin or
nonexistent plots, but their movies were guaranteed to entice eager
customers into dark movie houses with the promise of seeing the
unbelievable and forbidden.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember," Friedman says proudly. "I'm the guy who turned on your
fathers and grandfathers."</TE>
<TE>   This genre of exploitation movie predated the explosion of
explicit X-rated movies of the 1960s and 1970s, and they never
actually delivered what they promised. The earlier films were all con
jobs that played on the audience's prurient expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "I never did consider myself a pornographer," says Friedman,
chewing on a long Dominican cigar. "The secret of my stuff was the
old carnival tease. The audience would think: 'Oh, boy, we didn't see
it this week, but next week.' They never did see it, but they kept
coming back. We were fortunate that we were in the independent-film
business, running between the raindrops. I've always said I made some
terrible pictures, but I don't make any apologies for anything I've
ever done. Nobody ever asked for their money back.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, the great American public, in their wisdom, took
these pictures to their hearts."</TE>
<TE>   There was often nudity, of course, but no sex, at least not
anything remotely approaching today's standards. Some of the movies
were simply renamed and re-released on an unsuspecting public. Some
played on each other.</TE>
<TE>   "Blood Feast" was a detective story of sorts about a caterer named
Fuad Ramses who kills and mutilates young women in an ancient
Egyptian rite and uses their body parts in exotic dinners that pay
homage to Ishtar, Egyptian goddess of blood. The movie spawned two
more epics, "Two Thousand Maniacs" and "Color Me Blood Red,"
completing a trilogy that made Friedman a legend among fans of that
film genre.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, from the comfort of his home in Anniston, a town about 55
miles east of Birmingham, he has been plotting the promotion and
release of "Blood Feast 2." The expansive subdivision in which
Friedman lives is on the peak of a mountain, part of the Appalachian
foothills. The neighborhood is heavily wooded, disturbed only by the
gently rustling wind or yardmen brandishing leaf blowers. Magnolia
trees and towering oaks and pines shade the manicured lawns.
Neighbors are local businessmen, bankers, insurance agents and
retirees.</TE>
<TE>   Although he is well known and accepted locally, there is no
outward indication of the pressing business being conducted in
Friedman's comfortable, wood-paneled home office, except for the hint
on a brass doorplate--past the new Cadillac in the carport--that
whimsically reads "No Dogs, Children or Actors." Visitors invariably
are offered a libation by their convivial host. Inside his office is
a sign that reads: "Caution: You Are Now Entering the Den of Mad Dog
Friedman."</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years, many people have come to us and said they wanted
to make 'Blood Feast 2,'" Friedman says. "But they didn't have a
script, and they didn't have any money."</TE>
<TE>   So he and his equally famous production partner, Herschell Gordon
Lewis, told all hopefuls to come back when they had a deal in place.
Then in the fall of 2000, a young filmmaker named Jacky Lee Morgan
approached Friedman and Lewis again to enlist their help. Morgan, 35,
was just 8 when a teenage cousin smuggled him into a rural Louisiana
drive-in to see "Blood Feast."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Morgan has worked in various production jobs for
movies and music videos, and he was able to scrounge up the money,
some from friends and from his own pocket, to produce his first
feature-length film.</TE>
<TE>   The original "Blood Feast" was shot in Miami in five days in
February 1963, cost $24,500 to produce and has turned a $6.5-million
profit, according to Friedman. "Blood Feast 2" was shot in
Mandeville, La. (where Morgan lives), in 18 days last July and
August. Producer Morgan declines to disclose the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman and Lewis are listed as the movie's executive producers
and tinkered with Morgan's script. Friedman has been negotiating the
all-important distribution deal, which will determine whether the
movie will have a theatrical release, as he hopes, or go straight to
cable and video.</TE>
<TE>   By year's end, he had spent a week or so in Los Angeles showing
the movie to four distributors, and six others had lined up to take a
look.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, 72, an authority on direct-mail advertising and author of
about 14 related books, lives in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., and directed
the film.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Friedman nor Lewis have invested money in the new film,
but for their contributions they will share in any profits. The
rights to the "Blood Feast" name are held by the owners of Something
Weird Video, in Seattle, Wash., which markets videos and DVDs of
Friedman's movies.</TE>
<TE>   Preparations for filming "Blood Feast 2" were handled by Morgan,
and there was an added bonus to the revival. Director John Waters, a
devotee of the genre and friend of Friedman and Lewis, flew to
Louisiana for a day to make a cameo appearance in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting had its tensions. The crusty team of Friedman and Lewis
thought the youngsters spent too much time setting up shots that
would consume only seconds on the screen and drive up costs. "One
Take" Lewis saw no point in filming scenes twice, though he sometimes
did so anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of the crew was born when we made 'Blood
Feast,'" Friedman says. "They thought we were making 'Citizen Kane
2.' Finally, I had to take the cinematographer aside and say, 'Look,
kid, the people who go see pictures like 'Blood Feast' aren't looking
for any Rembrandt painting in every shot. They just want to see some
blood and guts and a little skin. And if it's in focus, all the
better.' It was something of a chore, but we lived through it and had
fun. We were very fortunate in picking up some local actors in New
Orleans who brought it off. We have five more victims [than the
original] and a lot more nubile Southern lasses who were not too
reluctant to show a little epidermis, so to speak."</TE>
<TE>   There were advantages to waiting 38 years to film "Blood Feast 2."
Technology has advanced the craft of moviemaking, and this time there
was a special-effects man from California. The original "Blood Feast"
relied on mannequins and makeshift animal parts acquired from butcher
shops to produce gory scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry has come a long way since then, and we have every
right to take credit for that because that whole genre wouldn't exist
if it hadn't been for us," Lewis boasts. "You can go into a local
magic shop and get things we didn't dream of."</TE>
<TE>   Friedman and Lewis didn't set out to produce a cult classic. They
hatched the project by accident shortly before they flew to Miami in
early 1963 to film another low-budget nudist-colony romp, one of the
staples of their moviemaking careers that bore such titles as
"Daughter of the Sun" and "Nature's Playmates."</TE>
<TE>   The independent-movie kingpins had wondered: What kind of movie
would no one else dare make--certainly not the big studios, which
were restricted by codes of standards and taste--and might draw a
crowd and turn a nice profit?</TE>
<TE>   As they talked, "Blood Feast" started to take shape. When they
finished the nudist-colony picture, they stayed in Miami and quickly
cranked out "Blood Feast."</TE>
<TE>   In his autobiography, Friedman calls "Blood Feast" a "revolting
little film that started out as a gag." When he and Lewis returned
home to Chicago with the raw footage, one of their film editors, Bob
Sinise (father of actor Gary Sinise, then 8), asked incredulously,
"Where do you plan to play this movie?"</TE>
<TE>   Friedman's wife, who had taught speech and drama in college,
wondered too. She described it in one word: vomitous. Friedman
observes with a smirk: "Carol never was that complimentary about my
work in film." But her remark gave the huckster another promotional
idea. He bought tens of thousands of barf bags that read "You May
Need This When You See 'Blood Feast'" and passed them out, sometimes
personally, in front of movie houses.</TE>
<TE>   "Blood Feast" premiered in early summer 1963 at the Bel Air
Drive-In in Peoria, Ill. At that time, the U.S. had 5,000 drive-ins,
which Friedman describes as the "showcase of movie mediocrity."
"Blood Feast" became a staple on the then-thriving drive-in circuit,
drawing crowds that chuckled at its amateur outrageousness and
daring.</TE>
<TE>   It was more than a boy from Birmingham, Ala., who was partly
raised in nearby Anniston, his mother's home, could have imagined.
Friedman's father was the business editor of the Birmingham News, his
mother a music teacher and pianist. Early on, he was exposed to
popular culture and the arts. He developed a passion for classical
music and opera, but movies and carnivals fascinated him the most,
leading him to a youthful decision to become a movie-studio
publicist.</TE>
<TE>   After Friedman's father died, Friedman moved to Buffalo, N.Y.,
with his mother and stepfather. He attended Cornell University for
almost three years.</TE>
<TE>   Following a stint in the Army, Friedman landed the job of his
boyhood dreams, becoming a regional publicist in Atlanta for
Paramount Pictures, which later transferred him to similar jobs in
Charlotte, N.C., New York and Chicago. He schemed to concoct ways to
promote movies and grab press attention.</TE>
<TE>   His "greatest stunt" came when Tony Curtis' "Houdini" was released
in 1953. Friedman was in Des Moines, Iowa, promoting the movie and
advertised that the studio would pay $100 to anyone who could
extricate himself from a straitjacket. Meanwhile, he recruited a
teenager and rigged the straitjacket so the boy could escape.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds laughed at how the publicist for the big studio had been
outsmarted, but it was Friedman who had pulled a clever con. News of
the youth's amazing accomplishment hit the wires and generated
enormous free publicity for the movie.</TE>
<TE>   As a publicist for Paramount, Friedman would play local host to
such stars as Bob Hope and Jane Russell, but he left that job in 1956
to produce low-budget movies in Chicago. In 1964, he moved to Los
Angeles and continued the work with partners, living almost lavishly
in a handsome home on Franklin Avenue in the Hollywood Hills and,
with wife Carol, supporting such civic institutions as the Los
Angeles Zoo and the local Audubon Society.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, however, with the years passing, Friedman and his wife
moved home to Anniston to be near her family.</TE>
<TE>   In semi-retirement, he has cut back on his activities, but
continues to manage and promote the video sales of the roughly 50
pictures he owns that bear such titles as "The Defilers," "Acid
Eaters," "The Erotic Adventures of Zoro" ("the first movie rated Z,"
as the promotions proclaimed) and "Trader Hornee." He figures he
sells about 25,000 videos a year at $19 a pop, and they're coming out
on DVD. He organizes and promotes the fall carnival in Anniston.</TE>
<TE>   He also has been a guest lecturer at most of the nation's
prominent collegiate film schools, in between appearances at film
festivals and fan gatherings in the U.S. and overseas. In 2000,
Friedman and Lewis were honored guests at the San Sebastian Film
Festival in Spain. The year before, Friedman toured most of
Scandinavia as young film buffs paid homage to his work. He annually
ventures north in late October to attend the Chiller Theatre Fan
Convention at the Sheraton Hotel and Convention Center in East
Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Now, of course, Friedman is working to sell and promote "Blood
Feast 2." He thinks it rates favorably with the other slasher/horror
movies that have been popular in the 38 years since he made the
first.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a parody of a parody," he says in the fading twilight. "I
think this thing will hold up with any of 'em. I'm pleased. It looks
very professional. But Herschell and I never took any of these things
too seriously. We knew we weren't creating fine art.</TE>
<TE>   "In many minds, Herschell and I became pariahs, but one man's
garbage is another man's treasure," Friedman says with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   "The young kids today look on us as pioneers in the cultural
revolution. We were just making movies for fun and profit."</TE>

<HD>An American Heritage Cast in Silver</HD>
<DH>Long overshadowed by Paul Revere, Jewish artisan Myer Myers
may at last be coming into his own.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN EMERLING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"We really wish Myer Myers had taken that famous ride of Paul
Revere," says Skirball Cultural Center's senior curator for Judaica
and Americana, Grace Cohen Grossman.</LD>
<LD>   If he had, one of the finest silversmiths and one of the few
prominent Jewish figures of the late-Colonial American era might have
something of the name recognition of his more famous and more
prolific Boston counterpart.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Myers and his life in 18th century New York are
relatively forgotten--even though a collector paid upward of $100,000
at auction for a coffeepot that David L. Barquist, the leading expert
on Myers and associate curator of American decorative arts at Yale
University Art Gallery, says "was not even one of his greatest
objects."</LD>
<TE>   "Myer Myers: Jewish Silversmith in Colonial New York," which opens
today at the Skirball, should alleviate Myers' posthumous anonymity.
It is meant to highlight what Barquist calls "some of the finest
American silver in the Rococo style" produced during the two decades
leading up to the American Revolution. The exhibition, which Barquist
originated at Yale, is the first to focus on Myers since 1954, when
the Brooklyn Museum celebrated the tricentennial of the arrival of
Jews in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Assembled from Yale's silver collection and nearly 60 other
lenders, it showcases Myers' punch ladles and Torah finials, milk
pots and snuff boxes, from unadorned early designs to elaborately
chased and engraved styles at the peak of his workshop's prominence.
The show also highlights the work of his competitors, portraits of
his clients, and maps, letters and other records that open a window
on Colonial society and the earliest Jewish congregation in North
America.</TE>
<TE>   Myer Myers was born in New York in 1723 to a Jewish shopkeeper. He
grew up in a city that was teeming with so many ethnic and religious
groups--French Huguenots, English Quakers, Africans (mostly slaves),
Dutch Reformed city founders and more--that there was no clear
majority. Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews were one of the smallest
groups, accounting for only 1% of the city's population. Despite, or
perhaps because of this, Jews, who had known prejudice and expulsion
in Europe, experienced the freedom of relative anonymity. In fact, as
Jonathan D. Sarna points out in his catalog essay, "On the eve of the
American Revolution, Judaism remained all but invisible to most
colonists. No more than one American in a thousand was Jewish, only
five cities had significant Jewish populations, and only New York and
Newport boasted synagogue buildings."</TE>
<TE>   After completing a seven-year apprenticeship, Myers became not
only the first Jewish silversmith in New York, but also, according to
Barquist, the first native Jew in the British empire to open up a
silver business.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout Western Europe, Jews were excluded from trade guilds,"
Grossman explains. The gold and silver trade was particularly
off-limits, "to keep precious metals out of the hands of Jews."</TE>
<TE>   Myers' career in the Colonies could have happened only in New
York, and not just because of the city's ethnic mix.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with their fellow Colonists in Puritan New England,
"patrons in New York were wealthier and more concerned with keeping
up to date with English fashion," Barquist says. "New England silver
was simple and sturdy. The taste in New York was opulent, showy."</TE>
<TE>   Myers' client base included a who's who of New York. One of his
most important patrons was the Livingston family, whose immense land
grant was said to have had no western boundary and included all of
what today is Duchess and Columbia counties. Another patron was the
Rev. Samuel Johnson, founder of the Anglican Church in Connecticut
and founding president of King's College, now Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Myers' most exquisite and original pieces were
commissioned by Susannah and Samuel Cornell, Loyalists who celebrated
their self-made wealth and promoted his political ambitions by
stocking their home with self-aggrandizing luxury. One of their
commissions, a pierced dish ring (used to hold hot dishes off a table
top), is among the exhibition's most singular objects.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing else in American silver equal to this," Barquist
says. Myers took the unusual measure of placing his surname not once,
but twice, to the right and left, of his patrons' engraved initials
on the front of the piece. "Placing the maker's stamp next to the
monogram shows how self-confident Myers was," Barquist continues. "He
was at his peak in the 1770s. This was his very best work."</TE>
<TE>   Such silver pieces tell as many stories about their owners as
their maker. Life expectancy was short and remarriages common in the
18th century, and as families grew and intermarried, many of their
allegiances could be traced through their silver. For example, it was
not unusual for a married woman, such as the prominent Dorothea
Remsen, to engrave her silver with her maiden initials, "so you would
know whose money paid for what," Barquist says. It was also not
uncommon to find the underside engraved with a notation of who should
inherit what.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 18th century they were obsessed with inheritances,"
Barquist says. "Nine times out of 10, it was the women who inherited
the silver. The men inherited all the good stuff like land and
livestock."</TE>
<TE>   Although often quite beautiful, originality of design was rarely
the point with these goods, and the exhibition includes English
silver, such as a cruet set with crystal flasks, chased and pierced
silver caps and an escutcheon for a coat of arms, that may have
served as a model for some of Myers' work. Daniel Christian Fueter,
an immigrant Swiss silversmith with whom Myers shared clients,
appears to have influenced his work, and vice versa. Fueter came to
New York via London in 1754, bringing with him the latest in English
styles. His marked work is represented by a number of objects in the
show, including a gold and coral teether/rattle produced for a very
special baby.</TE>
<TE>   Myers, like many of his clients, helped establish himself by
marrying well. His first wife, Elkaleh Myers Cohen, provided capital
to outfit a workshop that could turn out luxury items. "You couldn't
make a living making these things," Barquist says. "These were loss
leaders, there was too much labor involved. Most silversmiths never
got beyond the bread-and-butter phase of making flatware, porringers
and canns [Colonial mugs]."</TE>
<TE>   In a relationship akin to that of couture and ready-to-wear, Myers
also underwrote his high end goods by having apprentices and
employees turn out standardized objects such as milk pots and
teaspoons for retail sale to a less affluent clientele. (There were
no forks as we know them in the 18th century.) For a period of
several years, Myers even entered into New York City's first formal
partnership with another silversmith, Benjamin Halsted, to increase
his market share. In all, 380 objects survive with Myers' marks on
them; that number leads Barquist to believe that Myers ran the
largest New York silver workshop in the pre-Revolutionary period.</TE>
<TE>   Like his father, Myers was also a leader of New York's Shearith
Israel, founded in 1654, and referred to by Sarna as "the mother
congregation" of America's synagogues. This brought Myers into a
strong network of Jewish families not just in New York, but also in
the growing cities of Philadelphia and Newport, as well as smaller
Colonial enclaves in Savannah and Charleston. Although most of the
work Myers did for his Jewish clients was dramatically less opulent
than that for his Christian clients, his elaborate Torah finials, the
decorations that crown a synagogue's Torah scrolls, were among his
most exquisite work.</TE>
<TE>   "These are spectacular objects, big flashy and beautiful,"
Grossman says. "We are incredibly fortunate to have four [of the
five] surviving Colonial American torah finials in the exhibition."
All five sets were made by Myers and all are still in use.</TE>
<TE>   Myers' finials reflect the English Rococo style of the times, but
their basic shapes also hold with established Jewish traditions.
Called rimonim, the Hebrew word for pomegranates, they take their
bulbous midsections and crowns from the shape of the fruit. Eaten on
Rosh Hashana, the pomegranate was believed to hold 613 seeds, one for
each commandment or mitzvah in the Torah.</TE>
<TE>   Each finial is also adorned with several tiers of gold-plated
bells, referring to a passage in Exodus that describes pomegranate
applique and bells edging the high priest's robes. The bells assured
that the congregants could hear him as he entered the holy of holies.
When the Torah is paraded through the congregation, the bells tinkle
in what Grossman refers to as "one of the highlights of the
Saturday-morning Sabbath service."</TE>
<TE>   Myers' productivity and prosperity came to a close with the
American Revolution. Although an active supporter of independence, at
53, Myers was too old to fight, and in the summer of 1776, he moved
with his second wife, Joyce Mears, and six dependent children from
British-occupied New York to Norwalk, Conn., a town he mistakenly
thought would provide a safe haven too sleepy for the British to
bother with. But the port was attacked from the Long Island Sound and
burned to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Having lost his home, studio and many of his tools, Myers moved
farther east to Stratford, Conn., where he struggled for four years
to reestablish his business. Within days of hearing of George
Washington's victorious claim to New York at the war's end, in late
November of 1783, Myers returned to start life anew in his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   By then too much had changed. There were new production
techniques, younger artisans, an economic depression and changing
fashions to contend with. The Rococo style that had been Myers'
specialty was replaced with the clean lines of Neoclassicism.
Although Myers executed exquisite pieces in this vein, he was never
able to return to the level of patronage he'd had before the war.</TE>
<TE>   The totality of Myers' work provides an object lesson in the many
ways to work a piece of metal--including piercing, chasing,
engraving, casting and soldering--and the exhibition makes a point of
depicting the dangerous and difficult transformation of silver from
raw material to beautiful object. (There will even be a hands-on
workshop for those interested in trying out the techniques.) All of
which helps explain why one of his associates describes Myer Myers as
"that noted and proficient mechanic."</TE>

<DH>Nominees Alicia Keys and India.Arie dismiss talk of
rivalry. This is what matters most: being strong, successful and
black.</DH>

<LD>NEW YORK--Posing for photographs in the penthouse of a tony Manhattan
hotel, Alicia Keys and India.Arie hardly seem to be rivals for six of
the most sought-after awards in the music business. In fact, the two
are so cozy that they sing along with the radio in an impromptu duet
on "Me and Mrs. Jones."</LD>
<LD>   After veteran Irish rockers U2, who have eight nominations, the
two young women are the most-nominated artists for the Grammy Awards
that will be presented Wednesday in Los Angeles. Between them, they
have 13 nominations (Arie has seven; Keys has six) and are competing
in six categories: best new artist, song of the year, record of the
year, female R&amp;B vocal, R&amp;B song and R&amp;B album. Arie's "Acoustic
Soul" (on Motown) is also nominated for album of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Denver-born, Atlanta-based Arie, 26, and native New Yorker Keys,
21, are both part of the burgeoning neo-soul movement that has
infused contemporary R&amp;B with elements of classic soul and hip-hop.
Keys has landed hits with slickly produced, piano-driven songs such
as "Fallin'" and "A Woman's Worth," from her debut album on J
Records, "Songs in A Minor," while Arie's guitar-based compositions
mix personal experience with strong political viewpoints on the hit
single "Video."</LD>
<TE>   Slumped on a couch in the bedroom of the suite, booked by their
record companies for a day of interviews, Arie and Keys look more
like a pair of bedraggled friends after a long shopping day than two
of the most promising young talents in pop music. They met briefly
once or twice at music biz events but never really got to know each
other, and this is the first time they have spent any significant
amount of time together.</TE>
<TE>   The bed behind them is piled high with head wraps, bras, fuzzy
coats and brightly colored dresses. When not sighing like bored
teenagers, they tend to giggle. When one of them particularly agrees
with something the other has said, she reaches out and touches her on
the arm.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Is there any friendly rivalry because you've been
nominated in so many of the same categories?</TE>
<TE>   Keys: I'm happy for the acknowledgment and for people to like what
we're doing. But a statue doesn't make me mad at somebody else or
make me want to get it more than the other person.</TE>
<TE>   Arie: I want all seven and that's it! [Laughs.] In the long run,
no one statue or award is going to change anyone's destiny. So if you
think you're going to be competing with anyone else, it's a true
waste of your energy.</TE>
<TE>   Keys: Amen.</TE>
<TE>   Arie: The main thing is that I like the fact that it's two black
women....</TE>
<TE>   Keys: That's right.</TE>
<TE>   Arie: ... Smart. Talented. Purty inside and out. You know what I
mean? I feel proud of that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Aside from the Grammy nominations, there seems to be an obvious
connection between you: two young women of color who write music
steeped in soul and hip-hop. Do you feel like you're coming from the
same place?</TE>
<TE>   Keys: I do. I think we definitely have an individual thing. We
have our own flow and our own flavor. I definitely think there's a
sisterhood there.</TE>
<TE>   Arie: There's a common thread and respect for music.</TE>
<TE>   Q: At last year's Grammys, the big story was Eminem, and this year
it's the two of you. Is that a positive trend for pop music?</TE>
<TE>   Keys: I think that things change like the wind with everything in
the world, but especially in music. But it says a lot to embrace
strong women musicians. It shows that you can never guess what's
going to be popular. You should never say that's not going to work
because it's not radio-friendly enough.</TE>
<TE>   Arie: To see so many artists [nominated] who write and sing their
own songs, it's very obvious that there's a movement of wanting to
have more sincerity and honesty in our lives, especially after
everything that changed last year. It is very clear that Eminem is
not relevant right now because it's offensive to people.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Both of you write songs about women's strength. How did your
mothers influence your outlook?</TE>
<TE>   Arie: My mother taught me everything I know about music and
appreciating art and being an individual and taking chances and
writing songs and how to structure a song. She makes my clothes and
she does my hair. She's my girl. My mother's whole thing was that she
was telling me since I was age 10, "Watch how you live your life
because you're going to be very influential and powerful one day."
And I was like, "Why are you saying that?"</TE>
<TE>   Keys: She is my backbone. She is my mother and my father and she's
my sister and my brother. And she definitely showed me what strength
is and what perseverance is. She worked late hours from the time I
was really young. I always remember her coming in at about 4 a.m. and
then getting back to work at 8:30 or 9, and still doing and hustling
and helping me with my homework. I see her as a really solid thing.</TE>
<TE>   Q: With the positive messages in "Video" and "A Woman's Worth,"
you're setting yourselves up in the artist-as-role model mold. Are
you comfortable with that?</TE>
<TE>   Arie: It's great to be in a position to be able to use music to do
something that is meaningful and makes obvious changes in the way
that a person will think. Or in the way that the media will start to
perceive black women. To be able to use music to do that and to be
this age, I just feel really blessed.</TE>
<TE>   Keys: I spent a day at a school on 149th Street in this Read to
Achieve program that the NBA does. They were like, "I want to sing. I
want to play the keys. I hope to play basketball. I hope to be a
teacher." Whatever they wanted to do. To be able to give them
something to look forward to doing is something really important to
me. At the same time, I have myself and my feelings and what I'm
going through. And maybe sometimes you might feel a little crazy or
wild or whatever. That's OK. But my heart and my spirit [are] in the
right place, and I'm not afraid to be a role model.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Alicia, in "Girlfriend," you sing the line, "It's enough to
make a nigga go crazy." "Nigger" is a word that's slowly being
transformed by its use in pop music. Did you have to think hard about
using that lyric?</TE>
<TE>   Keys: Hip-hop is the form of music that I feel the most about. I
feel that it's truth and you should be able to express what you feel
in the moment that you feel it, if it is an honest feeling. And
sometimes that's not always the most politically correct thing that
you feel. The song that's under "Girlfriend" is a sample from an Ol'
Dirty Bastard record. And in his song he says, "It's enough to make a
nigga go craaazy." At the end of the song, there's that feeling of
jealousy that makes you want to go crazy. So I took that line that he
said and I sang it.</TE>
<TE>   Since that day, I want it to make clear that I've been reflecting
on myself. And I have actually chosen not to use the word anymore.
Not even in social conversations with [friends]. Not anywhere.
Because for me, I don't feel comfortable saying that anymore. But I
don't regret it or feel bad for doing that.</TE>
<TE>   Arie: On the Sade tour, me and my musical director wrote a song
about that. The hook says: [singing] "Keep the N-word out of your
vocabulary/Shackles on your feet are all imaginary/There ain't
nothing that prayer and faith can't do." And it's funny because I
never really used that word in my conversation. But after [listening
to Harvard professor] Cornell West [who objects to use of the word on
his CD "Sketches of My Culture"], I was thinking about that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When either of you plays solo on piano or guitar, I feel like
I'm hearing the heart of your music. How hard was it to flesh out
that sound in a way that satisfied you and your labels?</TE>
<TE>   Arie: A lot of producers have a sound that's their signature that
they want to try to put on you. I'm totally all the way against that.
I wanted to make a guitar sound that's very soft and real. And to
have the words I want to say and still have it be something that can
be played on the radio next to Cash Money and not sound little. I got
to the point where I couldn't dance to my own music and I was like,
"This is boring." And the drum machines finally made it happen. It
was just a matter of opening my mind to finding the sound. Once I did
that, it was like [snaps fingers].</TE>
<TE>   Keys: It actually just took me to go to complete frustration with
the people that I was working with and what they were trying to make
me do that wasn't me. It just made me realize if you want to do
something right, you have to do it yourself. So I bought all my own
equipment and went to my little crib on 137th Street, and I started
banging away and playing. I already knew music and the keys. It was
just a matter of getting the sound that I wanted to hear, with
messing up and trying again and listening to the records I love.
Sometimes you have to take it into your own hands to get what you
want.</TE>
<TE>   Q: India, before being signed you were part of a musicians'
collective and put out your own album. Do artists have to make do for
themselves now and not depend on record companies?</TE>
<TE>   Arie: I think that it puts you in a position of power and
experience when you do it that way. You have more performance
experience. You know how you want to look. You can come in with the
music and say, "This is what I do. If you sign me, this is what
you'll get." People forget that the artist is as useful to a label as
the label is useful to the artist. The artists, I would say, are even
more important. I'm like, "You're lucky that you found me." They
don't give you anything. But they take a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Keys: I think that the independent route is a good route to
explore. You don't always have to have somebody else do it for you.</TE>
<TE>   Arie: Of course, I had my own label and I had to find my own way
to go. And it was very, very, very, very, very hard just making a
name for yourself and becoming an entrepreneur as the years go by.</TE>
<TE>   Keys: It's crazy. It's not a game.</TE>

<DH>As computers take over more of the tasks of electronic
recording equipment, much is gained--and lost.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Moonshine Music's recording studio in West Hollywood takes up only a
room and a half, yet it's stocked with hundreds of pieces of classic
recording gear.</LD>
<LD>   There are famous-name guitar and bass amplifiers and speaker
cabinets, all warmed up and ready to shake the walls. Microphones
from dozens of manufacturers await to add their particular color to a
singer's voice. There's even an array of compressors, limiters,
delays and other signal-processing gear to shape the sounds coming in
and out of the 64-track recorder.</LD>
<LD>   The thing is, none of them is real. They're just pieces of
software on the studio's Apple computer.</LD>
<TE>   Software and computers have transformed the way music is recorded,
changing not only the process but also the sound of everything from
Grammy-nominated hits to homemade demo tapes. They have slashed the
cost of studios, put broadcast-quality sound within the amateur's
reach and opened new creative avenues.</TE>
<TE>   The shift has also spawned a slew of companies that focus on
sound-editing tools, many of which try to reclaim the sound of fabled
pieces of equipment or instruments. Others correct the foibles of
human performers or fit disparate sound samples into a seamless mix.</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of drawbacks too as even devotees of the new
tools freely admit.</TE>
<TE>   "You spend a lot of time going, 'Wow, I can do this, I can do
that,'" said Jerry Harrison, a producer, solo artist and member of
the influential band Talking Heads. "You can do too much, and you can
spoil music."</TE>
<TE>   Added Richard Elen of Apogee Sound International, a
recording-equipment company, "What's very tempting to forget is that
a good song, good playing and performing are actually important.
There is an assumption, which has been there for years and years and
years, that you can make up for the talent in the mix, or in the
recording as a whole. That's [baloney], really."</TE>
<TE>   Many producers and engineers also argue that recordings done on a
computer simply don't sound as good as those done the old-fashioned
way, on magnetic tape. But there's one thing everyone agrees on: It's
a heck of a lot easier to edit a song with a computer than with a
razor blade.</TE>
<TE>   There are two main steps in recording music. First, instruments
and vocals are recorded onto separate tracks, typically filling 24 or
more of them. Then the tracks are combined into a final stereo or
surround-sound mix, with a variety of effects added to enhance the
sound.</TE>
<TE>   The traditional approach was to use a multitrack tape recorder
connected to a banquet table-sized mixing console, which provided
separate volume and effects controls for each track. A studio also
had multiple racks of signal-processing equipment to groom the sounds
on each track, and another professional-grade tape recorder to
capture the final mix.</TE>
<TE>   In the past decade, computers have gradually taken on all of those
tasks. Hard drives substitute for magnetic tape, plug-in cards and
computer mice take the place of mixing consoles, and software
emulates compressors, limiters and reverbs.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been revolutionary. The painstaking, irreversible
process of editing and mixing a song on tape is being replaced by a
highly automated technique that encourages freewheeling
experimentation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of the same as the difference between a typewriter and
a word processor," Harrison said. "The computer-based systems allow
you to do the kind of editing that you do with a word processor, but
with sound."</TE>
<TE>   The studio at Moonshine Music, an independent label that
specializes in dance music, has a few tall racks of synthesizers,
samplers, drum machines and signal-processing gear. But the
centerpiece is a high-powered Apple computer with a huge hard drive
and two monitors, running a popular digital recording and editing
program called Pro Tools from Digidesign Inc. of Daly City, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   One monitor shows a measure-by-measure breakdown of the song being
recorded on the Mac's hard drive, with various voices and instruments
assigned to different tracks. The other displays a virtual mixing
board, with sliders and knobs to control each track.</TE>
<TE>   The in-house producer is Dave Aude, a DJ and recording artist who
has produced CDs or remixes for DJ Keoki, Madonna, BT and others.
Using a trackball mouse, Aude can quickly copy, cut or move sounds
anywhere in the song, as well as insert new elements pulled from a
storehouse of digital recordings. He also can apply a seemingly
endless array of sonic effects, all based in software.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if he wants a guitar he's recorded to sound as if it
were played through a particular Fender amplifier, he'll pull down a
menu of amplifiers and call up an electronic simulation. The amp's
control panel will appear on screen, and Aude will twiddle the volume
and tone knobs with his mouse until he's achieved the desired effect.</TE>
<TE>   The computer provides so much power to manipulate sound, it blurs
the line between editing and creating.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, Aude and engineer Steve Miller went into the
studio with a couple of drummers to record a variety of percussion
sounds and rhythms. They're still inserting the results in their
work, although the original drummers probably wouldn't recognize it.</TE>
<TE>   "I can take a one-bar drum loop, split it into eighth notes,
rearrange it, and it's a completely different sound," Aude said. "I
can record a guy playing for five minutes, and use pieces of that on
50 songs."</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, Miller said, he and Aude either obtain musicians'
permission to reuse the material or compensate them on a song-by-song
basis.</TE>
<TE>   Another example comes from the production duo of Brian West and
Gerald Eaton, a.k.a. Track and Field, who are up for a Grammy for
their work on Nelly Furtado's debut CD, "Whoa, Nelly!" The two did
much of the recording on computers in West's attic and a small studio
they built in Toronto, avoiding the expense and time-is-money issues
of a big studio.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of takes the pressure off," West said. "It makes the
performer more relaxed. It allows you to explore more ideas, instead
of just finding the thing that works."</TE>
<TE>   Furtado recorded multiple different, improvised melodies for each
of the songs. Then West and Eaton digitally spliced them together,
sometimes grafting in only a word or a syllable from a track.</TE>
<TE>   "That whole sort of live-or-die element of editing on tape is
gone," Eaton said. "There's really nothing you can't edit together in
terms of audio right now. It's just really, really handy. It keeps
all the options open."</TE>
<TE>   Although the duo has embraced computers for editing and mixing,
West still prefers the sound of old analog equipment. That's why the
two still use older gear to capture sounds onto a computer and record
final mixes onto tape "to fatten up the sound [and] round out the
bottom, which tape has an unusual ability to do," West said.</TE>
<TE>   The allure of analog sound quality has been a blessing for
Universal Audio Inc. of Santa Cruz, which makes reproductions of
vintage recording gear as well as software simulations. The company
was founded by the sons of the late M.T. "Bill" Putnam, a pioneering
studio engineer whose credits range from Duke Ellington and Count
Basie to the Beach Boys and Ray Charles.</TE>
<TE>   "I think no one doubts, except maybe a few purists, that digital
[recording] has been a big boon," said Bill Putnam Jr., chief
executive of Universal Audio. "But you do get a few people saying it
doesn't have that character, it doesn't have that warmth.... The way
that [analog] gear screwed up, or misbehaved, was musical."</TE>
<TE>   It's not necessarily easy to get those sounds, however, or even
get the equipment. That's why there's a demand for software-based
re-creations from the likes of Universal and Line 6 of Agoura Hills,
which digitally models the sound of classic amplifiers and
signal-processing devices.</TE>
<TE>   "If you just went and got an Echoplex"--a processor that used
magnetic tape to create echo effects--"chances are it would sound
different, or potentially not work at all, being an old and
temperamental mechanical device," said Marcus Ryle, co-founder and
chief product strategist for Line 6. "By doing it in software,
there's simply a knob on the screen to control how much wow and
flutter, how much tape hiss....</TE>
<TE>   "This is all about now doing those things on purpose, and doing it
in a way that's very controllable so that you can get the tones you
want and focus on making music."</TE>
<TE>   The steadily increasing power of microchips has made this kind of
modeling possible on desktop computers, enabling firms such as Line 6
to preserve the sound of older gear as studios move into the new era.
"In a way," Ryle said, "we're almost like historians."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, the shift to computers could make it
more difficult to preserve recording sessions. Bay Area producer
Cookie Marenco, who specializes in new age, jazz and world music,
noted that every few years brings a new computer operating system,
rendering many programs obsolete. If you can't reproduce the original
sessions, you can't remaster recordings for new formats or create
remixes.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Marenco appreciates some of the benefits of
recording on a computer. When she needs distant musicians to add or
edit tracks, she can send digital copies of the recording session
electronically for them to work on. She also loads snippets from her
recordings onto a computer and builds them into dance tracks, "kind
of like taking leftovers every day and making something new with it."</TE>
<TE>   To Harrison, there's something liberating about the ability to fix
errors in timing or intonation. The technology "allows you to play
with as much expression and excitement as possible," he said. "When
it works, right it's great, because it allows you to play without the
fear of making a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   The pitfall, though, is that the technology "can make you lazy,"
Harrison said. "The technicians end up having a lot to do with how
the music sounds."</TE>

<HD>Afghanistan's Past and Future in His Strings</HD>
<DH>Aziz Herawi will use traditional instruments to perform his
'Visions of New Afghanistan.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Nov. 13, 2001, Kabul's Radio Afghanistan went back on the air
after nearly a decade of restriction and repression. The first
musical selection? "My Sweetheart Kabul."</LD>
<LD>   Aziz Herawi may not have a clue what "My Sweetheart Kabul" sounds
like, but as far as he's concerned, the broadcast had to have been a
critical success.</LD>
<LD>   It signaled the end of the Taliban, and an era in his home country
he calls "the worst for Afghan musicians. Many were in prison; many
were either beaten up or had their instruments destroyed or stolen."</LD>
<TE>   Herawi--a native of Herat, Afghanistan; son of a Sunni cleric;
former moujahedeen commander; and a musician in exile for more than a
decade--will bring some of his hopes for a remade Afghanistan to the
Skirball Cultural Center tonight in a program called "Visions of New
Afghanistan." Backed by a tabla player, he'll present traditional
lute music on the long-necked dutar and Afghanistan's national
instrument, the rebab--short-necked, with three or four strings for
playing, as many as 15 resonating strings, and a double-chambered
goatskin-topped body.</TE>
<TE>   A resident of Northern California since the late 1980s, Herawi
plays music that, like his hometown, is a crossroads blend. His
lute-playing incorporates Persian music, classical Hindustani ragas
and talas, and the folk forms and rhythms of the Afghan mountains.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Herawi, 56, plays primarily in the Afghan expatriate
community, concentrating on connecting younger artists with their
roots and their homeland. In addition he has recorded for the
Arhoolie label and for Latitudes/Music of the World.</TE>
<TE>   But he also occasionally performs before a wider audience. In the
early '90s, the New York Times covered an appearance: His playing,
wrote critic Peter Watrous, "was about abandon and ecstasy, with
intense sections of improvising, always grounded in a galloping
rhythm, giving way to delicate, airy moments."</TE>
<TE>   It's "natural" music, Herawi says, speaking through a translator,
"from the heart and soul."</TE>
<TE>   Vaus Aslaun, head of Virtual Nation, Inc., a support group for
Afghan immigrants in the U.S., who arranged for tonight's
performance, says Herawi's music "represents the deep roots of
Afghanistan, transcending ethnic, linguistic and trivial boundaries."</TE>
<TE>   Herawi's experience of the ruinous effect of decades of war and
internal unrest in his home country dates to well before the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   He was born into a well-to-do family of mullahs in Herat, near the
northwestern border with Iran, and a career as a musician was hardly
what was expected of him. His father, deeply conservative, allowed
his children to hear the news on the radio but turned it off before
music could be heard, believing that it caused people to "dance and
lose control of themselves," Herawi remembers.</TE>
<TE>   But he found himself irresistibly drawn to music from the first
moment he experienced it.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 7 years old, my father and I were invited to a village
to stay overnight," he recalls. "While he was meeting with the local
dignitaries, I heard an amazing sound. It came from a shepherd on top
of a roof playing the dutar.</TE>
<TE>   "I bought his dutar. I had one of the family assistants wrap it in
a blanket, take it back home and hide it in the woods by the barn.
Then, when my father was sleeping, I went out alone in the dark to
play it every night."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his father's attempts to shield him, Herawi's first
teacher was the radio. With its arrival in Afghanistan in the '40s,
it had become one of the country's principal modernizing forces. He
heard Indian classical music and Pushtun folk songs, even American
pop. By listening, Herawi not only learned songs and musical forms,
he also found some support for his desire to become a musical
artist--a profession primarily associated at the time with lower
social classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of respect for my father, I had to hide my playing," he says.
But when he was still a young man his father died, and Herawi moved
his passion into the open.</TE>
<TE>   "I invited well-known Ustads [master musicians] from India and
other regions to learn from and to play with. Because what drove me
to music was my God-given love for it. When I am holding one of my
instruments--especially the rebab--it is like I am holding onto the
universe."</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was in his 20s, Herawi had become a prominent
performer, playing before the king, Zaher Shah, with Afghan pop
artist Ahmad Zahir, and recording and playing concerts in Iran,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkey and other Central Asian countries.</TE>
<TE>   But his career was curtailed during the Soviet occupation, which
began in 1979. That year, the Soviets bombed Herat and Soviet-backed
troops arrived to round up local leaders. Herawi, in a stroke of good
fortune, was away at the time, practicing with musician friends, and
he barely escaped.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of my family members were killed or missing," he recalls,
"so I went to the mountains, sometimes on horseback, sometimes by
foot. Risk was everywhere, from the Soviets as well as from
[Soviet-sponsored local tribal forces]. The risk was death and death
was common."</TE>
<TE>   At that point, music was already starting to disappear from
day-to-day Afghan life. Traditionally, music accompanied virtually
every private and public Afghan ceremony, with the exception of
funerals. Since death was, as Herawi notes, common in those war-torn
years, less and less music was heard, out of respect for the mourning
survivors.</TE>
<TE>   For Herawi, too, living in the mountains with the moujahedeen,
music was forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not happy, and that is why I did not play for over five
years," he says. "It did not feel right, since the country was at war
and my family members were killed. I was given the opportunity to
lead 1,500 men. And, as a commander, my mind was in the war, not
music, at the time."</TE>
<TE>   As the situation in Afghanistan worsened, he, like thousands of
others, slipped away to Pakistan. "It was the only route to escape,"
he says. Fans among the refugees, who remembered his music from the
old days in Herat, urged him to pick up his instruments again. He
also located a remnant of his family, whose resources enabled him to
emigrate to the Bay Area, where a sizable Afghan community has put
down American roots.</TE>
<TE>   Now, says Aslaun, Herawi is something of a leader in that
community, his music a link to pre-Taliban Afghan culture. Imagine,
suggests Aslaun, "Frank Sinatra, in another country, playing for
American expatriates."</TE>
<TE>   Concerts like the one at the Skirball, says Herawi, are
opportunities to connect others to the crossroads culture he
remembers, and to an Afghanistan that is far removed from the one on
television screens worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "Any culture connects with music," he says. "It is universal; even
animals understand or resonate with harmony. Americans or other
cultures that are not too familiar with traditional Afghan music can
instantly feel its force, because it transcends all borders and all
cultures, music from the heart of Asia."</TE>

<KH>Grammy Awards</KH>
<HD>You Heard It Here First</HD>
<DH>Often but not always the most deserving, U2 and Alicia Keys
are likely to snag the top honors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Grammy Awards show producers should open the telecast Wednesday
with U2's "Beautiful Day," because there's no real suspense when it
comes to naming the best album this year.</LD>
<LD>   The Irish quartet's "All That You Can't Leave Behind," which
includes the song, is the runaway favorite to win in the most
prestigious Grammy category, which would make it the first rock band
to win the best album award twice. "The Joshua Tree" was named best
album in 1988.</LD>
<LD>   A victory would climax a remarkable 15 months for the band, whose
album and world tour not only reestablished it as a critical and
commercial cornerstone in rock, but also helped restore confidence in
rock music's ability to inspire a mass audience.</LD>
<TE>   That kind of momentum could lead to a sweep of the top Grammy
categories most years, but it's not likely this time because
21-year-old Alicia Keys generated considerable momentum herself. The
singer-songwriter, who was the Cinderella story of pop last year, is
nominated in six categories and she stands a strong chance of winning
in most of them.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a guide to some of the most interesting Grammy matchups.
Wednesday's ceremony will be held at Staples Center and broadcast on
KCBS-TV at 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Album of the Year</TE>
<TE>   The nominees: India.Arie's "Acoustic Soul," Bob Dylan's "Love and
Theft," OutKast's "Stankonia," U2's "All That You Can't Leave Behind"
and the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the Grammy brain trust gave final responsibility for
choosing nominees in the top categories to a blue ribbon committee in
1995, the best album nominees have been impressive.</TE>
<TE>   "All That You Can't Leave Behind" isn't as inspiring as "The
Joshua Tree," but it is a passionate and well-crafted work and it
would be a popular choice in this category. But "Love and Theft" and
"Stankonia" were even more acclaimed, and a victory by either would
also be hailed by many pop observers.</TE>
<TE>   The OutKast collection would be the first hard-core rap album to
win in this category, while "Love and Theft" is even more ambitious
than Dylan's 1997 Grammy winner "Time Out of Mind."</TE>
<TE>   The remaining albums are respectable, but a notch or two below the
other choices. The longshot would be "O Brother," which could emerge
on top if Dylan draws enough votes from U2. The soundtrack will draw
a lot of support from Nashville and fans of the Coen brothers movie.</TE>
<TE>   Likely winner: U2.</TE>
<TE>   Most deserving: Bob Dylan.</TE>
<TE>   Record of the Year</TE>
<TE>   The nominees: India.Arie's "Video," Alicia Keys' "Fallin',"
OutKast's "Ms. Jackson," Train's "Drops of Jupiter" and U2's "Walk
On."</TE>
<TE>   India.Arie picked up more nominations (seven) than Keys, which was
a surprise because Keys got more radio play, more enthusiastic
reviews and more sales during the year. But while the screening
committee put Arie in this field, the full academy membership, which
now exceeds 13,000 will likely side with Keys. If for no other
reason, she has greater name recognition, often an important factor
in a lengthy Grammy ballot (101 categories this year).</TE>
<TE>   U2 is also a force, but "Beautiful Day" won last year in this
category (which honors a single track rather than an entire album),
so it's unlikely voters will honor the band two years in a row for
best record, especially when "Beautiful Day" was a more compelling
track.</TE>
<TE>   Key's "Fallin'," a soul-accented expression of being helplessly in
love, brings a modern sensibility to the classic soul tradition.
"Video" is a liberating expression of self-affirmation, but it wasn't
as big a hit, so it probably won't be as familiar to the mass
membership.</TE>
<TE>   Likely winner and most deserving: Alicia Keys.</TE>
<TE>   Song of the Year</TE>
<TE>   The nominees: Train's "Drops of Jupiter," Alicia Keys' "Fallin',"
Nelly Furtado's "I'm Like a Bird," U2's "Stuck in a Moment You Can't
Get Out Of," India.Arie, Carlos Broady and Shannon Sanders' "Video."</TE>
<TE>   The wild card here is U2. If there is a U2 sweep, "Stuck" could be
carried along. It's a moving statement of emotional disconnection.
But there is usually a correlation between this category, which is
for the songwriter only, and the best record category, which
considers all the elements in a single recording, including song,
vocal and instrumentation. Because different U2 works were nominated
in the categories, it suggests that neither was dominant in voters'
minds. The Keys song has more of a universal feel--it's the kind of
song that could have been sung in the '60s by Aretha Franklin or be
revived 30 years from now by a new generation of soul artists.</TE>
<TE>   Likely winner and most deserving: Alicia Keys.</TE>
<TE>   Best New Artist</TE>
<TE>   The nominees: India.Arie, Nelly Furtado, David Gray, Alicia Keys
and Linkin Park.</TE>
<TE>   Linkin Park's "Hybrid Theory" was the biggest-selling album of
2001, but the rap-rock group's appeal is almost exclusively to teens,
and there is little reason for adult Grammy voters to identify with
it. Besides, this award usually goes to a solo artist. Keys and Arie
are worthy, but Keys has the wider range and more striking ambition.</TE>
<TE>   Likely winner and most deserving: Alicia Keys.</TE>
<TE>   Pop Vocal Album</TE>
<TE>   The nominees: Nelly Furtado's "Whoa, Nelly!," Janet Jackson's "All
for You," Elton John's "Songs From the West Coast," 'N Sync's
"Celebrity" and Sade's "Lovers Rock."</TE>
<TE>   Sade's smooth, understated style would seem to be tailor-made for
mainstream Grammy voters, but she's only won twice (best R&amp;B vocal
with a group in 1993 and best new artist in 1985). John has won five
times but never in a high-profile category, so he is overdue. It
helps that this is his strongest album in decades--easily the class
of the field.</TE>
<TE>   Likely winner and most deserving: Elton John.</TE>
<TE>   Rock Album</TE>
<TE>   The nominees: Ryan Adams' "Gold," Aerosmith's "Just Push Play," PJ
Harvey's "Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea," Linkin Park's
"Hybrid Theory," U2's "All That You Can't Leave Behind."</TE>
<TE>   U2 is a cinch here. The media buzz about Adams probably hasn't
infected the membership, and the critically adored Harvey is
considered too much an outsider in Grammy circles.</TE>
<TE>   Likely winner and most deserving: U2.</TE>
<TE>   R&amp;B Album</TE>
<TE>   The nominees: Aaliyah's "Aaliyah," India.Arie's "Acoustic Soul,"
Mary J. Blige's "No More Drama," Destiny's Child's "Survivor," Alicia
Keys' "Songs in A Minor."</TE>
<TE>   This is one of the most competitive fields. The big if is whether
voters want to pay tribute to Aaliyah, the young singer who was
killed in a plane crash last year. Everyone here has a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Likely winner and most deserving: Alicia Keys.</TE>
<TE>   Rap Album</TE>
<TE>   The nominees: Eve's "Scorpion," Ja Rule's "Pain Is Love," Jay-Z's
"The Blueprint," Ludacris' "Back for the First Time;" OutKast's
"Stankonia."</TE>
<TE>   There is a lot of commercial firepower here, but the best album
nomination for "Stankonia" makes OutKast the odds-on favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Likely winner and most deserving: OutKast.</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary Folk Album</TE>
<TE>   The nominees: Bob Dylan's "Love and Theft," Buddy &amp; Julie Miller's
"Buddy &amp; Julie Miller," various artists' "Poet: A Tribute to Townes
Van Zandt," Gillian Welch's "Time (The Revelator)," Lucinda Williams'
"Essence."</TE>
<TE>   This category, a dumping ground for albums a little left of rock
and a little right of country, is a critic's delight. Just look at
the winners over the past five years: Emmylou Harris' "Red Dirt
Girl," Tom Waits' "Mule Variations," Lucinda Williams' "Car Wheels on
a Gravel Road," Dylan's "Time Out of Mind" and Bruce Springsteen's
"The Ghost of Tom Joad." Dylan and Williams are back again, and both
had marvelous albums, but Dylan will reign.</TE>
<TE>   Likely winner and most deserving: Bob Dylan.</TE>
<TE>   Producer of the Year (Non-Classical)</TE>
<TE>   The nominees: T Bone Burnett, Dr. Dre, Gerald Eaton/ Brian West,
Nigel Godrich, Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Dre is the greatest hip-hop producer ever, but he won in this
category last year, when he had much stronger credits. He's back this
time chiefly on name value and respect. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis are
also much respected, they've won before in this category, and their
work in 2001 (including the Janet Jackson album) wasn't strong enough
to earn them a repeat. The competition will be Burnett, the guiding
force behind the "O Brother" album. Eaton/West worked with Nelly
Furtado; Godrich produced the Travis and Radiohead albums.</TE>
<TE>   Likely winner and most deserving: T Bone Burnett.</TE>

<HD>Decline of the No. 1 Single</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Hilburn's analysis of why No. 1 records simply don't carry the
same weight that they once did is commendable for taking on the
"profit at any cost" mentality of the music business, but especially
perceptive is his argument as to why Mariah Carey is as lightweight a
figure as has ever been produced by pop music ("The Not-So-Big Hit
Single," Feb. 17).</LD>
<LD>   For years we've been told by publicity flacks and lapdog critics
about Carey's prodigious vocal talents. That she has never come close
to producing anything of substance is a statement that has begged to
be made, and finally someone has braved the industry's wrath to tell
the truth.</LD>
<LD>   Not to kick the woman when she's down, but isn't it interesting
how she was dropped so quickly by a major label that chose to cut its
losses now rather than later? This single act was a
multimillion-dollar vote of no confidence on the part of EMI, and one
that suggests her days of rivaling the Beatles' or Elvis' record
sales have come to a merciful close.</LD>
<TE>   Now how about some similar truth-telling on that other diva of all
artifice and little art, Whitney Houston?</TE>
<TE>   MIKE VILLANO</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hilburn's article illustrates that music in recent years has
rather stagnated. Additionally, due to the decrease in retail sales
and availability of CD singles since the mid-'90s, consumers cannot
buy their favorite songs, and this affects the songs' potential
ranking on the Billboard Hot 100. A lot of songs on the list reflect
airplay-only points more than sales points.</TE>
<TE>   These days, unlike the good old days of Top 40 radio, i.e., KFI,
KHJ, even KIIS-FM and KRTH-FM, back in the early '80s and '70s, or
even the mighty 690, out of San Diego (early '80s), there is no
variety on any one station. Top 40 stations today choose from such a
narrow playlist that songs are repetitive. Most of these songs are
not even available in stores.</TE>
<TE>   Songs that are released as singles but receive very little airplay
don't make No. 1 either, which leaves only a select few to make the
top spot. This criterion also results in little turnover atop the Hot
100. Since many weeks go by without a change at the top, there is
little variety of No. 1 songs each year since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   I have a collection of 45s and CD singles from 1955 to the
present, including every song to hit No. 1 on the Hot 100 since "Rock
Around the Clock" (July 1955), 940 singles in all. But because of the
chart methodology change in late 1991, the reduction of singles and
tight radio playlists, there has not been a good selection of
national No. 1 singles or a good representation of a year's music
hits to make No. 1, as compared to the '50s through the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Lately I've considered not buying current singles. I have to order
them from the U.K., since every hit song there is available as a CD
single ($7.99 each, plus shipping). Awesome for the British
consumers, bad for U.S. consumers and collectors.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What is Hilburn's point? The fact that he compares Carey's salary
to what the Enron executives stole is ridiculous. What is she, a
criminal?</TE>
<TE>   I just love how faceless cowards like Hilburn can so easily rip
someone to pieces. He sure worked diligently in compiling all of his
little facts and stats. Quite impressive! And for what? To point his
almighty finger, to voice his almighty opinion about someone's art,
someone's heart and soul?</TE>
<TE>   People like him will never understand what true risk is. He will
remain among those timid souls who know not the true joy of success
nor the heartache of failure.</TE>

<TE>   I really liked your article about Mariah Carey that I read online.
I was really annoyed when Carey came to Germany last year to promote
her movie "Glitter" (which also flopped here).</TE>
<TE>   In every TV show and interview, she was announced as the
best-selling female artist. But I am almost sure that this is not
true since she has only seven platinum certifications here in Europe,
while Celine Dion has 33 and Madonna has more than 60 platinum
certifications. I know that Carey is the biggest selling in the U.S.,
but certainly not Europe.</TE>

<LD>Evidently, Paul Brownfield is unhappy that he's not married to Julia
Louis-Dreyfus, or he wouldn't be sniping at writer-producer Brad Hall
("Married ... With Issues," Feb. 10).</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, Brownfield as much as accused Hall of being from
Harvard and a trust-fund kid. Hall's denials were not enough,
however, as Brownfield still referred to him in the article as
looking "like one of those Harvard Lampoon guys." Hmm. I don't know
what bone Brownfield has to pick with Hall, but I think it's hard
enough to produce quality television in this town without some gadfly
taking potshots at you in the paper.</LD>
<LD>   I know Hall to be a man of integrity, good humor and humility.
Several times Brownfield referred to what he called Hall having
"virtually no sitcom staff experience," overlooking that gem of a
show that Hall co-produced and co-wrote, "Brooklyn Bridge." I'm still
waiting for Hollywood to produce another show that charming and
delightful. Let's hope that shows of the quality of "Brooklyn
Bridge," and men of integrity such as Hall, all have long runs.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The other night I saw "Black Hawk Down." I was moved to think of
another film directed by Ridley Scott.</LD>
<LD>   In 1979, Scott directed "Alien," a story about a group of men and
women dressed in sexy military outfits who are sent to a distant
planet to investigate a distress signal and are attacked by a giant
bug.</LD>
<LD>   In 2001, he directed "Black Hawk Down," a story about a group of
men--no women--dressed in sexy military outfits who are sent to a
foreign county to rescue a group of Americans in distress. The bugs
are human beings in Africa, Somalis, who are called "skinnys," an
allusion to their famished physiques.</LD>
<TE>   "Alien" lavished great intelligence and care on its characters,
the world they lived in, and the motives that drove them to their
tragic and heroic destinies.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Hawk Down" was so anxious to get to the slaughter that it
ignored character development and waived any explanation of the
circumstances that pitted Somalis against Americans. As a result,
when Americans die, you can't feel anything--you don't even know who
they are. When Somalis die, they are dead bugs.</TE>
<TE>   In "Alien," corporate greed and duplicity were held responsible
for putting the astronauts in harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   In "Black Hawk Down," we never learn what put anyone--the Marines
or the Somalis--in harm's way. The only thing that gets respect in
this flick is the machinery--guns, choppers and editing equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Who would have thought that "Alien"--a film conceived in the
cultural wasteland of the late 1970s--would have fared so well in
comparison?</TE>
<TE>   "Alien." "Black Hawk Down." Ridley Scott. Jerry Bruckheimer. Rock
on, America, 2002.</TE>

<HD>They're Believers First, Then Artists</HD>
<DH>Only committed Christians can join Actors Co-op. They say
shared faith lends cohesion on stage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actors Co-op is the L.A. theater that prays before it plays.
Literally. To join, an actor must be a committed Christian. That, and
a pretty fair thespian.</LD>
<LD>   In 10 seasons, the company--based at the First Presbyterian Church
of Hollywood--has been nominated 13 times for Ovation Awards. It has
won six Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards, including a 1996
citation for sustained achievement by a small theater.</LD>
<LD>   Ensemble members say that a special cohesiveness born of
intimately shared faith is crucial to what happens on stage. But the
co-op learned early on that preachiness doesn't pay.</LD>
<TE>   Company leaders do have spiritual and moral issues in mind when
they choose plays: "Man at a Crossroads" is this season's theme--a
look at moral choices and their consequences. But the religious touch
is light and decidedly non-dogmatic. This season's shows, all
frequently seen on secular stages, include Alan Menken-Howard
Ashman's "Little Shop of Horrors," George Bernard Shaw's "The Devil's
Disciple" and Arthur Miller's "All My Sons." "Fools," the co-op's
latest show, opened this weekend. "I'm not a Christian, but their
work speaks to the soul of everyone," said Julie Briggs, an Actors
Co-op fan who is co-founder and artistic director of Moving Arts, a
small theater in downtown Los Angeles. "You don't get the sense of an
agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, though, the agenda is avowedly Christian. Every
Monday evening, the members meet to discuss business and bond. Each
is pledged to a Statement of Faith that says, "All of our members
must be born again through Jesus Christ.... We will seek first God's
kingdom and look to Him to reveal our place as actors in it."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Monday, about half of the 60 actors in the company
were scattered about the Crossley Theatre, one of two 99-seat spaces
at the church that Actors Co-op uses rent-free for shows and
rehearsals. First came a charitable ritual--the passing of a velvet
purse to collect money to help needy company members through
emergencies. Then, separating into groups of three, the players began
to talk quietly and pray.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Baldwin, a husky man with small eyeglasses and a Vandyke
beard, invoked God, "the author of all comedy," on behalf of the cast
of "Fools," a play about a village of idiots that Neil Simon adapted
from Russian Jewish folklore. "Let them get the rhythm right," he
prayed.</TE>
<TE>   Not every member believes in the same way. "Some people are really
fundamentalist Christian, and then there are people who are black
sheep," said Tim Woodward. He considers himself the company
troublemaker, the one who argues for more daring approaches when it
comes to strong language and sexuality. Last year, company leaders
had to ask Woodward to tone down his bawdy gesticulating when he
played Touchstone, the randy jester in Shakespeare's "As You Like
It." Given his druthers, Woodward said, the company would be freed of
such strictures, and artistic adventurousness would overcome
religious caveats. "But," he added, "part of the success is that
everything is prayed about, and prayer works."</TE>
<TE>   Joel Swetow, who considers himself an atheistic Jew, went in with
his radar on for signs of censorship or interference when Actors
Co-op hired him last year to direct "As You Like It" on the strength
of his past Shakespearean work with the Glendale classical stage
company A Noise Within. He came out delighted. He felt no pressure to
take part in the prayer sessions before each rehearsal and
performance, but sometimes joined in.</TE>
<TE>   "I never felt like there was any judgment against me when I didn't
participate," Swetow said. "The tenor of it was, 'We thank you, Lord,
for allowing us to be here, we thank you for Joel, we pray that you
give him inspiration.' We used to joke about that: 'If you're asking
God to inspire me, I must be doing a terrible job.' I enjoyed the
people and the process so much that I would go back there in a
flash."</TE>
<TE>   Actors Co-op began meeting in 1987, led by David Schall, a
transplanted Pennsylvanian who was passionate about acting and the
ministry. The company's first two productions were overtly
Christian--much too overt for the critics. "We woke up and realized
we were alienating the very people we wanted to embrace and draw in,"
Schall said. "We took stock and reconsidered what our contract with
our audience was."</TE>
<TE>   Producing director Nan McNamara and artistic director Gary Lee
Reed say there are certain unbreakable constraints for a theater that
has a Christian charter and operates on church grounds. Profanity can
be heard only sparingly, when the context justifies its use. The
company expurgated some epithets from its season-opening "Little Shop
of Horrors," for instance. Sexuality always will be treated gingerly.
Nudity is out.</TE>
<TE>   Schall, producing director for Actors Co-op's first six seasons,
says that until a few years ago, play selections were vetted by a
drama committee designated by the church.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the committee vetoed "The Boys Next Door," about a group
home for mentally disabled men, because a crucial scene was laced
with profanity. "That was a little painful," said Schall. The play's
impact and the context of the harsh language justified stretching the
boundaries, he said. In 1996, "The Runner Stumbles," about a priest
accused of murdering a nun, was dropped as potentially offensive to
Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   Church-theater relations have grown more relaxed with time, Schall
said, and so have the reins. Play selection is now strictly in the
hands of the theater company.</TE>
<TE>   Reed and McNamara see opportunities for more
adventurousness--within limits. When Reed directed "Godspell" in
2000, one scene depicted a man stoned and tied to a fence. It was a
deliberate evocation of the torment inflicted on Matthew Shepard, the
gay college student who was gruesomely beaten and left to die in
Laramie, Wyo. Reed said he didn't trumpet the parallel, but it was
there to lend current meaning to the story for anyone who wanted to
make the connection.</TE>
<TE>   Anton Chekhov's "The Seagull," also staged in 2000, bothered some
conservative playgoers because its cast of flawed characters offered
no examples of alternative behavior, Reed said. With the upcoming
"All My Sons," co-op audiences again will be left contemplating a
tragic play with a shattering ending.</TE>
<TE>   "The last three years we have tried to do more of showing people
going down those darker paths," McNamara said. "We always want to
balance a season with [lighter] shows, but we think it is important
to do those kinds of plays."</TE>
<TE>   The theater's vital signs seem strong. McNamara said Actors Co-op
will spend about $360,000 this season, most of it to stage
productions and pay its five employees. The theater earns 60% to 65%
of its budget at the box office and raises the rest from donors. With
the church forgiving the rent, providing free office space and paying
utility bills, Actors Co-op can funnel more money into the strong
production values that are one of its trademarks.</TE>
<TE>   The co-op has no trouble finding talent, despite the rule that
only believers can belong. Last year, McNamara said, 200 actors
applied and 100 auditioned for 14 openings in the annual spring
tryouts. McNamara estimates that about a third of the 60 current
members make their livings in show business--but they don't do it at
Actors Co-op. Players earn $7 to $15 for each performance. Co-op
leaders dream of changing that. They envision an Actors Co-op housed
in a 400-seat theater away from church grounds. There, some
strictures concerning language and sexuality might be loosened
somewhat. But not wanting to sever ties with the church, they would
keep running the 99-seat Crossley Theatre and Crossley Terrace
Theatre as well.</TE>
<TE>   Their model for expansion is the 350-seat Lamb's Players Theatre
in San Diego. That company came into being in 1971, when a group of
Christian hippies began doing street theater. Now Lamb's boasts a
budget of almost $4 million and nearly 8,000 subscribers, compared
with 1,200 at Actors Co-op.</TE>
<TE>   Reed belonged to a secular theater company in Los Angeles before
joining Actors Co-op. "When you'd get in serious conversations, it
was about work and business, the superficial day-to-day dealing with
our careers," he said. For him, Actors Co-op makes possible a closer,
more fundamental human connection that begets onstage cohesiveness.
But show business remains a business, even when conducted in Jesus'
name.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice," Reed said, "if our company was able to make a
living doing this."</TE>

<HD>To Err Is His Specialty</HD>
<DH>In his plays and films, Kenneth Lonergan writes about what
he knows: the difficulty of doing the right thing.</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>On a recent afternoon, writer Kenneth Lonergan, Kenny to his friends,
rushes into a Greenwich Village cafe near his apartment, apologetic
for being late, wearing the rumpled sleeplessness of what he has
recently become: a new dad. Nellie Sharp Lonergan is his weeks-old
baby daughter with actress-wife J. Smith-Cameron.</LD>
<LD>   Told that the moniker sounds like a stage name, the 39-year-old
Lonergan replies, "Yeah, for vaudeville. The instinct is to say, I
hope she doesn't go into show business, but I like show business. But
if she does, I'll know that I will have done something wrong because
all the actresses I know had either neglectful or dead fathers."</LD>
<LD>   For someone who admittedly hates change and who has cultivated
something of the image of the crabby writer in interviews ("And the
Whiner Is ..." was the headline of a New York magazine profile last
year), Lonergan appears to have taken the seismic shift with aplomb,
even cheer.</LD>
<TE>   "The expectation was horrible, but the reality is wonderful," he
says of his new role as a parent, with an element of surprise in his
voice. "The full impact has not yet come down on us, but I'm very
happy--which isn't always the way I feel."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed Lonergan seems to share the skittish discontent--the
suspicion that life could very well be about to play a dirty trick on
you--of his most memorable characters. Those include the erratic
Reagan-era stoners in "This Is Our Youth," which first catapulted him
into the first ranks of New York playwrights six years ago. Or like
Samantha and Terry, the tragedy-stricken siblings of "You Can Count
on Me," the acclaimed independent film he directed and appeared in
two year ago that earned him an Oscar nomination for best original
screenplay. (His two previous films, "Analyze This," which was a
box-office smash, and "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle," which
was a turkey, have their own species of blighted characters. But
Lonergan doesn't lay claim to either of those films because his
original vision was diluted in the development process by subsequent
writers.)</TE>
<TE>   Lonergan's deft explorations into the psychological complexities
and moral quandaries of people struggling--and often failing--to do
the right thing extend to two of his recent plays that are being
produced on the West Coast. "Lobby Hero," about a hapless security
guard who finds himself implicated in the possible cover-up of a
murder, is at South Coast Repertory through March 24. "The Waverly
Gallery," a harrowing portrait of an elderly woman's descent into
senility and its corrosive effect on her well-meaning family, opens
in June at the Pasadena Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Lonergan is drawn to writing about these types of characters
because this is what he sees around him. "I don't know anybody who
doesn't self-destruct constantly," he says, zestfully digging into a
very late lunch of provolone and prosciutto. Between bites, he stops
to qualify what strikes him as a bit exaggerated. "If you're existing
at a certain level of economic comfort, if you're not worried about
starving, or being blown up, or trying to pay the rent or feed your
10 children that you can't afford, then your problems become
self-generated or at least are helped along...."</TE>
<TE>   Pointing to the character Terry in "You Can Count on Me," he adds,
"You get insulted when no one's insulting you or you're depressive or
just go down the list. Of the people I know well, I don't know anyone
who does not have some inhibiting characteristics of some kind that
get in their way more often than external forces do. There are people
who get hit by disease or bad luck and hardship or crime, but I know
more about the other kinds of trouble."</TE>
<TE>   The trouble that invades "Lobby Hero," springs from the misguided
attempts of all of the characters--an immature security guard, his
besieged and fault-finding supervisor, and the two cops on the beat,
a female rookie and a slick professional--to make sense of the murky
challenges they can't hope to sort out. Jeff, the security guard who
sleeps on the job and must suddenly decide whether to back an alibi
for the ne'er-do-well brother of his boss, is the "hero" of the
title. But the word--which has been so much a part of the popular
discourse these days--is one Lonergan uses without sneer or irony.</TE>
<TE>   "Kenny is the master of the small moment, but he doesn't belittle
or condescend to the misfits and outsiders he writes about," says
Mark Brokaw, who directed the New York productions of "This is Our
Youth" and "Lobby Hero," which premiered last March at New York's
Playwrights Horizons. "He captures their full range in a magnanimous
and truthful way, especially the humor."</TE>
<TE>   In "Lobby Hero," some of that humor stems from Jeff's naivete,
alienating others even as he tries to ingratiate himself. "Isn't it
stupid that you're the captain when there are no other ranks?" he
asks his boss.</TE>
<TE>   "I think one of the things that this story is about is that it's
not the easiest thing in the world to be a hero for your whole life,"
the writer says. "I don't think there's anything ambiguous about a
fireman running into a burning building to save people. That's pretty
straightforward. But it's usually not as simple as it may appear. For
most of us, it's not as clear as all that. Often, whatever you do
that seems like the right thing to do in one way is quite likely
going to do somebody else some harm in a way that you can't control."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the unforeseen consequences of such decisions, defiant as
they are of such black-and-white moral resolution, is a major thrust
of one of his most recent projects: the film adaptation of T.H.
White's "The Once and Future King," a quartet of works completed
between 1938 and 1958, with a fifth published posthumously in 1977.
The tale of Arthurian legend may at first seem an unlikely choice for
someone who has come to the fore as a chronicler of contemporary
malaise. But Lonergan says the book has been a favorite since he was
a child in Manhattan, the son of a doctor and psychoanalyst who
divorced when he was 5. At 18, before he attended New York
University's playwriting program, Lonergan turned the first chapter
of the work into a movie scene as an exercise.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a delightful but very sad book," he says of the novel that
became the basis for the stage and film musical "Camelot." "It starts
out as a children's story, beginning with Arthur as a young boy, and
the style of the book itself matures as the character grows older.
It's just a great, massive medieval tapestry of a tragedy and all the
stuff of armor and jousting and relationship are just very rich
material for a movie."</TE>
<TE>   Although White's take on the legend was to compare the events of
Arthur and his court to the mid-20th century England in which he was
writing--suggesting that the knights were the cricket stars of their
day and that donning a suit of armor was similar to getting into a
diving suit--Lonergan says he has no desire to bring a contemporary
sensibility to his adaptation, which he is writing for producer Mark
Gordon and Warner Bros. He wants his screenplay to be a faithful
adaptation of "Once and Future King"--indeed that is his raison
d'etre for taking on a story that has already reached the screen in
many other guises.</TE>
<TE>   But Lonergan sees its resonance today in other, more human terms.</TE>
<TE>   "White is also trying to say that this was the first attempt to
create a civilization," he says, "and that it fails because people
are imperfect and we haven't yet managed to create a civilization.
Like Jeff [in 'Lobby Hero'], the characters in the King Arthur story
are trying very hard to do what is right, to be better people. And in
being active in that, with all their faults and desires, they bring
wrack and ruin down around them."</TE>
<TE>   Lonergan's defiance of easy resolution in his work would seem to
make him something of an anomaly to the major studios. But not only
is he adapting "Once and Future King," but the writer has taken on
"Time and Again," Jack Finney's 1970 novel about a young illustrator
who time-travels to 1882 New York in a scientific experiment.
Lonergan says he was so taken by the credibility and historical
detail in the book that over the years he would ask his agent
(whoever that happened to be at the time) to inquire of the film
rights holder, Robert Redford, if he could write the screenplay.
Finally, after the success of "You Can Count on Me," Lonergan got the
job.</TE>
<TE>   "The plot is a bit rickety and the characterizations aren't that
great," he says of the novel, "but that doesn't matter because Finney
captures so vividly the sheer excitement and fascination of
time-traveling. The guy is so excited about it that he, literally,
almost faints."</TE>
<TE>   Lonergan has also been spending time in the 19th century for
Martin Scorsese, doing brush-up work on the filmmaker's "Gangs of New
York," which is set in the 1860s. The film is due for release this
summer. Scorsese has been something of a mentor, showing early
interest in "Analyze This" and commissioning a screenplay, as yet
unproduced, about an amateur archeologist. "I love the period and the
material and working with him," Lonergan says of "Gangs" and its
director. "But it wasn't a case of pursuing an artistic vision of my
own." What fascinates him, he adds, are "these full-blown
personalities moving through a historic milieu that has not been seen
before in any American movie. The politics of the time affect what
they do, and yet they really don't notice the world around them. It's
a hard thing to balance, and Scorsese is wonderful at it."</TE>
<TE>   For Lonergan, his first stop on a time machine would be 1770s
Europe--"You could go to Mozart and Haydn concerts, travel to America
and meet George Washington and Thomas Jefferson"--but for now he's
content to be exactly where he is: New York in 2002, husband and
father and playwright and screenwriter who is trying to avoid the
pitfalls and blandishments of success to keep pursuing his
iconoclastic visions.</TE>
<TE>   Believing in his press--which he admits he enjoys reading--is
likely only to make him destructively self-conscious. "I've always
had the grandiose fantasy that if I ever were successful, it would
ruin the quality of my work," he says with a characteristic
half-smile. "I do think the more you struggle, the more you tend to
be doing your own thing. But if someone writes something nice, then
you're at your typewriter, thinking, 'Oh yes, this is so
characteristic of my understanding of the mentality of outsiders,'
and that's not good. What you're writing is likely to be quite bad in
fact."</TE>
<TE>   The pabulum that is often doled out to the public, he says, is not
only condescending but terribly misguided. "It's like they do a story
about your situation and then they lie about it; they put this
phony-baloney salve over it," he says with some passion. "And the
truth is, it doesn't feel so good. I don't like movies that are all
bleak and bad--we know life is tragic--but there are billions of
people who have experiences that end horribly, and they're stuck
trying to figure out what it all means and how they're going to get
on with it. And one of the ways they get on with it is the fact that
they like each other a lot."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, that is the story of perhaps Lonergan's toughest play,
"The Waverly Gallery," in which a former lawyer-turned-art dealer, a
woman with a terrific zest for life, falls victim to the confusion
and horrors of Alzheimer's. Ben Brantley of the New York Times called
the drama, which opened in 2000 at the Promenade and turned out to be
the swan song for the late Eileen Heckart, "a stirring and soulful
comic drama ... painful and hilarious." It was based on the
experiences of Lonergan's grandmother. At one point, the woman's
grandson turns to his mother and tells her suddenly, out of the blue,
"Mom, I love you" as a hedge against the uncertain future.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that is the only redemptive thing to be had out of that
experience, and I think that's a lot," Lonergan explains. "If there's
anything good to be had from that problem, mental decay and death, it
is the fact that people try so hard to help the person going through
it and how hard people struggle to stay alive. While it's tragically
upsetting because they don't get to, it does tell you something good
about being alive. It has great value and it's admirable, all those
people in hospital rooms all over the world holding each other trying
to get through the crappy hands they've been dealt. What else do we
have?"</TE>

<HD>Tiny Saddle Creek Records Becomes a Mutual Omaha Admiration
Society</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Being among the most coveted unsigned rock acts in America has been a
profitable experience for Omaha band the Faint.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been going around and picking up free CDs from all the
record companies that have been talking to us," singer Todd Baechle
says.</LD>
<LD>   What the band has not been picking up, though, are the lucrative
contract offers from several major labels--including Interscope,
Warner Bros. and DreamWorks--eager to have it on their rosters.</LD>
<TE>   The band has made it pretty clear to suitors that it's happy with
its tiny Omaha label, Saddle Creek Records, also home to local
phenoms Bright Eyes and Desaparecidos and a recent release by
ethereal Athens, Ga., duo Azure Ray.</TE>
<TE>   "The label's doing well," Baechle says. "We're meeting with the
big label people in order to learn, get a better understanding of the
music business in general. We're a hands-on group, not willing to
give up a lot of power or say in our band."</TE>
<TE>   So far it seems to have worked out fine. The band's third album,
"Danse Macabre,"  came out last year to indie press and college radio
acclaim for its synth-centered sound, which recalls the early-'80s
electronic pop of Gary Numan and Depeche Mode.</TE>
<TE>   The band has also won a strong live following (it headlines L.A.'s
El Rey Theatre on Thursday) and is picking up such high-profile
supporters as No Doubt, which has invited the Faint to open an
upcoming series of dates (including March 27-28 at the Universal
Amphitheatre). In England, the band is the latest import rock
sensation, following the Strokes and the White Stripes.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's getting rich," says Saddle Creek President Robb Nansel,
estimating "Danse Macabre" sales at about 15,000. "But the bands are
able to make a living, and the label can sustain itself and put out
the records we want to. It grows every year, and it seems like it's
heading in the right direction. Doesn't seem we should mess with
what's going right."</TE>
<TE>   Singer Baechle says that he really isn't sure what advantages a
major label would bring to the band, other than financial
resources--a belief that's becoming more common as many artists,
veterans and newcomers, question the practices of corporate record
labels and look for alternatives. The White Stripes' deal with V2,
for example, gives the group full creative control and ownership of
its master tapes, something rarely done in major-label contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really care if we get on the radio or not," Baechle
says. "From where we're from, the radio is [bad]. Honestly, what
we're interested in is becoming a better band and making a better
record, and the sales of it all doesn't matter to us a whole lot.
Even if we couldn't make any money selling records anymore, we would
still be a band and hopefully make a living."</TE>
<TE>   Most major-label A&amp;R executives courting the band take Baechle and
Nansel at their word--at least for now. The White Stripes and ... And
You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead also rebuffed major offers
before signing last year with V2 and Interscope, respectively</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're still educating themselves on where they want to
fit in the record business," DreamWorks executive Luke Wood says.
"They're happy with Saddle Creek. But at the same time, they want the
resources and market reach of a major. They're true artists. I listen
to 'Danse Macabre,' and to me that record could become enormous the
way it is.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll someday have videos on MTV, and songs on that album would
light up the phones at KROQ. It's a matter of finding a partner and
at the same time protect their core values."</TE>
<TE>   AUCTION ACTION: A lot of rock stars have had to sleep on friends'
couches on their way up the ladder. Now you could sleep on Korn
singer Jonathan Davis' couch. It's one of the more intriguing items
being auctioned on Startrader, a new Web site dedicated to selling
musician-owned ephemera for charity.</TE>
<TE>   Startrader (www.startrader.com) was founded by Bobby Hewitt,
drummer in the band Orgy, basically as a vehicle for meaningful
housecleaning.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years of touring and being in bands, like anyone else, I
collected things, and they kept piling up in my closet and garage,"
Hewitt says. "I thought, 'It's worth money, I'm not going to throw it
all away, but I don't want to put it in the paper and have people
come to my house. I could have a Web site and sell it myself.' And
then I thought it would be great to have other artists, sort of an
online Recycler for musicians. And it started to grow and we brought
in charities."</TE>
<TE>   The venture was in development for a year and a half before its
recent launch, and already it has a range of items, mostly more
explicitly connected to rockdom than the sofa (bidding on which
starts at $800).</TE>
<TE>   Items range from the red jumpsuit worn on last year's Ozzfest tour
by Tommy Lee (bidding starts at $600) to a drum machine owned by
Hewitt ($300) to various backstage laminates and posters autographed
by members of Sugar Ray, Orgy, Kid Rock's band and others ($15 and
up).</TE>
<TE>   Startrader, run by Hewitt and Skip McNevin, a former Web designer
and video producer for NASA, is not-for-profit, with the sellers
allowed to designate charitable organizations to receive proceeds
from their items. Participating artists or companies will benefit
from links to their sites or streaming audio and video. But even
before any promotional element was considered, Hewitt says, he had no
trouble finding musicians interested in donating.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of artists I know have come to the same conclusions--'I
have all this stuff,'" he says. "They don't care about getting money
back but are into helping out others."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Bay Area hip-hop duo Blackalicious makes its
major-label debut with "Blazing Arrow," due April 30 from MCA
Records. Lyricist Gift of Gab and DJ-producer Chief Xcel are joined
on the album by, among others, Zack de la Rocha, the Roots'
?uestlove, Jurassic 5's Chali 2Na and Cut Chemist, Cibo Matto's Miho
Hatori, DJ Shadow, and urban poets Saul Williams and Gil
Scott-Heron.... "Since I Left You," by Australian act the Avalanches,
which makes its music entirely of samples from obscure '50s and '60s
records found in record-store bargain bins, has been picked up in the
U.S. by Elektra Records after Sire Records was shuttered shortly
after releasing the album last year. Elektra plans an aggressive
promotion campaign for the single "Frontier Psychiatrist." Tour plans
are on hold indefinitely, though, while member Darren Seltmann
recovers from serious leg injuries suffered when he leaped off a
speaker during a London concert last summer....</TE>
<TE>   Having achieved a platinum-selling album with R&amp;B singer Avant's
2000 album, "My Thoughts," Magic Johnson Music, the former Lakers
star's MCA-distributed label, has made its second
signing--Hawaii-raised singer Yasmeen. Her debut album is due in
July.</TE>

<LD>   ALANIS MORISSETTE</LD>
<LD>   "Under Rug Swept"</LD>
<TE>   Maverick</TE>
<TE>   Confession is good for the soul, and it's often good for
singer-songwriters. In her 1995 "Jagged Little Pill," Morissette
established herself at age 21 as one of the most absorbing pop
arrivals in years by digging deep inside to share memories that were,
by turns, raw, painful and cleansing. The collection sold about 30
million copies worldwide and won a Grammy for album of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Morissette was staggered by the success, and in the 1998
follow-up, "Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie" she again dug deep to
try to understand why all the good fortune hadn't erased her
long-standing lack of self-esteem.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a wonderfully liberating collection of songs about
inner peace that enabled us to identify with her feelings as easily
as we had in the first album. In the magical "Thank U," she reminded
us that we can find strength from even life's most difficult moments.
"Thank you terror, thank you disillusionment, thank you frailty,
thank you consequence, thank you silence," she sang, recalling the
inspiring grace of Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush's most moving music.</TE>
<TE>   Morissette--handling both the writing and production assignments
this time after co-writing the first two with producer Glen
Ballard--is again in a confessional mood on "Under Rug Swept" (due in
stores Tuesday), but the results are mixed. The music's textures
remain in an aggressive pop-rock style, but they sometimes seem
adrift rather than dynamically focused.</TE>
<TE>   Morissette's lyrics deal again with troubled relationships and
matters of self-esteem. Some of it works nicely, including the
tuneful "So Unsexy," the idealistic, socially conscious "Utopia" and
the introspective "This Particular Time."</TE>
<TE>   But too much of the album is more wearisome than revealing. In "21
Things," she spells out just what she expects from a relationship,
going through such a long list of complaints about former beaus that
it's almost comical.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a bad idea for a song, but the lyrics seem like something
jotted in a journal rather than tailored for a song. "Do you have a
big intellectual capacity but know that it alone does not equate
wisdom?" might be a valid thought for the song, but there must be a
more graceful way to express it. Morissette remains a major talent
who understands the importance of exploring private feelings, but she
needs to make the findings more universal.</TE>

<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   ... AND YOU WILL KNOW US</TE>
<TE>   BY THE TRAIL OF DEAD</TE>
<TE>   "Source Tags &amp; Codes"</TE>
<TE>   Interscope</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who thought At the Drive-In was a budding savior of rock
before it abruptly broke up last year can take heart. Trail of Dead,
from the same Texas circuit that produced ATDI, more than fills the
void with its major-label debut, making good on the promise of the
raw energy and intelligence of its prior independent releases and a
reputation for invigoratingly chaotic concerts.</TE>
<TE>   The opening "It Was There That I Saw You" makes the case for the
quartet's growing command: Massive avalanches of sound envelop an
engaging melodic sweep and lyrics nakedly romantic enough to make
your average emo-rocker blush--then, suddenly, the tumult gives way
to a passage of delicate beauty.</TE>
<TE>   "Beaudelaire" is a philosophical meditation on the inner sins
committed by an unexercised psyche, with music that churns like a
lost '60s garage nugget filtered through Sonic Youth. "Monsoon,"
another take on stormy emotions, sounds like Iggy Pop backed with
Who-like majesty.</TE>
<TE>   "Relative Ways" fits a bouncy rock melody to this thinking band's
existential crisis, as Conrad Keely sings, "All panic and struggle,
pain and decay / Are coming together in relative ways / This electric
guitar hanging at me knees / A couple of verses I can barely
breathe." A lot of bands are whistling in the growing darkness. Trail
of Dead also wants to shine a light. The band plays April 5 at the El
Rey Theatre in L.A. and April 6 at the Glass House in Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   CHER</TE>
<TE>   "Living Proof"</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   After getting all of that personal-statement stuff out of her
system in 2000 with the Internet-only release "not.com.mercial," an
album featuring her poetry set to music, Cher has electro-bopped back
to inspirational danceability in this follow-up to her 1998
blockbuster "Believe." Just in time to dedicate the pulsing new
single "(This Is) A Song for the Lonely" to the people of New York in
the aftermath of 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the veteran singer and actress planned it that way, of
course. She's just, again, suddenly in tune with the zeitgeist with
an uncanny timeliness that rivals Madonna's. Anyway, why mess with a
good thing? She's even reunited with "Believe" producers Mark Taylor
and Brian Rawling to make "Living Proof" (in stores Tuesday) another
neo-disco opus focused on lightweight-yet-uplifting sentiments as
penned by such reliable fluff-meisters as Diane Warren.</TE>
<TE>   Her ruminations on love lost and found, real and not, universal
and erotic, are all very smooth and soaring, but even given the
context, the inch-deep revelations quickly wear thin. Such variants
as the mournful, acoustic-flavored ballad "Rain, Rain" don't do much
to keep the songs' thoroughly modern two-step rhythms, throbbing
house beats, shimmery synths and Vocoder effects from blurring
together into one endlessly vibrating mechanism, with Cher the gooey
human center. But not even her throaty, over-enunciated sincerity can
make the repetitive points of feeling lonely/being happy/getting
cosmic very interesting.</TE>

<TE>   X-ECUTIONERS</TE>
<TE>   "Built From Scratch"</TE>
<TE>   Loud</TE>
<TE>   People often forget that rapping is just one of hip-hop's pillars.
Breakdancing, graffiti and DJ-ing have been largely overshadowed by
rappers in the culture's move into mainstream society.</TE>
<TE>   Performance DJs, who probably stand as the second-most-recognized
hip-hop expression because of their dexterous turntable tricks, are
still integral to many live rap shows and are often included in
rap-rock groups for credibility's sake. The X-ecutioners, however,
are no gimmick. With their second album (due Tuesday), Rob Swift, Roc
Raida, Mista Sinista and Total Eclipse deliver a sonic gem that
illustrates the vibrancy that can radiate through hip-hop recordings.</TE>
<TE>   Composed of sonic collages that cut and paste vocal snippets from
LL Cool J, KRS-One, Mobb Deep and others, songs such as "3 Boroughs"
acknowledge hip-hop's history and make their own statement via deft
scratching. "Let It Bang" with M.O.P. and "It's Gon' Down" with
Linkin Park show how hard-core rock sensibilities can be melded into
credible, scratch-laden hip-hop. The genius of groups such as the
X-ecutioners is best displayed live, where they can mount a hip-hop
symphony of sorts. When that's not possible, "Built From Scratch" is
the next best thing.</TE>
<TE>   Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Neil Finn &amp; Friends, "7 Worlds Collide," Nettwerk America. The
New Zealander may be the most Beatles-esque of all post-Fab Four
singer-composers, and he gets more than a little help from his
friends on this live set. Eddie Vedder, Radiohead's Phil Selway and
Ed O'Brien and others come along for this infinitely melodic ride
through a happily-rarely-after land of romantic disillusionment. The
emphasis is on gorgeously elegant pop balladry spanning Finn's
various group and solo projects, with detours into the Pearl Jam and
Smiths songbooks. The CD also includes new material from a solo album
due in April. Proceeds from the album (and an accompanying DVD) go to
Doctors Without Borders to help the group's work in Afghanistan. Finn
plays March 12 at the Galaxy Theatre in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Various artists, "Roswell: Original Television Soundtrack,"
Nettwerk America. There's nothing exactly out of this world, but this
collection spun off the alien youth soap weaves previously released
songs by strong yet ethereal women (Dido, Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl
Crow) and the new crop of English romantic rock acts (Coldplay,
Travis, Doves) to create an aura of mystery. Two versions of Dido's
"Here With Me" (the show's theme) frame the disc, with Zero 7's
future-soul "Destiny" and Doves' electronic-decorated version of the
Beatles' "Blackbird" the gravity-defying highlights. Show-related
CD-ROM features are a bonus for fans.</TE>
<TE>   S. H.</TE>
<TE>   *** Nappy Roots, "Watermelon, Chicken &amp; Gritz," Atlantic. Add
Kentucky to the list of states producing quality hip-hop music.
Bowling Green's Nappy Roots introduce a distinct brand of low-income
rap with their first major-label album (due Tuesday). Skinny DeVille,
Big V, Scales, Ron Clutch, B. Stille and R. Prophet are, as they put
it, "Ballin' on a Budget," injecting a frankness and a sense of pride
about their country lifestyle that make for an enticing package.</TE>
<TE>   S.B.</TE>
<TE>   ** The Mockers, "Living in the Holland Tunnel," One Eye Open.
Passionate fans of '60s and '70s pop-psychedelia might regard the
second album by the Virginia foursome as a classic painting, to be
displayed and revered forever. To the less zealous, however, the
12-song collection merely blends into the scenery, despite its snappy
lyrics and clever wordplay. The Mockers, who perform Tuesday at
Spaceland in L.A., show they are masters of their forebears' destiny
but, not yet anyway, their own.</TE>

<LD>The major successes of Diana Krall, followed by the growing
prominence of Jane Monheit, has opened the floodgates to what will
soon be a torrent of new, ambitious young jazz singers. But it would
be a shame if the fascination with relatively untested performers
obscured the work of a substantial number of older (but not old)
vocal artists.</LD>
<LD>   Janis Siegel, for example, has been a prominent member of the
Manhattan Transfer for three decades without leaving behind her
impressive abilities as a solo singer. On "I Wish You Love" (***,
Telarc Records), she has positioned herself in a solidly supportive
musical setting.</LD>
<LD>   Siegel has always had an ear for a good song, and the program here
is no exception, including such relatively offbeat items as "The Late
Late Show" and "The Big Hurt," as well as the more familiar "Don't Go
to Strangers." In part, the diversity of the material traces to the
album concept, focusing on pop songs of the '50s and '60s, as well as
jazz vocals that crossed over to the pop charts. But what makes it
all work is Siegel's unerring ability to find the dramatic heart of
such far-ranging pieces.</LD>
<TE>   Among the highlights: a lovely rendering of "(I'm Afraid) The
Masquerade Is Over," in which her vocal floats above a stretched-out
meter; and an insightful version of "Guess Who I Saw Today,"
accompanied only by Cedar Walton's piano, in which Siegel captures
both the sentimentality and the irony of this tricky evergreen. In
addition to Walton, the accompanying players include trumpeter Tom
Harrell and--performing with particular sensitivity--saxophonist
David "Fathead" Newman. (Siegel will be at the Jazz Bakery March 12
through 17 with the Eric Reed Trio.)</TE>
<TE>   Ann Hampton Callaway has been both well served and somewhat
handicapped by her remarkable versatility. Most recently, she has
performed on Broadway in the musical "Swing," she is a busy
songwriter (among others, "At the Same Time" on Barbra Streisand's
"Higher Ground" album) and she wrote (and performed) the perky theme
music for the sitcom "The Nanny."</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat obscured by all this activity has been the fact that
Callaway, when she puts her mind to it, is a fine jazz vocal artist.
On her new album, "Signature" (***, N-Coded Music/After Nine
Records), she definitely has focused herself.</TE>
<TE>   As with the Siegel album, a thematic foundation is evident. In
this case, as the title suggests, it is the gathering together of a
group of "signature" songs associated with some of Callaway's
favorite artists. Some examples: "In the Wee Small Hours" (Frank
Sinatra); "Tenderly" (Sarah Vaughan); "Good Morning, Heartache"
(Billie Holiday); and "The Best Is Yet to Come" (Tony Bennett).</TE>
<TE>   The task Callaway has set for herself is a daunting one: to honor
such legendary artists--especially in material they have managed to
creatively possess--without falling into the trap of simulation. To a
large extent, she has managed to do just that, remaining firmly in
touch with her highly personal style, while capturing the essence of
each tune.</TE>
<TE>   The most difficult was "Is That All There Is?"--so personally
associated with Peggy Lee (and now, sadly, so powerful a reminder,
via a CD arriving only weeks after Lee's passing). Although not her
most effective rendering, Callaway successfully finds her way through
the number. She has better luck with a similarly familiar original
source when she duets with Freddy Cole on "For All We Know," one of
his older brother Nat King Cole's classics. Not exactly
"Unforgettable," but memorable nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   Enhancing the production, the New York Voices join Callaway on
"Route 66" and "Twisted," with what appears to be a new, witty intro
by Callaway on the latter. Wynton Marsalis--who is a regular on her
albums--offers his version of Louis Armstrong to accompany Callaway's
romp through "Give Me a Kiss to Build a Dream On," and the presence
of Kenny Barron on piano adds the touch of musical class that he
always brings to a project.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Wilson and Ramsey Lewis recorded an album 17 years ago. But
in the case of 1984's "The Two of Us," their parts were recorded
separately, and they never performed together at the same time. On
"Meant to Be" (**1/2, Narada Jazz), however, they work in close
proximity. But even here one is obliged to make a slight disclaimer:
Although it's billed as a duo release, the CD in fact only includes
five songs by Wilson, with the balance dedicated to the always
elegant and listenable work of the Lewis trio.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's performances lately have revealed a diminution of some of
the pop-styled mannerisms that tended to dominate her work in the
'90s. Here, on three tracks--"Peel Me a Grape," "First Time Love" and
"Moondance"--she takes a laid-back approach, her voice soft, her
phrasing easygoing and her manner unprepossessing. But on the
remaining two pieces, "Piano in the Dark" and "Did I Ever Really
Live," many of the distracting qualities--a chasm-wide vibrato,
occasional yodeling and melodramatic climaxes--return. Given the
appealing qualities of the other numbers, it's particularly
bothersome that Wilson, who obviously is fully capable of fine jazz
artistry, doesn't do a better job of maximizing her enviable creative
abilities.</TE>
<TE>   As long as we're taking a look at veteran artists, I have to
include an album by a performer who is not really identified as a
jazz singer. Yet, like Sinatra, his phrasing and musical persona are
deeply rooted in the jazz experience.</TE>
<TE>   Henri Salvador is a legendary French performer with a career back
to performances with Django Reinhardt in the mid-'30s. I don't think
it's particularly ageist to note that--from his performances--one
would never suspect Salvador is 84 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Salvador spent a few years living in Rio de Janeiro, and Brazilian
rhythms course through many of the tracks on "Room With a View" (***,
Blue Note), which was released in France in 2000 (it has already sold
more than a million copies in Europe). In 2002, it won album of the
year at Les Victoires de la Musique (roughly, the French Grammys),
and Salvador was honored as male artist of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Although a few of the tracks are plagued by occasionally errant
pitch, Salvador's sweet-sounding voice and lovely phrasing more than
compensate. "All I Really Want Is Love," a duet with baby-voiced
Swedish singer Lisa Ekdahl, is the only track recorded especially for
the U.S. release of the album, presumably to pacify the
English-speaking market--and it's the least interesting. Blue Note
should have left well enough alone.</TE>
<TE>   Salvador's French-language vocals (as well as Portuguese and, on
the title track, English) communicate beautifully, especially over
the floating bossa nova rhythms of "Vagabond." On "Un Tour de
Manage," the harmonica of Toots Thielemans adds an atmospheric touch,
and on the marvelously romantic "Je Sais Que Tu Sais (Que je t'aime)"
he reveals the pleasures of a performance that transcends both genre
and age.</TE>

<DH>The London Symphony's fledgling in-house label is showing
other orchestras a way to record without corporate backing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Maestro Colin Davis, or Sir Colin as he's known in these parts, had
every reason to welcome the new year in January.</LD>
<LD>   His 2001 recording of Berlioz's opera "Les Troyens," with his
band, the London Symphony Orchestra, had already made many of the
best-of year-end lists.</LD>
<LD>   Then came the Grammy nominations: The CD, recorded on a fledgling
label called LSO Live, garnered three nominations--for best classical
album, best opera recording and best engineered recording.</LD>
<TE>   And that wasn't even the beauty part.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and company had created this "Les Troyens" entirely on their
own.</TE>
<TE>   LSO Live is the London Symphony Orchestra's private label. Other
orchestras, including the Chicago Symphony and the New York
Philharmonic, have gotten into the record business, issuing special
sets of recordings from their archives, with limited distribution,
but LSO Live is a different kind of enterprise: an orchestra going
head to head with the commercial record business--and winning.</TE>
<TE>   What makes it especially delicious--what "makes them feel rotten,"
says the maestro, "and us really good"--is the nyah-nyah-nyah factor:
The major record labels have deserted classical music in droves in
the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, music director at the LSO since 1995, is now 74, and he has
seen plenty of ups and downs in his trade over the years. But with
LSO Live in his back pocket, he can afford to see the current
situation as a bigger problem for "them" than for "us."</TE>
<TE>   "Since big business has removed its money from classical music,
the actual standard of the orchestras has gone up," he says, with
evident satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   "The big companies have missed the peak of the profession in some
way. They were interested in making money and they exploited the
repertory and the orchestras and the artists, [and then] they chucked
it in. But, you know, we're still there. Big business isn't going to
destroy classical music. It didn't invent it in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   The Barbican Centre is an imposing citadel of reinforced concrete
in central London, a city within the city, with countless flats
surrounding a huge arts center, within which sits the LSO's
wood-lined concert hall.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra almost matches the center as a monumental force.
There are five major orchestras in London, but the LSO is literally
at the center of things, giving more concerts than any of the others
and maintaining its claim to being the most recorded orchestra in the
world. That's LSO on Diana Krall's latest hit record, "The Look of
Love," and that will be the LSO, under John Williams' direction on
his score for the fifth installment of "Star Wars."</TE>
<TE>   It is just that recording strength that turned the LSO into a
do-it-yourself operation. Since its first recording in 1911, it had
been a major player in classical recording as well as film music and
other genres. Over coffee in the Barbican Centre recently, Chaz
Jenkins, general manager of LSO Live, laid out the saga. The push
toward self-recording came two years ago, when the orchestra's
diminishing classical recording schedule couldn't be ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the LSO's schedules in the '80s and right back
through its history, it has had constant recording sessions. A
typical day would be morning and afternoon at Abbey Road [studios],
and an evening doing a concert. Quite often, the concerts would be
done here, and they'd do the same concert at Abbey Road. Come the
'90s, the number of recordings went down and down as companies came
to re-evaluate classical recordings in the current market."</TE>
<TE>   The real impetus for LSO Live, he says, "all stems from the line
that we think, generally, what we're doing in concert is the very
best the LSO has ever performed--the best conductors, the best
soloists--and since the standard of playing is better than ever, we
thought it was a shame that what we're doing doesn't get regularly
recorded."</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't hurt that the LSO is used to going its own way. The
98-year-old ensemble was London's first self-governing orchestra;
there is no outside board. As Jenkins says, "In the LSO, technically,
I'm an employee of the musicians."</TE>
<TE>   The label was actually the brainchild of LSO general manager Clive
Gillinson, once a cellist in the ranks before he was drafted for the
"temporary" task of aiding an ailing administration ("I switched
loyalties," he explains). Starting in the late '90s, Gillinson looked
at the same history that Jenkins cites, and decided that the
orchestra should take matters into its own hands.</TE>
<TE>   He faced a few obstacles. First was the musician's union contract.
It called for the orchestra, conductors and soloists to be paid a fee
upfront for recording sessions, which made costs of experimenting
prohibitive. In 1999, however, the contract was eased. In the case of
live recordings, the musicians could be paid on a royalty basis. If
the CDs made money, the players and guest artists would too.</TE>
<TE>   Gillinson wasn't unhappy about having to record live; he knew it
would cut down on expenses all around. He figured the orchestra could
reasonably afford to hire freelance engineers, producers and
equipment to record in Barbican Hall, and, as Davis says, live
recordings produce "a tension which you don't always get in the
studio. You can get the thing right in the studio, but you can't get
that tightrope feeling, that which creates the excitement. I think
that we've captured some of that in these recordings."</TE>
<TE>   Distribution--getting albums shipped into retail stores--was a
different sort of obstacle, one that, at first, Gillinson decided to
avoid altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it would [be years] before we'd have enough [product]
to get distribution," Jenkins say. "We decided early on that we'd
just sell our recordings via our Web site [and at concerts]. It
seemed a sensible idea. We had a lot of traffic on our Web site, with
people booking tickets."</TE>
<TE>   LSO Live got underway in 1999, recording concert performances
during its regular season. From the beginning, the idea was to
cherry-pick the most interesting repertory and artist lineups. There
was some early serendipity, from Gillinson's standpoint, because the
orchestra had scheduled a series of Berlioz programs, conducted by
Davis. "He is, I suppose, the premiere Berlioz conductor in the
world," Gillinson says.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in January 2000, the label released Dvorak's "New World"
Symphony. Issues of Brahms, and the beginning of the Berlioz series
began followed quickly. To Jenkins, one sign of success came quickly.
"Within a couple of months, we started getting approached by
distributors," he says. "We only had three titles out by then." At
present, the albums are available in retail stores in 10 countries.
Next stop: the U.S.--Harmonia Mundi has just picked up the label for
distribution here.</TE>
<TE>   The five-part Berlioz series culminated with "Les Troyens," which
was recorded in late 2000 and released by spring 2001. It's a good
example of what LSO Live can achieve. Fast turnaround from live
concert to living-room listening; minimal cost (it was recorded over
a few performances, with minimal editing to clear up audience noise),
creating a four-disc set that sold for $30 (comparable studio sets
cost close to $65).</TE>
<TE>   Neither Gillinson nor Jenkins will reveal specifics on sales,
profit or expenses on any of their titles. Jenkins says that LSO
Live's goals are to sell 10,000 to 20,000 copies in the first nine
months of a release. According to a British music industry trade
paper, "Les Troyens" sold "well above the 30,000 mark" in that
period. Are the musicians getting royalties? Not yet, says Jenkins,
but by July, when the orchestra's fiscal year ends, he expects that
to change.</TE>
<TE>   Gillinson says that while the orchestra isn't getting rich off the
recordings, it isn't going broke either. And he points out several
ways in which the do-it-yourself impulse is good for business: "There
is the preservation and dissemination of the most important work you
do as an orchestra, where you can decide and not simply be responding
to what a record company might want to do in terms of its overall
catalog." Also, "it means you can build your brand internationally, a
key thing for the future. Major arts organizations as well as artists
are going to move toward the area where they own their own copyright
and are actually the licensor of their own product."</TE>
<TE>   The shifting and fragile nature of the recording industry has
shaken up musicians in every category in the past decade, but perhaps
nowhere as radically as in classical music.</TE>
<TE>   Sedgwick Clark, producer of several of the New York Philharmonic
archival releases, points out that the relationship between labels
and orchestras has never been more unstable.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the big orchestras in the United States now have [major]
contracts. The last was the Chicago Symphony, and they recently made
their final recording for Teldec, and that's that. [Music director
Daniel] Barenboim and Chicago do not have a contract anymore.
Philadelphia lost its EMI contract. Cleveland lost its Decca London
contract. The [New York] Philharmonic lost its Teldec contract.
Boston has had non-exclusive contracts with Deutsche Grammophon and
Phillips, and has made recordings for Sony, as well."</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, the San Francisco Symphony is "currently in
negotiations to extend their relationship" with BMG, according to the
orchestra's executive director, Brent Assink. The Los Angeles
Philharmonic has an ongoing agreement with Sony Classical, although
it isn't the kind of deal that guarantees a set number of CDs will be
recorded.</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, labels had an almost philanthropic attitude
toward classical music. "It used to be that the classical market was
supported by the pop business and by original cast albums and things
like that," Clark said. "Those days are gone. The problem is that the
companies no longer have the stability to go out and record all sorts
of things. Plus, when there are a couple hundred Beethoven Fifths
available, what do you choose? I must say, I've gone into big stores,
like the Virgin Megastore, and my knees just buckle. It's too much,
even for me."</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, the big labels got greedy, Clark said. An album
can make it onto the Billboard mainstream classical chart with sales
of just 500 albums; 4,000 in a week might mean a No. 1 rating. The
1992 Nonesuch recording of Gorecki's Third Symphony, over time, has
sold more than a million copies, making it a megahit in classical
terms. But then there's the Three Tenors. The first of their CDs,
from 1990, sold like a pop record. In 1996, the last time its sales
were audited, the figure was 3 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically," Clark says, "the classical market is a mom-and-pop
market, and the problem happened when Three Tenors [CDs] came out and
heads of companies who should have known better said, 'Hey, if we can
make this much money on the Three Tenors, why can't we make that much
on the L.A. Philharmonic's latest recording?' Of course, this just
doesn't happen. No matter how much the people at the companies
explain to their bosses that this will never work, they still wanted
it."</TE>
<TE>   LSO Live's Jenkins agrees: "It's just that the economics of
running record companies are changing." The labels are so
concentrated on the short-term bottom line, he says, that they can't
appreciate the slow-brewing nature of the classical music market.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day," Jenkins says, "a classical recording can
still be valid 30 years later. So it's a good long-term investment.
But the major companies these days can't afford to think like that.
It's not surprising that the major record companies are re-evaluating
what their classical arms are doing."</TE>
<TE>   So what's an orchestra to do? Stateside, the Philadelphia
Orchestra is paying keen attention to the LSO Live. It has already
gingerly dipped into the do-it-yourself realm, experimenting with an
independently released album two years ago. Initially, it put out an
album called "Nature's Prelude" with music by Dvorak and Liszt.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really just an experiment to see whether there was a
market for this," Philadelphia Orchestra President Joseph Kluger
says. "With relatively modest marketing efforts, we sold 8,000 or
9,000 copies."</TE>
<TE>   Kluger explained that "necessity being the mother of invention, we
have formed what we call the Philadelphia Media Institute, a joint
venture similar in structure to the LSO Live entity, where it is
jointly run by musicians and management." Again, the idea is to make
the musicians partners in the recording effort, rather than paying
them upfront fees.</TE>
<TE>   Though the orchestra is working out long-term union contractual
issues in trying to set up a revenue-sharing program to make the
label possible, it hopes to be issuing more CDs in a year or two.</TE>
<TE>   At least one U.S. orchestra is further along the LSO path. This
month, the San Francisco Symphony launched its SFS Media label, with
a recording of Mahler's Sixth Symphony. A complete cycle, funded by
Gordon Getty, of Mahler symphonies will eventually be released on the
label in the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco's Assink said that "what intrigued us was the
possibility of making our own recordings with less overhead. What had
stopped us before was the lack of an effective distribution model.
Now, with the Internet and online e-commerce opportunities, it seemed
to us that that last barrier had fallen."</TE>
<TE>   Assink says it is too early to know how it will sell. "Based on
the early buzz, we're cautiously optimistic that what we thought
would happen will, in fact, happen--that this will turn out to be a
best-seller, in terms of how that applies to classical CDs. We'd be
extraordinarily proud, of course, if that happens."</TE>
<TE>   The next LSO Live releases are scheduled to be, appropriately
enough, Davis leading the orchestra in the music of Britain's own
Edward Elgar ("Pomp and Circumstance"). Elgar once had Davis' job,
and the recording project follows on the heels of concerts late in
2001. Other upcoming releases, yet to be performed and recorded this
season, are Holst's "The Planets" and Mahler's Symphony No. 4.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Gillinson and the orchestra are reveling in their
Grammy nominations. They plan to send the CD's producer, James
Mallinson, to L.A. for the ceremonies.  "These are early days for the
label," Gillinson says, "so we're absolutely thrilled that it should
receive this kind of recognition."</TE>
<TE>   Win or lose, however, Gillinson sees his organization as creating
a future model for classical recording. "There are a lot of terrific
orchestras around the world, no question about it," he says. "But I
think one of the things that's always been a characteristic of this
orchestra is that it's not a follower. It does tend to lead and it
does tend to feel that if we believe in something, we're going to go
out and make it happen."</TE>
<TE>   Sir Colin edges on positively gleeful when he considers what LSO
Live has achieved so far:</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that makes us independent of big business is to be
applauded," he says, with a laugh. "These guys think that because
they've got money, they can do what they bloody well like. But they
can't. We can do just as well without them."</TE>

<HD>Accountants Can't Keep Up With Financial Complexity</HD>
<DH>Auditing: Experts say regulations and the risk of losing
clients has led to less-detailed examinations of companies' books.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Timothy S. Lucas began his career as a rule maker for the
accounting industry, there were 33 rules and the nation's accounting
standards fit on 342 pages.</LD>
<LD>   Lucas, now the research chief at the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, has watched an explosion in rule making and
complexity. The board is up to rule 144 and has 12,000 pages of
standards, pronouncements and bulletins.</LD>
<LD>   The exponential growth in accounting rules--giving the nation's
bean counters an assignment equal to reading Leo Tolstoy's "War and
Peace" 17 times, has saddled U.S. businesses with audit costs that
can run into tens of millions of dollars.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the growing range and sophistication of the rules, they
have failed to keep up with the evolution of the U.S. economy and
with changes in the financial structure of American business, experts
say. In addition, the pressure on corporations to report consistent
and predictable profit growth has exacerbated the distortions in
accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Auditors face simultaneous risks of losing lucrative clients if
they reject their books and lawsuits by investors if they approve
suspect deals. Even major players within the industry said this has
given rise to a culture in which auditors avoid examining the
substance of financial transactions to determine whether they are
reported accurately. Instead, they engage in a process known as
"check off" auditing in which they make sure no regulation prohibits
a transaction.</TE>
<TE>   "The tendency is that the more complex the standards are, the more
time you spend making sure you are technically in compliance," Lucas
said. "In some cases, the objective of financial reporting is lost."</TE>
<TE>   This complexity often makes it impossible for the average
investor, and occasionally even Wall Street analysts, to figure out
what's going on at a company. And when companies provide information,
the disclosures often are couched in legal and technical terms that
only finance experts can decipher.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in an annual report to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Inktomi Corp., a Foster City, Calif.-based technology
company, said:</TE>
<TE>   "In June 2000, we entered into a synthetic lease agreement for the
land and facilities of our corporate headquarters. Immediately prior
to the closing, the agreement was assigned to a third-party lessor
under the terms of a lease finance structure. In accordance with this
agreement, we have created and will maintain a cash collateral
account that limits the liquidity of approximately $119.6 million of
our cash."</TE>
<TE>   What that means is that the $472 million in shareholder equity
listed on the balance sheet several pages later in the report
actually could be closer to $350 million in some circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   And that's a relatively simple deal, worlds away from the Enron
Corp.-created construct in which it would establish a venture and
then book the current value of potential future revenue from the
business, even in instances where it turned out the venture was a
money loser.</TE>
<TE>   Recently bankrupt telecommunications company Global Crossing Ltd.
used a controversial accounting method for trades and leases of
transmission space on fiber-optic networks to bolster measures of
revenue and cash.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing would purchase a long-term contract for
fiber-optic space on a network and book the price as a capital
expense to be spread over a number of years. It then would resell the
space and count the entire sales prices as revenue for the quarter,
according to a former financial executive at the company.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time a smart CFO or investment banker wants to do
something, they look through the rule book and say, 'this isn't
here,' so they design a transaction that is not covered and then ask
the accountants, 'where does it say I can't do it,'" said Roman Weil,
a University of Chicago accounting professor.</TE>
<TE>   Companies are supposed to follow what is known as generally
accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Issued by the accounting
board, the rules have been developed over the last century by the
accounting profession, business and regulators. Its intent is to
create a set of bookkeeping and financial reporting standards that
can be used to make a reasonable and fair representation of a
company's financial position.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses prepare the books according to these guidelines. The
auditor's job is to determine whether the accounting principles were
applied correctly and the resulting report fairly states the
company's finances.</TE>
<TE>   These standards were born in an age when the U.S. economy was
beginning to churn out mountains of manufactured goods.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting allowed the company to document transactions that
reflected the flow of money to suppliers, the cost of labor and the
sale of the product for a profit.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting principles, even with all the new rules, fail to
address the development of what many call the information or
intellectual economy.</TE>
<TE>   Determining the value of intellectual assets, such as software
engineers, or intangible assets, such as a proposed venture to
deliver an Internet product, is very different from calculating the
profit on a shipment of doorknobs.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's system of financial reporting has become so
complicated that many in the industry are asking whether it should be
scrapped for a new one.</TE>
<TE>   "We've evolved into a postindustrial economy with a business
climate that is infinitely more complex than before, when most of our
accounting standards and securities regulations were formulated,"
Stephen G. Butler, chairman of accounting firm KPMG, said in a recent
speech to energy executives. "In this context, generally accepted
accounting principles don't do a very good job of describing any
modern company."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Kaplan, a Harvard Business School professor, says much of
the complexity in the financial reporting system dates to the model
of valuing stock options devised three decades ago by economists
Fischer Black and Myron Scholes.</TE>
<TE>   The pricing model, which won the authors the Nobel Memorial Prize
for economics in 1997, gave rise to a new class of financial vehicle
called derivatives, which allow businesses to hedge all sorts of
risks.</TE>
<TE>   And the price model coincided with an explosion in computing power
that allowed clever finance executives to develop and track thousands
of new types of transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Determining and reporting the value of derivatives has become one
of the stickiest issues in accounting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Derivatives Can Be Useful, Deceptive Tools</TE>
<TE>   Enron dealt in derivatives that ranged from energy products to
telecommunications services to even what amounts to bets on weather
patterns.</TE>
<TE>   Though Enron has shown that these tools can be used to manipulate
company profit figures, they also have legitimate purposes, allowing
a business to hedge, or protect itself from some sort of risk.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of this is so complex that people who have been trained in a
much simpler economic model just don't understand it well," Kaplan
said. "That includes auditors, board members and even the regulators.
This is not simple arithmetic."</TE>
<TE>   And the accounting gets more complicated with use, Weil said.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, a company must report changes in the value of a
derivative on its income statement. But if the company says it is
holding the contract with the intent to sell it in the future, it
doesn't have to show those changes in valuation.</TE>
<TE>   "A big pharmaceutical company has a legitimate need for a currency
hedge because of its operations in Germany, but now comes 23 other
CFOs who have designed a bunch of hokey transactions to get around
the rules, and that in turn requires more rules," Weil said.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the complexity is the decline of auditing from a
principle-based discipline to a check- list process.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of this has turned into 'check the box' rather than looking
at the substance of transactions," said Mark Bagaason, managing
partner for accounting firm Grant Thornton's practice in Southern
California. Grant Thornton officials said auditors must reject the
type of rule-book approach Weil described.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if an accounting method is not prohibited by the standards,
auditors are loath to make a stink, Weil said. They don't want to
lose the client.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the accountants then go to the rule makers--the FASB,
the Emerging Issues Task Force or the SEC and ask for a rule. But in
these instances, the auditors are looking to protect themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Auditors, in a rational pursuit of a full purse, want unambiguous
rules to stand behind when, inevitably, the trial lawyers sue them
for accountant judgments and estimates, made in good faith, that turn
out to miss the target," Weil said in congressional testimony this
month.</TE>
<TE>   It is a seemingly endless cycle, Weil told The Times. "We spend a
lot of time writing detailed rules, and the CFOs and investment
bankers spend a lot of time to get around the rule book."</TE>
<TE>   The gaps in the accounting principles have become a matter of
course work at the nation's business schools.</TE>
<TE>   A device called a "synthetic lease" takes up five printed pages of
a handout posted on the Internet for Business Administration 280, a
real estate investment analysis class taught by Nancy Wallace at the
Walter A. Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of such a lease, Wallace teaches, is to "keep reported
earnings high and balance-sheet assets low since small boosts to
earnings can have a significant impact on the stock price."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, students are told, "For GAAP reporting, the financing
is reported as an operating lease, yet the firm retains control and
tax benefits of ownership."</TE>
<TE>   It is the financial equivalent of having your cake and eating it
too.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's course teaches specific ways this type of lease
structure works well for technology companies, retailers and
manufacturers. The benefits range from helping to keep stock prices
high, adding stores "off balance sheet" and burnishing debt-to-equity
ratios.</TE>
<TE>   Enron used this type of financial structure to finance one of the
towers at its Houston headquarters. Similar lease structures have
been used by companies as different as Inktomi and Krispy Kreme
Doughnut Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Weil said the accounting treatments for the special purpose
entities, or ventures, that figured in the Enron collapse grew from
the synthetic lease rules.</TE>
<TE>   But other long-term trends, such as the way companies pay
executives, the volatile nature of Wall Street and the stock market's
addiction to quarterly profits, also have contributed to the
complexity as financial managers look for ways to emphasize a
company's growth and profit.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market's recent jitters about the quality of accounting
at publicly traded companies is an ironic reaction to a system Wall
Street helped create.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in the late 1980s and accelerating through the boom years
of the last decade, chief executives and Wall Street developed a
symbiotic relationship in which each was rewarded by projecting and
hitting financial targets--generally profits and revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts won praise for predicting the growth of a business.
Shareholders saw the value of their holdings increase. And the
executives, who held huge numbers of options to purchase shares in
the company at low prices, earned millions of dollars by exercising
their stock options, selling shares at high prices and pocketing the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   Companies suffered swift punishment when they failed Wall Street,
often losing a third of their market value within minutes of issuing
a statement that they would not achieve the growth estimates expected
by analysts. A long-term change in the way executives are paid added
to this pressure cooker.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aligning Corporate Performance With Pay</TE>
<TE>   Starting in the 1980s, corporate-governance activists complained
about the lack of a direct relationship between executive pay and the
financial performance of a company. Their objections contributed to a
shift in executive compensation practices intended to better align
executive pay with the financial and stock performance of the
companies.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, 41% of a typical chief executive's total pay was in the
form of a conventional salary, or cash. The CEO collected slightly
more--42%--in long-term incentives, primarily stock options. The
remainder of the pay came from short-term incentives such as bonuses,
according to statistics compiled by Clark/Bardes Consulting in
Marlborough, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   By last year, chief executives were collecting 65% of their pay in
long-term incentives, the Clark/Bardes report said. Salary plunged to
18% and bonuses remained steady at 17%.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the size of the pie nearly tripled. The median CEO pay
package was just over $1 million in 1995. That grew to $2.85 million
in 2001. Long-term incentive payments jumped by more than 425%, to
$1.85 million from $433 million.</TE>
<TE>   One consequence of this trend was to create a financial incentive
for managers to meet the expectations of Wall Street quarter after
quarter, said Graef Crystal, a Las Vegas-based compensation expert.</TE>
<TE>   Aggressive and complex accounting became one of the prime tools of
meeting those expectations, Crystal said.</TE>
<TE>   A simple accounting change could help reverse this trend,
according to accounting and compensation experts. Unlike a salary
paid in cash, companies don't have to account for stock options as an
expense, said Brett Trueman, an accounting professor at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal believes that if companies had to subtract the value of
stock options from their profits, they would be much more circumspect
about using them as a form of pay. And that could reduce the emphasis
on short-term financial measures.</TE>
<TE>   Previous efforts to make such a change have failed, but Sens. Carl
Levin (D-Mich.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) recently introduced
legislation that would change the accounting methods for stock
options.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Hurt by Board's Cronyism</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Instability and lack of independence among members
may have hampered their ability to keep the company out of trouble.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS, KAREN KAPLAN and JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd.'s board of directors was unable to rein in
profligate spending, put a stop to questionable accounting practices,
or head off the fourth-largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history in
part because it was compromised by cronyism and chronic instability.</LD>
<LD>   Since the end of 1998, Global Crossing has had at least 30
directors on a board whose size has ranged from eight to 17 members.
Five of them also served as chief executive of the ambitious
telecommunications upstart. Half the board's eight current directors
joined within the last year, according to company filings.</LD>
<LD>   "Going through that many directors is definitely unusual," said
Jackie Brown, a researcher for Boardroom Analysis, a Seattle firm
that specializes in corporate governance issues. "You wouldn't expect
to see turnover of more than two directors a year. If there is too
much turnover, that means nobody gets to know the company that well."</LD>
<TE>   Most of the directors also had economic or social ties to the
company or its founder, Gary Winnick. Those who weren't employed
directly by Global Crossing often did business with the company or
Winnick's private investment firm, Pacific Capital Group.</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual for founders and CEOs to pack their boards with
friends and business associates. And no one is saying Global
Crossing's board was single-handedly responsible for the company's
dramatic descent into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   But the clubby nature of boards of directors is receiving closer
scrutiny in the wake of the Enron Corp. scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick declined to comment about his relationships with Global
Crossing directors. Company spokeswoman Becky Yeamans said,
"Information about our board is in our filings. We have no further
comment."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's current board includes Winnick and longtime
friends Lodwrick Cook, a former Arco chairman; Mark Attanasio, an
executive at Trust Co. of the West; Geoffrey J.W. Kent, owner of an
Illinois travel agency; and Steven J. Green, former U.S. ambassador
to Singapore. Also on the board are Global Crossing CEO John Legere;
Joseph P. Clayton, head of the firm's North American unit; and former
U.S. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   Previous directors include Winnick's personal banker, Maria Elena
Lagomasino of J.P. Morgan Private Bank; childhood friend and Denver
lawyer Norman Brownstein; and several former co-workers at Drexel
Burnham Lambert, the junk bond firm that collapsed amid a scandal in
the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Directors' Firms Gained Business</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing did business with several of the directors'
companies. For example, Global Crossing paid Brownstein's law firm,
Brownstein, Hyatt &amp; Farber, $1.35 million in lobbying fees over three
years, and Pacific Capital paid it $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Kent's firm, Ilinois travel agency Abercrombie &amp; Kent Inc.,
"arranged exotic events for Gary and the guys," a former executive
said. It's not clear how much Abercrombie was paid.</TE>
<TE>   The company also paid Cohen Group, headed by the former defense
secretary, $500,000 in consulting fees in 2001, according to a
regulatory filing.</TE>
<TE>   Eight past and present directors of Global Crossing who spoke to
The Times reject comparisons to Enron, which has sparked federal
investigations of misleading accounting, off-the-books partnerships
and phantom sales. All agreed to speak only if they weren't
identified by name.</TE>
<TE>   "Directors are not full-time employees of the company," said one
former director. "They are only as good as the information that is
given to them. That's it. You're sitting there and the CFO [chief
financial officer] comes in and makes a presentation. The CFO either
gives you information or he doesn't. You don't know if he's
withholding something. You have absolutely no idea. Same with the
accountants."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Global Crossing, shareholders are questioning why
the board sanctioned a string of exorbitant pay packages for top
executives and failed to press for details about serious negotiations
to sell the company when market conditions were more favorable.</TE>
<TE>   They also wonder how the firm could have logged so many
questionable deals to swap capacity on its fiber-optic network
without raising suspicion on the board until nearly six months after
a former finance vice president raised concerns with company
management. Those deals now are being investigated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   The Global Crossing directors say the deals that have been
questioned were legitimate and were good for the business.</TE>
<TE>   "These transactions were all washed out on the [board's] audit
committee and there never was an issue of improper accounting," one
former director said.</TE>
<TE>   Several shareholder suits, however, paint a picture of a board
that merely cruised along on autopilot while the worldwide
telecommunications market imploded, taking with it hopes for Global
Crossing to recoup its multibillion-dollar investment on its vast
undersea fiber-optic network that connects 27 countries on four
continents.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of people have the mistaken notion that [serving on
a board] is almost like being a member of a country club and getting
paid for it," said Henry Hu, a securities-law professor at the
University of Texas at Austin. "You'd be crazy to view it like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Board Meetings Held in Bermuda, L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Past and present board members said they took their jobs
seriously, but their obligations weren't overly rigorous. One former
director said the board met in person once a quarter in locales such
as Bermuda, where Global Crossing is officially based; Beverly Hills,
where the executive offices are located; and New York and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Gatherings typically would begin with a dinner, followed by a
three-hour meeting the next morning. The board often would adjourn
after lunch.</TE>
<TE>   About one-third of the meeting would be spent discussing the
company's financial health.</TE>
<TE>   "We had in front of us a set of financials, and people would ask
questions about whether the company met its projections, whether
there were any audit issues," one former director said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the in-person gatherings, board members would meet
up to four more times a quarter via teleconference.</TE>
<TE>   As compensation, board members received 120,000 stock options,
along with $2,500 for each board meeting they attended and $1,500 for
each committee meeting. Committee chairs who were not Global Crossing
employees received an additional payment of $5,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Board members are charged with exercising "due care in terms of
supervising the management of the company," said securities-law
expert Hu. Among their responsibilities was "to set up appropriate
control systems so that you cannot have some rogue executive or
executives causing problems. They have to ask enough questions that
these kinds of things don't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Some board members have reaped millions by cashing in their Global
Crossing stock. Winnick netted $359.5 million from his sales,
according to an analysis of public filings by Thomson/Lancer
Analytics. Hillel Weinberger, senior vice president and senior
portfolio manager for Loews/CNA Holdings Corp., profited to the tune
of $204.1 million. Altogether, 12 board members made more than $991
million buying and selling Global Crossing stock since the company
went public.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Named as Defendants in Shareholder Suits</TE>
<TE>   Criminal prosecutions of directors are extremely rare and are not
expected in the Global Crossing case. Directors can be sent to prison
for up to 10 years if they engaged in "willful and knowing
violations" of federal securities laws, such as fraud statutes, Hu
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Global Crossing's directors have been named as defendants
in several of the more than a dozen civil suits brought by
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   It is common for shareholders to blame the directors for providing
misleading or fraudulent data in financial reports, said Christopher
Bebel, a former prosecutor with the SEC and Justice Department who
now practices securities law in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   A litigator could argue that the board's instability and lack of
independence prevented the firm from making complete and honest
disclosures and looking out for the best interests of shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in 2000, when much of the investment community knew
that then-Chief Executive Leo J. Hindery Jr. was trying to sell the
company, potential deals were quashed by Winnick without consulting
the board. A board less deferential to Winnick might have pressed for
more information and forced the chairman to consider the deals.</TE>
<TE>   A year earlier, over the strong objections of then-CEO Robert
Annunziata, the board approved a deal backed by Winnick to acquire
IXnet. Typically a board would defer to the chief executive on key
strategic matters. Global Crossing later sold a large part of the
firm.</TE>
<TE>   The degree of turnover on the board was unusual for a public
company, said George Ott, president of the Southern California
chapter of the National Assn. of Corporate Directors, a nonprofit
group that focuses on issues of corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   Only Winnick has served on the board since the company's inception
in 1997. A close second is co-founder and former Arco Chairman Cook,
who joined in early 1998. The longest stint by a Global Crossing CEO
was one year.</TE>
<TE>   Former directors offer several explanations for the steady churn.
They note that the company quickly grew from start-up phase to a
massive construction period and finally an operating entity that
needed to make sales to businesses. As the company matured, new
skills were needed on the board.</TE>
<TE>   New directors also were added as Global Crossing grew through
acquisitions and needed to represent new groups of investors,
according to a former director. One of the largest growth spurts came
after the purchase of phone company Frontier Communications Corp. in
1999, causing four new directors to join the board at once.</TE>
<TE>   Directors sometimes left the board when the investors or
institutions they represented wanted to sell their Global Crossing
shares without appearing to have a conflict of interest. For
instance, CIBC Oppenheimer provided financing for the company and
worked on its initial public offering in 1998. The Canadian bank had
five representatives on the board in 1997, but they were all gone by
2000.</TE>
<TE>   "All their people got off the board before they sold their
shares," said one former board member. "That's why they left."
Similarly, Weinberger left the board in 1999 so the Tisch family,
which controls the Loews conglomerate, could sell shares "without any
conflicts or insider information."</TE>

<CX>   Global Crossing payments--A story in Sunday's Business section
incorrectly identified the source of information about payments made by
Global Crossing Ltd. to Cohen Group, the consulting firm run by Global
Crossing board member and former Defense Secretary William S. Cohen. The
information came from former company executives, not regulatory filings.
Cohen Group denies that it received any payments from Global Crossing.</CX>

<CX>   Global Crossing--Global Crossing Ltd.'s available cash increased by
$100 million from Jan. 28 to Feb. 25. A story in Wednesday's Business
section incorrectly reported that it had declined by $200 million. A
Wednesday story about Global Crossing's 401(k) plan incorrectly reported
that the company's bankruptcy is the fifth-largest in U.S. history. It is
the fourth-largest. In addition, a Sunday story about Global Crossing's
board of directors incorrectly stated that former director Norman
Brownstein is a childhood friend of Global Crossing Chairman Gary
Winnick. In fact, the two have known each other for about 15 years.</CX>

<CX>   Global Crossing--A Feb. 24 chart in the Business section
significantly understated proceeds for stock trades made by several
directors of Global Crossing Ltd. The figures provided to The Times by
Thomson/Lancer Analytics did not use the correct selling price in
calculating the profits from the trades.</CX>
<CX>   Here are the correct figures, based on trades reported to the
Securities and Exchange Commission:</CX>
<CX>   Former Chief Executive Robert Annunziata made a $3.5-million profit
instead of a $2.2-million profit; former CEO Thomas J. Casey,
$8.9-million profit, instead of $8.4 million; Co-Chairman Lodwrick Cook,
$35.5-million profit, instead of $31.6 million; Chairman and founder Gary
Winnick, $577.9-million profit, instead of $359.6 million; and former CEO
and director Jack M. Scanlon, $23-million profit, instead of $4.3 million
(the original figure did not include trades that were reported under the
name John M. Scanlon).</CX>
<CX>   Former director Hillel Weinberger made a $21.7-million profit from
stock sales, not $204.1 million. The original figure included proceeds
from the sale of shares owned by an insurance company that Weinberger
represented on Global Crossing's board. The insurance company, a unit of
Loews/CNA Holdings Corp., grossed $227.9 million.</CX>
<CX>   In addition, Global Crossing director Norman Brownstein, who was
correctly listed as making a $1.4-million profit from selling stock, sold
his shares before he joined the company's board.</CX>

<HD>A Pause, Then Big Growth for Telecom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wintry aftermath of the 1990s telecommunications boom, the
promise of new technologies and Internet services to homes and
businesses looks like a pipe dream. But the boom was real and
transformed a century-old industry, pointing it toward new
possibilities on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Conventional thinking bemoans the collapse of a "bubble," but what
is happening in telecommunications is a perfectly normal shakeout of
inadequate concepts and companies. This could lead to a revitalized
telecom industry with a bright future, as the development of
broadband Internet communications and services gathers force.</LD>
<LD>   Revenues in the telecom business more than doubled in the last
four years and will double again in the next four, as communication
through wires, cables and airwaves becomes the basic infrastructure
of every business and a greater essential in every home.</LD>
<TE>   To be sure, the casualty lists are daunting. Global Crossing,
builder of a fiber-optic network, has entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Firms once hailed by Wall Street as new-wave competitors of the old
phone companies went into bankruptcy last year, including Teligent,
WinStar Communications and Covad Communications Group.</TE>
<TE>   Suppliers of network equipment--Nortel Networks, Lucent
Technologies, Cisco Systems--are treading water, hoping for an upturn
in telecom capital investment to restore their profitability.</TE>
<TE>   Contemplating such destruction, it's easy to forget that there are
victors in the recent telecom wars.</TE>
<TE>   The regional Bell operating companies were challenged by newcomers
and they responded, merging operations and adapting their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Now SBC Communications, Verizon Communications and BellSouth are
giant companies with strong finances at a time when capital is scarce
for telecom ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest Communications owns US West, but Qwest has troubles. Its
fiber network is part of the great fiber overcapacity that already
has claimed Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   But this is no longer the one-size-fits-all telephone industry.
Wireless telephone revenues nearly equal those of traditional local
telephone service.</TE>
<TE>   Newcomers Vodafone of Britain--which owns AirTouch
Cellular--Nextel Communications and Sprint PCS are prominent in
wireless service, as are spinoffs or subsidiaries of traditional
firms, such as AT&amp;T Wireless, Verizon Wireless and Cingular Wireless,
a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth.</TE>
<TE>   Americans are using a variety of media to communicate more than
ever--wireless and traditional phones, cable connections and
telephony through the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The industry is in a post-boom pause, and investment in new
facilities is restrained. But the pattern of headlong expansion
followed by consolidation has happened at least twice before.</TE>
<TE>   After Samuel F. B. Morse invented the telegraph in 1842, investors
and entrepreneurs formed ventures and made and lost huge fortunes for
two decades before the Western Union company emerged to lead the
industry, writes historian Daniel Gross in the Milken Institute
Review.</TE>
<TE>   The telephone itself saw enormous growth--phone usage grew sixfold
in the 1890s. Hundreds of companies crowded the field until Theodore
Vail in 1907 started to consolidate the industry under American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph--the present-day AT&amp;T.</TE>
<TE>   The transformation of telecom today lies in the expansion of
broadband Internet communications and services. The number of homes
with broadband Internet connections by cable or digital subscriber
lines will grow from 17 million this year to</TE>
<TE>   23.3 million next year and</TE>
<TE>   28.3 million in 2004, according</TE>
<TE>   to research firm Gartner Dataquest. That's 65% growth in two
years.</TE>
<TE>   The Ciscos and Nortels, not to mention Internet component makers
such as JDS Uniphase, could see their business picking up late this
year and growing again in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But what immediately lies ahead for telecoms is a period of
intense competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Competition in the next two years will pit Bell phone companies
against cable operators and wireless providers," says David
Cooperstein, director of Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   able company Cox Communications, for example, is preparing to
offer voice telephony over its cable system. AOL Time Warner, a major
cable owner, and Comcast, which is acquiring AT&amp;T's cable operations,
and other cable firms will push further into traditional phone
services.</TE>
<TE>   Wireless companies will add information services to their phones,
and providers of hand-held computing devices, such as Palm and
Handspring, will expand their communication capabilities. The
prospect is for a competitive and technological free-for-all.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government may back greater competition. The Federal
Communications Commission issued a rule last week that views
competition by the form of service offered--telephony, computing,
television programming--rather than by delivery system, such as
telephone line, cable or wireless network.</TE>
<TE>   And a bill to encourage competition could come up for a vote
Wednesday in the House of Representatives, sponsored by Reps. W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) and John D. Dingell (D-Mich.).</TE>
<TE>   Competition is likely to bring lower prices for consumers. AT&amp;T
Broadband--the Internet service division of the long-distance phone
company--is already test marketing a $100-a-month flat rate for all
services.</TE>
<TE>   ''It would replace separate bills for Internet access, cable and
telephone services and could be competitive'' Cooperstein says.</TE>
<TE>   As more people have access to broadband Internet services, experts
expect many aspects of life to change. Customers with broadband
Internet access typically spend 25 hours a week online, compared with
7.5 hours for customers with today's more prevalent dial-up access.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Chang, head of SBC's technology subsidiary, foresees
customers with broadband access dispensing with newspapers, radio and
television and instead turning to the Internet for news, information
and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Services will proliferate, says investment manager Kelly Pan of
Pantheon Capital in New York. Already some fallen dot.coms are
becoming profitable, Pan says, citing IVillage , the Internet-based
service for women and new parents, and Autobytel, the Irvine-based
auto marketing service.</TE>
<TE>   The next two years will be a time of technological development to
bring down costs, says venture capitalist Brad Jones, of Redpoint
Ventures. His firm raised $1.25 billion in late 2000 to invest in new
firms working with lasers and optical components for Internet
networks.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Redpoint has invested $200 million of that money in
start-up companies, such as Sabeus Photonics of Long Beach,
Asymmetric Integral Photonics of Princeton, N.J., and Telasic of El
Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not impatient," Jones says. "For broadband Internet, we
invest looking ahead five years."</TE>
<TE>   That's a good perspective for an industry with a big future.</TE>

<LD>Everybody now wants corporate accounting to be clean and accurate.</LD>
<LD>   But greater honesty in accounting has implications for the stock
market that may leave some investors pining for the good-bad old days
of financial obfuscation.</LD>
<LD>   If earnings have been overstated by accounting gimmickry, then the
high prices paid for stocks in the boom years of the late 1990s were
even higher than they seemed.</LD>
<TE>   Likewise, if reported earnings grow more slowly in the next few
years because accounting is more honest, then current stock
valuations--which are down from their bull-market peaks, but are
hardly cheap, historically--also may be higher than they appear.</TE>
<TE>   How much these issues are contributing to the stock market's woes
this year is impossible to measure. They are major topics of
discussion among Wall Street economists and market strategists. But
this kind of stuff can take a long time to sink into investors'
psyches.</TE>
<TE>   It should sink in, however, because measuring the prices of shares
relative to underlying earnings isn't supposed to be some mere
academic exercise. Investors are supposed to be interested in a given
stock because they're interested in owning a piece of the company's
current and future earnings power.</TE>
<TE>   Long, long ago, investors received their piece of corporate
earnings directly, in the form of cash dividends paid by companies.
But as dividends fell out of favor in the late 1990s--in part because
many companies correctly determined that investors didn't want bigger
dividends because of the tax bite--the long-term earnings payback to
shareholders became almost exclusively a function of share-price
appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   That was fine when share prices were appreciating. But the last
two years have mostly been about depreciation. If you want to believe
the worst is over, then many of the stocks with the best appreciation
potential from this point ought to belong to companies whose earnings
growth will be strongest in the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to the question of what constitutes genuine
earnings.</TE>
<TE>   With the sudden passion to discover what was real and what was
fake about corporate earnings in recent years, some economists are
comparing two broad measures of results: the "operating" earnings
figure for the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, and total U.S.
after-tax corporate profit as reported in the government's "national
income and product account" report, or NIPA.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 figure, measuring results of the largest publicly
traded U.S. companies, is the gauge most often quoted in the media.
Operating earnings are supposed to tell investors what a company
earned from its basic business in a particular period, excluding
so-called one-time gains or losses, such as from the sale of a piece
of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   As investors now know all too well, operating earnings data have
been manipulated in recent years to the point where no one is exactly
sure what they mean, other than that they measure profit excluding
often unpleasant, albeit important, things a company would like
investors and analysts to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   The NIPA results, by contrast, are based on information reported
to the Internal Revenue Service by all incorporated businesses,
public and private.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Grannis, economist at Western Asset Management in Pasadena,
calls NIPA earnings "the best measure of true [corporate] profit"
because they are based on after-tax numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Economist Edward Yardeni, the newly named chief investment
strategist for Prudential Securities in New York, also points out
that NIPA earnings are reduced by the cost of stock options companies
granted to workers. The accounting for such option costs has become a
hot button in the post-Enron era: Many companies claim a tax
deduction for option costs without officially charging the costs
against earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Some in Congress now want to force companies to book their options
expenses so shareholders can plainly see them. Investor Warren
Buffett has long pressed for that. As he wrote in his Berkshire
Hathaway Co. annual report a few years ago: "If options aren't a form
of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn't an expense,
what is it? And, if expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of
earnings, where in the world should they go?"</TE>
<TE>   The effect on companies' bottom lines if they're forced to include
options as an expense would vary, but it could hit some technology
and telecom companies' particularly hard--just as those firms are
trying to rebound from the capital spending plunge of the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Back to NIPA earnings versus S&amp;P 500 operating earnings: Yardeni
notes that both NIPA earnings and S&amp;P earnings surged between 1992
and 1997. But then the NIPA results stalled out, while the S&amp;P
results continued to rocket from 1998 through mid-2000.</TE>
<TE>   Since mid-2000, both measures have been plummeting. But why should
the S&amp;P companies have had dramatic profit growth from 1998 to 2000
while total U.S. corporate profits had stalled?</TE>
<TE>   It may have been that the biggest companies simply did a far
better job of running their businesses in that period, compared with
most other public and private companies. Post-Enron, though, many
analysts believe that strong S&amp;P operating profits were at least
somewhat illusory, thanks to many perfectly legal accounting tricks
and some that were either illegal or borderline.</TE>
<TE>   With the recession, the discrepancy between S&amp;P operating earnings
and the bottom line for those companies after including all "special"
write-offs and charges widened dramatically last year. In the third
quarter, S&amp;P operating earnings were down 14.5% from a year earlier,
Yardeni said. But S&amp;P results including all special items plummeted
47% from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder companies want investors to focus on operating results
when valuing shares.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some analysts argue that it would be absurd to value stocks
purely on earnings according to generally accepted accounting
principles, especially in an economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Wieting, economist at Salomon Smith Barney in New York,
notes that while total write-offs recorded by S&amp;P 500 companies last
year were equal to nearly 45% of operating earnings--an astoundingly
large figure--non-cash charges recorded by just two telecom
companies, Nortel and JDS Uniphase, made up almost one-third of the
write-off total.</TE>
<TE>   The Nortel and JDS charges were for "goodwill impairment." Under a
change in accounting rules decided before Enron became a household
word, companies must immediately write off assets that they know are
worth far less than their value on the balance sheet. For Nortel, JDS
and others, that has meant writing off goodwill, which essentially is
the amount they overpaid for what have turned out to be bad
acquisitions made during the boom years.</TE>
<TE>   In aggregate, those goodwill write-offs "could wipe out all
[reported] U.S. earnings on the mistakes of just a handful of
companies," Wieting said. Surely, he argues, it wouldn't make sense
to price the market overall based on those bottom-line results.</TE>
<TE>   Most investors must agree, because stock prices, while under
pressure again this year, obviously haven't collapsed across the
board. The S&amp;P 500 is down 5.1% year to date; the Nasdaq composite
has fallen 11.6%.</TE>
<TE>   But if corporate accounting now is turning more conservative, it
raises the question of what level of earnings growth
companies--especially the S&amp;P 500 firms--can achieve in the next few
years.</TE>
<TE>   Grannis, for one, cautions against becoming too pessimistic about
earnings potential.</TE>
<TE>   "Profits have come down an awful lot, and lots of restructuring
and time have passed under the bridge. There may be some more nasty
earnings announcements as companies scramble to come clean, but the
overwhelming thrust of corporate efforts going forward will be to cut
costs, reduce leverage and restore genuine profitability," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors, however, may only have begun the process of
re-evaluating what is "genuine profitability," and deciding how high
a stock price they want to pay for their slice of that profit.</TE>

<LD>Northrop Makes Defensive Move</LD>
<LD>   Northrop Grumman Corp., the largest military shipbuilder, made an
unsolicited offer to acquire TRW Inc. for about $5.9 billion in stock
and assumption of additional debt to create the biggest defense
contractor.</LD>
<LD>   TRW's automotive unit, which accounts for about three-quarters of
sales, would be separated from the company if the transaction is
completed.</LD>
<TE>   TRW's electronics, missile defense and space units are the most
attractive to Northrop because they would fit well with its existing
businesses. Century City-based Northrop had made about $7.7 billion
in acquisitions in the last two years, adding shipbuilding yards as
U.S. defense spending rises.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop made its move within days of an announcement that TRW
Chief Executive David Cote was resigning to lead Honeywell
International Inc. His abrupt departure prompted speculation that TRW
either would be split up or acquired.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal is the latest in a decade-long consolidation in the
defense industry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andersen Floats Plan to Settle Lawsuits</TE>
<TE>   Accounting firm Andersen has floated a plan to settle dozens of
lawsuits from its audit of Enron Corp., a move that represents a
savvy strategy to force shareholders and creditors to negotiate
jointly so neither gets left out, legal experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Such a tactic also could speed resolution of claims against
Andersen and end an anticipated hemorrhaging of clients and staff.</TE>
<TE>   But the initial figures floated--$600 million to $800 million,
according to one attorney involved in the case--may be too small to
satisfy the claims of the competing interests of shareholders
involved in a class-action lawsuit and creditors, who are separately
seeking restitution in Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, which is the target of federal investigations for its
role in the failure of the Houston-based energy trader in December,
provided little detail about its efforts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another Kinder, Gentler Bush</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, during a three-day visit to Japan, did his best to
protect his counterpart, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who is
struggling with a bad economy.</TE>
<TE>   Bush soft-pedaled economic issues and instead focused on the
U.S.-Japan security alliance. But when the attention shifted to the
economy, Bush was extremely gentle in public and was vociferous in
his support of the Japanese leader.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also visited South Korea and China, where he discussed
security issues and American values.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Setting a Reverse Course</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Co. is preparing for a significant retrenchment this year
at its satellite manufacturing operations in El Segundo, starting
with a cutback of about 1,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Layoffs could exceed 2,000 this year, or nearly 25% of the
company's work force in what has been one of the most resilient and
fastest-growing sectors of the California aerospace industry.</TE>
<TE>   The cutbacks reflect a belated response to the telecommunications
bust that has seen the collapse of a number of ambitious efforts to
build global wireless communications systems and space-based
broadband systems for the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The El Segundo business, which Boeing acquired last year, had
aggressively expanded manufacturing capacity in recent years and
developed new generations of more powerful satellites. The
investments were based on the outlook for tremendous growth in the
communications industry, the same optimism that damaged companies
such as Lucent Technologies Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mechanics Land Airline Contract</TE>
<TE>   United Airlines, averting a potentially crippling strike by its
mechanics, reached a tentative contract with the union, the
International Assn. of Machinists.</TE>
<TE>   The 10,600 mechanics and 2,200 utility workers are scheduled to
vote on the pact March 5.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative deal--which builds on proposals made by an emergency
board convened by President Bush--calls for senior mechanics to get
an immediate 37% wage hike to $35.14 an hour, which would give them
the top mechanics' pay in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   The mechanics haven't had a wage increase since 1994. They were
set to strike United, a unit of UAL Corp., on Wednesday had a
settlement not been reached.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Putting a Dent in Trade Deficit</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed by 8% in 2001, its first
improvement in six years, as recession-wary consumers trimmed their
purchases of imported goods, more than offsetting a drop in foreign
demand for U.S. products.</TE>
<TE>   But the improvement in the trade gap didn't translate into good
news for the nation's export sector, which is being pummeled by a
strong dollar and weak overseas economies.</TE>
<TE>   California exports plunged 26% in the fourth quarter of 2001
compared with the same period in 2000. The decrease capped a brutal
year for the state's high-tech manufacturers, whose products account
for nearly half the state's exported goods. Exports of computers and
other electronic products fell from a record $16.6 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2000 to $11.2 billion in the final quarter of
2001--a 33% drop.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, with energy costs declining sharply, consumer prices
rose only 1.1% over the 12 months ended in January, the smallest
increase since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HMOs Getting the Cold Shoulder</TE>
<TE>   The percentage of Californians enrolled in health maintenance
organizations declined last year for the first time in at least eight
years, dropping below 50%, the Kaiser Family Foundation and the
Health Research and Educational Trust said.</TE>
<TE>   The decline, a significant milestone in a state where managed care
was pioneered, reflects growing dissatisfaction among employers and
workers with HMOs and their limited choices. It also reflects a
paradoxical resurgence in more expensive health plans that offer more
medical options, such as preferred provider organizations and
point-of-service plans that allow patients to seek treatment outside
their regular health-care network.</TE>
<TE>   The report showed a decline in HMO enrollment to 48% in 2001, from
55% in 2000. The percentage had been growing steadily since 1994,
when 35.3% were in HMOs. Nationally, HMO enrollment fell to 23% last
year from its peak of 31% in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Kaiser report said, the percentage of
Californians enrolled in PPOs rose to 27% in 2001 from 25% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Enrollment in point-of-service plans, once considered a dead model
by some health-care analysts, rose to 25% from 19%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Court Gives FCC Some TV Work</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court upended Federal Communications Commission
rules about broadcast media ownership, prompting the FCC's chief to
acknowledge it will be harder for the agency to justify its rules.</TE>
<TE>   The court ordered the FCC to reconsider restrictions that no
single company can reach more than 35% of the national broadcast TV
audience. The court also swept aside a ban on a company owning a
cable system and a TV station in the same market.</TE>
<TE>   The court ruling "was a monumental case" that makes it harder for
the FCC to keep its restriction, Chairman Michael K. Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom Inc., owner of CBS; News Corp., which owns Fox; and General
Electric Co., NBC's owner, challenged the 35% ownership cap rule as
obsolete.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court is requiring the FCC to provide additional
evidence that other media ownership rules are still needed. The
agency is reviewing a ban on a company owning a newspaper and
broadcast station in the same market. Several companies already are
in violation of that rule, including Tribune Co., publisher of the
Los Angeles Times, which owns newspapers and TV stations in several
of the same markets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Home Is Where the Buying Is</TE>
<TE>   Buyers in the Southland snapped up homes last month at the most
hectic rate for a January in 13 years, triggering a steep run-up in
prices, according to a report released last week.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, 8,087 new and existing condominiums and
houses were sold last month, up more than 22% from a year earlier and
the biggest volume for a January since the frenzied market of 1989.
The median price of homes sold rose 17.5% to a record $235,000,
according to DataQuick Information Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Orange and Ventura counties also saw double-digit sales increases
last month as consumers moved to lock in low interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Although the January spike in sales was unusual and not likely to
be sustained, analysts said the DataQuick report reaffirmed the
enduring strength of the housing market, which has cushioned the
blows of an otherwise sluggish economy.</TE>

<LD>It's been really amazing to watch Miss Cleo, hasn't it? The Caribbean
clairvoyant's late-night TV ad popped up amid pitches for incredible
stain removers, precise vegetable dicers, easily cleaned rotating
ovens and impressive breast enhancement creams that, according to the
animation, work in seconds. For only $4.99 a minute, the Psychic
Hotline's Miss Cleo could see things invisible to mere mortals. Right
before our eyes she listened to one female caller and knew instantly
the caller's boyfriend was fooling around with a co-worker. But
that's not all. Miss Cleo also knew the caller herself had been
fooling around. Incredible! The caller confirmed it. "Call me now!"
Miss Cleo said. And thousands did.</LD>
<LD>   Webster's defines clairvoyance as "the hypothesized ability to
perceive things that are not in sight." But was it necessary for Noah
Webster, the noted 19th century prig who foresaw the need for a
popular dictionary, to be so skeptical? Anyone can be clairvoyant.
Many, for instance, have predicted that a parent or spouse would be
angry if they returned late or crashed the car. Some even predicted
the precise words uttered upon delivery of that news.</LD>
<TE>   Over the years some of us concentrated real hard and saw in the
future's mists a new scandal coming to Congress. It had something to
do with money or sex or both. Bingo! We were regularly right. Others
saw Congressional investigations and predicted questions sounding
more like speeches. Uncanny.</TE>
<TE>   Many of us, even without calling the hotline and being stalled
past the first free minutes to accrue a bill averaging upward of $60,
also foresaw that eventually Miss Cleo and her off-camera employers
would run into legal trouble. Now it's happened. Not because her
predictions were off, but because Miss Cleo could not see that the
Federal Trade Commission would find fault with free three-minute
psychic readings that weren't really free because operators allegedly
took too long to complete credit card paperwork. Seeing the future
can take time, on the phone anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Since cave days, humans (even Libras) have shown a powerful
curiosity about the future, whether those insights emit from the
Delphic oracle's obtuse observations or by analyzing pigeon innards,
tea leaves, palm lines, ouija boards, Nostradamus, fortune cookies or
weather and traffic reports. We're pleased the FTC is on this case.
We see something else though. It's coming into focus now. We see
large lawyers' fees and ample news coverage. Oh, and Miss Cleo will
be replaced by TV ads for new music tapes and CDs, not available in
stores. We foresee shipping and handling charges adding another
$5.95, no, $6.95 to the advertised cost, with rush delivery also
available.</TE>

<HD>Yes on L.A. Proposition Q</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Proposition Q, a $600-million city of Los Angeles bond measure, would
finance two new police stations, repair existing police and fire
stations, establish new bomb squads and build facilities that would
speed up response time to 911 emergency calls. Who could oppose
these?</LD>
<LD>   Supporters, especially Los Angeles Fire Chief William R. Bamattre,
make a good case for the tax, approximately $3 a month on a house
valued at $189,000. But taxpayers are still smarting over broken
promises from the 1989 public safety bond measure, particularly the
failure to build a new Valley police station. And the unfinished 911
upgrade funded by a bond measure approved a decade ago. Voters, who
must give the measure two-thirds approval, will rightly demand to
know what's different this time. However, because of oversight and
other bond-issue spending safeguards in a law passed last year, The
Times endorses Proposition Q.</LD>
<TE>   The ballot description does not list the specific major projects
it will fund, an omission that is unfair to voters, but the projects
are in a separate motion passed by the City Council. They include:
improvements to every fire station ($25 million); a new
earthquake-safe police and fire emergency operations complex to
replace the underground center built four decades ago ($120 million);
a new jail ($100 million); replacement police stations in the West
San Fernando Valley, Hollenbeck, Rampart and Harbor divisions ($170
million), and two new stations in the Valley ($70 million, including
a Valley Bureau headquarters and traffic division) and the Mid-City
area ($45 million); two new bomb squad facilities, including one in
the Valley ($20 million); and repairs at police stations ($50
million).</TE>
<TE>   Unlike previous public safety bond measures, Proposition Q
requires annual independent audits and an oversight board appointed
by the mayor and City Council. Citizen activists and news
organizations will surely also inspect how the money is spent. The
total will not put the city over its own limits on bond debt.</TE>
<TE>   Residents needing police and fire protection should not be the
first to suffer from the broken promises of politicians. Neither
should firefighters and police officers be crammed into overcrowded
stations that need repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it's a tough time to ask voters to tax themselves. True, the
city has yet to prove that it can do what it promises in a reasonable
time.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the need is there, and the requirement of oversight makes a
difference. The Times endorses Proposition Q on March 5.</TE>

<LD>Enron has become the shorthand reference for what's wrong with
American business. Among its most recently revealed shenanigans is
that, despite paper profits of almost $2billion between 1996-2000, it
paid no corporate federal income taxes in four of the past five
years. Indeed, it received a net tax rebate of $381million and a
$278-million tax rebate in 2000. Enron also created no less than 800
"subsidiaries" in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands to make this
possible.</LD>
<LD>   It may have all been narrowly legal, but ordinary taxpayers who
ended up footing Enron's tax bill aren't rushing forward to say,
"Here's my hard-earned pay, Enron, and you're welcome."</LD>
<LD>   Enron's use of foreign tax havens is not new or unique. It is
merely symptomatic of how American corporations are increasingly
avoiding income taxes. Becoming a corporation in Bermuda is as easy
as creating a mail drop. Corporations don't need to set up an office,
but under U.S. tax law they get all the benefits of operating abroad.
Any income earned abroad by the offshore "subsidiary" is not taxed by
the U.S. government. These loopholes need fixing.</LD>
<TE>   The corporations employing, or about to employ, legal offshore
tax-avoidance include Ingersoll Rand and Foster Wheeler Corp.,
manufacturers of heavy machinery. There is no downside: They keep
their headquarters in the U.S., allowing them to benefit from the
U.S. legal system, roads and universities, not to mention the
protections of its huge military. They just don't have to pay a fair
share for all of these benefits. Ingersoll-Rand expects to cut its
tax bill by $60million in 2002, and Stanley Works, which makes tools
and aims to incorporate itself in Bermuda, calculates that its
corporate income tax bill will drop by $30million this year.</TE>
<TE>   These individual sums are not gigantic given the $2-trillion
federal budget, but there is something corrosive about businesses
going through ever-slicker machinations to avoid taxes while
wage-earners pay for the nation's defense, transportation, federally
subsidized health care and schools.</TE>
<TE>   An Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy study indicates a
resurgence in corporate tax avoidance. The most recent data, from
1996-98, show that the top 250 companies paid only 20.1% in 1998,
down from 26.5% in 1988, following a landmark tax reform. In Business
Week magazine, Robert McIntyre, one of the study's authors, says that
General Motors, Navistar International and El Paso Energy, among
other companies, have continued to slash their payments.</TE>
<TE>   Offshore tax shelters harm individual taxpayers and the
infrastructure of the nation. Congress needs to approve legislation
that would either impose a worldwide minimum tax on U.S. corporate
profits or make it prohibitively costly for companies to incorporate
themselves in havens like Bermuda. Until then, Enron won't be the
last company to avoid paying taxes altogether.</TE>

<LD>Although U.S. accounting rules and standards fill 12,000 pages,
companies still have considerable latitude in compiling their balance
sheets and income statements. Here are some of the more controversial
ways companies have used the rules to burnish their financial
reports.</LD>
<LD>   * Changing assumptions: IBM Corp. boosted its earnings in 2000
when it increased the expected rate of return on its pension from
9.5% to 10%. The change generated $195 million in pretax income for
the computer giant.</LD>
<LD>   IBM changed its assumption at the start of a market slump, a year
in which the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index declined 10.1%. It fell an
additional 13% last year and is down 5.1% this year.</LD>
<TE>   IBM spokeswoman Carol Makovich defended the change, saying, "The
expected return on plan assets is long-term view, not just current
year. IBM has exceeded assumed return on plan assets, substantially,
every year since 1995, save one."</TE>
<TE>   * Omitting crucial data: It was a big issue in the Enron failure,
yet the energy trader was hardly a rogue company in this regard.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, PNC Financial Services Group reduced its 2001 profit
by $155 million because the Pittsburgh-based bank omitted the
operations of three companies it had set up with American
International Group Inc., a large insurance company.</TE>
<TE>   PNC said its treatment of the subsidiaries followed the advice of
its auditor, Ernst &amp; Young. But the Federal Reserve Board, which
oversees financial institutions, said PNC's interpretation of
generally accepted accounting principles was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   * Hiding or obscuring debt: Companies attempt to obscure debt so
they look more creditworthy. This allows businesses to obtain higher
credit ratings, pay lower interest rates and avoid restrictive
covenants in loan agreements.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating company put Williams Cos. on a
negative credit watch this month after learning the energy company
might have to cover a potential liability from a former subsidiary
with a loan.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is on the hook for a $1.4-billion Williams Communications
Group Inc. bond issue. Williams had said it could cover any potential
default by the former subsidiary by issuing Williams stock. But
declines in the stock price has made that solution untenable, putting
Williams at risk of having to suddenly accept a huge debt, according
to S&amp;P.</TE>
<TE>   * Using mark to market accounting: This is one of the more
controversial methods often used by companies, such as Enron, that
trade energy, telecom services and other nontraditional commodities.</TE>
<TE>   One use of this accounting practice is to estimate the value of a
contract to deliver a product, service or good at a future time. It
works where there are established futures markets, but becomes
difficult for assets that can't easily be sold or in areas where
there are no uniform markets, such as in natural gas or electricity
futures.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens in electricity is a secret market," said Robert
McCullough, a Portland, Ore.-based financial analyst and economist.
"Enron booked revenue and earnings on deals that go out 20 years.
That is pricing by rumor. Without the transparency that we have in
established markets, that fails pretty quickly."</TE>

<LD>Let's see now, the music industry would like us all to abandon the CD
format, discard all our CDs, CD players and CD burners, and instead
buy the new, more expensive DataPlay system and discs so we'll never
be able to make another "illegal" copy of music again ["New Disk a
Contender for CD's Titles," Feb. 18].</LD>
<LD>   As blank CDs and CD replication costs have gone down over the
years, retail music CDs keep getting more and more expensive, gouging
the consumer.</LD>
<LD>   What we want is technology that makes it easy to make our own
personalized copies of music whenever we want, however we want.
Anything less is a step backward. We're not pirates or criminals. We
simply want a fair shake.</LD>
<TE>   Good luck selling the DataPlay, guys. I'll just keep my old-tech
CDs, thank you.</TE>

<LD>I have been a Realtor/broker in the Coachella Valley going on nine
years. While I do respect the comments made by Bruce Blomgren
["Vacation Home Sales Sliding," Feb. 11], business in real estate
continues to grow.</LD>
<LD>   Certain segments of housing such as Mr. Blomgren sells could
indeed be down, as his niche is the upscale housing market. Housing
in the medium price range is building by leaps and bounds.</LD>
<LD>   This is no longer a vacation-home area, in my opinion. People are
moving in permanently and living in the valley year-round.</LD>

fiancee, who has now asked whether she could have $10,000 from the
life insurance proceeds. She would use it to have new siding put on
the house, which desperately needs it. I have no problem with helping
her, but I wonder what tax implications I will have. Earlier this
year I gave her $5,000 toward the purchase of a new car.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Don't let tax worries prevent you from helping your
grandchildren and their mother. Unless you plan to give away more
than $1 million in your lifetime, you won't face any tax implications
for your gifts.</LD>
<LD>   You're allowed to give $11,000 a year to anyone you choose without
having to file a gift tax return.</LD>
<TE>   You don't actually owe any tax until your gifts, above that
$11,000 threshold, total $1 million per person.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, your $10,000 gift, added to the $5,000 you've
already given her, would require the filing of a gift tax return with
the IRS, because your total gifts for this year would exceed $11,000.
But only $4,000 would be subtracted from your $1-million lifetime
limit.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't want to bother with a gift tax return, you might give
$6,000 and ask your husband to chip in the rest.</TE>
<TE>   You also might consider giving her the rest of the money, either
now or over the next few years. Chances are this policy was purchased
for your son by his employer, and your son never got around to
changing the beneficiaries when he started a family. Unfortunately
this happens far too often. People marry, divorce or have children
but forget to update the beneficiaries on their insurance policies
and retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   You're not required to give up the money, of course, but a single
mom with two children certainly could use all the help you're willing
to give.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   State's Property Laws Decide Entitlement</TE>
<TE>   Q: What advice do you have for someone whose spouse brought
investments into the marriage that have doubled in the last 10 years,
but are still in the spouse's name alone? My spouse's children are
named as the only beneficiaries on the accounts, which include
annuities and life insurance policies. Because this amount of money
is large, am I entitled to any portion of it upon death or divorce?</TE>
<TE>   A: The answer depends on the type of accounts and where you live.</TE>
<TE>   In community property states, such as California, it matters who
had what when you got married. Assets acquired and income earned
during marriage are considered to be owned equally by both spouses.
Assets owned by one spouse before the marriage, or received by gift
or inheritance during marriage, usually are considered separate
property.</TE>
<TE>   There are exceptions, of course. If you commingle
assets--depositing your inheritance into your joint checking account,
for example--your separate property could become community property.
Also, retirement account contributions and earnings during the
marriage are considered community property even if the spouse had the
account before marriage. In two community property states, Texas and
Idaho, income earned from separate property--such as investment
dividends--also is considered community property.</TE>
<TE>   Had enough yet? Sorry, there's more. Most states don't have
community property laws. They operate by common law, which holds that
the spouse who earns the money or brings the assets into a marriage
doesn't have to share--at least during life.</TE>
<TE>   At death, however, the surviving spouse typically has the right to
take one-third to one-half of the estate, regardless of who owned
what--and often regardless of what the dead spouse's wishes were.</TE>
<TE>   You'll probably want to chat with an estate planning attorney to
find out exactly what the rules are in your state and how they affect
you. If you're in a common law state, your spouse would have a tough
time disinheriting you, especially without your consent. You might be
in a somewhat more precarious situation in a community property
state, but a thorough review of your situation may turn up ways to
mitigate the damage.</TE>
<TE>   Gather as much information as you can about what you and your
spouse own and owe. The more financial data you have, the better you
can plan for your future.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Daily Tip Log Can Help With Taxes</TE>
<TE>   Q: A waitress we know recently received her W-2 wage statement.
The box for tips had been filled in by her employer and is
substantially more than her actual tips for the year. Fortunately,
she keeps a log of her daily tips for her financial records. How can
she challenge this with her employer as well as prove to the IRS that
her tips were less than her employer reported?</TE>
<TE>   A: Because she kept good records, your waitress friend can report
the tips she actually earned and not worry about what her employer
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Many restaurants and bars are required to allocate tips, equaling
about 8% of sales, to their employees--whether or not the servers
actually made that much. Smart waiters and waitresses do what your
friend did, and keep a daily log. That should be enough to prove her
figures are right, even if challenged by the IRS.</TE>

<HD>There Are Pitfalls in Path to Online Financial Advice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using the Internet to get advice on managing your personal finances
can be convenient, cost-effective--and confusing.</LD>
<LD>   That's what Bruce Glasscock, a 45-year-old Modesto pharmacist,
discovered when he signed up for three Web-based services that offer
financial planning advice: Morningstar, Financial Engines and the
Motley Fool.</LD>
<LD>   Glasscock, who wanted guidance on picking mutual funds for his
retirement, was able to do his research in the comfort of his own
home for a fraction of what a financial planner would have charged.
But what he didn't expect was that each of the services would give
him different--and often conflicting--advice.</LD>
<TE>   One site touts buying individual company stocks; another says
mutual funds are the best way to go.</TE>
<TE>   One recommends Janus funds--another does not.</TE>
<TE>   An investment calculator on one site says he'll be rich at
retirement, while another predicts he'll just scrape by.</TE>
<TE>   Glasscock says he's confused to the point of paralysis.</TE>
<TE>   "Which advice service do you go with?" asks Glasscock, a married
father of two. "We don't have the kind of time to make a career out
of this. I just want to know if I am doing the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   He isn't alone. Faced with an explosion of financial information
on the Web, consumers must be prepared to do some homework to make
sure they're getting accurate advice that's suited to their needs.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some tips for finding your way through the online maze:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Narrow the Field</TE>
<TE>   Lynn O'Shaughnessy, author of "The Investing Bible" (Hungry Minds
Press, 2001), said investors should limit themselves to well-known
sites sponsored by reputable companies. All three sites Glasscock
uses, as well as sites sponsored by big mutual fund companies such as
Vanguard, Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, are good options. She also
likes sites sponsored by journalistic organizations such as CNBC,
Smart Money and the Los Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers should avoid sites sponsored by unfamiliar companies,
and particularly those that tout individual stocks that are
"guaranteed" to post huge profits, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you stray too far off the path, you can get snagged by sites
that tout particular stocks only because some promoter has paid them
to do so," O'Shaughnessy said. "Why wander into the jungle? You never
know what's going to bite you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Determine Your Needs</TE>
<TE>   Some sites offer a wide range of financial advice, from how to buy
a house or car to strategies for retirement savings. Others
concentrate solely on investments.</TE>
<TE>   If you need life advice--such as whether and how much to save for
college expenses--free sites probably will provide it. These sites,
sponsored by mutual fund companies, newspapers and magazines, do a
great job of providing valuable consumer education materials and work
sheets on a wide array of personal finance topics. They can help you
figure out how much to save and give some direction on the best types
of savings vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   However, if you're looking for specific investment advice--the
best funds to choose in your 401(k) retirement plan, for
instance--you might need to pay a fee to get it. Although detailed
investment analysis sites, such as Financial Engines and
Morningstar.com, offer a wide array of financial information for
free, only members have access to the portfolio analyzers that can
pick funds for you.</TE>
<TE>   Morningstar charges $7.95 for a three-month subscription to Clear
Future, its consumer advice service. A one-year membership works out
to about $32. However, those who want more--including analyst reports
and enhanced portfolio tools--might want to buy Morningstar's premium
membership service for $11.95 a month, which is what Glasscock does.</TE>
<TE>   Financial Engines charges about $150 annually for advice on
tax-qualified savings accounts such as 401(k) plans and $300 a year
for advice on investments in taxable accounts.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based MPower offers a retail retirement plan
analyzer through MSN Money for $20 annually, MPower Executive Vice
President Neal Ringquist said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Test the Advice</TE>
<TE>   Consumers who subscribe to more than one service may get very
different advice from each service. Some differences are to be
expected, financial advisors say, because there are many routes to
financial security, and reasonable advisors often disagree.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the conflicts can be traced to differences in the
online advice programs, said Jeff Maggioncalda, president and chief
executive of Financial Engines. Consumers looking for detailed
financial advice should spend a little time testing the program to
see what it's providing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, financial professionals know that the risk of
investing in a single stock is substantially greater than investing
in a diversified mutual fund. But many online advice services act as
though there is no difference between the two investments.</TE>
<TE>   To see whether your online service accounts for that risk,
Maggioncalda suggests this test: Plug in a sample portfolio of
$10,000 in a single blue-chip stock, such as General Motors, and
click to get the program's projection of value and investment
volatility.</TE>
<TE>   Do the same calculation using an index mutual fund, such as
Vanguard Index 500. If the projection looks the same, your service is
using the historic returns of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index as a
proxy for each stock within that index, which is misleading, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Advisory services also can come up short when comparing mutual
funds, ignoring differences in management fees, investment strategies
and turnover rates.</TE>
<TE>   To judge how well a site evaluates mutual funds, pick several
funds that invest in growth stocks and that have different fees and
then plug them into the program--one-by-one--to see whether the
program distinguishes among them.</TE>

Opinion</HD>

<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using the Internet to manage finances isn't for everybody. Even the
people who provide online financial advice concede as much.</LD>
<LD>   "If you have a complicated life, an online investment program
should not be your solution," said John Rekenthaler, president of
online advice at Morningstar Associates in Chicago. "Online advice
programs are sophisticated, quantitative calculation programs.
They're not psychologists. They don't know how to probe and get to
the root of issues. They have to take you at face value."</LD>
<LD>   People who have trouble getting motivated, don't express
themselves well, need lifestyle advice rather than basic investment
advice or who lead atypical lives may find that online services don't
meet their needs, experts say.</LD>
<TE>   The computer programs used by online services ask few questions
and can't discuss options or address unusual economic challenges,
such as raising a disabled child or helping an ill parent.</TE>
<TE>   "Financial planning is a combination of art and science," said
Neal Ringquist, executive vice president of MPower, a San
Francisco-based service that provides online advice primarily through
company 401(k) plans. "When you narrow the focus to planning for
retirement--and the advice is limited to the financial assets
earmarked for that--it becomes more science, which is something we
can do very well.</TE>
<TE>   "But the more you go from retirement planning to financial
planning, the more art that's involved. That's where you need a
[human] advisor."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, online services can provide some help to most
consumers, and at a much lower price than financial planners, who can
charge hundreds of dollars to prepare a detailed financial plan. The
services can educate consumers about what to expect from different
types of investments and help them gauge how much to save for
specific goals. They also can provide a valuable "second opinion" on
a human planner's advice.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, financial planners who get commissions on the
investments they recommend to clients may be tempted to put their own
interests ahead of the clients'.</TE>
<TE>   Online services provide a check for anyone with that worry,
Rekenthaler said. "If we can be a validator, that's a good role."</TE>
<TE>   For $7.95, Morningstar's Clear Future will run a detailed analysis
of a human planner's advice, providing a range of possible outcomes
that can be compared with what the planner suggested. The service
also will recommend and run comparisons on other investments.</TE>
<TE>   If another investment recommendation looks better, the consumer
can go back to the planner and ask why the funds or investments he or
she originally recommended are superior to those recommended by the
program.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of folks get second opinions from doctors," said Jeff
Maggioncalda, chief executive of Financial Engines, a Palo Alto-based
online advice service. "It's not a bad idea for folks to check in
with a few different sources for financial advice as well."</TE>

<HD>Ashcroft Lets 'Source of Freedom' Ring</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is it such a bad thing that the religious beliefs Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft mentioned spill over into his work (" 'Creator' Is Freedom's
Source, Ashcroft Says," Feb. 20)? The very similar spillage in this
nation's founders helped give us our amazingly pluralistic society:
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness." This is the strong philosophy upon which our
country was founded and has succeeded. Ashcroft gives a relevant
history lesson, not a sermon, when he reminds us all.</LD>
<LD>   Allison Hollabaugh</LD>
<LD>   Fremont, Calif.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So I guess, according to Ashcroft, I am not a civilized person,
since I am not Christian, Jewish or Muslim. Ashcroft says that all
freedoms are granted by the creator, but given the chance, he and
those of his ilk would surely deny me my freedoms for not adhering to
their narrow belief system. So I would like to remind Ashcroft that
my freedoms were granted by the Constitution of the United States.
You know, that document he swore to uphold and defend when he took
office. Apparently the upholding and defending will go much better
for Christians, Jews and Muslims than for the rest of us uncivilized
masses.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Mallon</TE>
<TE>   San Luis Obispo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If God gave us freedom, as Ashcroft says, we need not fight to
protect it, because God decides who has it. Could the entire defense
budget be used to improve education?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Good turns" can be performed by individuals or teams. Your inspiring
Feb. 17 story about Gloria Garcia appropriately gave recognition to
this fine volunteer at the Community Resource Center in South
Whittier. Another inspiring story is the collective "good turn" that
a team of players performed for that community. The L.A. County
Community Development Commission, which owns and operates the CRC,
has spent over eight years working in partnership with the South
Whittier community and Supervisors Gloria Molina and Don Knabe to
revitalize that low- and moderate-income area. These county entities
and various for-profit and nonprofit developers have jointly funded
five projects with a total investment of more than $30 million within
a two-mile radius. The five developments constructed are the CRC,
Sunshine Terrace Apartments (affordable rental housing), Sundance
Vistas (public rental housing), TELACU Villa Hermosa (a housing
center for low-income seniors) and Carmenita Walk (affordable
housing).</LD>
<LD>   The team effort has created a powerful "community synergy." Anyone
seeking services or wanting to volunteer may contact the Community
Resource Center at (562) 946-2425.</LD>

<HD>Bradley's Fifth Star</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Feb. 20 letter stated that Omar Bradley wore five stars during
WWII. Gen. Bradley didn't receive his fifth star until 1950.</LD>
<LD>   The five-star general of the Army rank was first provided for as a
"temporary grade" by the 78th Congress, approved Dec. 14, 1944, and
was not made permanent until March 23, 1946, by the 79th Congress.
There have been only five generals of the Army: George C. Marshall,
Dec. 16, 1944; Douglas MacArthur, Dec. 18, 1944; Dwight D.
Eisenhower, Dec. 20, 1944; Henry H. "Hap" Arnold, Dec. 21, 1944; and
lastly, Omar N. Bradley, Sept. 20, 1950.</LD>
<LD>   It should be pointed out that Gen. Arnold's rank was redesignated
to general of the Air Force in May 1949.</LD>

<HD>Belmont: Don't Throw Good Money After Bad</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Cleaning Up Belmont Is No Job for the LAUSD," by Bryan Steele,
Commentary, Feb. 18: I have watched in horror as the LAUSD board
members started the process again to try to make the Belmont school
site usable and perhaps also repair their image as government
bureaucratic bunglers. I believe the figure they now put forward is
another $80 million to make the school site "safe." I just wonder
what the yearly upkeep of all these remedial environmental systems
will be. Undoubtedly in the millions of dollars (above and beyond
normal operating costs).</LD>
<LD>   My guess is that the school board members feel that the well of
taxpayer money is so bountiful that they can continue to afford to
throw good money after bad (this while they complain about how badly
underfunded they are). Their arrogance toward the taxpayer is
incredible. As Steele pointed out, how long do we think it will take
(weeks, months) before the first round of lawsuits is filed on behalf
of students claiming to have been injured by some toxic leakage? Will
the school board then simply set up a fund for those and all the
other lawsuits that will be filed, or will it declare that the
"contractor" is at fault and the school site will have to be
abandoned anyway?</LD>
<LD>   Is there anyone in government (in Los Angeles) who has anything
close to common sense?</LD>

<HD>Growing Populations Without Water</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Once again those concerned about assuring adequate water supply
before development is approved are painted as slow-growth advocates
by the development community ("Water Report Favors Growth," Feb. 16).
One large developer in particular, Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co., has
chanted this mantra ceaselessly to try to deflect criticism over lack
of a firm water supply for its 21,600-unit Newhall Ranch proposal.</LD>
<LD>   We cannot solve our water problems by burying our heads in the
sand and pretending we have an abundance of supply. We do not. The
1998 edition of Bulletin 160, a statewide report on water supplies
published by the Department of Water Resources, predicted about 2
million acre-feet in future deficit, and its updated version, due out
soon, may have even more dire predictions. Last year the state
Legislature admitted water was indeed an issue and began addressing
the problem with the passage of SB 221 and SB 610, bills that ensure
that consideration of water supply would occur in the planning
process. The public apparently sees things differently, too. What
else would explain the growing statewide public interest in watershed
protection and water conservation?</LD>

<LD>May I suggest the following name for the Valley, should it secede
from L.A.: The Valley.</LD>
<LD>   When residents travel and are asked where they are from, they
invariably say, "The Valley." Also, a name using the article "the" is
quite rare. I can offhand think of only two, the Bronx and The Hague.
This rarity will give the city further distinction.</LD>

<LD>"Wings"</LD>
<LD>   by Christopher Myers</LD>
<LD>   Ikarus Jackson was different because he had wings. All of his
classmates laughed and giggled when he walked by, and it made him
very sad. Even strangers laughed. But one day a girl at his school
felt sorry for him. She told Ikarus that his wings were beautiful and
that he did not have to feel sad or lonely. Ikarus smiled for the
first time.</LD>
<TE>   I enjoyed reading "Wings" because I learned it is OK to be
different.</TE>

me a tree," and the artist draws a tree. Then they just keep on
asking for things a little bit different and the artist keeps on
drawing. There just might be something for you to draw inside.</TE>

<HD>Here's Something to Smile About, if Only You Could</HD>
<DH>Botox's wrinkle: It erases age lines plus all signs of
emotion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM SHEA</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've been reading up on botulism. Apparently, it's a good thing.</LD>
<LD>   It's funny how stuff comes full circle. Most of my life I
considered the disease to be one of those it was best to avoid. I'm
not sure where I got this. It probably had something to do with the
fact that botulism, caused by a toxic bacterium, cannot only result
in death but, worse, vomiting.</LD>
<LD>   These days, botulism is experiencing an image make-over. This is
because botulinum toxin is used to produce a substance called Botox.
Botox is kind of like Wite-Out for your face.</LD>
<TE>   When it is injected near wrinkles, it makes them go away. It does
this by paralyzing the muscles that cause life's creases. A good
Botox job can make a 70-year-old look like a 30-year-old--with blue
hair.</TE>
<TE>   The downside of Botox is that while it can make your face smooth
as a baby's behind, it also leaves your face with the same ability to
express emotion as a baby's behind.</TE>
<TE>   If you have access to a teenager, you are no doubt well acquainted
with this look.</TE>
<TE>   A reporter for the New York Times recently wrote that because of
Botox: "It is now rare in certain social enclaves to see a woman over
the age of 35 with the ability to look angry."</TE>
<TE>   Movie directors have also complained that as a result of Botox,
certain actresses have the facial dexterity of Steven Wright.</TE>
<TE>   In fairness, there are advantages to being Botoxed: It enables you
to apply makeup simply, rather than having to Spackle it on. It makes
it a lot easier to keep a straight face when listening to the boss.</TE>
<TE>   If you're a man, it allows you to claim that you are, in fact,
showing emotion. And then, there's the matter of poker.</TE>
<TE>   Having said that, I'm not going to be joining the Botox nation any
time soon.</TE>
<TE>   Call me old-fashioned, but I kind of think your mug should give
people a clue as to where you've been and, just as important, how
much longer you're likely to be here.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, there's the unpleasantness of a doctor sticking needles in
your face every three months or so.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings up the oops factor. Suppose the needle misses its
mark and paralyzes your brain. That could be a real problem, you
know, in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, I'd like to see Botox put to more practical uses. I'm
just thinking out loud here, but why not market Botox as a sleeping
aid? You come up with a way to paralyze aging kidneys for a seven- or
eight-hour stretch, and I'm at the front of the line.</TE>

<LD>Breathing Easier</LD>
<LD>   Two Olympic gold medalists, boxer George Foreman (1968) and
swimmer Tom Dolan (1996 and 2000), were honored at the 100th
anniversary celebration of Barlow Respiratory Hospital, held at the
Millennium Biltmore Hotel. The venerable treatment center, nestled in
Chavez Ravine, has embarked on a $3.75-million campaign for a new
hospital that will increase its capacity from 49 to 84 beds. Built in
1927, the main facility must be brought up to seismic safety
standards by 2008 or cease inpatient operations altogether.</LD>
<LD>   Foreman was recipient of the Barlow Foundation's first
Humanitarian Award for his will to succeed and good works; Dolan
received the Barlow Respiratory Hospital Award for his perseverence
in spite of daunting odds.</LD>
<TE>   Foreman's mother was diagnosed with tuberculosis when he was a
teenager. "While she was away in the hospital, I got off on the wrong
hand," he said. "But when she came home, I straightened my life out
and joined the Job Corps. I owe it all to her."</TE>
<TE>   Dolan's connection is even more personal. Despite allergies, a
narrow trachea and exercise-induced asthma, he has won six
international gold medals and four silver. In accepting the award,
Dolan said, "It's a disease I've had to battle since I was 12. It
doesn't go away, and there is no quick fix, but visiting Barlow
touches me close to home because the worst pitfall for an athlete is
to think he's invincible.</TE>
<TE>   "Seeing the patients reminds me that I'm blessed to have the
strength to overcome any obstacle. I receive hundreds of letters from
young people with asthma, and I try to respond to every letter and
encourage them."</TE>
<TE>   KCBS news anchor Jonathan Elias emceed the Feb. 16 event, which
grossed $83,000. Among those attending were Dodgers exec Bob
Graziano, chairman of the fund-raising campaign; Stanley P. Hebert
III, Margaret Crane, Dale Kristien, Joseph Van Der Meulen, Dennis
Zine, Jamaal Wilkes and one of Foreman's sons, George III.</TE>

<TE>   Oscar Costumes</TE>
<TE>   The opening of the 10th anniversary exhibition "The Art of Motion
Picture Costume Design" drew a packed house at the Fashion Institute
of Design and Merchandising last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   In the crowd grazing at Renaissance Caterers' lavish buffets were
two top contenders for this year's Oscars: Judianna Makovsky, creator
of the costumes for "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," and
Ngila Dickson, co-designer for "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship
of the Ring."</TE>
<TE>   Makovsky admitted that creating the wardrobe for the wizards of
Hogwarts was quite a stretch from the designs that earned her a prior
Oscar nomination, for the funky '50s fable "Pleasantville." She said
she felt very lucky that, as an American, she had the chance to go to
England for the adaptation of J.K. Rowling's best-selling fantasy.
"The illustrations on the cover of 'Harry Potter' vary in every
country, so I didn't feel obligated to replicate the costumes on the
American edition. But I still get letters from children who've seen
the film and challenge my choices. It's really quite sweet," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   New Zealand designer Dickson said, "I came to the project six
months out. Richard Taylor had already done the armor for the film,
so when I came on the project, my approach was a blend of the Tolkien
illustrations with Taylor's armor." Like Makovsky, she said she tried
not to think about the fact that so many have read the book and have
their own conception of the characters. "We worked our fingers to the
bone and did over 15,000 pieces in two years," she said. When
quizzed, neither nominee would reveal what she plans to wear to the
awards ceremonies next month, but Dickson confided, "For sure, it
will be made by a Kiwi."</TE>

<TE>   Romancing Stones</TE>
<TE>   Major donors to the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana
gathered on Valentine's Day for a romantic sit-down dinner and a
preview of the facility's new exhibit, "Gems! The Art and Nature of
Precious Stones."</TE>
<TE>   After a champagne reception, about 80 guests were serenaded by
strings as they dined on fare created by the museum's Tangata
restaurant: seared duck breast, lobster tail, lamb and bittersweet
chocolate cake.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the agenda was a tour by museum president and show curator
Peter Keller, where guests beheld rare gemstones including a
242-carat tanzanite, believed to be the world's largest, and a
200-pound gold-toned quartz.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it all," said museum board member and exhibit co-sponsor
Ed Roski Jr. of Toluca Lake, who attended the event with his wife,
Gayle. Michael Scott and Dee Dee Anderson Poiry were chairpersons.
The exhibit runs through June 2.</TE>

<TE>   Women's Voices</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Lipstadt, professor of modern Jewish and Holocaust studies
at Emory University in Atlanta, was the keynote speaker at the annual
Women's Voices luncheon sponsored by the Jewish Federation of Orange
County at the Hyatt Regency Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Lipstadt, author of "Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on
Truth and Memory," told the event's 450 attendees that she tries to
"stand up for people who didn't have the chance to stand up for
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   During the event, Natalie Mandel of Newport Beach was presented
with the Anne Entin Woman of the Year Award for her 25 years of
service to the group.</TE>
<TE>   Pledges of $615,000 from the Feb. 14 luncheon will go to the
federation's annual campaign, which supports Jewish community
services in Orange County and throughout the world. Jodi Greenbaum
and Jacquee Lipson were event co-chairs.</TE>

<TE>   Cheney Honored</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne V. Cheney, were
presented with Architect of Peace Awards at a benefit on Tuesday for
the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   Donors to the library paid $2,500 per ticket for the sit-down
luncheon, held in the facility's entrance hall. Net proceeds of about
$200,000 will be used for the library's special programs and
exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   "The defining struggle of the 21st century is an enemy determined
to kill Americans by any means on any scale and on our own soil,"
Dick Cheney told guests, who included Julie Nixon Eisenhower and
library chairman Donald Bendetti and his wife, Dorothy. "Our greatest
priority is to prevent further attacks and be prepared should they
come."</TE>
<TE>   During her remarks, Lynne Cheney emphasized the need to teach
history to young people. The U.S. has a legacy of liberty for which
their is no guarantee, she said. "We need to tell students the story
of our past so they understand that freedom is not our natural
heritage."</TE>

<LD>Little Boy wanted to go outside to play, but it was raining. He went
upstairs. He looked in his toy box. There was a drum, a horn, a ball,
some blocks, a baseball and bat, an airplane and some cars. Little
Boy did not want to play with any of the toys. He went downstairs.
And down some more stairs.</LD>
<LD>   In the basement he found a box with things in it. He found his
safari hat and toy binoculars. He found a rubber boat. He got in. The
boat took him sailing. He sailed across the blue carpet ocean in his
yellow boat with his safari hat and binoculars. Soon he was near
land. It was a strange place.</LD>
<LD>   He got out of the boat. He took his binoculars with him and walked
ashore. He saw a lion. He hid from the lion under a bush. The lion
walked past him.</LD>
<TE>   Little Boy walked along. He saw something big. Very big. It was an
elephant. Little Boy climbed a tree. The elephant walked past him.</TE>
<TE>   In the tree, Little Boy saw a monkey. The monkey was eating a
banana. Little Boy wanted a banana, too, but the monkey would not
share with him. Little Boy climbed down the tree.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, along came the lion. Little Boy ran. He dropped
his binoculars. He lost his safari hat. The lion ran after him.</TE>
<TE>   Little Boy ran past the elephant. The lion ran past the elephant.
The monkey jumped down from the tree onto the elephant's back. They
all ran after Little Boy.</TE>
<TE>   At last Little Boy reached his boat and sailed safely away. When
he got home, the rain had stopped. So Little Boy went out to play.</TE>

<HD>Words From a Street-Smart Tale Teller</HD>
<DH>L.A. author's work wins praise for its gritty, human touch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High heels normally aren't part of Lisa Teasley's fashion modus
operandi. "I have huge feet," she explains, "so I usually wear men's
boots." But certain exceptions must be made when you're a youngish
(39), semi-underground L.A. fiction writer on the cusp of mainstream
recognition.</LD>
<LD>   So in next month's issue of Glamour magazine there's Teasley, a
vision of dreadlocked urban chic, draped in designer couture and
slingback heels for a photo essay on eight up-and-coming female
writers. "They put us in pinks and grays, and none of us were very
pink and gray," says Teasley, somewhat bemused. "We looked like we
were going to a tea party."</LD>
<LD>   A few days later, Teasley is back in her element, loping along the
sidewalks of Little Tokyo in a clingy cafe-au-lait dress, her
dramatic appearance practically daring passersby not to notice. Not
that she's courting approval, mind you. But like her fictional
characters, she projects a vivid singularity that's hard to turn away
from.</LD>
<TE>   That quality burns through the pages of "Glow in the Dark,"
Teasley's first published collection of short stories, which was
issued last month by Seattle's independent Cune Press. Written in
prose both blunt and elliptical, the dozen tales form a gritty,
unflinching yet empathetic collage of lives on the precipice of
contemporary America.</TE>
<TE>   A New Jersey man with a dark obsession; a drug-addled Baja surfer,
tough enough to handle anything but her own contradictions; a trio of
young bohemians, two women and a man, adrift between their inchoate
desires and the liberating possibilities of the Mendocino
Coast--these are a few of the restless spirits floating through "Glow
in the Dark." Post-punk versions of Kerouac's subterraneans, they're
headstrong, conflicted and a little desperate, wavering between
reckless defiance and romantic fatalism. "Very young and pregnant,"
thinks one, "what a heroic way to die."</TE>
<TE>   Atmosphere shifts subtly with the topography as "Glow in the Dark"
cruises from New York to Northern and Southern California, then
hopscotches over to Paris. Superficially, Teasley's L.A. appears
milder, less menacing than her New York, with its trash-strewn East
Village streets and "Wall Street bars thick with slick hair and cigar
smoke."</TE>
<TE>   But the author's hometown casts dark shadows. In "What the
Fertility Goddess Brought," a mixed-race couple struggling to rise
above ancient tribal taboos returns from vacation to find "a
bleached-haired, white girl lying unconscious on their living room
floor." "White Picket Fence," barely a page long, starts out
benignly, only to end with an elderly wife watching her beloved
husband walk away from their Fairfax District duplex--while she
screams uncontrollably.</TE>
<TE>   While Teasley's dialogue-driven scenarios are written with an
authority that suggests firsthand knowledge, she says they emanate
more from imagination and observation than direct experience. "I'll
see someone on the street or I'll read something, and I'll just want
to know, 'What is that about?'" Teasley says as she slips into a
booth at a popular Japanese restaurant, takes in the scene at a
glance and orders the eel without breaking conversational stride.</TE>
<TE>   A painter, dancer and journalist whose work has appeared in The
Times, the Washington Post, Details and L.A. Weekly, Teasley says
that her goal as a fiction writer is to "drop readers dead center"
into the minds and hearts of people on the verge of breakdowns or
breakthroughs. But the extreme situations she depicts aren't meant as
furtive glimpses of some dark sociological underworld. While her
characters may live far from the middle-class suburbs of much current
American fiction, she maintains they're not as alien as some may
believe.</TE>
<TE>   "That daily drama that we hear about or read about, even if we
don't experience it ourselves, it is a part of life," she says. "And
I just happen to be attracted to those kind of situations, just in
wondering what is the human spirit in that kind of dire circumstance,
or just at the point of epiphany."</TE>
<TE>   Since its Jan. 15 release, Teasley's fictional debut has drawn
attention from a mixed bag of publications, including Flaunt and the
trendy French magazine Rebel, as well as Glamour. Maryellen Gordon,
Glamour's deputy style editor, said "Glow in the Dark" "was
interesting to me because the voice of [Teasley's] characters is
probably a bit edgier than some of the other writers we included."
Even characters whose behavior may seem over-the-top and off-putting,
Gordon says, are rendered compelling, multifaceted and ultimately
sympathetic by the author.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon was especially moved by "Why I Could Never Be Boogie," a
lonely 10-year-old girl's first-person sketch of the heavyset boy
next door, who "shows me the hangs around Washington Blvd." and other
bittersweet initiations. "That little girl really stayed with me,"
Gordon says. "She just was so well-drawn, I really felt I could see
that little girl and understand the confusion of what her life was
like at that moment."</TE>
<TE>   Among Teasley's closest friends is L.A. multimedia artist Ron
Athey, who gained international notoriety several years ago when his
performance of the NEA-funded "Four Scenes in a Harsh Life" at the
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis drew the wrath of Capitol Hill
conservatives. In that piece, Athey invoked various symbols of
martyrdom, such as stigmata, to probe the metaphysics of faith.
Confidants since the mid-1980s, he and Teasley have collaborated
occasionally and often give feedback on each other's work. "I really
think she's one of the most Zen people I know, and within that is all
this volatility" in her fiction, says Athey, speaking by phone from
Hamburg, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Teasley, who hopes to write Athey's biography someday, admires the
way her friend and fellow performer "uses the body and ... seems to
transcend its limitations." She says, "We have all this emotional
investment in each other."</TE>
<TE>   Choosing to invest in another human being, or not, is an issue
that defines virtually every story in "Glow in the Dark." Black,
white, gay, straight, young, old, the inhabitants of Teasley's
stories are seduced by the urge to cross lines, smash barriers, make
connections--for better or worse. Even their ethnically and sexually
neutral names--Baker, Pup, Nepenthe, Jazz--link them with a polyglot,
highly molten sensibility that feels very L.A.</TE>
<TE>   A generation ago Bret Easton Ellis memorably wrote in his novel
"Less Than Zero" that people in L.A. were afraid to merge, a metaphor
for the empty lives of rich, dissolute brat-packers who manufactured
cheap thrills to counter the sheer, sun-bleached ennui of it all.
Teasley, a very different writer for a very different L.A., paints
characters whose difficulties may be said to result from merging too
much.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done readings where people have been scandalized," says
Scott Davis, the founder and owner of Cune Press. "They're still
beating me up! And I'm saying, OK, the characters are leading rough,
desperate lives, and no one's paying attention to them. They're just
lost people."</TE>
<TE>   Teasley's personal history is a far cry from those of most of her
subjects.</TE>
<TE>   The eldest of three girls, she was raised in a strict Baldwin
Hills household where the only music heard regularly was classical.
Her father, an insurance company executive, paid his daughters for
every "A" on their report cards, "and he only accepted A's." Her
mother taught her to draw and took her to her maternal grandmother's
house, where she would dance away the warm Sunday afternoons to salsa
music.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a really sheltered childhood," Teasley says. "I've always
had friends who had rebel phases. So I've always been boring that
way. I've never been in any trouble. Maybe that's why I'm so
fascinated by people who get into extreme trouble."</TE>
<TE>   After earning a bachelor's in English at UCLA, specializing in
creative writing, she began flexing the authorial voice that emerges
in "Glow in the Dark." The collection's first stories were written as
early as 1988, and they have trickled in over the years while Teasley
moved to New York City and back and took a crack at two unpublished
novels. (She's working on a third.)</TE>
<TE>   But her short fiction might have languished if she hadn't met
Davis, who asked her to contribute an essay to the 1997 Cune Press
anthology "An Ear to the Ground: Presenting Writers from 2 Coasts."
He then urged her to publish her collected short fiction as "Glow in
the Dark." "She's the quintessential West Coast L.A. woman in that
she's internalized the fluidity you have in L.A.," Davis says. "She
has this ability to seem very comfortable in different worlds, but
you don't feel like she's an outsider looking in. She seems very at
home."</TE>
<TE>   Now resettled in her hometown, Teasley has purchased a Laurel
Canyon fixer-upper, where she lives with her husband, John Vlautin,
38, a music publicist, and their 5-year-old daughter, Imogen. One key
difference between New York and L.A., she says, is how strangers
react to the couple's mixed-race child. "In New York, no one thought
the child was with me," she says. "They thought I was the nanny! Then
I'd come here for a week and no one questioned, 'Is that your
child?'"</TE>
<TE>   She shakes her dreads, managing a smile. People in other parts of
the country imagine that L.A. is a difficult place to live, she says,
but she finds it energizing, unexpected, alive. "That's the magic of
it too," she says as the waiter clears the table, wrapping up lunch.
"If you would just get in your car and go somewhere different, you
would be amazed that this is your city."</TE>
<TE>   And then Teasley is back on the downtown streets again, turning
heads as she merges into the early rush-hour traffic.</TE>

<HD>Taking Steps to Protect Pedestrians</HD>
<DH>A New York inventor has designed a crosswalk countdown to
help out those on foot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROCCO PARASCANDOLA</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A longtime academic wants to teach traffic experts a thing or two
about pedestrian safety along dangerous roadways.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Firestone, 79, last month was granted a patent for a
transparent lens that, when placed over existing traffic control
signals--the "Walk" and "Don't Walk" signals used by pedestrians and
the red, yellow and green lights used by drivers--numerically
displays the time left until the signal changes.</LD>
<LD>   The lens, known in the federal government's list of patents as
Traffic Control Signal with Displayed Time-Elapse, would cost only
$15 per signal--not a lot to spend, Firestone said, when lives are at
stake.</LD>
<TE>   "Just the other day on Broadway I saw a woman crossing the street
and the light was on the last blink, so I ran out there and brought
her to the [traffic] island," the Manhattan resident said. "She said
she didn't know how much time she had to cross.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured if I knew how many seconds I had, I could gauge my pace
and those in wheelchairs or using a walker could do the same," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Firestone now has to sell traffic experts on the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in New Rochelle, N.Y., have expressed an interest in
Firestone's invention, as has Traffic Signals Inc., a Long Island
company that distributes traffic signals.</TE>
<TE>   New York City's Department of Transportation, whose officials
Firestone could not reach, told Newsday that Firestone's invention
seemed intriguing, in part because it would supplement, not replace,
existing traffic signals.</TE>
<TE>   Agency spokesman Tom Coccola says DOT has been averse to similar
devices that have been tested by other cities for fear that using
only numerical signals on street corners would encourage pedestrians,
particularly kids, to try to hurry across the street in a race
against time.</TE>
<TE>   "But this is different from what we've seen before," Coccola said.
"If Firestone wants to show it to us, we would be willing to take a
look at it."</TE>
<TE>   Firestone got the idea for his invention when he was almost hit by
a car near his home in the summer of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He knows the "Walk" signal at that corner blinks 12 times before
turning to "Don't Walk," but on that particular day he was distracted
by a friend, lost count and was forced to scurry across the street to
avoid a fast-moving car.</TE>
<TE>   With assistance from his brother, Jack, a retired electrical
engineer, and Kevin McKeown, a security expert and the author of the
upcoming book "Patent Secrets for Inventors," Firestone researched
his idea and applied for a patent. He was surprised when it was
granted.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling was, 'How could someone not have come up with this
years ago?'" Firestone remembered.</TE>
<TE>   The new inventor has a background in education, not pedestrian
safety.</TE>
<TE>   Firestone said his brush with fatality made him slow down long
enough to realize that as much as he gave of himself as an educator,
maybe he could help others in a much different way.</TE>
<TE>   "Safety is just as important as education," he said.</TE>

<DH>Women's football leagues try to capitalize on the
popularity of female athletics and bruising sport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The eleven starting players for the California Quake are huddled
around their coach. "We're gonna have some fun tonight, ladies," he
tells them. "Now get in there and hit, hit, hit!" The women, in full
pads and gear, rush onto the football field, eager to knock helmets,
crunch body armor and tackle anything that moves on enemy lines.</LD>
<LD>   "Get her!" Kelli Harris yells from the sidelines during a game
against the Arizona Caliente. She plays strong safety for the Quake:
"Anybody that makes it through the line, I pick 'em up, take 'em
out."</LD>
<LD>   Harris, a 28-year-old mother of three who wears makeup even in
uniform, is about the last person you'd expect to see waiting to bust
someone's chops after she's let loose on the field. But she and
thousands of other women across the country are turning to this
traditionally testosterone-fueled sport for the love of the game, the
athleticism and the camaraderie.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a lot of fun being able to go out there and hit people,"
Harris said. "It's the one place where it's legal."</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the Women's American Football League--smashmouth
football, girl-style. One of two competing leagues attempting to form
national conferences of professional female players, the WAFL is the
only one with a Western division. The league, launched last fall, had
playoffs two weekends ago in Long Beach and will conclude its season
this afternoon with the Women's World Bowl at San Diego's Balboa
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   It is unknown whether the WAFL or its off-season counterpart, the
National Women's Football League, will succeed. Women's tackle
football has a long and unsuccessful history that dates back to the
mid-1960s, when a Cleveland talent agent started a semipro league as
a "gimmick." Succeeding decades have seen various leagues come and
go. All have fallen prey to lack of interest and insufficient
funding. But today's league founders are banking on America's passion
for football and an increasing interest in women's athletics in the
hopes that, finally, the time may be right.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that the players want, the fans are asking for,
that has a niche in American sports," said WAFL founder Carter
Turner, 49.</TE>
<TE>   Turner, of Daytona Beach, Fla., helped found the now-defunct
Women's Professional Football League in 1999. That lasted a single
season before management and funding disputes resulted in its
failure, prompting him to start the WAFL on his own in 2000. The WAFL
has 17 teams, six in California--including the Oakland Banshees,
Sacramento Sirens, Los Angeles Lasers, San Francisco Tsunami, San
Diego Sunfire and the Long Beach-based California Quake.</TE>
<TE>   Franchises cost $20,000 and are privately owned. Though they are
set up as profit-sharing agreements between the coaches and players,
no one is making any money, at least not yet. Attendance is still
low; sponsorships and TV coverage elusive.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 3,000 women playing football now who weren't three
years ago, Turner estimates--women for whom playing tackle football
has been a lifelong dream. Women such as Mary Margaret Montgomery, a
33-year-old physical therapist with a Southern accent, a quick wit
and one mean throwing arm. A quarterback for the Quake, her teammates
call her Sister Mary Margaret, even though she is neither Catholic
nor a nun. Then there's Sharron Sanchez, a 41-year-old freelance
sound engineer who, on any given Sunday, is parked on her couch tuned
to the games on TV, and, during the week, runs full-field sprints in
anticipation of her next touchdown as a Quake wide receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Like many women who now play the full-contact version of the
sport, Montgomery and Sanchez used to play flag football. But now
that they've tasted grass through their facemasks, they think yanking
a strip of fabric from someone's waistband pales in comparison to a
game in which players are tackled in five-car-pileups. The players
are serious athletes, and they know how to play this game:
Quarterbacks throw the ball in tight spirals; receivers zigzag and
spin into the end zone; and defensive players aren't afraid to mow
down the competition or take a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they take their lumps. In the first play of the Quake
and Caliente game, a player is blocked hard, takes a blow to her
chest and falls in agony to the ground. A few minutes later, another
is tackled 10 feet out of bounds. Then there's A-Train, an SUV of a
woman who is able to knock down pretty much anything in her path.</TE>
<TE>   Some Fans LikeWhat They See</TE>
<TE>   "This is football," says Perry Anzalone, who is in the stands at
Long Beach City College for the playoffs. Wearing a Caliente T-shirt,
and chanting "U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi," he is at the game to
cheer on his niece.</TE>
<TE>   A Raiders fan, the 44-year-old from Ceres, Calif., was a skeptic
when he went to his first women's game last year. Now he's a
believer. NFL die-hards, he says, "don't know what they're missing.</TE>
<TE>   "When they have receivers catching the ball, which they do, when
they score the kind of points they do, when they're throwing 30- to
40-yard passes, this is football," he adds. "Most people wouldn't
believe it because there's never been a training ground for them."</TE>
<TE>   Very few, if any, high schools and colleges have women's
full-contact football teams. In the absence of such a "feeder
system," most players hail from college teams or clubs, such as
soccer, rugby or powder-puff football. For many, the transition isn't
the physical beating but learning the sport's multitudinous and
complex rules.</TE>
<TE>   With a handful of exceptions, the WAFL and the NWFL adhere to NFL
regulations. They play on the same size field and by the same rules,
although the ball is slightly smaller.</TE>
<TE>   Some players have experienced minor concussions, shoulder
dislocations and knee injuries, but no one has been seriously hurt
playing in the WAFL, Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   Paige Durivage, a Quake wide receiver, has broken both pinkies,
dislocated a shoulder and is almost always black and blue. "I've come
into the office wearing short sleeves and had bruises but didn't know
it. I'm sure my boss is thinking I'm some beaten wife or something,"
says the 28-year-old database administrator who lives in Redondo
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Like the rest of the players, Durivage makes no money from playing
and maintains her own health insurance. The fledgling WAFL is in no
position to pick up the tab. In fact, she covers a lot of expenses
out of pocket. Even though the team bought her uniform, she still
spent about $1,800 this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm on my ninth pair of gloves at $55 a pop. My second pair of
shoes," she says. "They know me at Sport Chalet pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   Her largest expense was travel, she says. Her team charters a bus
for away games, but when given a choice between busing to Portland
for the better part of a day or flying, she and most everyone who can
afford it take to the skies.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of tickets (typically $10) are the primary source of
funding for WAFL teams, but that doesn't amount to much when the
average game draws between 200 and 500 fans. By comparison, the
average NFL game draws about 64,000.</TE>
<TE>   For the playoff game between the Quake and Caliente, only a couple
hundred people are in the stands. The crowd is dwarfed by the
stadium, and the parking lot is all but empty.</TE>
<TE>   The NWFL, based in Nashville, claims to have better attendance
figures. About 5,000 attended its championship game last spring,
according to league founder, Catherine Masters.</TE>
<TE>   A 25-year veteran of the sports industry, Masters started the NWFL
with two teams in December 2000. By 2001, she had 10 teams. Today,
there are 22 in five divisions--the Northern, Great Lakes, Central,
Mid-Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions. She plans to launch a West Coast
division in 2003. Unlike the WAFL, Masters' league operates April
through July, the off-season for men's football, when there is less
competition for an audience.</TE>
<TE>   "A new sport for women needs an environment where there's a lot of
attention to put on them," said Masters, 57. "In the fall for
football, let's face it, it's college, it's pros, it's high school.
It's everything but women's."</TE>
<TE>   Building a Fan Base From the Ground Up</TE>
<TE>   Even though women's sports are more popular than they've ever
been, and football extremely popular, women's professional football
has a lot working against it. Independently owned, the leagues are
operated on shoestring budgets. Without television coverage or
big-name sponsors, they are relying on word of mouth to build an
audience.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike soccer and basketball, it does not benefit from a built-in
fan base of girls who play the sport. And unlike the WNBA, which has
the NBA's backing, or the WUSA, which used the publicity from its
1999 World Cup victory as a launching pad, women's professional
football is on its own.</TE>
<TE>   Where the WNBA has benefited from LA Sparks center Lisa Leslie's
double life as a model, and women's volleyball has benefited from the
olive-skinned and doe-eyed amazon Gabrielle Reece, it is hard to
trade on female sex appeal with football. Being covered head to toe
in shoulder, hip and knee pads makes for an interesting figure, but
it isn't one that jibes with traditional notions of female
attractiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Any way you slice it, football is a body-busting gruntfest. It is
brutal.</TE>
<TE>   And the women who play it are seen as masculine, even though the
builds of the players vary widely--from those with the soft features
and grace of a ballerina to those with bodies like bulldozers.
Durivage, a wide receiver with the Quake, knows football is a
masculine sport. Still, she said she was surprised when a date told
her he was intimidated that she played the game. "It was the first
time I even thought a man would be.... If anything, I think men think
we're a joke. Women hitting, they think it's a cat fight. It's not.
Women come out with concussions."</TE>
<TE>   NFL Watching, Waiting Before Backing Women</TE>
<TE>   With women increasingly participating in other hard-hitting,
male-associated sports, it could be that women's football will soon
have its day. Ice hockey, a sport that is as well known for its
bloodlust as its players' talent, is an Olympic event for women. And
last year, the second-generation female progeny of boxing legends Joe
Frazier and Muhammad Ali went one-on-one in the ring in a
well-publicized prizefight.</TE>
<TE>   The only reason previous attempts at launching a women's
full-contact league have failed, Masters says, is because "women
athletes weren't real popular. Women's sports in general weren't as
accepted as they are now. Now it's the hot thing--finally."</TE>
<TE>   The NFL also sees promise in women's play and has been following
the various leagues since they began. Even so, the NFL is "not
prepared to commit either financial or personnel resources to the
organizations at this time," said spokesman Brian McCarthy. "We need
to see stability that would enable us to step in in some manner."</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't say when that might happen, only that it won't be this
year or next.</TE>
<TE>   "It will take time to develop a mass audience for these female
football players," he said. "However, we believe that the game
itself, the game of football, is so strong that it would be able to
help generate interest."</TE>
<TE>   Going into the final quarter of the playoff game, the Quake is
holding a lead and the crowd is going wild. In the stands, Caliente
fans scream and hold up cardboard signs that read, "Break the Quake!"
while some Long Beach fans shake their white and purple pompoms and
others wear T-shirts with the team slogan: "Did you feel that?"</TE>
<TE>   Leading 16-12 with 5 seconds left, the Quake's players and fans
yell the countdown. When time expires and its victory is certain, the
team bursts into screams hugging one another while the fans stream
out of the bleachers and onto the field, the stadium rock of Queen's
"We Will Rock You" blaring behind them.</TE>
<TE>   Today the Quake will find out if it has what it takes to win the
WAFL's first championship. The team kicks off against the
Jacksonville (Fla.) Dixie Blues at 3 p.m.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>For the last five months, I've never stopped thinking about it. Now
and then in my sleep, I'll wake up dreaming about being there,
reporting atop the rubble of the World Trade Center, sometimes
swallowed by it. Or, while walking my dog, I'll panic at the sound of
an airplane, look up and watch it fade into the clouds. I never saw a
therapist, never consulted a counselor. I didn't even discuss my
feelings with my mom.</LD>
<LD>   So when I returned to the city last week, I deliberately avoided
the site. Yet on my last night, I found myself meandering the streets
around ground zero instead of watching a Broadway show.</LD>
<LD>   At the exact spot on Church Street where all I encountered was
confusion and utter destruction on the night of Sept. 11, now there
are tourists posing for photographs against a blank backdrop where
the towers once stood. It strikes me as disrespectful. And when I
hear a teenager in a group whining about how she's bored and hungry
and cold, I just want to shake her and tell her to grow up.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, I walk away, crying until I find a quiet spot against a
wall facing the gouged area and let go of my anger. Then suddenly I
realize why I have returned--to resolve an overwhelming sense of
helplessness that I felt back then when all I could do was report
about the scene.</TE>
<TE>   The night before the attacks, my colleague, Booth Moore, and I
attended a lavish party at Pier 54 with the rest of the fashion pack,
guests of designer Marc Jacobs. We sipped wine, ate finger food,
spoke with Christy Turlington, met Hilary Swank and were awed by
Deborah Harry. Later, we left with a goody bag filled with samples of
a new perfume and body lotion.</TE>
<TE>   By midmorning the next day we roamed the city on foot, trying to
figure out how to get into hospitals and the morgue. By midnight, we
stood near the toppled towers, phoning in details of the ravaged
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   The next night, we were in the middle of the devastation at what
became known as the Pit, watching the firefighters, police and
volunteers as they gently sifted through concrete and metal
debris--and body parts.</TE>
<TE>   This was where we spent the next four nights, from dusk to
sunrise, reporting on the recovery efforts, and like so many others,
barely comprehending what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   Now as I walk, certain images flash back: A sidewalk fruit
vendor's scale filled with strawberries that measured exactly 1
pound, each covered in thick white ash, looking as if they had been
dipped in white chocolate. Another cart with a plexiglass box on top
had two stacks of 25 bagels inside. I had counted them and was struck
how two concrete and steel towers were gone and here stood two stacks
of baked goods, untouched, unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   I remember Jason Rodriguez, a 30-year-old highway construction
worker who headed for Manhattan to help after he saw flames spewing
from the towers while on a job miles away. He used to come to the
World Trade Center as a bicycle messenger, and now, for 18 hours, was
pulling pieces of bodies from the site. I offered him some water
after he collapsed to his knees and sobbed. I told him I was a
reporter and I'd get him to a first-aid station. Instead, he offered
to take me to where he found a woman folded in half.</TE>
<TE>   "It was right here," he said, standing where he made the grisly
discovery. In other spots, he said he found an ear, a foot, a scalp
with hair. Amid the debris he noticed a fabric patch that looked like
the back pocket of someone's pants. With his own pocketknife, he cut
through the fabric and pulled out a billfold that he gave to
investigators. They attached it to a body bag containing remains.</TE>
<TE>   I scribbled notes on my hand and palm and arm, afraid to pull out
a reporter's notebook as Rodriguez walked me through a long, dark
corridor inside the World Financial Center, a building next to the
twin towers that was partially destroyed. The few dangling bulbs cast
shadows of men and women in protective jumpsuits and gear that made
them look otherworldly. No one spoke. They were too busy and too
tired. Outside, we walked past boxes stacked against a dust-covered
glass wall, finger scribbled with "Body Bags."</TE>
<TE>   Those horrific recollections overshadow what I see now on Church
Street. There's a marker, the size of a movie poster, that reads:</TE>
<TE>   "What has 200 elevators, 1,200 restrooms, 40,000 doorknobs,
200,000 lighting fixtures, 7 million square feet of acoustical tile
ceiling, more structural steel than the Verrazano Narrows Bridge--and
was built for a final cost of one billion 1970s dollars? That's
right, the World Trade Center."  A woman and two men from Arizona ask
if I'd take three photos: one of them next to the marker, another in
front of ground zero with the cranes in the background, and finally,
one that shows a building with blown-out windows.</TE>
<TE>   Then the trio gather over a manhole cover to warm themselves with
the billowing steam as they peer through barricades to watch the
excavation because the viewing platform is closed. Other Church
Street visitors seem disappointed that they can't get a better view,
so they tippy-toe and jump and lean over barricades with a curiosity
that reminds me of motorists rubbernecking a wreck.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere bothers me, taking me back to the chatter of a
fashion crowd earlier in the week. The group was organizing a trip to
the site--followed by dinner. Just as disappointing was the
conversation of some other fashion insiders trying to schedule the
next round of shows around the Sept. 11 anniversary. They mention
nothing about a commemoration but settle on a possible plan: staging
men's shows two days before and starting the women's on the 12th.
Sounds good, they agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "More wine, anyone?" someone asked.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing that angered me and made me feel very alone. I decided
then I had to return to the site.</TE>
<TE>   The first thing I see: two intersecting steel girders that have
become known as the Cross at Ground Zero.</TE>
<TE>   While walking I find solace at a sidewalk memorial for the dead
and missing strewn with fresh and dried flowers. Candles flicker
illuminating posters, photographs and remembrances. I stop to read a
modest notebook filled with condolences from around the world,
several written in foreign languages. I add my own with a pen tied to
a music stand holding the book.</TE>
<TE>   I touch T-shirts and jackets with names on them. For an hour I
read prayer cards left on makeshift altars and messages that covered
the wall and others taped onto police barricades. "You will always be
remembered," one says, "never forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the fliers are so crisp and new--as if they have just been
printed and placed there by family and friends who believe their
loved ones are missing, not dead. They remind me of the family of
William Valcarcel, who was on the 87th floor of one of the towers.
His daughter, Melissa, invited me to her parents' home because she
believed her father was alive five days after the attack. She wanted
him home back in the Bronx to complete the family photo gallery he
was compiling on the refrigerator door.</TE>
<TE>   It was the last story I reported from here in September. Last
month, Valcarcel was moved from the missing list to the "reported
dead" category.</TE>

<HD>On Warming, Bush Is Out of Step</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KATHERINE ELLISON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>STANFORD</DL>
<LD>By the looks of his global warming plan released Feb. 14, President
Bush thinks climate change is nothing to worry much about--at least
not until long after he leaves office.</LD>
<LD>   While much of the rest of the world continues to work toward
ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 agreement mandating an average
5.2% reduction of greenhouse gases over 1990 levels by the year 2012,
Bush has outlined voluntary incentives and tax breaks he "hopes" may
slow the increase. Rather than calling for actual reductions in
gases, Bush is focusing on reducing "greenhouse gas intensity"--the
volume of emissions divided by economic output. If that fails to do
the job by 2012, he'd support a reassessment then. "I will not commit
our nation to an unsound international treaty that will throw
millions of our citizens out of work," Bush said.</LD>
<TE>   What he doesn't seem to grasp is that, throughout the country, an
increasing number of Americans want the treaty--or at least its more
immediate, limit-setting approach. They don't buy the president's
contention that curbing greenhouse gases would wreak economic chaos,
and they believe scientists' warnings that the buildup of greenhouse
gases in our atmosphere brings risks of increasing droughts,
dangerous storms, floods and disease. Their concerns have sparked a
new movement that may soon leave our president in the dust. Across
the country, in city halls, at corporate offices and on college
campuses, people are going ahead with plans of their own to limit
emissions of carbon dioxide, the main contributor to climate change.</TE>
<TE>   To date, 116 cities and counties, including such unlikely
candidates for environmental radicalism as Toledo, Ohio and Decatur,
Ga., have pledged to cut their carbon-dioxide emissions. Some,
including Seattle and Salt Lake City, have set targets well beyond
those outlined in the Kyoto Protocol. Several local governments have
already taken decisive actions toward this goal, investing in
conservation, public transportation and alternative fuels. In San
Francisco last November, voters overwhelmingly approved a
$100-million revenue-bond measure promoting solar and wind power.
Boston, meanwhile, plans to convert its bus fleet to hybrid vehicles
and eventually to fuel-cell power.</TE>
<TE>   Equally dramatic are actions by several large U.S. corporations,
whose CEOs have shown that capping carbon-dioxide emissions as soon
as possible is hardly a fringe concern. (After all, no less radical a
group than the World Economic Forum has called global warming the
greatest challenge we face.) DuPont has pledged to slash emissions by
65% over 1990 levels by 2010 and claims it has already gotten more
than halfway toward that goal while improving its energy efficiency.
BP Amoco has committed to a 10% reduction by 2010, and Royal
Dutch/Shell Group hopes to meet a similar target next year.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of college campuses are on the same course, completing
greenhouse-gas inventories and, in some cases, sharply cutting
fossil-fuel consumption. Several campuses have managed to reduce
carbon emissions even as they've used more energy by investing in
more efficient heating, lighting and air-conditioning systems that
eventually pay for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The campus movement began in earnest in 1999, when Tufts
University President John DiBiaggio pledged the university would
start working immediately to meet the Kyoto target. Since then,
enthusiasm has caught on. Early this month, students at Lewis and
Clark College voted to tax themselves an extra $10 per year to fund
programs to achieve Kyoto compliance. The "offsets" would pay for
carbon-cutting measures off campus, such as installing fluorescent
lights in local homes.</TE>
<TE>   State governments have also been moving forward. New Jersey has
pledged to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 3.5% below 1990
levels by 2005. Last August, the governors of six New England states
and premiers of seven Eastern Canadian provinces agreed to roll back
emissions by 25% by 2012.</TE>
<TE>   Capitol Hill, too, seems much more concerned about global warming
than the Oval Office. Last year, a climate-change caucus was formed
in the House of Representatives that now includes more than 70
members of both political parties. And there are now more than 60
legislative proposals on global warming, encompassing everything from
reducing CO2 emissions from power plants to paying farmers to
cultivate plants that sequester greenhouse gases to--just
imagine--actually developing a national strategy with the goal of
stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level
safe for continued human life.</TE>
<TE>   A weekend before Bush announced his plan, I was in Portland, Ore.,
attending an unprecedented organizing conference for students
committed to confronting climate change. The nearly 90 participants
had flown in from all over the country, with backpacks and sleeping
bags, to trade information on how to catalog their campuses'
greenhouse-gas emissions and get their college administrations to
start cutting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the making of a movement," said Charlene Garland, associate
director of the nonprofit group Clean Air-Cool Planet, which is
trying to accelerate the trend by offering logistical help to
communities, campuses and corporations. "People aren't waiting for
government leadership, but are moving ahead because they know the
problem is real."</TE>
<TE>   For the students I spoke with, the problem is also painfully
personal. That's because they can imagine some serious effects of
climate change by the time they reach the average politician's
age--not least of which may be increasingly potent resentment of the
United States, as less-developed nations suffer the brunt of the
initial effects, and the world finds itself awash in environmental
refugees. They also take seriously predictions of a generally
worsening quality of life, as U.S. coastlines are threatened and more
species become extinct.</TE>
<TE>   So much for Bush's rationale when he backed out of Kyoto, that
"first things first are the people who live in America." With past
controversies over the science of climate change rapidly fading away,
many Americans have come to appreciate the ways in which this looming
threat could strike close to home.</TE>
<TE>   Grass-roots action can help to raise awareness of these problems,
but it's not nearly enough to meet the challenge we face as a nation
and a species. Scientists tell us that just to stabilize the
greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere, and halt the warming
trend, we must eventually reduce our emissions by at least 70%.
That's a serious international task, requiring a courageous leader in
the White House--a far cry from the fair-weather friend we have now.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>We will soon see whether prosecutors have a strong case against four
former members of the Symbionese Liberation Army who were arrested
last month and charged with a 1975 murder and bank robbery in a
Sacramento suburb. Perhaps the evidence has gone stale after nearly
27 years, and the prosecution is simply availing itself of a
terrorism-averse political climate. But it's a safe bet that many
will mislabel the case and tell us that a generation of activists is
going on trial.</LD>
<LD>   A few on the left will agree with some on the right that the
prosecution of the SLA "soldiers" for the murder of Myrna Opsahl, who
was counting church dues in the Crocker National Bank, is really a
prosecution of the left as a whole. These sentimentalists will
halfheartedly acknowledge that the SLA's tactics were extreme, but
contend that its members' hearts were more or less in the right
place, that they thus deserve the sympathy of those who peopled the
radical movements of the 1960s and '70s. This quarter-truth matches
the right's attempt to turn the SLA into poster monsters for
left-wing politics of every stripe.</LD>
<TE>   But tenderness must be tempered by recognition of the sheer
senselessness--and worse--of the SLA, whose obscurantism
("Symbionese"), vagueness ("liberation") and chutzpah ("army") were
of a piece with the vileness of their tactics. The group was the
offspring of the fantasy that black prisoners were the vanguard of a
coming revolution. This was a not uncommon delusion in the early
'70s, as remnants of the civil rights movement were midway toward
becoming a mainstream political force, and yet some militants were
still entranced with revolutionary fantasies.</TE>
<TE>   Having missed the high tide of militancy, the SLA did not even try
to convince large numbers of cadres that its way was the right way.
Language for its soldiers was like a secret handshake--meant to boost
morale. A few recruits would do, as long as they had guns and were
ready to use them. Accordingly, the SLA members were stupefyingly
incoherent. With no detectable grasp of political ideas, they spoke
in self-parodying claptrap ("Death to the fascist insect that preys
upon the life of the people"). This is the way people talk when they
have no real following or any serious intention of organizing one.</TE>
<TE>   It was only the SLA's actions that made its words worthy of
notice. Its soldiers embraced a lunatic theory: They could make their
actions mean whatever they said by simply declaring they had big
ideas and daring anyone to disagree with them. Not for them the moral
requirement of making a reasonable case that their means might
conceivably lead to desirable ends.</TE>
<TE>   The SLA announced its existence by taking credit for the murder of
Marcus Foster, Oakland's first black superintendent of schools,
claiming that he was working with the police to violate the rights of
children by requiring them to carry identification. Having landed
with a bang at the outer edge of the political map, the SLA then took
a shortcut to greater glory. In 1974, they kidnapped newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst, which guaranteed that the group's slapstick
tragedy would have marquee value--all the more so when, in a
soap-operatic turnabout, she joined the SLA's cartoon revolution.</TE>
<TE>   From then on, bank robberies seemed logical. So did shootouts.
Inevitably, the SLA's surrealist adventure collapsed. Nothing was
left behind but some headlines and Paul Schrader's unrevealing movie.
Roy Lichtenstein should only have painted Field Marshal Cinque,
Hearst, Bill and Emily Harris and the rest of the gang.</TE>
<TE>   So, what do SLA soldiers represent? Gangsters pretending to
politics. Specifically, they celebrated the romance of some white
radicals for some black prisoners--the tougher and more audacious,
the better. The Symbionese Liberation Army did operate in a
tradition, though it was not the main tradition of the New Left of
the 1960s and early 1970s. Even after nonviolence wore thin, most
movement violence was spasmodic, impulsive and targeted on
property--smashing a window during an antiwar demonstration or
torching your neighborhood. This was usually stupid, but it was, in
some sense, sane.</TE>
<TE>   The Black Panther Party took the destructive mood further. Their
shootouts with the police were criminal and indefensible, episodes of
a "war" they could not come close to winning. But you could say the
Black Panthers had some legitimacy, insofar as they reflected the
ferocity of the ghetto. They had a sizable following and produced
some effective leaders once they overcame their romance with
violence. Still, the Panthers had been resoundingly defeated by the
police by the time the SLA came along, cold-bloodedly murderous, to
dress up as an army and claim to act in the name of the oppressed.</TE>
<TE>   Former Black Panther Chairman and co-founder Bobby Seale has been
quoted as saying, "The SLA was a clear government setup to discredit
the positive revolutionary movement we were leading." This is fantasy
upon fantasy. As for Seale's "positive revolutionary movement," Hugh
Pearson, in "The Shadow of the Panther," amassed much evidence that
Panthers' co-founder Huey Newton was far from a "positive" fellow. To
blame the government for the likes of the SLA in order to protect a
glamorous Panther myth is staggering cluelessness.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, there were never more than a score of SLA's "soldiers."
But a little ugliness can smear a good deal of beauty. Like the Latin
American urban guerrillas from whom the SLA and other such gangs took
inspiration, the soldiers predictably drew down the wrath of the
armed state and left nothing behind but the blood of their victims
and of themselves. In its farcical, nightmarish way, the SLA helped
inter the dreams of a decade. Whatever our political persuasion, it
is worth remembering for two reasons: to remind us that murder,
however adorned, is murder, and to remind us that whoever professes
politics is also required to make sense.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>I first met Pat Buchanan almost 33 years ago, though I can't say I
remember him--I was 8 days old. My dad's great friend, Victor Lasky,
the late, great conservative muckraker, brought Buchanan to attend my
bris (the Jewish celebration that brilliantly marries ritual
circumcision and smoked fish on a bagel). Lasky introduced the future
three-time presidential candidate to my Dad: "This is Pat Buchanan,
he's a terrific redbaiter." Since my family's apartment on the Upper
West Side of Manhattan was, for political conservatives, what the
catacombs were for Christians in ancient Rome--sanctuary from the
pagan authorities--it was probably the only place north of Lincoln
Center that someone could be called a "terrific redbaiter" and it
would be both offered and received as a high compliment.</LD>
<LD>   The reds are gone for the most part, thank God. But Buchanan
remains a great baiter. Now, though, rather than attack the manifest
evil of international communism and its sympathizers here at home,
Buchanan finds himself arguing about demographics and what
immigration is doing to American (read Anglo-American) culture. It is
a debate that has marginalized Buchanan and those in his orbit. But
far more disturbing, it has marginalized the entire debate about
immigration at the exact moment that the issue needs all the
intelligent discussion it can get.</LD>
<TE>   At a time when Latinos make up 13% of American citizens, 28
million Americans are foreign-born and tens of millions of Americans
are the children or grandchildren of immigrant-success stories, it
hardly seems constructive to declare that immigrants, in general, and
Mexicans in particular are "enemies" and "invaders" who threaten
Western civilization. Rather, a constructive discussion might simply
focus on the idea that we want immigrants--no matter where they come
from--to become assimilated Americans, not aliens in our midst, and
that maybe our current policies at home and on the border are not
promoting that effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we get Buchanan and his new book "The Death of the West,"
which warns hysterically that the white race is becoming an
"endangered species," about to be swallowed up by the duskier Third
World (defined as all nonwhites no matter how rich, educated or
democratic). We get Peter Brimelow, a once-respected conservative
voice who now runs the shrill anti-immigration website VDARE.com,
named for Virginia Dare, the first British child born in North
America. We get syndicated columnist Samuel Francis (widely
considered Buchanan's personal ideologist of choice) who has argued
earnestly for "imposing adequate fertility controls on nonwhites."
These are not stupid men--indeed, they are extremely talented
individuals--but they have become dismayingly obsessed in recent
years with creating, to borrow a phrase from my colleague at the
National Review, Ramesh Ponnuru, an "identity politics for white
people."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than focusing on how to create a rational immigration
policy that recognizes the permanence of America's ethnic diversity,
they live in denial about how to get back to the days when America
was 90% white. Buchanan even seems to imply in his book that Russian
ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky wasn't totally off his
rocker when he introduced a bill in the Duma denying Russian women
the right to leave the country and permitting ethnic Russian men to
marry up to five wives.</TE>
<TE>   Hiding out in their bunkers on the web and in the pages of a few
obscure publications, these unhappy paleoconservatives and
neo-nativists have rallied the troops under a single flag: white
supremacy. No, they aren't Klansmen or skinheads, and, no, they won't
like that label. But they are very serious about keeping America a
white country because, in their view, white people, on the whole,
make better Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Take Brimelow's VDARE.com, which features--pardon the
expression--a Chinese menu of white-pride dishes. Some authors
concentrate on genetic questions, others focus almost entirely on
cultural arguments, but pretty much everyone agrees that immigration
spells the doom of America (some even claim that all immigration
after 1865 was bad for the Republic).</TE>
<TE>   Francis, whose writings Buchanan borrows from heavily, once
declared at a conference, "The civilization that we as whites created
in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic
endowments of the creating people."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the emphasis is on race or culture, this sort of thinking
is hardly new. Racial doom-and-gloom ideologies have a long history
on the right (and on the left--the founder of Planned Parenthood, for
example, Margaret Sanger, was a repugnant racist and eugenicist). In
many respects, the intellectual antecedent of Buchanan's "The Death
of the West" is Oswald Spengler's classic "The Decline of the West."
Spengler, too, worried that the darker peoples would overtake Europe
and topple the white man as the ruler of the world. Spengler also
worried that the introduction of nonwhites and their culture into
Western civilization was a cancer. World War II and the Cold War
shrank the tumor of this sort of thinking on the right, but it didn't
excise it.</TE>
<TE>   So, why this latest round? You could point to a lot of things, but
the most important is that it is a response to the left. Seriously.
As the left has sunk ever deeper into multicultural absurdity, many
white folks have come to buy into the tribal logic of Afrocentrists,
feminists, La Raza fanatics and the like. Perhaps the most recurring
theme of resentment on the racial right goes like this: "If
Afrocentrism is great, if Asian pride is great, if Hispanics can
champion la raza (the race), then how come a preference for
Eurocentrism, white pride and the white race is evil?"</TE>
<TE>   When hearing a case about a more qualified white law student being
denied a slot in favor of a black, U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall noted, "You guys have been discriminating for
years. Now it's our turn." Well, if we're just taking turns, then
maybe it's our turn again, reason lots of disgruntled, fed-up but
perfectly decent white folks. Yes, the writings of the
anti-immigration right are a bonfire of fear and hyperbole. But the
multiculturalists provide kindling at every turn. The resulting
conflagration draws attention away from what's really important.</TE>
<TE>   Such as asking what unprecedented levels of immigration--both
legal and illegal--do to a culture uncomfortable with demanding
assimilation. Or the simple fact that illegal immigration is, well,
illegal. No matter what approach you favor, if you aren't against
illegal immigration, you have no policy at all. And, needless to say,
no American should start his new life here as a criminal: It breeds
contempt for both the law and the lawbreaker and undermines
assimilation terribly. Also, simply as a matter of foreign policy, we
need to respond to the fact that the president of Mexico is
developing political constituencies on both sides of the border to
influence politics on both sides of the border. This would be
troubling if Mexico were as white as Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to the basic issue: Race isn't the point, so
drop it. Now.</TE>

<HD>The Great GOP Hope: Independents?</HD>

<LD>The race for the Republican gubernatorial nomination is tightening,
and "independent voter strategy" has become the political buzz. Can
voters who decline to state a party preference affect the outcome of
the GOP primary on March 5, and possibly rescue the party from
near-permanent minority status? Where will independents land in
November?</LD>
<LD>   In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down California's "blanket
primary," an electoral free-for-all in which voters, regardless of
party affiliation, could hop around the ballot to select any party's
nominee for any office. A new law created the modified closed
primary, in which decline-to-state voters, usually labeled
independents, can vote in the primary of one, but only one, of the
parties that have agreed to let them participate.</LD>
<LD>   The blanket primaries in 1998 and 2000 taught us that
independents, like most California voters, gravitate toward the fight
that counts. UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain further
analyzed their voting behavior and found they also tend to vote for
moderates and popular incumbents.</LD>
<TE>   According to a recent survey by the nonpartisan Public Policy
Institute of California (PPIC), the governor's race has begun to
generate interest among Independent/Other voters, defined in the
survey as "likely voters ... not affiliated with a major party."
Fifty percent indicated they planned to vote in the March 5 primary,
up 16% over the last two months.</TE>
<TE>   Wooing independent voters is a key element of the campaign
strategy of moderate Richard Riordan, running hard against two
conservative opponents for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.
The former L.A. mayor contends that if the California GOP doesn't
reach out beyond its conservative base, the party will "turn from an
endangered species into an extinct species."</TE>
<TE>   The PPIC survey indicates that Riordan's message may be producing
results. He draws 36% of the independent vote, compared with 23% for
political newcomer financier Bill Simon and 13% for Secretary of
State Bill Jones. Furthermore, Riordan's currently running
neck-and-neck or better with Gov. Gray Davis and could give the
unpopular incumbent the fight of his life in November.</TE>
<TE>   But other survey numbers offer less encouragement to Riordan.
California's independents look more like closet Democrats than
budding Republicans and, for the March primary, they appear to be
moving toward Democratic contests, lured perhaps by the prospect of
making a difference in down-ballot races.</TE>
<TE>   Ideologically, 40% of independents call themselves very or
somewhat liberal, compared with 48% of Democrats and only 8% of
Republicans, according to the PPIC survey. Conversely, only 5% of
independents and 3% of Democrats say they're very conservative,
compared with 22% of Republicans. A greater percentage (37%) label
themselves "middle of the road" than do either Democratic (31%) or
Republican (28%) likely voters.</TE>
<TE>   On social issues, independents tend to mirror the Democratic
electorate, with one glaring exception: guns. For example, seven out
of 10 Californians believe that "government should not interfere with
a woman's access to abortion." Roughly eight of 10 Democratic and
independent likely voters agree, as compared with 54% of Republicans.
Similarly, independents are closer to Democrats on environmental
protection, gay rights and public services for illegal immigrants.
But independents (58%) are closer to Republicans (70%) in their
opposition to new gun-control laws, and that won't help Riordan in
the primary.</TE>
<TE>   Independents are split over whether they'll vote in the GOP (23%)
or the Democratic (27%) primary. But as the election draws closer,
the interest in mixing it up on the Democratic side is increasing (up
16% since last December), while interest in the GOP race remains
unchanged. Given the centrist tilt of independents, Riordan will miss
those potential primary votes.</TE>
<TE>   The draw of independents to an uncontested Democratic
gubernatorial primary seems counterintuitive, until you look
down-ballot to the legislative and congressional contests.</TE>
<TE>   Reapportionment created virtually safe seats for the two major
parties, which means the real battles are in the primaries, and
California Journal counted only 33 meaningful races in 153
legislative and congressional districts. Within those contests, it
appears Democrats have more of the electoral action--24 competitive
primaries, compared with 17 for the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   If too few independent voters participate in the GOP primary to
have an impact, they can become a potent wild card in the November
race. In general election match-ups, the PPIC survey shows Riordan
and Davis splitting the independent vote, while Davis beats both
Jones and Simon by at least a 12-point margin. That's a daunting
obstacle for Republicans. Democrats account for 45% of the state's
registered voters, while Republicans are only 35%. To win, Davis
doesn't need the bulk of independents (14.5% of the electorate) if he
holds his Democratic base. A Republican, on the other hand, not only
has to motivate his party's faithful, but also must sway most
independents and some disaffected Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   For Riordan, holding the party faithful could prove quite
difficult. That is the danger in his strategy of aiming his primary
message at the general electorate. He not only risks losing GOP
conservatives in March, he also risks de-energizing, or disaffecting,
the base, and suppressing GOP turnout in November.</TE>
<TE>   A foreshadowing of that scenario occurred at the recent California
Republican Party convention, where Riordan encountered downright
hostility at times. Former Gov. George Deukmejian and several former
state party leaders announced they would not support Riordan if he
became the Republican nominee. In other words, if Riordan comes out
of the primary as the party's bloodied and weak standard-bearer, the
GOP may not unite behind him.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent bipartisan dinner that brought together campaign
operatives and media types, an informal poll was taken to predict the
winner of the GOP gubernatorial primary and of the November general
election. Riordan got the primary nod and Davis was tapped for
November. Four years ago, a similar exercise predicted that Dan
Lungren would beat the projected Democratic nominee, political
neophyte Al Checchi, in the general.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I'm worried," said one Davis operative.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans should be more than worried. Independents are not
enough to broaden their base. Conservatives really don't want it
broadened. Moderates are chafing at the GOP's "die-hard
conservatism." And pragmatists anxiously contemplate the fate of
their schizophrenic party come November.</TE>

<HD>A Reagan Echo</HD>
<DH>Bush's version of cowboy diplomacy has our allies reeling,
but the 'axis of evil' is running scared.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM SCHNEIDER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A month ago, President Bush uttered three little words, and they
caused our allies to take the vapors. The words were not, "I love
you."' In his State of the Union speech Jan. 29, Bush condemned Iran,
Iraq and North Korea, saying, "States like these, and their terrorist
allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of
the world." My goodness, look at the response.</LD>
<LD>   The French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine called the president's
remarks "simplistic" and "not properly thought through." Chris
Patten, a British Conservative and the European Union's
external-affairs commissioner, warned that the U.S. success in
Afghanistan "reinforced some dangerous instincts ... that the U.S.
can rely only on itself, and that allies may be useful as an optional
extra."</LD>
<LD>   The German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer complained that
"alliance partners are not satellites."</LD>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin observed that, among countries
whose citizens fought with the Taliban and helped finance the enemy,
"Iraq is not on that list."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea erupted in protests during the president's visit last
week. Angry politicians complained that Bush was sacrificing Korea to
his global strategy. One banner on the streets of Seoul read, "Who is
in Axis of Evil? You, Mr. Bush!"</TE>
<TE>   To the allies, Bush's words sounded like cowboy diplomacy. With
good reason. A week after Sept. 11, Bush startled the world when he
said about Osama bin Laden: "There's an old poster out West, as I
recall, that said, 'Wanted: Dead or Alive.'" On Feb. 8, Bush
addressed a roomful of cowboys at the National Cattlemen's Beef Assn.
meeting in Denver. The president said to a forest of 10-gallon hats,
"Either you're with us, or you're against us." On his way to the Far
East last weekend, he told U.S. troops in Alaska, "I view this
current conflict as either us versus them [or] evil versus good. And
there is no in between." It's the black hats and the white hats--just
like in the cowboy movies.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is not the first cowboy president. Ronald Reagan was also
fond of 10-gallon hats. Remember when Reagan threatened tax raisers
by saying, "Go ahead--make my day"? That's cowboy talk, even if the
line came from "Dirty Harry," Clint Eastwood's urban vigilante movie.</TE>
<TE>   During Reagan's first year in office, his tough talk and military
build-up frightened so many people that a spontaneous nuclear-freeze
movement broke out all over Europe. The allies were shocked by
Reagan's "evil empire" speech to the British House of Commons in
mid-1982, when he denounced the Soviet Union as a tyranny, relegated
Marxism-Leninism to "the ash heap of history" and asked, "Must
freedom wither--in a quiet, deadening accommodation with totalitarian
evil?"</TE>
<TE>   Reagan's policy was, "Talk tough, and carry a big stick." In the
end, it worked. The evil empire crumbled. Europeans scoffed in 1987,
when Reagan stood at the Berlin Wall and said, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear
down this wall!" But two years later, the wall came down.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's policy is the same as Reagan's--tough talk and a huge
military build-up. He does not share former President Bill Clinton's
ambitions. Clinton wanted to be known as a peacemaker. Bush is a war
leader, a self-described "crusader for justice" against evil and
tyranny. "Our cause is just, our cause is noble, and we will defeat
the forces of terror," the president told the troops in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton was loved and admired overseas. Reagan was respected
abroad, but not especially loved or admired. Bush is a Reaganite, not
a Clintonian, by temperament. He has no need to bask in the love and
admiration of people around the world. But he does want to be
respected. Which means his policies have to meet the same test as
Reagan's: They have to work.</TE>
<TE>   Critics argue that Bush's cowboy rhetoric is counterproductive. It
undermines reformist forces in countries like Iran. When the U.S.
denounces their country as "evil," moderates have no choice but to
join the hard-liners in denouncing the U.S. They cannot risk being
seen as pro-American. But that's all theatrics, the president's
supporters would argue. What matters are the realities: the tyranny
and corruption of their regimes, and the steadfastness of U.S.
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. allies understand the military realities. The primary reality
being: The U.S. doesn't need them. Afghanistan proved that the U.S.
is perfectly capable of fighting this war on its own--militarily. But
the U.S. does need the cooperation of allies in two other, equally
crucial areas--intelligence and financial sanctions. The U.S. cannot
get information about terrorist networks or cut off their financing
without the cooperation of other countries. Will Bush's blunt
rhetoric cause our allies to go their own way?</TE>
<TE>   Here, too, the Bush administration claims the realities are on our
side. The allies are just as threatened by terrorists as we are. They
are closer to the Middle East and have larger Muslim populations. Are
they going to refuse to cooperate with the U.S. when the reality is,
we're all in this together?</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, Bush's tough policy appears to be working. The
Iranians have been arresting suspected terrorists. The Iraqis have
issued statements saying they are not interested in acquiring weapons
of mass destruction. ("I've heard that before," U.S. Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell said. "We've heard it for 10 years.") The North
Koreans are promising to keep their agreements with respect to
missile development. Our enemies are all acting scared.</TE>
<TE>   So are our allies. They're complaining about Bush's return to a
policy of "unilateralism." What makes them think the U.S. is ready to
go it alone? "The United States, and only the United States, can see
this effort through to victory," Vice President Dick Cheney said Feb.
15.</TE>
<TE>   Well, OK. But wait. Powell can explain. Sure, Bush talks tough.
"What the president said is, 'I'm calling it the way it is,'" Powell
observed last week. "He did it in a very straightforward, direct,
realistic way that tends to, you know, jangle people's nerves." You
bet.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the president's actions--to use his father's
favorite word--tend to be "prudent." Powell added, "Once they settle
down and understand that he is going about this in a prudent,
disciplined, determined way, they realize that's what leadership is
about." Bush was extremely cautious and methodical in Afghanistan. He
resisted a lot of pressure to take impulsive military action after
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I can assure you, he has taken no decision about the use of force
against Iraq," National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said last
week. Powell acknowledged, "With respect to Iran, some good things
have been happening there." Bush himself elaborated his policy
concerning North Korea. "We're a peaceful people," he said in
Panmunjom last week. "We have no intention of invading North Korea.
South Korea has no intention of attacking North Korea." So, Powell
asks a pertinent question: "What unilateral action have we taken that
is causing them to get so upset?"</TE>
<TE>   Talk tough, and carry a big stick. But act with prudence. It's
Reagan diplomacy with a Bush twist--and it's producing results. Just
right for an Ivy League cowboy.</TE>

<DL>OMAHA</DL>
<LD>During my last meeting with Ahmed Shah Masoud, two months before his
assassination, the popular Northern Alliance commander described his
vision for how a post-Taliban Afghanistan should be constructed.
First, he said, a centralized military and administrative
infrastructure would have to be established. A strong center, he
felt, would be crucial in managing the millions of weapons remaining
in the hands of regional warlords and bandits, as well as in
countering the interference by Pakistan and Iran likely to continue
along Afghanistan's periphery. Masoud also endorsed the convening of
a grand assembly, or loya jirga, followed by parliamentary elections
two years later (a process later codified in December's Bonn accord).
He suggested that provincial elections should take place only after
the country had reached a plateau where stability and reconstruction
were well-advanced.</LD>
<TE>   Masoud's idea that a strong center is essential to Afghanistan's
survival seems obvious. Yet, some in Washington and elsewhere argue
that aid should also continue to flow to the warlords operating
around Afghanistan's periphery. A strong centralized government may
be impossible, they warn, destined to be brought down by factionalism
and tribalism. Better, then, to continue U.S. assistance to local
warlords at the same time we offer support to the government of Prime
Minister Hamid Karzai. This approach is doomed to backfire.</TE>
<TE>   It also ignores history. Afghanistan's self-governing structure
evolved internally, over time, and while its institutions developed
some of the flaws common in the Third World--inefficiency, nepotism
and corruption--the regions of Afghanistan nonetheless coalesced as a
country.</TE>
<TE>   For 50 years, ending with the 1979 Soviet invasion, Afghanistan's
centralized military and administrative infrastructure functioned
effectively. In return for resources flowing to the regions from
Kabul, local tribal and clan chiefs provided security in their areas
as well as cooperation with the center. The center-province balance
was buttressed by the Kabul government's respect for local tribal and
clan influence in Afghanistan's outlying regions. Regional leaders
periodically met each other in Kabul as members of parliament, as
participants in loya jirgas and at meetings organized by the central
government. In 1964, a loya jirga approved a constitution. In 1965
and 1969, democratic parliamentary elections were held.</TE>
<TE>   Governors were appointed by the central government to administer
Afghanistan's 29 provinces. To dampen centrifugal tendencies, the
central government generally appointed governors who were not from
the localities they served. The ministries in Kabul assigned
personnel to each province, further enhancing central control. These
representatives implemented beneficial programs in the regions, to
address needs ranging from health and agriculture to finance and
public safety. They reported both to their ministries in the capital
and to the local provincial governor.</TE>
<TE>   It was to this model of successfully functioning governing
institutions that Masoud looked in formulating his ideas for
Afghanistan's post-Taliban reconstruction. And it is to this model
that the international community must now look as well, making
revival and modernization of Afghanistan's pre-war governing
institutions a strategic priority.</TE>
<TE>   This will require an about-face for the United States. In recent
years, we grew used to working with the warlords of outlying areas to
help defeat the Taliban: Now we must encourage the central government
with our bounty, even if it means cutting off former allies. Most of
today's warlords are the same militarists who proved so destructive
and brutal in the chaotic period from 1992 to 1996, when a series of
pitched battles for control culminated in the Taliban's seizure of
power.</TE>
<TE>   These warlords have reestablished themselves in their own areas
over the past four months. And while many currently express support
for the Karzai regime in Kabul, this is likely to change as the
interim regime consolidates its strength. Afghan warlords, like
Mohammed Farah Aidid in Somalia, seek only to amass personal power
and line their pockets. Most, like Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, Kandahar
Gov. Gul Agha Shirzai and dozens of other warlords in eastern
Afghanistan, were previously deep into drug trafficking. Almost all
lack even an elementary school education. Their fighters are usually
illiterate with no prospect for employment except as hired gunmen.
The warlords will happily sell their services to the Americans, the
Pakistani military intelligence, Muslim extremists or all three
simultaneously. But in the end they have allegiance only to
themselves, which is in part why we have had such trouble locating
Osama bin Laden and Taliban leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The onus should remain on the Afghan interim regime to rein in the
warlords and restore stability in Afghanistan. But this will not be
easy. As the recent apparent assassination of the country's aviation
and tourism minister, Adul Rahman, demonstrated, tensions run high,
even within the ruling coalition. Afghanistan's fledgling government
cannot restore order alone. The International Security Assistance
Force (ISAF) must gradually fan out to key Afghan towns, providing
assistance as the interim regime's administrative and military
institutions are reestablished in the regions. The Pentagon should
decisively act on President Bush's stated commitment to help build a
modern Afghan army. And the U.S. and its allies should coordinate
with the regime to buy up warlords' tanks, artillery and rocket
launchers and then help ensure that outside entities do not, as they
have in the past, assist the warlords in restocking their arsenals.</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, it may be politically necessary to appoint
warlords as governors in some regions: Many have considerable support
and are needed as allies of the central regime rather than enemies.
But, as was the rule before the Soviet invasion, a governor should
not be allowed to concurrently serve as regional military commander,
a position that should report directly to the defense ministry in
Kabul rather than to local authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The most efficient way to break up the warlords' militias may well
be to conscript their soldiers, who often don't have other means of
employment, into the new national forces. Before the Soviet invasion,
all Afghan youth entered the military for two years at age 22. After
basic training, some were sent to regular military units around Kabul
or to one of the regional military commands. Thousands were also
assigned to either the civilian ministry of public works or the
ministry of agriculture, to build roads or to carry out large
agricultural projects. Army generals were permanently stationed at
these two ministries, working under the ministers to oversee the
military construction units.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of service worked well before and could serve as the
model for a new, enlarged program. It is cheap. Afghans are familiar
with its administration. Most important, young Afghans would not
become dependent on warlords for their livelihoods--nor would
warlords have as large a supply of young men with whom to build a
fighting force. As in the past, Pushtun conscripts in the south could
be sent to projects in the north; northern Uzbeks, Tajiks and Hazaras
would serve in the south. The program could be a useful tool in
accustoming young people once again to the idea of a multiethnic
nation.</TE>
<TE>   It would be naive to think that a governmental structure destroyed
during 23 years of war can be instantly reconstituted and reformed to
meet the needs of today's Afghanistan. But neither must a new
government be created from scratch. Effective government institutions
will be essential to Afghanistan's continued development when foreign
aid tapers off. Our task, therefore, is to assist Afghanistan in
reviving and modernizing its democratic, administrative and military
institutions. To abandon that task before it's begun in favor of a
decentralized array of squabbling warriors would not only ignore
Afghanistan's history, it would negate its future, reopening the door
to chaos, war and radical Muslim terrorism in Central Asia.</TE>

<KH>JAPAN</KH>
<HD>The Wages of Comfort</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES WOLF JR.</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Japan, economic stagnation is compatible with comfort. Zero or
negligible economic growth will still lift per-capita income because
Japan's population will soon decline. By 2010, the falling population
will raise per-capita income by nearly 1% every five years, even
assuming that the country's gross domestic product remains unchanged.
This suggests that Japan's stagnation will continue absent a drastic
shock to the system. That shock is just as likely to come from an
external source, like China, as from an internal one.</LD>
<LD>   Far from being in a "crisis" condition, Japan remains one of the
world's wealthiest countries, with its standard of living among the
world's highest. Sales of luxury consumer goods--Louis Vuitton,
Gucci, Hermes and Courvoisier Cognac--continue to be strong. Japan's
current-account surplus ($117 billion in 2000) is the world's
largest, and its $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves is almost
twice that of second-place China, at some $203 billion. Its pledge of
assistance for rebuilding Afghanistan ($500 million over two years)
is larger than that of the United States or the European Union.</LD>
<TE>   Japan's cities are generally among the world's cleanest and
safest. Public services are comparatively reliable and efficient.
When travelers step beyond the gate of an arriving flight at the
Tokyo or Osaka airports, within five seconds a noiseless and speedy
shuttle arrives to move them to another terminal for a connecting
flight. It's a sharp contrast to practices at U.S. airports before
Sept. 11, let alone since then.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's generally high comfort level is a legacy of the 1970s and
1980s, when its economy was the wonder of the industrial world,
recording the highest annual growth rate, averaging about 4%, among
all developed economies. During this time, Japan became the world's
second-largest economy. The explanation for Japan's economic
"miracle" was the subject of many an academic and policy debate. The
miracle also fostered predictions that Japan's economy would either
surpass that of the U.S. or that Japan would own substantial parts of
it.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's protracted stagnation has evoked hardly less wonder and
hardly less debate over why the country can't restart its economy.
It's a debate tinged with irony. Many of the commentators who
previously extolled Japan's economic system and confidently predicted
that it would overtake that of the U.S. are now equally adamant about
their diagnoses of Japan's failures. A history of bad predictions
apparently hasn't dampened the confidence of the predictors.</TE>
<TE>   To better understand Japan's stagnation in the 1990s, it helps to
recall the factors that accounted for the miracle of the 1970s and
1980s: high rates of savings and (although government "guided")
private investment; a skilled, vigorous and growing labor force; a
positive rate of productivity growth for both capital and labor; and
a monetary policy that provided credit on favorable terms to
aggressive, export-oriented industries and firms, especially in the
automotive and electronic fields. Taken together, these factors
masked the economy's accumulating inefficiencies caused by a
protected domestic market and an industrial policy in which
government and bureaucracy, rather than competitive markets,
determined how and to what purposes resources were allocated. As a
result, Japan's economy is marked by an unbalanced industrial
structure, financial institutions warped by huge nonperforming loans
and heavy-handed regulation.</TE>
<TE>   The reforms Japan has undertaken to revive economic growth fall
somewhere between bland and modest. They have included near-zero
interest rates, government bailouts of major banks, increased levels
of public spending and a modest degree of deregulation. Most
observers, myself included, think these efforts are inadequate.
Without more drastic deregulation, Japan's near-stagnation is likely
to continue. Rand forecasts project Japan's annual growth in the
first decade of the 21st century to hover between zero and slightly
above 1%.</TE>
<TE>   Since Japan's consumers and political elites seem content to
languish in comfort, pressures to deregulate the economy, weed out or
consolidate unprofitable firms and precarious banks and create a new
business environment to encourage Japanese entrepreneurs, as well as
foreign investors, are unlikely to build. While President Bush's
visit to Japan last week elicited familiar promises of reform, their
practical effects are likely to be minimal. Instead, China may be the
stimulus that gets Japan's economy growing again.</TE>
<TE>   China has long-standing grievances against Japan stemming from the
history of Japan's aggression and oppression in Manchuria in the
1930s and in World War II. Periodically, Japan's reluctance to
acknowledge and make amends for its culpabilities--for example, by
amending the history texts used in Japanese schools--reignites
Chinese animosity. If these grievances remain, and if China's
economic and military power provide strong and increasing evidence
that the country will eclipse Japan in the Asian region, the
resulting shock in Japan may have consequences equivalent to those
which occurred following the Meiji restoration in the late 19th
century, when the threat of foreign domination fostered a dramatic
political realignment and a drastic redirection in national policy.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What was Wall Street Journal correspondent Danny Pearl doing when he
was kidnapped and viciously murdered in Pakistan? Why would this
husband and soon-to-be father put himself at such terrible risk?</LD>
<LD>   These are questions that every journalist faces each time one of
their number pays the ultimate price their calling can demand. Pearl
was the third journalist to die this year, the tenth to be killed
covering Sept. 11 and its consequences.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the Committee to Protect Journalists chronicled more
than 600 instances in which journalists faced lesser but still
serious threats--beatings, imprisonment, harassment both physical and
economic.</LD>
<TE>   Why would anyone undertake this kind of work? Pearl's cruel and
pointless killing makes us all examine ourselves and our profession.
His life provides some of the answers to these questions.</TE>
<TE>   A very intelligent, able and charming man, Pearl had a reputation
for being a careful journalist. He wasn't interested in excitement
for excitement's sake and didn't take unnecessary chances. He was
dedicated, as is nearly every foreign correspondent I know, to
finding and telling the truth.</TE>
<TE>   In the course of that search, he decided it was important to find
out more about how and why Islamic radical Richard Reid embarked on
the course that led him to load his shoes with explosives and get on
that Paris-Miami airplane flight. So he began seeking out Reid's
teacher and mentor, Sheikh Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani. Unfortunately,
those he came in contact with were not interested in truth, only in
terror.</TE>
<TE>   But their evil does not detract from Pearl's dedication or his
courage or the courage of every correspondent who believes truth is
worth taking risks. They don't know if anyone will actually pay
attention to the truths they find and tell.</TE>
<TE>   They are sometimes discouraged and dismayed at the indifference of
the world to the terrible things they witness. They find it hard to
point to instances in which the mere telling or showing of evil acts
brings about an end to them. But somehow they believe it will.</TE>
<TE>   They believe it is better for you to know that such things happen
than not to know. They believe it is better for you to see the faces
of the victims, almost always innocent children and women, and to
hear their voices than to let them die ignored and unrecognized. They
believe that if they can just make you pay attention, your horror and
anger and outrage will match theirs, and you will demand that such
things stop. And sometimes, they are right.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, often enough, wrongs are righted, wars are stopped,
oppressive governments are toppled because the world did pay
attention. Often enough that despite the cruel and evil death
experienced by Pearl, despite the deaths of other journalists, and
the beatings and the jailings, his colleagues will continue to take
risks to find and tell you the truth, or as much of it as they can
manage.</TE>
<TE>   Danny's murder was pointless. His life was not.</TE>

<LD>Environmentalists botched this fight once. Now they're missing the
point again.</LD>
<LD>   There is something just as important as oil to the future of
Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</LD>
<LD>   I'm speaking of a road. And all the things that a road means, like
campgrounds and gasoline stations and fast-food stops and
"attractions." In other words, development.</LD>
<TE>   Unless they rally quickly, environmentalists may lose the fight to
save the Arctic from this destiny no matter which way the Senate
votes on petroleum drilling in coming days.</TE>
<TE>   I know this distant place beyond the cities and highways in
northern Alaska. I worked there as a boatman, rowing adventurers down
its wilderness rivers. I have hiked among its grizzly bears, wolves,
musk ox, wolverine and nomadic caribou. I've written about it, talked
about it, smelled the raw crankcase odor of oil in its tundra. I have
ventured there in winter too, at 45-below with the northern lights
smoldering overhead and polar bears pawing yonder ice.</TE>
<TE>   I love it.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-million-acre refuge is the most special place left in North
America--a vestige of authentic wildness. If you're willing to huff,
you can stand on a foothill and follow your eyes from west to east,
from the Beaufort Sea in the north to the Brooks Range Mountains in
the south, with nothing--absolutely nothing--to disturb nature's
endowment.</TE>
<TE>   It is a fragile, mythical land where the growing season can be as
short as 54 days.</TE>
<TE>   People need a place like this. A place where a human can feel
small in the presence of grandeur. Where the mind has room to walk,
as the Athabascans say. We need it just to know that such a place
remains--out of easy reach, unspoiled. We need it because there is so
little left. The untamed, after all, is our ancestral home.</TE>
<TE>   But just outside the western boundary of the refuge is an elevated
gravel road laid down atop the permafrost. And a broken promise. The
"haul road," now known as the Dalton Highway, runs 414 miles from the
Yukon River, beyond Fairbanks, more or less due north to
Deadhorse--the squalid, pre-fab, industrial drilling capital of the
oil on the North Slope. This road was built in 1974 for the sole
purpose of hauling the tools, welding rods, lobster tails, filet
mignons and other necessities to supply the oil workers at Prudhoe
Bay, which lies in the plains to the west of the refuge.</TE>
<TE>   When it approved construction of the Alaska pipeline across
federal lands, Congress burdened the road with a sacred covenant: It
would not be used to open the Arctic to tourists, hunters and other
commercialization. A guard station would be placed north of Fairbanks
and motorists without a permit turned back. When the oil was pumped
dry, the road would be torn out.</TE>
<TE>   It is important to realize that these Arctic lands were claimed as
a national treasure. That is, deed was granted to the 284 million of
us who are not Alaskans as well as the 634,000 who are. Over time,
however, the federal government and then-Interior Secretary James
Watt quietly ceded right of way to the road from all of us to Alaska.
In 1995, the state summarily broke the old deal. It opened the road
for the convenience of urban hunters and as a lure to tourists.</TE>
<TE>   A few local environmentalists and native tribes objected. But most
conservationists were otherwise occupied with what seemed, for the
short run, to be juicier targets elsewhere: big timber in the
Northwest, big oil in Prince William Sound, all the usual bad guys.</TE>
<TE>   So today, an ever-increasing flow of RVs and hunters head north on
the haul road exercising a right they should not have. In 50 years,
that road will change the Arctic more than drilling ever did. The oil
fields will be gone. But the road will be paved. There will be
hunting lodges, restaurants, trinket shops, petting zoos and
airfields for flight-seeing tours. Spur roads will be pushed deeper
into the wild. Imagine the fun for off-roaders. Hunters will fan out
over hundreds of miles to ambush the migrating caribou herds, along
with the wolves and grizzly bears that follow them. A mosquito
abatement district will be established. Tourists will enjoy the
splendor in an IMAX theater.</TE>
<TE>   The Arctic will be like everywhere else: the province of
concessionaires, traffic, noise, litter. Another place to get a
window decal for the fifth-wheeler.</TE>
<TE>   "Wildness ... will be lost forever," says Allen Smith, Alaska
policy analyst for the Wilderness Society, and one of the few
conservationists to grasp the long-term threat of transforming this
supply road into a public highway.</TE>
<TE>   I wish environmentalists luck in battling to keep the drillers out
of the refuge. But win or lose, the upcoming showdown in Congress is
a last chance to reclaim and re-close this road, and order anew that
it be pulled out when the oil is gone. It's time that progress was
held to its promises.</TE>

<HD>Latinos Have Waited Long Enough for the Belmont Complex</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The poor neighborhoods around Belmont High School have been waiting
20 years for another secondary school to relieve student
overcrowding. But that school has never opened, at least partly
because the narrow agendas of politicians and interest groups keep
getting in the way. So why should things be any different now?</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Los Angeles schools Supt. Roy Romer will ask the Board
of Education to approve a plan to finish the new Belmont Learning
Complex. That should be a no-brainer, since the new site is just a
few blocks from 79-year-old Belmont High, where 5,000 students are
jammed onto a campus designed for half that many.</LD>
<LD>   With the can-do optimism that has characterized his brief tenure
in Los Angeles, Romer is confident a school board that voted to shut
down the project two years ago will give it another try. But rumors
continue to circulate that powerful players in local school politics
may try to delay the school's opening for many more months, if not
years. Such rumors cannot be easily dismissed.</LD>
<TE>   The latest twist in the Belmont saga involves a possible standoff
between the nonprofit group that wants to finish the Belmont Learning
Complex and the district's teachers union, United Teachers of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Alliance for a Better Community, or ABC, is the nonprofit that
says it can finish the already costly ($154 million) complex for an
additional $68 million to $88 million, mitigating safety issues that
halted the project in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   ABC is a Latino education reform group organized two years ago by
local community activists and corporate executives. It was created to
protect the interests of Latino students--who make up 70% of the Los
Angeles Unified School District--even as a newly elected school board
majority began to shake up the LAUSD by, among other things, firing a
popular Latino superintedent.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than pushing to break up the district, as some angry Latino
activists wanted, ABC opted to work for education reforms that would
keep the interests of Latino kids foremost. The plan to complete the
Belmont complex is ABC's first big effort. The ever-pragmatic Romer
will recommend ABC's plan to the school board as the best of the
proposals to finish the project.</TE>
<TE>   Romer has done such a good job of laying the groundwork for
reviving the project that some school board members who voted to
close it down in 1999 now may vote to reopen it. That only makes the
discordant note sounded by UTLA all the more jarring.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers union officials are not opposed to finishing the new high
school but worry about another part of ABC's reform agenda: charter
schools. The Latino reform group says it hopes to use the Belmont
Learning Complex, when it finally opens, to experiment with charter
schools--campuses supported by public funds but run like private
schools under state charters.</TE>
<TE>   UTLA President Day Higuchi says his union is not against charter
schools per se but is "totally opposed" to Edison Schools Inc., the
New York-based company advising ABC how to set up charter schools,
because of labor problems it has had in other cities.</TE>
<TE>   This is a risky stance for the UTLA. It will not look good for a
white-collar union to stand as the last roadblock to a project
desperately needed by the children of working-class immigrants whom
many other local labor unions are trying to sign up as members.</TE>
<TE>   But UTLA's leaders are no fools. And the Latino leaders who
founded ABC are as pragmatic and politically well connected as Romer,
a former Colorado governor and former chair of the Democratic
National Committee.</TE>
<TE>   So I suspect a way will be found around UTLA's objections--like
putting off any discussion of charter schools until construction of
the Belmont complex is finished.</TE>
<TE>   But I can't help but wonder if this final skirmish in the long
fight to get the Belmont Learning Complex built isn't also the first
battle in an even bigger war: the fight to get Latino kids in Los
Angeles the quality education they deserve, no matter who gets in the
way.</TE>

<HD>More Than Pearl Was Lost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANSOOR IJAZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The loss of Daniel Pearl at the hands of his inhuman captors
represents much more than the loss of a husband, father, son and
friend. His death represents the defamation of a country trying hard
to pull back from the brink of failure at the hands of extremists who
are prepared to go to any length to project their insanity. And it
puts another black mark on a great religion, Islam.</LD>
<LD>   The strategic consequences of this heinous crime are no less than
the future of Pakistani society itself; for any Pakistani--military
or civilian--to say otherwise is to dishonor the cause for which
Pearl's life was taken from him.</LD>
<LD>   Pearl was not just a journalist working for the Wall Street
Journal. He was a symbol of American intellectual and financial
power. His kidnapping was not a hostage drama; it was a message to
Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president, that much more than
eloquent speeches threatening the fanatics with doom would be needed
to stop them.</LD>
<TE>   Pearl's brutal videotaped execution was a message to the families
of Americans and Westerners everywhere who would dare enter the lair
of Islam's fanatics of what awaited them if they continued to
challenge Islamist mendacity and arrogance.</TE>
<TE>   And for now, the message has put a screeching halt to the
restructuring of Pakistan's foundations. Pakistan cannot rebuild
without a lot of help in reconstructing its corroded economy. Most if
not all of that help will come from the U.S. as reward for
Islamabad's staunch support of the effort to eradicate Al Qaeda and
the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   But it won't happen if American CEOs who seek to invest there or
U.S. lawmakers who consider aid grants come to the conclusion that
internal forces struggling for control over Pakistan's future are
pulling in such divergent directions that private American citizens
trying to help rebuild the country are not safe.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has much to explain to the U.S. before we can commit our
intellectual, financial and legislative resources to his
restructuring proposal.</TE>
<TE>   His first act must be to allow the U.S. to extradite without delay
Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, the man believed to be the mastermind of the
Pearl kidnapping. A trial of those responsible is essential for the
American people and for the Pearl family's closure.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf also must seriously crack down on the fanatics in his
midst. Cleaning up Pakistan's notoriously corrupt police and
intelligence bureaus should be the highest priorities. Without their
connivance, the Pearl kidnapping may have been resolved much earlier
and without the damaging political consequences it has now sown.
Merely rounding up assorted hucksters and gangsters is little more
than media manipulation and it has to stop. The American people are
not naive.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has to crack down on the illicit black market economy
that funds militancy and extremism. If need be, use the army to take
the guns and drugs off Pakistan's streets. The risk of civil war is
minimal because Pakistan's militants are cowards. They can only hide
in dark alleys at night for their prey.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has to lead the way, walking the streets himself with
baton in hand if necessary, to demonstrate to Pakistan's silent
majority that he is dead serious about taking on those who would
destroy their country. Musharraf wants to leave a legacy; here is his
chance.</TE>
<TE>   The extremists believed to have murdered Pearl are men who know
not even the first verses of the Koran, whose word they so
desperately seek to spread with their violence and hatred. They seek
only political gain from the abhorrent acts in the name of a religion
they know nothing about.</TE>
<TE>   It is time for the Islamic world--particularly the large numbers
of moderates in Pakistan--to rise up against them and stop their
criminal hypocrisy.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Pearl will live on as a symbol of the hope that men and
women of goodwill have in trying to understand each other's human
deficiencies. May almighty Allah rest his soul in peace for the good
work he did on this Earth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mansoor Ijaz, an American of Pakistani origin who worked with
moujahedeen leaders to bring about the 2000 cease-fire in Kashmir,
introduced Daniel Pearl to Muslim fundamentalists in Pakistan after
Sept. 11.</TE>

<LD>Just as annoying as the drivers who fail to signal a left turn ("A
Good Turn Involves a Signal," letters, Feb. 16) are the drivers who
fail to pull into the intersection while waiting for a break in the
oncoming traffic. So many of them wait with their car barely into the
intersection, thus preventing a second car from making a turn on the
same light. Drivers should pull into the center of the intersection,
making it possible for a second car to enter also.</LD>

<HD>Experimenting With Private School Vouchers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ralph Neas is right to criticize vouchers for posing a threat to
public schools and to those children who attend them ("Vouchers
Hinder School Reform," Commentary, Feb. 20). First, vouchers coerce
the taxpayer into paying for religion, something that Thomas
Jefferson opined was "sinful and tyrannical." Second, they constitute
a state takeover of religious schools and will inevitably result in
added regulations and restrictions that will jeopardize the religious
mission of those schools.</LD>
<LD>   The notion that free choice only exists when it is subsidized by
government makes a mockery of our heritage of freedom. Vouchers don't
expand school choice, they threaten it.</LD>

<TE>   President, Seventh-day</TE>
<TE>   Adventist Church State Council</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Neas is right and maybe he is wrong. But nowhere does he
explain why the decision about whether to experiment with school
vouchers should be determined by the nine men and women of the
Supreme Court and not the people of Ohio and their elected
representatives. If Neas thinks that school vouchers are a bad idea,
he should lobby the Ohio Legislature and convince the citizens of
Ohio. Is that not how a democracy is supposed to work?</TE>
<TE>   In 1932, Justice Louis Brandeis, one of the great liberal justices
to serve on the Supreme Court, wrote: "There must be power in the
states and the nation to remold, through experimentation, our
economic practices and institutions to meet changing social and
economic needs. . . . Denial of the right to experiment may be
fraught with serious consequences to the nation. It is one of the
happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state
may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory, and try novel
social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the
country."</TE>

<LD>Re "Students Aim to Give Bush a Lesson in Diplomacy," Feb. 20:
Perhaps the Korean students should take a lesson in history before
deciding to give lessons in diplomacy. In particular, they should
look at what the North Koreans did to their people in the '50s and
how many Americans gave their lives so they could have a free,
democratic South Korea and choose to go on hunger strikes rather than
be starved by force by a dictatorial government. Maybe the U.S.
should pull out all forces from South Korea and leave the students at
the mercy of the militarily fortified North. This may give the
students a badly needed lesson in reality.</LD>

living on the streets, but our Army is fed. What is it they say--the

<LD>I applaud the overall tenor and recommendations in your Feb. 18
editorial, "A Too-Dirty Clean Air Plan." Yet I gasped on reading your
agreement with President Bush that "compliance with the [Kyoto]
treaty would be prohibitively expensive." Really?</LD>
<LD>   By me, "prohibitively expensive" goes with funding a wartime
economy to benefit the military-industrial complex and maintain a
high-voter-approval commander in chief image for Bush. By me,
"prohibitively expensive" goes with giving whatever it takes for a
nonsensical "Star Wars" bullet-hitting-bullet missile program. By me,
"prohibitively expensive" does not go with forcing citizens and
industry to do the right thing, which is to preserve the planet.</LD>

<HD>Vote Threatens Ruling Coalition</HD>

<AU>MICHAEL CIEPLY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Think globally, lose locally. By fall, that may be the mantra of a
governing coalition that has made Santa Monica a world-renowned
symbol of municipal activism.</LD>
<LD>   Even as the beach community continues its attack on ATM fees,
orders ocean-front businesses to pay a $10.50 minimum wage and
deliberates a first-in-the-nation ordinance requiring handicapped
access in private homes, its political leaders are preparing for
bloody battle over a much homelier notion. To wit, that city council
members should represent--and be elected by--specific neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   The Voter Election Reform Initiative for a True Accountability
System (Veritas) narrowly qualified for the Nov. 5 ballot after
backers, including big, beach-front hotel interests miffed by the
living-wage law, put money behind a civic reform proposal that's been
kicking around Santa Monica for decades. The proposal would replace
the city's seven at-large council members with district
representatives, as in much larger Los Angeles, thus diminishing the
power of ideologically driven slates. It would also mandate direct
election of the mayor (currently the mayor is chosen by the council
from among its members), institute mayoral veto of council actions
and impose term limits on city officials.</LD>
<TE>   Ordinarily, this wouldn't be the stuff of high drama: The city
council quietly rebuffed the same proposition in 1992 without
difficulty. This time around, however, Santa Monica's hitherto
comfortably entrenched activist leadership smells a major test.
Calling the initiative part of a "scorched earth policy" by the
operators of luxury hotels like Casa del Mar and Shutters, Mayor
Michael Feinstein, a Green Party leader who ran with the endorsement
of the powerful Santa Monicans for Renters Rights (SMRR), believes it
could pass. "It all depends on how deceptive their mailings are,"
says Feinstein.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe the voters will simply choose Veritas on the merits. The
truth is, Santa Monica desperately needs to freshen up its politics
after two decades of almost unbroken one-party rule by the dominant
SMRR faction. With rent control effectively taken out of the city's
hands--state law now lets any vacant unit go to market rates--the
renters party tried to keep itself vital by tackling ever bigger
issues. But the net effect has been to polarize thinking along
left-right lines, while turning this relatively small community into
a battleground for big unions and big companies that happen to have a
presence here. Election spending is way up. Satisfaction with
bothersome matters like traffic flow is down. A good dose of
neighborhood-minded civic reform, under which slate loyalty will
suddenly mean less than constituent service, is surely in order.</TE>
<TE>   Things will depend, of course on how a majority of Santa Monicans
are feeling about their weirdly bipolar city, where politicians
struggle to fix the world's problems, while knotty little backyard
issues have a way of going unresolved for years. At least some
indicators point toward growing discontent. Last year, Santa Monica's
annual survey of resident satisfaction, normally quite rosy, showed
that only 10% of its adult residents felt the city did an "excellent"
job of addressing neighborhood concerns, down by a third from just
two years before. Fully 49% of those who live in single-family homes
and 44% of long-time residents expressed dissatisfaction with the
neighborhood situation. Meanwhile, the number of those who were "very
satisfied" with city services dropped several points, to 35%, while
negatives crept up.</TE>
<TE>   If Santa Monicans are really fretting about the home front, it's
not hard to see why. In the proposed Wilshire corridor district, a
community pool at Lincoln Middle School has been cracked and empty
since 1994, while officials have dithered over funding for earthquake
repairs. (I was thinking about how quickly a neighborhood councilman
would have jumped on this one when I put my own name on the Veritas
petition.) Over in the Mid-City area, it's not uncommon to see
derelicts downing a half-gallon of vodka within two blocks of a
school at midday, or tossing the remains of a 12-pack over an
apartment wall. To dial 911 seems excessive, but a few constituent
calls to a district councilman might get some action. In the City
Center district, businessmen are howling that the city broke a
promise by launching simultaneous street repairs on all sides of
their traffic-snarled establishments. Surely, it couldn't have
happened if a district councilman had his eye on the public works
department. North of Montana Avenue, a corporate lawyer type tells me
that more than a year ago he sent a nice letter to Councilman and
Mayor Feinstein, pointing out the hazard posed by untrimmed trees
that sent branches through the windshield of his parked car. He's
still waiting for a reply.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what the city could do better, in fact, the 2001
satisfaction survey found plenty of complaints about traffic problems
and homelessness; but nobody mentioned ATMs or wheelchair access to
their neighbors' homes. Those who listed lack of affordable housing
as a key problem actually fell to just 10%, from 23% the year before.
But city leaders are proceeding with a grand plan to put hundreds of
rental units, at least a third of them to be subsidized for
low-income tenants, on a downtown ocean-front plot purchased from
Rand for $53 million.</TE>
<TE>   The most intriguing battleground in the reform fight could turn
out to be the heavily Latino neighborhood south of the 10 Freeway
near Pico Boulevard. Community activists there have strongly
supported the living-wage push. Yet the neighborhood, according to
Veritas proponents, has never had an elected representative on Santa
Monica's currently all-white city council, a situation that would
change instantly under district representation.</TE>
<TE>   On this last point, a bit of history is in order. Santa Monica's
original 1906 charter actually mandated district representatives and
direct election of the mayor. After some intervening changes,
however, a 1946 charter reform established the current at-large
system, in a process that was tainted with unsavory racial overtones.
A city-commissioned study in 1992 concluded that the electoral setup
was based, at least in part, on intent to exclude from political
power a burgeoning black population in the World War II-era Pico
neighborhood. The study recommended district representation as the
best way to avoid a damaging lawsuit under the Voting Rights Act. So,
race could become an issue in the Veritas fight--and Santa Monica's
leadership wouldn't necessarily be on the side of the angels in this
one.</TE>
<TE>   Paul DeSantis, a real estate attorney and self-styled
"progressive" Democrat who co-sponsored the initiative, says Veritas
is really about accountability and independent thinking in city
government--hotel money notwithstanding. "Santa Monica is going to
remain a liberal community, a progressive community. It's not going
to change," he says. The major difference, argues DeSantis, is that
good candidates with competing views will be able to drum up support
by walking their relatively small districts, and they won't have to
depend on money from the Renters Rights party or its opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein, fiercely proud of his record on neighborhood issues,
replies that DeSantis is doing the dirty work of outside forces who
want "to kill the living wage before it gets out of Santa Monica,"
and vows a major fight this fall. He's sure that district
representation will reduce democracy by giving each voter a stake in
just one council member instead of in many, and will lead to a
narrow-minded focus by councilmembers on parochial interests.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the voters decide, the accompanying debate can only be
good for this city by the sea. We've had our eyes on the stars for a
good, long while. Maybe it's time to get our feet back on the ground.</TE>

<HD>Spackling Is the Quickest Way to Fix Drywall Holes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DREW ABRAMS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the widespread use of drywall construction for home interiors,
homeowners often find themselves dealing with dents, holes and gouges
in their walls due to the softness of the material.</LD>
<LD>   With a little lightweight spackling compound and some handiwork,
these problems can be quickly repaired.</LD>
<LD>   Lightweight spackling compound is sold in hardware stores, paint
stores and home centers in quart-size containers for about $5. The
advantage of this product over standard spackling compound is that
after it is applied to a wall and dries, it will not shrink, crack or
change shape. This makes patching walls usually a onetime repair that
needs no added sanding or recoating.</LD>
<TE>   To repair dents and gouges, simply apply the compound to the wall
and smooth it with a putty knife that is at least as wide as the area
you are fixing. You may have to make a few passes over the area
before it is filled evenly and smooth with the surrounding wall. Once
it is, do not touch it again. The compound will dry in several hours
and then be ready for painting.</TE>
<TE>   Patching a hole in a wall up to 4 inches across is also simple,
but it requires creating a backing within the hole upon which to
apply the lightweight spackling compound.</TE>
<TE>   An easy way to do this is to cut a piece of 1/8-inch hardware
cloth (a stiff but flexible steel mesh  available at most hardware
stores) slightly larger than the hole and wedge it into place. Once
it is set into the hole securely, the spackling compound can be
applied directly to it until the hole is filled. Use a 3-inch-wide
putty knife to smooth the material.</TE>
<TE>   For holes between 4 inches and 8 inches in diameter, you need to
provide a solid anchor for the steel mesh within the hole. The best
way to do this is to cut a strip of 1-by-2-inch wood about 8 inches
longer than the hole. Position the strip inside the wall, centered
across the hole. Then carefully drive a 1 1/4- or 1 1/2-inch drywall
screw through the wall next to the hole so it bites into the wood
strip behind the wall. Do this again for the other side of the wood
strip. Tighten the screws enough that they recess slightly below the
wall surface.</TE>
<TE>   With the strip anchored in place across the back of the hole, you
can secure a piece of hardware cloth to it with a couple of half-inch
screws to form your backing for the spackling compound. It is
sometimes easier to get the compound to adhere properly if two layers
of mesh are secured.</TE>
<TE>   Apply the compound to the perimeter of the hole first and work
toward the center. Smooth it with a putty knife. Also apply some
compound over the heads of the screws.</TE>
<TE>   When it dries, sand it smooth and touch up the surface with more
compound if needed. Let it dry overnight before painting.</TE>
<TE>   Incidentally, lightweight spackling can also be used to patch
damaged wood surfaces around the house.</TE>

<HD>What Can Landlords Deduct From Security Deposits?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H. MAY SPITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Giving a security deposit to the landlord is only half the equation.
What deductions can a landlord take? Will the deductions multiply as
time goes on?</LD>
<LD>   The answers depends on who is doing the defining. Here are a few
guidelines to help work through the basics, as defined under
California state law.</LD>
<LD>   A "security," according to Civil Code 1950.5, is "any payment,
fee, deposit or charge, including but not limited to, an advance
payment of rent." The security may be used for the following:</LD>
<TE>   "1. The compensation of a landlord for a tenant's default in
payment in rent."</TE>
<TE>   In plain English, pay your rent or your deposit may be used.
Before you leave, 30 days' written notice is the law, but a
pre-warning is nice, too.</TE>
<TE>   When the time comes, a sheet of plain paper simply stating your
name, the address of the unit and your intention to depart in 30 days
will satisfy the written-notice requirement. Remember to date the
letter clearly, sign it and keep a copy for yourself. Mail or deliver
the notice to the same person and place the rent would be delivered.
Follow up with a friendly phone call to be sure it was received.
Thirty days of deducted rent due to a "never received" letter can
really take a bite out of a deposit.</TE>
<TE>   "2. The repair of damages to the premises, exclusive of ordinary
wear and tear, caused by the tenant or by a guest or licensee of the
tenant."</TE>
<TE>   Fix it or pay for it. Problems also arise in defining the terms
"wear and tear." Amazingly, few people bother to take note of the
condition of the place at the time they move in. An itemized
walk-through sheet may be your best protection. Common deposit
deductions include repainting (especially if the tenant got creative
and painted a new color), replacing window treatments and floor
coverings.</TE>
<TE>   Wear and tear has been the cause of many a dispute. Tenants feel
worn paint behind a sofa, for example, is wear and tear while the
landlord may feel it's damage. Damage according to the dictionary is
"loss or detriment due to injury." The difference between a worn-out
door key and a broken one is an easy determination--but what about a
scratch on the hardwood floor? Ask your landlord before you move out.</TE>
<TE>   If something is broken or damaged in the apartment, be upfront
about the damage. You have the option of repairing the damage
yourself if done to the owner's satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   "3. The cleaning of the premises upon termination of the tenancy."</TE>
<TE>   Cleaning often gets messy. Tenants want to save the expense and do
the cleaning themselves, and landlords want to save cleaning for last
and use their own crew.</TE>
<TE>   Since the law provides that cleaning can be deducted, the second
question is: How clean is clean? Does it mean "broom clean" or "hotel
room clean"? Unfortunately the law does not elaborate, but based on
personal experience, the best answer is to agree beforehand on the
level of clean. Providing a basic sheet outlining the specific areas
to clean, a list room by room, would help everyone maintain the same
level of definition.</TE>
<TE>   "4. To remedy future defaults by the tenant in any obligation
under the rental agreement to restore, replace or return personal
property or appurtenances, exclusive of ordinary wear and tear, if
the security is authorized to be applied thereto by the rental
agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Appurtenances refer to anything and everything included in your
rental agreement. Anything from personal property items, such as a
stove, to everything outside, including the yard itself (if your
lease says you mow, you mow). You have to return the items,
naturally, plus return them in the same shape you started with--less
wear and tear.</TE>
<TE>   Most leases have language that mirrors the law. Double-check your
lease to see what you've agreed to, that any nonattached items are
written in and that promised items are provided.</TE>
<TE>   Recently a dispute over a washer and dryer in a condominium came
up. The appliances included weren't written down in the lease and
four years had passed. Whose were they? Luckily a receipt was
produced to settle the memory loss, but don't depend on memory when
it comes to rental agreement details.</TE>
<TE>   The landlord has 21 days after you move out to send a detailed
letter and a check for the balance of your deposit. For more details
on the law, visit www.leginfo.ca.gov.</TE>

<LD>"How to Buy a Condominium or Townhome," Second Edition, by attorney
Irwin E. Leiter (Sphinx Publishing-Sourcebooks Inc., Naperville,
Ill., 2002), $19.95, 180 pages.</LD>
<LD>   If you are thinking of buying a condominium or townhouse, first
read this detailed book which explains condominiums, cooperative
apartments and townhouses, with an emphasis on the legal aspects.</LD>
<LD>   The author compares condo ownership with traditional single-family
homeownership. He explains the differences, especially the common
areas owned by the homeowners' association for the benefit of its
members, and the similarities, such as the individual mortgages for
condos, just like those for houses.</LD>
<TE>   As an attorney, I question some of the author's explanations, such
as the condominium purchaser's interview with the officers of the
homeowners' association. Having bought and sold condos in several
states, I have never encountered such a procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Leiter writes: "Many associations require this interview before it
will release disclosure information as part of the closing process
... although you may be able to obtain this information from the
seller." Assuming the interview goes well, Leiter says the
association hands out three documents: current budget information, a
paid assessment letter and a waiver of the right of first refusal, if
any.</TE>
<TE>   The book's primary emphasis is on filling out the detailed forms
and worksheets in its appendix.</TE>
<TE>   But there is also much practical advice, such as how to check out
a prospective condo purchase. Leiter recommends roaming around the
condo complex, talking with prospective neighbors and checking for
poor soundproofing. In addition, the author suggests a professional
inspection contingency in the purchase contract.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy emphasis is placed on both required and optional seller
disclosures. However, some of the author's statements are open to
question. In the section about defect disclosures, Leiter writes,
"The buyers can rely on the seller's representation made on the
(seller disclosure) form." Really?</TE>
<TE>   The book should have included more examples of condominium
purchase experiences, good and bad. Real-world examples would have
increased reader interest in an otherwise tedious book.</TE>
<TE>   This is an excellent basic book to alert prospective buyers about
condo buying. Yet it lacks practical answers to questions about how
to avoid buying a bad condominium.</TE>

<LD>Industry Phasing Out Arsenic-Treated Lumber</LD>
<LD>   Arsenic-treated lumber no longer will be available for residential
use after Dec. 31, 2003, according to an announcement by
Environmental Protection Agency administrator Christie Whitman.</LD>
<LD>   Whitman said the wood-treating industry has voluntarily decided to
phase out the use of chromated copper arsenate, or CCA, which
contains inorganic arsenic, as a preservative for most residential
uses. The move affects virtually all residential uses of CCA-treated
wood, including play structures, decks, picnic tables, landscaping
timbers, residential fencing, patios and walkways.</LD>
<TE>   The decision follows controversy surrounding the use of
CCA-treated lumber in residential settings, with critics claiming it
poses a health risk. The nearly two-year conversion to alternative
wood preservatives will provide the industry with the time it needs
to retool and convert treatment plants with "minimal economic
disruption" to the industry, the EPA says.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers expect production of CCA-treated lumber for the
affected residential uses to drop by up to 25% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA has not concluded that CCA-treated wood poses unreasonable
risks to the public. It is not recommending that existing structures
or surrounding soil be removed or replaced. For more information
about the wood decision, visit the EPA site at
www.epa.gov/pesticides/citizens/1file.htm.</TE>

<HD>Air May Be Much Dirtier Inside Than Out</HD>

<AU>JAMES CAREY and MORRIS CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Indoor air pollution can be just as bad as or even worse than outdoor
air pollution.</LD>
<LD>   Studies by the Environmental Protection Agency of human exposure
to air pollutants indicate that indoor air levels of many pollutants
may be two to five times, and occasionally more than 100 times,
higher than outdoor levels. It's estimated that most people spend as
much as 90% of their time indoors--making home, school and the
workplace potentially hazardous to one's health.</LD>
<LD>   Further, laws designed to improve energy efficiency by cutting
down on drafts don't improve indoor air quality. Tightly sealed homes
constructed in the last couple of decades might have diminished the
use of fossil fuels, but have wreaked havoc with Americans'
respiratory systems. Homes that can't "breathe" can't dilute
pollutants contained in building and decorating products.</LD>
<TE>   Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the
air are the primary cause of indoor air-quality problems. Inadequate
ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in
enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources, and by
not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the home. This allows
concentrations to build up. All these pollutants have one thing in
common: They contain chemicals that are part of a larger class of
chemicals known as volatile organic compounds or VOCs. VOCs are
organic (carbon-based) chemicals that evaporate readily at room
temperature. VOCs typically are found in high indoor concentrations
in dry-cleaned clothing; chloroform from chlorinated water; benzene
from tobacco smoke; (formaldehyde from fabrics, pressed wood products
and insulation; styrene found in adhesives, foam, lubricants,
plastics, carpets and insulation; methylene chloride from paint
strippers; and carbon tetrachloride from paint removers.</TE>
<TE>   Other potential sources of indoor air pollution are central
heating, cooling and dehumidification systems, household cleaning and
maintenance products, outdoor sources such as pesticides, and
biological contaminants such as animal dander, mold and cockroaches.</TE>
<TE>   While indoor air pollution affects people differently, in general,
short-term exposure might cause immediate effects such as headaches,
dizziness and allergies. Long-term exposures can result in
respiratory disease, heart disease and cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Building-related illness is an identifiable disease or illness
that can be traced to a specific pollutant or source within a
building. In contrast, the term "sick building syndrome" is used to
describe situations in which building occupants experience acute
health and comfort effects that appear to be linked to time spent in
a building, but where no specific illness or cause can be identified.
Both syndromes are associated with acute or immediate health
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Awareness is the first step in creating a more healthful indoor
environment. Your best defense against indoor air pollution is a
strong offense. First, identify and control sources of pollution to
reduce and prevent indoor air contamination.</TE>
<TE>   This can range from changing housecleaning products to airing out
freshly dry-cleaned clothing to tossing out formaldehyde-containing
furniture. Equally important is improving ventilation. Proper
ventilation--the mixing of indoor air with outdoor air--can
revitalize the air in your home.</TE>
<TE>   Because cigarette smoke is one of the single greatest contributors
to indoor air pollution, smoking indoors is inadvisable. Similarly,
fireplaces and other fuel-burning appliances (water heaters,
furnaces, stoves, etc.) should be properly adjusted and vented to the
exterior. Doing so will prevent carbon monoxide poisoning and improve
efficiency of the appliance.</TE>
<TE>   Adequately sized exhaust fans should be used wherever moisture and
combustion are present in the bathroom, laundry and kitchen. A bath
fan, for example, will help to dissipate chloroform gas, which is a
byproduct of chlorinated water.</TE>
<TE>   There are other indoor air pollutants that deserve your attention,
such as asbestos, lead and radon. The first two were used pervasively
in building products before being outlawed by the EPA in the late
1970s. The rule with asbestos and lead is that it is best left alone
if it is not peeling or crumbling.</TE>
<TE>   Asbestos or lead should not be scraped or sanded and should be
removed only by a professional abatement contractor with the proper
equipment. Moreover, testing should be performed after the abatement
process to ensure the air quality is safe.</TE>
<TE>   Radon, on the other hand, is a naturally occurring gas derived
from uranium in the ground. Radon can make its way into a home
through cracks in the foundation or basement walls. Small amounts of
radon can be controlled by sealing cracks with a caulking or patching
compound. Higher levels might require the installation of an exhaust
system.</TE>
<TE>   For more information on indoor air pollution and what to do about
it, visit the EPA's Web site at www.epa.gov  or the American Lung
Assn. Web site at www.lungusa.org.</TE>

<HD>Faulty Valve May Be Cause of the Noise in Water Taps</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I open any tap in my house and I hear train-like noises. It
also feels as if air is being sucked into the tap. When we use both
taps, the noise disappears, but this is not a permanent solution.
Tell us what the problem is and how to fix it.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: If faucets screech when you turn them on, and pipes hum
when water's running, chances are you have a bad main-inlet valve or
a bad pressure-regulator valve. Water enters a home at only one
point. If all faucets groan and howl the same throughout the house,
the main-inlet valve is bad where water enters your home.</LD>
<LD>   Over time, rubber gaskets can become brittle. Running water rushes
in, passing over the gasket which acts as does a reed in a clarinet.
Pipes carry the sound to every faucet and fixture, making it hard to
pin down the source.</LD>
<TE>   In this case, check the main-inlet valve. If it screeches at only
one location, check the gasket of that particular faucet. Repairs can
be done with basic tools.</TE>
<TE>   Checking for Proper  Waste-Water Drainage</TE>
<TE>   Q: The waste water from the clothes washer and kitchen sink drain
onto the floor of the garage or into the backyard through a pipe on
the exterior of the home-kitchen wall. This pipe was broken before I
moved in and remains open. Should I call a plumber?</TE>
<TE>   A: Waste water from your clothes washer and kitchen sink should
not drain onto the garage floor or into the backyard. This waste
should discharge into an on-site septic tank or a municipal sewage
system.</TE>
<TE>   Contact a reliable plumber or sewer and drain service in your area
to make sure that the drainpipes are configured properly and draining
freely.</TE>

<HD>Outdated Software Can Lower Your FICO Credit Score</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. HARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--Ever wonder why you were charged a higher interest rate
and higher fees on your mortgage than the best rate you saw
advertised?</LD>
<LD>   One possible reason is an issue now stoking controversy within the
American mortgage industry: the use by lenders of outdated
credit-scoring systems that tend to lower applicants' scores.</LD>
<LD>   Outdated software frequently helps justify higher rate quotes and
higher loan fees, say critics. If you need a 680 FICO score to
qualify for a lender's best rate, and yours is 650, "the lender says,
'Sorry, but you just missed the cut, and I've got to charge you a
higher rate,'" according to Richard F. Le Febvre, president of AAA
American Credit Bureau Inc. of Flagstaff, Ariz., a national leader in
efforts to improve credit scoring.</LD>
<TE>   FICO refers to the predominant form of risk-evaluation score used
in the home-mortgage market. The initials derive from Fair, Isaac &amp;
Co., the firm that developed the scoring technology. Scores are
obtained by running the data in a consumer's credit file through the
company's risk-prediction software. FICO scores generally range from
the upper 300s to 850 and higher. The lower your score, the higher
your projected risk of default on a loan.</TE>
<TE>   Yet your FICO score for a mortgage application can vary
significantly, depending upon the age of the software being used by
the lender. Older FICO models, dating to the mid-1990s, penalize
applicants for such things as having "finance company" loans on their
credit histories, or for multiple "inquiries" from creditors
requesting copies of their credit reports.</TE>
<TE>   Such score-depressing factors have been modified or eliminated by
the company's recent roll-outs of its FICO models. But many lenders
have not adopted these more consumer-friendly models and continue to
use outdated versions that produce lower scores. Those lower scores,
in turn, force some borrowers into higher interest rates, higher fees
at closing and even higher down payments.</TE>
<TE>   One of the country's largest home-loan trade groups, the National
Assn. of Mortgage Brokers, considers the outdated FICO model problem
widespread and serious enough to issue a warning to its 13,000
members. Ginny Ferguson, the association's secretary and credit
scoring committee chairwoman, said in an interview last week that
"when lenders use (outdated FICO models) for pricing of loans, we can
run into major problems."</TE>
<TE>   Le Febvre takes the criticism one step further. He said some
lenders have been slow to integrate the latest models into their
underwriting systems because "there is a financial incentive to use
the old models." Lower scores mean higher rates on loans for sale in
the secondary market and may also generate higher fees for loan
officers who bring in the applicants.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is most acute, Le Febvre said, for loan applicants who
are "marginal"--decent credit risks whose scores nonetheless place
them at the borderline of the "sub-prime" category. Interest rates
charged to sub-prime or damaged-credit applicants can range from half
a percentage point above prime to four percentage points or higher.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it every day of the week," Le Febvre said. A mortgage
broker orders a score on an applicant through a credit bureau such as
Le Febvre's, using an updated FICO model. But then the lender to whom
the broker intends to sell the loan runs the same applicant through
an old model, "and guess what? The lender's score is lower. And
that's the one that dictates what the borrower pays," Le Febvre said.</TE>
<TE>   Fair, Isaac &amp; Co. recognizes the problem, but said it cannot
require any creditor to use a specific version of its software. Even
its most recent model--dubbed Next Generation--has not been adopted
by most lenders and investors, even more than a year after its
release. There are substantial computer system costs to integrating
new FICO models into lenders' underwriting programs, "and we are very
sensitive to that," said spokesman Craig Watts.</TE>
<TE>   What can consumers do about this problem? First, know what is in
your credit file before you apply for a loan. And while you're
obtaining your file, check out your FICO score direct from the source
(www.myfico.com). More than outdated models, erroneous information in
your credit file can depress your FICO score and push you into a
higher-cost mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   Second, ask your broker or lender for assurance that the model
used to pull your FICO is no older than the late 1990s. Ask about
multiple inquiries. If the software generating your score doesn't at
least incorporate that advance--allowing you to shop competing
lenders for the best deal without penalty--consider taking your
application somewhere else. Otherwise, your score is likely to be
lower than the best you deserve.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rock 'n' roll star Glenn Frey of the Eagles has purchased a Brentwood
home at about its asking price of $10.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   Built in 1996, the house has six bedrooms and eight bathrooms in
slightly more than 8,000 square feet, according to public records. It
is on nearly an acre with a pool.</LD>
<LD>   The Mediterranean-style house also has a basement with a theater
and a circular driveway, Realtors said.</LD>
<TE>   Frey, named with the Eagles to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in
1998, and his wife, Cindy, own another house in the area that is
expected to be sold.</TE>
<TE>   They also own a contemporary home on a golf course in Palm
Springs. The songwriter-vocalist-guitarist and his wife are known to
be golfers.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles were formed by Frey and drummer Don Henley in 1971. The
soft-rock band broke up in 1982 but re-formed in the mid-1990s. Last
fall the group, with only two original members--Frey and
Henley--embarked on a tour for the second time since 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Among songs associated with the Eagles was the group's first
single, "Take It Easy," and the hit "Witchy Woman." The band is also
known for the song "Hotel California."</TE>
<TE>   After the band's breakup in the early '80s, the Grammy-winning
Frey, now 53, recorded a number of albums as a solo artist including
"No Fun Aloud" (1982), "Strange Weather" (1992) and "Solo Collection"
(1995).</TE>
<TE>   He also appeared in such movies as "Jerry Maguire" (1996) and the
NBC series "Miami Vice."</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles' "Hell Freezes Over" tour in 1994 was one of the
highest-grossing tours--at more than $250 million--in pop history.
The band's "Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975" is one of the biggest
selling albums in the United States. And the group's other albums
have consistently sold about 1.5 million records annually since 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Aykroyd, who plays Britney Spears' father in her new movie
"Crossroads," and his wife, actress Donna Dixon, have listed their
Hollywood Hills home of about 20 years for sale at $2.5 million or

<TE>   The couple briefly put the home on the market two years ago, but
then changed their minds. The Aykroyds have a home on the East Coast,

<LD>Donald and Helen, ages 80 and 76, obtained a reverse mortgage secured
by their home. They received a lump sum, plus monthly payments, for
about two years until they decided to sell their residence.</LD>
<LD>   The lender's reverse mortgage payoff demand, at the time of sale,
was for $72,018 borrowed principal, plus interest, and $75,000 in
"contingent interest," which was 50% of the home's market value
appreciation during the two-year loan period.</LD>
<LD>   Donald and Helen objected to the lender claiming 50% of their
home's market value appreciation. They paid the lender's payoff
demand "under protest." The borrowers then sued their reverse
mortgage lender for unfair business practices, violations of the
Consumer Legal Remedies Act, fraud, unlawful prepayment penalties and
bad faith.</LD>
<TE>   The lender included a clause in the loan agreement requiring that
disputes go to binding arbitration, rather than a court trial. The
arbitration clause did not limit the lender's right to foreclose if
the borrowers breached the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Donald and Helen opposed binding arbitration, arguing it was
unfair to bar them from a court trial and a right to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   If you were the judge would you rule the lender can require
borrowers to accept binding arbitration for disputes?</TE>
<TE>   The judge said no.</TE>
<TE>   When Donald and Helen arranged their reverse mortgage, the judge
began, the lender dictated "take it or leave it" terms. They had no
ability to negotiate, he noted. Since there was no "bilaterality" in
the arbitration clause, this was a contract of adhesion, the judge
explained. That means the borrowers had no opportunity to negotiate,
he added.</TE>
<TE>   The arbitration clause was completely one-sided in favor of the
lender, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   "Realistically, the mandatory arbitration provisions apply to
claims of the borrower, but not vice versa. We conclude that this
unilateral obligation to arbitrate is so one-sided as to be
substantively unconscionable," the judge ruled. The arbitration
clause is unenforceable, so the borrowers may proceed to a trial
court to resolve their dispute, he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--The average price of a house nationwide rose 6.6% last
year, according to the latest government tally. Of the 31 markets
surveyed by the Federal Housing Finance Board, 25 had
increases--almost half by two digits.</LD>
<LD>   Only five places registered declines, and one--Atlanta--was
unchanged. In monetary terms, the average selling price for new and
existing houses rose $14,000 during the last 12 months, from $211,100
in 2000 to $225,100 in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   That works out to an appreciation rate of more than $1,000 a
month, not all that much less than the $1,269 mortgage payment
(principal and interest) on a $200,000 mortgage at 6.54%, the going
rate for a loan these days.</LD>
<TE>   But several markets fared far better. In the Bay Area, the owner
of an average priced house saw the value of his home rise by $35,500,
or almost $3,000 a month, last year. And the typical Milwaukee owner
wasn't far behind, posting a gain of $31,900 in just 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   Other places where home owners registered big gains included
Seattle, up $32,300; Greensboro, N.C., up $31,600; Miami-Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla., up $29,700; Chicago, up $27,600; Washington, D.C.,
up $27,400; New York City, up $28,700; Los Angeles up $26,400; and
San Diego up $23,400.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the gains were fueled by greater activity at the high end
of the housing market, where analysts believe many investors are
parking their money until the stock market quiets down. In places
where prices declined, values didn't actually fall. Rather, there was
more activity in lower-end product last year, which caused the
average to dip.</TE>
<TE>   Dip probably isn't the right word to describe what occurred last
year in Rochester, N.Y., where the average price plunged 16.5%, from
$164,100 to $137,000 in 12 months. And it doesn't adequately portray
the tumble experienced in Indianapolis, where the average was off 9%,
from $183,200 to $166,800. The decline in Cleveland was a more modest
4.8%, dropping from $180,700 to $172,000. And in Columbus, Ohio, the
drop was a negligible 0.6%, slipping from $194,100 to $192,900.</TE>
<TE>   In many of the other markets, though, sellers were gobbling up big
profits as the housing markets in their cities and towns remained on
fire. And the largest windfalls were recorded in normally low-cost
places.</TE>
<TE>   In Greensboro, for example, the average price of new and used
houses shot up 22.2%, from $142,600 to $174,200. In Milwaukee, it
jumped 20.5%, from $155,500 to $187,400. In Miami, the average rose
17.4%, from $170,900 to $200,600. And in Pittsburgh, and Kansas City,
the average rose 15.1%, from $136,800 to $157,400 in the Steel City
and from $158,700 to $182,600 in Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   The more expensive markets didn't do as well last year. But then,
prices are so high in most of these places that even a relatively
small percentage increase results in huge monetary gains.</TE>
<TE>   In the Bay Area, which, as usual, heads the list of the nation's
most costly housing markets. The average in the San
Francisco-Oakland-San Jose region rose a reasonable 8.5% last year,
from $419,100 to $454,600.</TE>
<TE>   The second and third most expensive markets also are located in
the Golden State. San Diego is second at $340,700, an increase of
7.4% from $317,300 a year ago. And Los Angeles is third at $313,800,
up 9.2% from $287,400.</TE>
<TE>   The three California metropolises are the only markets in the
country where the average is more than $300,000. But two big Eastern
burgs, New York City and Washington, are closing in. In the Big
Apple, the average now stands at $298,200, an increase of 10.6% from
$269,500. And in the nation's capital, the average is $291,600, up
10.4% from $264,200. Rounding out the top 10 are: Seattle-Tacoma at
$283,600, up 12.9% from $251,300; Denver-Boulder at $283,200, up 8.5%
from $261,000; Boston-Worcester at $278,700, up 3.4% from $269,500;
Honolulu, and Chicago-Gary at $247,300, up 12.6% from $219,700.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end, the average in the 31 markets studied is lowest
in Rochester at $137,000, followed by Pittsburgh at $157,400,
Louisville, Ky., at $158,400, Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla., at $160,600
and St. Louis at $163,900.</TE>
<TE>   How strong is house price appreciation? Robust enough to allow
homeowners to use up the equity they built up in their houses and
still owe less than they did when they first bought their places.
Homeowners refinanced a whopping $1.1 trillion of housing debt last
year, according to Fannie Mae, a major supplier of funds for home
loans. About $800 billion of the total was in cash-out loans in which
more was borrowed than was owed at the time the loan was traded in.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in most cases, the loan-to-value ratios on their new loans
were "still substantially lower" than they where when their original
mortgages were written, said Fannie Mae chief economist David Berson.
And that, he added, "all points to strong gains" for homeowners.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After Fresno resident Darren Gennuso was sworn in as a California
Highway Patrol officer in 1998, he could have asked to be located
anywhere in the state.</LD>
<LD>   Single and feeling the Central Valley wasn't quite metropolitan
enough, he opted for Los Angeles. "I love the beach," the 29-year-old
said. "That's the biggest reason I came here."</LD>
<LD>   Back in Fresno, Gennuso, who grossed about $40,000 a year as a
paramedic, lived well, sharing a three-bedroom apartment with two
friends. It was the perfect bachelor pad, with a pool and a sand
volleyball court in an upscale part of town. The rent was
cheap--especially split three ways. "That's the frustrating part," he
said. "My rent was as little as $225 a month there."</LD>
<TE>   But even with the jump to a CHP's salary of about $66,000 a year,
Gennuso has found that his income doesn't stretch far in Los Angeles.
In the last three years, he's rented a room for $500 a month in
Westlake Village and is now living in a converted garage in Brentwood
for $800 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "Some one-bedroom apartments are between $1,200 and $1,600 a
month," he said. "I think [with rent like that] I could probably just
buy a house somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Gennuso's frustration with rental rates, he is
beginning to worry that while he's having a great time, he's
squandering his money, especially the $1,000 a month he spends on
entertainment--mostly eating out with friends. "I have a lot of
Cheesecake Factory binges."</TE>
<TE>   So now Gennuso is considering settling down a bit and getting into
the housing market as an investment. "I want a home that I can afford
and still maintain a good quality of life," he said. "I just need
some structure."</TE>
<TE>   Based on Gennuso's excellent credit history, Joe Parisi, a senior
loan consultant with Metrociti Mortgage Corp. of Encino, was able to
qualify him for the purchase of a $220,000 home. Parisi recommended a
5/1 ARM loan, a fixed loan with zero down at an interest rate of
6.75% for five years. In the sixth year, the loan would convert to an
adjustable rate mortgage with an interest rate based on current
market conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "I recommend this type of loan for those who plan on stepping up
to a higher-priced home in the future," Parisi said. But Gennuso's
housing payment would be $2,000 a month--more than double what he is
currently paying in rent.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a big jump," Gennuso said. "That means the $1,000 I spend
on entertainment and messing around would have to go out the window."</TE>
<TE>   Not necessarily. Even though Gennuso has only $4,000 in savings,
he has managed to put $23,000 in a company 401(k) plan since his
employment with the CHP. Currently he contributes $875 a month to the
plan as a kind of forced savings account.</TE>
<TE>   Reducing or temporarily eliminating that hefty 401(k) contribution
coupled with a change in the exemptions that Gennuso claims on his
state and federal income tax might help him afford a mortgage payment
and not put too much of a damper on his lifestyle, Parisi said.</TE>
<TE>   A change in tax exemptions--from his current zero--could help
Gennuso have an additional few hundred dollars a month now, Parisi
said, instead of waiting for a big income-tax return later. "That
would free him up for a bigger house payment now, instead of grinding
it out and waiting for a return later."</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Parisi estimated that Gennuso would be able to write
off about $450 a month in income tax as a homeowner. But above all,
Parisi stressed homeownership as a good investment.</TE>
<TE>   "While you are sitting on the sidelines, property values are
appreciating and you are missing out on that," he said. "We are still
in a slight recession, but a lot of economists think we will be
turning the corner in 2002."</TE>
<TE>   But Gennuso knows that what $220,000 could buy him in Fresno won't
come close here. "I think I make decent money," he said. "But it's
almost like you need a dual family income to get into a house here."</TE>
<TE>   Making it even more difficult for Gennuso is that he wants to live
in pricey Manhattan Beach without having to depend on having a
roommate. That, however, may not be realistic. According to Carole
Stonich, a sales associate and manager with Shorewood Realtors
specializing in South Bay real estate, Gennuso is not alone when it
comes to sticker shock for Manhattan Beach area homes.</TE>
<TE>   "People who have lived here are pretty property savvy," she said.
"But if they are moving in from out of the area we have to sit them
down and tell them how it is."</TE>
<TE>   According to Stonich, the entry price for a Manhattan Beach home
today starts at $600,000, and that could be for a duplex on a tiny
lot or a small fixer. "When expectation and reality are so far
apart," she said, "there's going to be some disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   While no homes were available in Gennuso's price range in
Manhattan Beach, Stonich was able to locate seven properties in the
neighboring cities of Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach. The
properties--all condos except for one--ranged in size from 619 to
1,429 square feet. Prices ranged from $227,000 to $279,000, slightly
above Gennuso's target but not out of the question.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be able to push him up," Parisi said. "[Gennuso] has good
credit and good stability, so we might be able to stretch him" to get
a higher loan. Of particular interest was one condominium just five
blocks from the ocean that Stonich said has appreciated greatly since
the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the absolute lowest thing going in the beach cities," she
said. "It'll have to appreciate [even more]."</TE>
<TE>   After grasping the reality of the Manhattan Beach housing market,
Gennuso was pleased he could afford anything at the beach at all.
"The fact that I can live in a beach community with a five- to
10-minute [walk] to the beach is satisfying to me. It's a younger
crowd there, and that's what I'm looking for."</TE>
<TE>   But even though many first-time buyers are entering the housing
market now because of lower interest rates and a fear that prices may
be on the rise, Gennuso said he thinks he will wait a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at the housing market like gas prices," he said. "If you
wait, it'll come back down."</TE>

<LD>Home buyer: Darren Gennuso, 29</LD>
<LD>   Occupation: California Highway Patrol officer</LD>
<LD>   Gross monthly income: $5,550 with overtime; $4,600 without
overtime</LD>
<TE>   Goal: To buy a home in the South Bay as an investment</TE>
<TE>   The problem: Gennuso invests too much of his income, overspends,
lacks a down payment and wants to live near the beach, which will be
expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Recommendations:</TE>
<TE>   * Buy a home now, as analysts predict real estate prices will go
up later this year.</TE>
<TE>   * Temporarily eliminate any current heavy investments, such as a
401(k), to help bridge the gap between paying rent and a higher
mortgage amount.</TE>
<TE>   * Increase exemptions on state and federal income tax to free up
money to help pay a higher mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   * Be prepared to purchase a home that may not be a first choice,
but to view real estate as an investment that will grow and trade up
later.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When you're looking at kitchens in model houses it's easy to be
seduced by a look--beautiful cabinets, gorgeous floor tiles,
eye-catching granite. It's a lot harder to pay attention to the
practical details.</LD>
<LD>   Function will matter much more than looks. If the kitchen in your
new house isn't well planned and there's not enough counter space or
cabinets, you will hate it every day you live there.</LD>
<LD>   The first step in getting the right kitchen is to make a detailed
evaluation of the kitchen you use now. The more you can articulate
what you like and hate about it, the more you will know what to
include or omit in your new one.</LD>
<TE>   For example, do you have enough counter space? Is your food
preparation area by the sink too small? Are you constantly
crisscrossing your kitchen while preparing a meal or loading and
unloading your dishwasher? Have you outgrown your kitchen's storage
capacity? Be honest in your assessment.</TE>
<TE>   With list in hand, make the same practical evaluations of the
kitchens in model houses. When you focus on function, you'll find the
kitchens have pluses and minuses, just like yours. Because most
builders are unwilling to modify a kitchen for a particular buyer,
you'll have to decide which minuses you can live with.</TE>
<TE>   The first thing to check is the counter surface area. Is the
food-preparation space adequate? If more than one person will be
cooking at the same time, is there enough room for two to work
together comfortably? Is there room on the counter for a dish rack?</TE>
<TE>   The best way to answer these questions is to act out how you will
use the space. If you and your spouse pretend to prepare a meal and
find that you keep bumping into each other, the kitchen is clearly
too small.</TE>
<TE>   As you field-test the kitchen, make sure your imagined meal
preparation includes all the appliances. A kitchen that is awkwardly
arranged can be just as irritating as one that's too small. The
stove, sink, refrigerator and adjacent work areas should be in
reasonable proximity to one another so you don't crisscross the room
to get a meal together.</TE>
<TE>   A wall oven can be off to one side because you won't spend much
time at it, but a microwave should be convenient to the work area
because the cook may be heating, defrosting or using it for preparing
the meal. The dishwasher should be close to the cabinet where dishes
and glasses are kept, which should be close to the daily eating area.
The refrigerator should be close to the food-prep area and the
cabinet where dishes and glasses are kept. Because of its size, the
refrigerator is frequently put in a far corner, which can cause
unnecessary trips across the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Storage needs vary with lifestyle, but this will be another sore
point if there isn't enough storage space. From the study of your
current kitchen you should have an idea of how much space you need.
If the base cabinet storage in the model kitchen appears to be
inadequate, can you hang some pots and pans on the wall? If there
isn't enough wall cabinet storage, can you keep dishes in the dining
room?</TE>
<TE>   Adequate food storage depends on your shopping and eating habits.
Do you go food shopping once a week or every few days? Are your food
preferences simple or do you prepare meals with many pantry
ingredients? If the kitchen has a pantry closet, the shelves must be
at least 12 inches deep and 12 inches high to accommodate cereal
boxes, but a 24-inch depth will be more useful.</TE>
<TE>   Kitchen lighting is often overlooked because most buyers visit the
model during broad daylight, when windows can flood the room with
light. At night, however, you still need to see what you're doing.
Even if there is adequate general lighting, the counter areas can be
dark and hard to work in. Under-cabinet lighting will eliminate this
problem. If the builder doesn't install these (and very few do), ask
if he will install the wiring so you can add the lights yourself
after you move in. A "slim line" type of fixture that fits under the
cabinet box is more expensive but it might make the added cost worth
it.</TE>
<TE>   There are many types of counter arrangements, but most kitchen
designers consider the galley-type to be the most efficient. With a
single aisle and counters to either side, you only have to turn
around to go from sink to range.</TE>
<TE>   In small houses, the galley kitchen has given way to the L-shaped
counter. In this configuration, the appliance arrangement may be
satisfactory. But make sure that the counter area is adequate for
food preparation. Packing a sink, dishwasher, stove and refrigerator
into one L-shaped counter may compromise cabinet storage.</TE>
<TE>   In larger houses, kitchens frequently have island counters. For an
island to add function as well as style, it should be no more than 42
inches from the main counters. If the island is too far away it
becomes awkward to reach, especially if the island has a cook top.
Buyers who want an island cook top should make sure that the island
is at least 60 inches long. With this length, you can get a 15-inch
counter on each side of a standard 30-inch range and have space for
pot handles to overhang as well as a place to put bowls and utensils.</TE>
<TE>   Of course practicality is not the only thing you will care about
in your new kitchen. Once you get the basics down, you can obsess
about colors, cabinet styles, counter-top materials and flooring.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Preparing a home for sale means making improvements that will help
you sell the home faster--not necessarily fetch a higher price.</LD>
<LD>   The objective is to take on easy cosmetic jobs, such as brushing
on a fresh coat of paint or careful landscaping, rather than
remodeling projects where you are unlikely to recoup your costs.</LD>
<LD>   For example, you may think that remodeling the kitchen is your
best bet. While the kitchen is one of the high-profile rooms in a
home, remodeling is a costly endeavor that will most likely not
provide an adequate return on your investment.</LD>
<TE>   When in doubt about what to fix up, ask your Realtor. He or she
will be looking at your home with fresh eyes and will notice things
you overlook.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a room-by-room list of improvements, along with jobs to
avoid because they require too much investment in time or money.</TE>
<TE>   Bathroom</TE>
<TE>   Do:</TE>
<TE>   * Remove stains from toilets, tubs and sinks.</TE>
<TE>   * If fixtures are outdated or leak, replace them.</TE>
<TE>   * Replace the shower curtain.</TE>
<TE>   * Inspect, repair and replace any worn out grout in tiles.</TE>
<TE>   * Caulk all joints for a watertight seal.</TE>
<TE>   Don't:</TE>
<TE>   * Replace the flooring unless it's damaged.</TE>
<TE>   * Re-tile unless it can't be patched or repaired.</TE>
<TE>   Kitchen</TE>
<TE>   Do:</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure the faucet works properly, shuts off quickly and looks
good. Repair or replace as needed.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep the sink spotless. If you can't remove stains, consider
replacing the sink with a more modern look. Quality porcelain sinks
made with cast iron are a good choice since they're available in many
colors, are quiet and stand up well over time. If you replace the
sink, you may as well update the faucet at the same time--you'd be
surprised how much this will improve the look of a kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   * Clean the appliances and make sure they're in good working
order.</TE>
<TE>   * Clean the cabinets. If they're dark, consider repainting them to
give the entire kitchen a fresh, new look. This is also an excellent
time to upgrade the cabinet hardware (pulls, knobs, etc).</TE>
<TE>   * Consider adding an appliance garage or two to store appliances
and create an uncluttered counter-top.</TE>
<TE>   Don't:</TE>
<TE>   * Remodel.</TE>
<TE>   * Install new flooring unless the old floor is damaged or
unattractive.</TE>
<TE>   Living Areas, Bedrooms</TE>
<TE>   Do:</TE>
<TE>   * Patch cracks in the walls and touch up with paint. Consider a
fresh coat of paint on all walls and trim work. White always works,
but if you want to add color, stick with light pastels. Darker colors
make rooms look smaller than they are.</TE>
<TE>   * Inspect wallpaper to make sure there are no loose areas. Reaffix
as needed with wallpaper glue.</TE>
<TE>   * Have the curtains or drapes cleaned as well as the carpet.</TE>
<TE>   * Polish wood floors and buy new scatter rugs.</TE>
<TE>   Don't:</TE>
<TE>   * Install new carpeting unless the old carpet is damaged and can't
be repaired.</TE>
<TE>   * Paint the walls a dark color.</TE>
<TE>   * Replace lighting fixtures unless they're broken; odds are the
new homeowner will replace them with a different style.</TE>
<TE>   Exterior</TE>
<TE>   The exterior of your home provides the first and often strongest
impression. It's important that this be a positive one.</TE>
<TE>   Do:</TE>
<TE>   * Have your siding, stucco or brick professionally power-washed
and then touch up walls and trim with paint.</TE>
<TE>   * Give your front door a fresh coat of paint.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider adding a highly polished brass door knocker.</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure the house number is prominent, and in good shape
(brass numbers make a good impression).</TE>
<TE>   * Oil the door hinges and make sure the doorbell works.</TE>
<TE>   * Inspect the roof and clear away any debris. Replace any broken
or missing shingles.</TE>
<TE>   * Clean windows and make sure they open freely without binding.</TE>
<TE>   * Repair any damaged storm windows or screens.</TE>
<TE>   * Apply a fresh top coat of sealant to asphalt driveways.</TE>
<TE>   * Clean your deck with deck cleaner and apply a fresh coat of
stain.</TE>
<TE>   Don't:</TE>
<TE>   * Have the entire exterior painted unless necessary. Consult your
Realtor; he or she will be able to tell at a glance if you need to
paint it.</TE>
<TE>   * Reshingle the roof unless it leaks or it's falling apart.</TE>
<TE>   Curb Appeal</TE>
<TE>   Here's a list of simple things you can do to help your home sell
fast:</TE>
<TE>   * Grass trimmed and edged, leaves raked, toys picked up, shrubs
and trees pruned.</TE>
<TE>   * Buy new doormats.</TE>
<TE>   * Sweep and vacuum all floors.</TE>
<TE>   * Set flowers or a dish of fresh fruit on the kitchen
counter-tops.</TE>
<TE>   * Replace dingy curtains in any of the rooms that need them.</TE>
<TE>   * Store kitchen counter-top appliances in the cabinets to maximize
counter space.</TE>
<TE>   * Place colorful towels and soaps in the bathrooms.</TE>
<TE>   * Clean fireplaces and place logs on the grate.</TE>
<TE>   * Minimize the number of knickknacks in the house--they tend to
create a cluttered look that makes rooms appear smaller.</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure beds are made, laundry is put away and floors are free
of clutter.</TE>
<TE>   * Turn on all the lights in the house, open all the curtains.</TE>
<TE>   * A little soft music playing is a nice touch.</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure closets are as empty as possible and neatly organized.</TE>
<TE>   * Add some mums or other colorful flowers to the entryway.</TE>
<TE>   Most improvements will help you sell faster even though they won't
increase the value of your home. That's why it's smart to choose
improvements with minimal investment. Stick with cosmetics and let
the new homeowner remodel.</TE>
<TE>   And remember: Clean and tidy equals a quick sale. Neatness really
does count.</TE>

<HD>Exchanges Are a Way to Defer Taxes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>Sixth in a series</SE>
<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Would you like to become a real-estate millionaire without paying
taxes on your wealth?</LD>
<LD>   Buy a fixer-upper rental house, improve it to increase its market
value and make a tax-deferred exchange for another fix-up property.
Then do it all over again until you pyramid your way to realty wealth
without owing any profit tax.</LD>
<LD>   Pyramiding your real-estate wealth without owing profit taxes
along the way requires an understanding of tax-deferred exchanges.
Since 1921, Internal Revenue Code 1031 has allowed tax-deferred
exchanges of real estate held for investment or use in a trade or
business. Tax-deferred exchanges are based on the idea that disposing
of one investment (or business) property and acquiring a "like kind"
replacement of equal or greater cost and equity is really a
continuous investment, so it shouldn't be taxed.</LD>
<TE>   Tax-deferred realty exchanges, however, cannot involve your
personal residence. All exchanged properties must be held for
investment or used in your business. But you can make your personal
residence eligible by renting it to tenants before disposing of it in
a tax-deferred exchange. Or you can trade a business or investment
property for a rental house, which, a year or so later, you convert
to your personal residence.</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate how a tax-deferred exchange works, let me describe
my first tax-deferred exchange. I acquired a rundown three-unit
apartment building with a 10% down payment and a 90% mortgage, fixed
it up to increase its market value and then wanted to trade up to a
potentially more profitable rental property.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of two sharp realty agents, I exchanged my three
units for a rundown nine-unit apartment building. Since the seller of
the apartment building didn't want to keep my little three-unit
building, one of the realty agents arranged for a "standby" buyer to
immediately purchase my three units after my trade up was recorded.
It was a tax-deferred exchange for me. For the seller of the
nine-unit apartment building, it was a taxable "down trade." He
received cash from the "cash-out" buyer.</TE>
<TE>   But the down-trader wanted to get out of apartment management and
expected to pay a capital-gains tax on his sale profit. Everyone
walked away happy, except perhaps Uncle Sam, who didn't receive tax
on my tax-deferred exchange up to a larger rental property.</TE>
<TE>   The primary reason for exchanging investment or business property
is to avoid profit tax. Eight reasons for exchanging, besides
avoiding capital gains tax, include:</TE>
<TE>   * To minimize the need for mortgage financing on the acquired
property.</TE>
<TE>   * To dispose of an undesirable property, or one that is hard to
sell, by exchanging for one that is more desirable and easier to
sell.</TE>
<TE>   * To increase the investor's depreciable basis by trading for a
larger depreciable building.</TE>
<TE>   * To acquire a property that better meets the investor's needs and
is easier to manage.</TE>
<TE>   * To defer part of the profit tax by trading down and carrying
back an installment sale mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   * To pyramid your wealth into a large estate without paying profit
taxes along the way.</TE>
<TE>   * To receive tax-free refinance cash either before or after the
exchange (but not as part of the actual exchange).</TE>
<TE>   * To accept an unsolicited purchase offer to sell an investment
property and avoid tax by reinvesting in another qualified property.</TE>
<TE>   There are three basic types of tax-deferred exchanges: a direct
exchange of one property for another (very rare today), a
simultaneous three-way exchange of a direct trade followed by an
immediate "cash-out" sale to a pre- arranged buyer (such as my
exchange explained above) and a Starker "delayed" tax-deferred
exchange, as authorized by Internal Revenue Code 1031(a)(3).</TE>
<TE>   Starker exchanges are, by far, the easiest and most popular today.
They are named after T.J. Starker, who sold his timberland in 1979 to
Crown-Zellerbach Corp. and who later used the sales proceeds to
acquire other timberland. The key to a successful Starker
tax-deferred exchange is having the sales proceeds held by a
qualified third-party intermediary, such as a bank trust department
or title insurance subsidiary, beyond the constructive receipt of the
exchanger. To defer the profit tax, the trader must designate the
qualified replacement property within 45 days after the sale of the
old property, and must complete its title acquisition within 180
days.</TE>
<TE>   To make Starker exchanges even easier, on Oct. 2, 2000, the IRS
issued Revenue Procedure 2000-37 in Internal Revenue Bulletin
2000-40, which approves "reverse exchanges." That means an investor
can now first locate the suitable replacement property and have a
third-party accommodator temporarily take title to it before the old
"like kind" property is sold.</TE>
<TE>   The big problem for many exchangers has been finding a suitable
replacement property within the short 45-day replacement period. Now,
by following the new IRS "reverse exchange" rules, Starker exchangers
can acquire the replacement property before selling the old property.</TE>

<HD>A Good-Faith Estimate Is Not Always as Benign as It Sounds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK GUTTENTAG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I am working with a mortgage broker who gave me a a
good-faith estimate. It shows the interest rate, term, loan amount
and a listing of all the charges I will pay at closing: loan-related
charges, title charges, everything. It looks to me as if I could use
this document to shop different brokers/lenders to find the best
deal. Am I missing something?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The purpose of the good-faith estimate is to provide the
borrower with the information needed to shop for a loan effectively.
Unfortunately, it doesn't serve this purpose, either with or without
the companion disclosure called the truth in lending disclosure
statement.</LD>
<LD>   Borrowers should be mainly concerned with the mortgage price: the
interest rate, points--an upfront charge expressed as a percent of
the loan--and other lender fees expressed in dollars. The good-faith
estimate shows the interest rate. The lending statement shows the
APR, which is the interest rate adjusted for points and some lender
fees. However, the rate and APR are as of the day the documents were
generated, and since the market is volatile, they might not apply one
day later.</LD>
<TE>   Shoppers can depend on quoted rates and points only when they have
written confirmation from the lender that the terms have been locked.</TE>
<TE>   Settlement costs other than points are not volatile. However,
discovering what they will be in a particular transaction, on a basis
timely enough to help in shopping, is very difficult. Lenders and
brokers need not provide a good-faith estimate until three business
days following receipt of an application, by which time most
borrowers are already out of shopping mode and have committed
themselves. Furthermore, the settlement costs shown are estimates,
and the earlier the estimate is received, the less accurate it is.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowers who submit an application through a mortgage broker will
receive a good-faith estimate from the broker. After the application
is sent to the lender, the borrower will receive another from the
lender. The lender's estimate supersedes the broker's. Shortly before
closing, the borrower may receive a preliminary HUD1, which is a
closing document similar to the good-faith estimate except that the
fees are closer to being final. (A borrower has a legal right to see
a preliminary HUD1 the day before closing, but it may not be complete
or accurate). Settlement costs are not known with certainty until the
closing, when the borrower receives the final HUD1.</TE>
<TE>   The narrowing of errors as a transaction moves toward closing
would be less disturbing if during the process costs were as likely
to decline as to increase, but that is not the case. Not all
estimates are provided in good faith. A recent HUD/Federal Reserve
study noted: "Consumers report many instances in which the costs
disclosed on the GFE were significantly lower than those actually
charged at closing. They also report cases in which some fees charged
at closing were completely left off the GFE." There is no legal
liability for errors on the good-faith estimate.</TE>
<TE>   HUD could substantially improve the usefulness of the estimate by
recognizing that lenders know exactly what their own charges are. The
loan officer employed by a lender who quotes a rate and points to a
shopper can also quote that lender's charges for appraisal, credit
report, underwriting, inspection, wire transfer and the like. The
same information is available to mortgage brokers. Viewing these
charges as estimates subject to change is a needless invitation to
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Lender charges should be placed in a separate section of the
good-faith estimate as part of the lender's quoted price, with the
total of such charges clearly shown. If this were done, lenders would
quickly begin quoting their price in terms of three numbers instead
of two: interest rate, points and total dollar charge for all other
lender services</TE>
<TE>   Services provided by third parties, such as title or
closing-related services, present a different problem. Mortgage
brokers and lenders may not know the exact charges for these
services. Some major lenders have proposed that they be permitted to
assume full responsibility for all such services, negotiating prices
with service providers and offering a guaranteed price to borrowers.
HUD and the Federal Reserve have endorsed this idea, and would extend
the privilege to entities other than lenders. To date, however,
Congress has not been prepared to move on it.</TE>

<HD>Pistons Firing for Their Coach</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Carlisle has Detroit challenging the
Milwaukee Bucks for Central Division title in his first season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY LAGE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Rick Carlisle rarely rants or stomps his feet on the court.</LD>
<LD>   Off it, Detroit's first-year head coach doesn't smile or joke
around much.</LD>
<LD>   That's fine with the Pistons, especially because they're winning.</LD>
<TE>   Detroit entered the weekend tied with Milwaukee for the Central
Division lead, which is the first time that has happened this late in
the season since 1990, the second year of the franchise's
back-to-back championships.</TE>
<TE>   Team President Joe Dumars, who gave the 41-year-old Carlisle his
first head-coaching job, appears to have found the right person to
stabilize a situation that has seen five coaches come and go since
Chuck Daly left in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Carlisle's steady and stoic approach has helped the Pistons
navigate the ups and downs of the NBA season.</TE>
<TE>   They started 14-6, then lost 13 of 16, before bouncing back by
winning 13 of 16--now making them the NBA's hottest team.</TE>
<TE>   In Detroit's two winning stretches, Carlisle has been nearly
expressionless during games. When the Pistons were losing, he didn't
flinch.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't analyze my demeanor that closely, but I do believe that
if you're ranting and raving on the sidelines, you can throw your
team out of whack," Carlisle said. "I think it's important to be on
an even keel. I try not to overreact, or underreact.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that there are going to be fantastic plays and
mistakes in every game, and it's a long, long season."</TE>
<TE>   Carlisle has 16 years of experience in the league, five as a
player and 11 as an assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte Coach Paul Silas, who was an assistant with Carlisle
under Daly in New Jersey, has been impressed with what Carlisle has
done this season.</TE>
<TE>   "In a short amount of time, he's been able to do what every coach
in this league tries to do," Silas said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got his players working hard, playing defense and playing
together."</TE>
<TE>   Carlisle has benefited from a much improved surrounding cast to
Jerry Stackhouse and Ben Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   Dumars traded Jud Buechler and John Wallace for Clifford Robinson,
who is second on the team in scoring and, along with Wallace, sets
the tone defensively.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Barry, who was acquired along with a first-round pick for
former Michigan State standout Mateen Cleaves, provides a spark at
both ends of the court. Yugoslav star Zelijko Rebraca, who adds a
low-post presence, was acquired from Toronto for a 2002 second-round
pick.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Stackhouse says Carlisle deserves a lot of credit for
helping a team succeed that was picked to finish as low as
next-to-last in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not fickle, he's consistent," Stackhouse said.</TE>
<TE>   "When we're winning, he's talking to us about playing defense and
playing hard. When we've lost, he's saying the same things in the
same way."</TE>
<TE>   And if his players don't follow his demands, they will not
play--regardless of their contracts or draft status.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the season, he benched Corliss Williamson, who signed a
hefty contract last summer, and Chucky Atkins, a returning starter.
He also has barely used rookie Rodney White, the ninth pick in the
draft.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to argue with anything he's done because we're
winning," White said.</TE>
<TE>   Carlisle was asked if it is rewarding to know his messages and
methods have been received by his players.</TE>
<TE>   "If it has, great," he said. "But I don't know what our guys on
the team think, and I don't particularly care to know.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to play the guys that can best help you win, and
we have a roster full of guys capable of helping us."</TE>
<TE>   While Carlisle has an all-business look before and after
practices, games and interviews, Stackhouse said he's seen Carlisle
loosen up--off the court.</TE>
<TE>   "He's definitely a guy that you can grab a beer and talk about
things, or joke around," Stackhouse said.</TE>
<TE>   "You might not see that, but his players do."</TE>

<HD>Dixon Left His Mark in College</HD>
<DH>Basketball: What the Maryland senior guard lacks in size,
he makes up for with his all-around play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GINSBURG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>COLLEGE PARK, Md.</DL>
<LD>Juan Dixon entered Maryland with skinny arms and scrawny legs, a
155-pound waif who seemingly couldn't withstand a stiff breeze.</LD>
<LD>   After years of weightlifting, the 6-foot-3 senior has added a mere
10 pounds to his wiry frame. His reputation, however, has ballooned
immeasurably.</LD>
<LD>   Dixon's accomplishments at Maryland have earned him consideration
as the finest guard in school history, topping a formidable list that
includes John Lucas, Steve Francis, Walt Williams and Brad Davis.</LD>
<TE>   "Juan is as good as anybody that ever played here," Maryland Coach
Gary Williams said. "I say that because he was on a team that got to
a Final Four. You look at his numbers, his steals, everything--it's
just incredible to be that well-rounded when you're known as a
scorer."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon stands only 137 points short of becoming the school's career
scoring leader, but he's done much more than merely put the ball
through the hoop in helping second-ranked Maryland take a place among
the nation's elite.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon leads the Atlantic Coast Conference in steals, ranks second
on the Terrapins in assists and third in rebounding. His 21-point
performance Wednesday night at Clemson enabled him to become the
first player in NCAA history with at least 2,000 points, 300 steals
and 200 3-point field goals.</TE>
<TE>   Before he did all this, Dixon had to overcome a frustrating
redshirt season and shoot down the notion that he was too frail to
play in the ACC.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all heart. You can't let people put you down," he said. "No
matter what people say, you've got to stay hungry."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon honed his game by spending countless hours in the weight
room and on the basketball court. He doesn't weigh much, but what's
there is mostly muscle.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't show me someone who put in more work than he did," said
Francis, who started ahead of Dixon in 1998-99. "Good things come to
those who work hard, so Juan deserves everything he gets."</TE>
<TE>   On the court, and in life. By bonding with a close-knit family,
Dixon overcame the AIDS-related deaths of both his parents, habitual
drug users. It's a topic he prefers not to talk about, except when
the discussion concerns the contribution of his older brother, Phil,
a Division III All-American at Shenandoah (Va.) College.</TE>
<TE>   "He definitely set an example for me and my siblings," Juan said.
"He got his college degree and had a great college career. I would
love to follow in those footsteps."</TE>
<TE>   He's almost there.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take 15 credits this spring and hopefully I can finish with
an internship in the fall and be done," said Dixon, a family studies
major.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in class is about the only time Dixon stops moving. On
those nights when his shooting touch is off, he makes up for it with
his defense.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just an amazing player, someone who can beat you so many
ways," North Carolina State Coach Herb Sendek said.</TE>
<TE>   Long before he suited up for the first time, Dixon gave a hint of
things to come during his redshirt season. His scrappy play made a
memorable impression on Williams, who quickly realized that the
youngster from Baltimore was a keeper.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of the energy level, the first day of practice I knew he
was going to be a player because he just ran around," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon doesn't plan to stop after the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a dream of playing in the NBA, and I'm getting closer and
closer to that dream," he said. "I just have to keep on getting
better. Hopefully things will work out for me."</TE>

<HD>Flying Dutchmen</HD>
<DH>Four Years Ago, Lebanon Valley College Had No Hockey  Team;
Now the School Is an NCAA Division III Power</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN LEWERENZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HERSHEY, Pa.</DL>
<LD>When Al MacCormack came to coach hockey at Lebanon Valley College, he
had his work cut out for him.</LD>
<LD>   After all, it's not easy recruiting players for a team that
doesn't even exist.</LD>
<LD>   Four years later, MacCormack's job is a lot easier. His Flying
Dutchmen have become an NCAA Division III powerhouse, winning the
regular-season conference championship in the ECAC Northeast and
clinching home ice in their bid for a second-consecutive NCAA
tournament berth.</LD>
<TE>   That's a far cry from where MacCormack started. When he left a
successful program at the State University of New York, Cortland,
MacCormack came to a school with no tradition to sell, no club team
to build from, not even a campus ice rink.</TE>
<TE>   The Dutchmen play at Hersheypark Arena, about six miles from their
Annville campus.</TE>
<TE>   "No one heard of Lebanon Valley College in the hockey world -- it
was a very difficult sell," MacCormack said. "There were a lot of
skeptical people when I first started this, a lot of wrinkled faces
when I first mentioned it. There were nights when I was worried I
wouldn't get enough people for a team."</TE>
<TE>   But MacCormack found them, recruiting a core of
freshmen--including forwards Jamie Taylor and Dan Fox and goaltenders
Lincoln Matlock and Kevin Block--that would quickly develop into one
of the nation's best teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Dutchmen went 16-8-1 in 1998-99, their first season, improving
to 19-6-1 in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   "In our first practice ever, you could see it. There were guys who
had just tons of talent--we just needed to put it together," said
Greg Kutchma, a senior forward from Johnstown. "The first year, we
were still feeling everything out. The second year, the third year,
we knew we could do something and put this team on the map."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Lebanon Valley upset defending ECAC Northeast champion
Wentworth to claim the league championship and an automatic bid to
the NCAA tournament. The Dutchmen finished 18-9-2 after losing in the
first round to Rochester Institute of Technology.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get to the first round of the NCAAs, we definitely want to
make some noise," said junior forward Brian Yingling. "We don't want
to do what happened last year--that was embarrassing to us. I think
in some ways we were happy to be there, and we can't play like that."</TE>
<TE>   Lebanon Valley got off to a slow start this year, losing their
first two games. But they responded with a 17-game winning streak,
finishing the season 21-3-1 after a 10-0 rout of Western New England
College.</TE>
<TE>   That win sealed the first regular-season conference championship
for the Dutchmen, who will get home ice throughout the ECAC Northeast
tournament. Plymouth (N.H.) State comes to Hersheypark on Sunday for
the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not just the home crowd that gives Lebanon Valley an
advantage. Hersheypark Arena is warmer than most other league rinks,
and visiting teams often tire late in a game.</TE>
<TE>   But more than travel or warm ice, MacCormack believes his players'
success comes from their balance and their work ethic.</TE>
<TE>   The Flying Dutchmen were ranked No. 10 in the U.S. College Hockey
Online poll this week. More important, they are ranked No. 3 in the
Pairwise rankings, a computer ranking that mimics the system used by
the NCAA selection committee. That means even if the Dutchmen lose in
their conference tournament, they have a good shot at one of three
at-large NCAA bids.</TE>
<TE>   Once there, the Dutchmen are determined not to get bounced in the
first round this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the talent to play with anybody," Fox said. "When you get
that far, everybody is great, so you're going to have to get a couple
lucky bounces and not make mistakes. But if we get those bounces, I
think we can play with anybody."</TE>

<HD>Thorn Picked a Rose When He Acquired Kidd</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE JACOBSON</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The man who made the trade picks out a moment in the very first game
Jason Kidd played for the New Jersey Nets. Opening night, and the
comparisons begin.</LD>
<LD>   Julius Erving, Michael Jordan, Stephon Marbury, John Stockton, Bob
Cousy, Guy Rodgers, Hakeem Olajuwon and Keith Hernandez.</LD>
<LD>   Jalen Rose of the Indiana Pacers was cutting up the Nets in a
fashion well remembered by those who care about the Nets. Kidd went
to Byron Scott, the coach, and said, "Let me take him." So Rose
scored one basket in the second half, and the Nets won. Whether
anybody would have believed it or not, the Nets are in first place in
their division and the New York Knicks are last.</LD>
<TE>   Rod Thorn, who has been around in this league and the other and
boldly traded the ego-driven but popular Marbury for Kidd, makes the
comparisons. "Jason just made everybody around him better, and not a
lot of guys do that," Thorn said.</TE>
<TE>   They are some comparisons. "Julius Erving: best teammate I ever
saw," said Thorn, assistant coach when the Nets won two championships
of the red, white and blue league in Nassau Coliseum and were
beginning to make people care. Erving told the coach in the
championship game in Denver to clear his side and he'd score. So
Kevin Loughery cleared one side and Dr. J scored again and again, and
the Nets won.</TE>
<TE>   Thorn told of how Larry Kenon was devastated by a scoring slump
and Dr. J, in a race for the scoring title, advised Loughery that
he'd take care of Kenon. By the quarter, Kenon had 12 points, on the
way to 25. Erving got his 15 and the Nets won. "When it was over, Doc
just winked to Kevin," Thorn said.</TE>
<TE>   The Erving years were too good to last, and nobody on the Coliseum
side of the state line missed the Nets--especially last season--until
now. New York loves guards. Kidd is the best guard to play in New
York since Walt Frazier, and how much the Knicks ache for a point
guard is clear.</TE>
<TE>   Thorn, as general manager of the Chicago Bulls, drafted Michael
Jordan with the league's third pick. "I thought he'd be real good; I
had no clue he'd ever be what he turned out to be," Thorn said.
Houston picked first and chose Olajuwon, which Thorn would have done.
Next was Portland, which already had Jim Paxson and Clyde Drexler and
thought it could win a title if it had a big man, so it picked Sam
Bowie when doctors said his broken leg was sound. That left Jordan
for Chicago, which would have taken Olajuwon.</TE>
<TE>   "The mindset then was to take big," Thorn said. "Michael changed
the thinking; a midsize player could lead a team to a championship."</TE>
<TE>   Thorn finds Jordan and Kidd with much in common. "They are
ultracompetitive," he said. "They have a calm in the guts of the
game; the game seems to slow down for them. They're not afraid to
take the big shot. They're not afraid to succeed; they expect to play
well."</TE>
<TE>   And they make everybody around them better, which not a lot of
guys do.</TE>
<TE>   Remember how quickly Guy Rodgers moved the ball in the '50s and
'60s? Kidd dribbles as fast as he runs, fits through narrow openings
and, Thorn said, "has a genius for finding who's open. He knows the
strength and weakness of his teammates and plays to it."</TE>
<TE>   He observed that other players with Basketball USA, the
pre-Olympic program, wanted to be on Kidd's side. Thorn did not see
him as the leader who has emerged. It was apparent except in the
grandstand that Marbury, although devastatingly talented, created
anti-chemistry. His ego wouldn't let him coexist with Kevin Garnett
in Minnesota. With the Nets, he listened to the old neighborhood,
which is always a peril in playing near the old hometown.</TE>
<TE>   When the team asked him to help teammates play better, Marbury
said, nuts to them, they couldn't play.</TE>
<TE>   When Kidd had a publicized incident last season with his wife,
after several first-round playoff exits, the Suns wanted him gone.
Thorn wanted him.</TE>
<TE>   Marbury can go to the hoop with the big guys and thinks shot
first. Kidd thinks pass first, second, third and fourth--and still
averages 14 points. "He's an old-time guard," Thorn said. "He's like
John Stockton or Bob Cousy; when he dreams, he dreams of the great
pass." And Marbury has fouled his third nest in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Van Horn and Kerry Kittles are better for having Kidd.
Inflammatory Kenyon Martin can benefit from seeing that Kidd seldom
embarrasses a referee. Kidd never embarrasses a teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "If a guy misses two or three shots, he looks to get him a layup,"
Thorn said. In a league increasingly constipated in the halfcourt
trend, Kidd makes teammates run even if they don't want to. "Guys see
if they don't get down there with him," Thorn said, "they might miss
out on something."</TE>
<TE>   Thorn grew up in West Virginia and identifies himself as a "huge"
St. Louis Cardinals baseball fan. He remembers there was bad air
around Keith Hernandez, who then went to the New York Mets and made
everybody around him better, and not a lot of guys do that. "It's a
good comparison," Thorn said. "They make people think they can win."</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks grit their teeth.</TE>

<HD>Tales of Age Discrepancies Developing New Wrinkles</HD>
<DH>Baseball: With closer scrutiny given to birth records, some
young players have developed instant maturity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wow! Bartolo Colon, Rafael Furcal and a bunch of major leaguers sure
got old in a hurry.</LD>
<LD>   The shortest off season in baseball history turned out to last a
lot longer for Rey Ordonez and Enrique Wilson, too.</LD>
<LD>   Neifi Perez and Ramon Ortiz? Both good players--just no longer
some of the better young guys in the game.</LD>
<TE>   An age-old question has become the No. 1 issue all over spring
training. Every day, teams are learning a player or two is a little
older than they thought.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the Danny Almonte domino effect," Chicago Cubs Manager Don
Baylor said. "It seems like that has happened a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, it's occurring with players from the Dominican Republic,
the product of closer scrutiny of birth certificates, passports and
visa applications.</TE>
<TE>   Don't blame us, said Joan Dalmau, president of the Bronx league
that produced Almonte. The pitcher's team was forced to forfeit its
third-place finish in the Little League World Series last summer
after local Dominican officials confirmed he was 14 instead of 12.</TE>
<TE>   "See, it's not just us," Dalmau said. "It can happen with major
leaguers as well as Little Leaguers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's because of poor record-keeping. It's not like here, where
you just look in a computer and find out when someone was born.
There, the boys go by what they're told."</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 also have had an impact. With
tighter security in place for all people traveling to the United
States, closer checks have revealed the age discrepancies.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's the result of 9-11 or Danny Almonte or
exactly why," said Pat Courtney of the commissioner's office.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner's office sent out a memo to all teams in
December, advising them to get players' documents in order to avoid
trouble. A branch of the commissioner's office was set up in the
Dominican in 2000 to help avoid possible problems.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, baseball is filled with lore about mysterious ages.</TE>
<TE>   No one ever really knew how old Satchel Paige was, and there were
always questions about Fernando Valenzuela. Even now, does anyone
believe Orlando "El Duque" Hernandez is just 32?</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta's ageless wonder, Julio Franco, is tired of talking about
it. He's listed at 40, and that's how it's going to stay.</TE>
<TE>   "I told you guys last year I would let you ask questions about my
age, but I won't allow it this year," Franco told reporters last
week. "I'm not going to go through it again this year. Anyway, age is
only a number."</TE>
<TE>   But the Braves now know Furcal, the 2000 NL Rookie of the Year, is
really 23, rather than 21.</TE>
<TE>   "He's maturing," manager Bobby Cox joked.</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Indians at first through Colon was 27 instead of 26,
then learned Friday he was 28.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no bid deal," the star pitcher said of his sudden aging.</TE>
<TE>   Indians general manager Mark Shapiro wasn't troubled by the recent
trend.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times it's not just players lying and saying they're
younger than they really are," he said. "It's not just us. It's
happening all over baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Perez reported to the Kansas City Royals' camp and told general
manager Allard Baird that he was actually 28 instead of 26. A
contradiction was found in his birth certificate and visa.</TE>
<TE>   "Neifi said, 'I want to get it out and over with,'" Baird said.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as the value of the player, we don't look at it any
differently. I would be concerned if he were 30, 32 years old," Baird
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz was thought to be 25. Instead, the Anaheim pitcher will
celebrate his 29th birthday next month.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to take a lot of ribbing from his teammates, that's
for sure," Angels General Manager Bill Stoneman said.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Mets and Yankees also were affected.</TE>
<TE>   Ordonez had previously been listed at 29, but instead the Gold
Glove shortstop is about to turn 31. Mets teammate Timo Perez is 26
instead of 24.</TE>
<TE>   When Wilson reported to the Yankees on Thursday, the team learned
the backup infielder was 28 and not 26.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how it happened," he said. "I'm going to be the same
player, and do the same things."</TE>

<HD>Santo on the Long Road to Recovery</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Former Cub third baseman is adjusting to loss of
leg, but has plans to resume broadcasting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MESA, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Baseball has always been Ron Santo's life. Now, it is his therapy,
too.</LD>
<LD>   Two months after his right leg was amputated below the knee
because of diabetes, the former Chicago Cubs third baseman is
starting over.</LD>
<LD>   He soon will have a state-of-the-art prosthesis and will go about
trying to live as normal a life as possible, starting first with
learning to walk.</LD>
<TE>   The nine-time all star plans to resume his broadcasting career
with the Cubs, get back on the golf course and ride his horse again.</TE>
<TE>   "What I went through, eight operations in 10 weeks, I can't
explain it. You had to be there," said Santo, 61, as he visited the
Cubs' spring training camp.</TE>
<TE>   He drove himself to the facility in a vehicle with controls on the
steering column and then got around with surprising ease with the aid
of a walker.</TE>
<TE>   Players, coaches and team officials cracked jokes and slapped him
on the back, lifting the spirits of a man who is already known for
his upbeat personality.</TE>
<TE>   "I never said, 'Why me?' I believe in God and I was wondering,
'When is this going to work?' 'Why can't this heal?' I started to
lose faith," Santo said.</TE>
<TE>   "The end result is that what I found out there are more people
aware of diabetes since this has happened to me."</TE>
<TE>   Santo spent 14 of his 15 major league seasons with the Cubs and
had 342 career homers and won five gold gloves. His popularity has
continued since he became a team broadcaster in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails have poured in by the thousands and so have the cards
and letters, many of which contain contributions to fight diabetes, a
disease Santo was diagnosed with at age 18.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are sitting there and having a bad day and you read
these cards and letters, it just picks you up," Santo said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every one of these letters, whatever they say, it's like they
know you, like they've been there. I didn't look at myself at this
level with the fans."</TE>
<TE>   Santo's family kept him going during the tough days since last
summer when he discovered a small ulcer-like sore on his foot that
would eventually cost him his leg.</TE>
<TE>   "My family was my biggest inspiration, they just kept me
fighting," said Santo.</TE>
<TE>   "What worried me more than anything else was that two years ago I
had open heart surgery, a quadruple bypass," Santo said. "Every time
I went in for an operation, I was worried that my heart was going to
give."</TE>
<TE>   And finally in November after one of his many operations, his
heart did stop.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking at the ceiling and I knew my heart was going to
stop," Santo said.</TE>
<TE>   A nurse jumped on him and began screaming: "'Don't leave me Ron,
stay with me,'" Santo said. "She kept me with her and then she yelled
'Code Blue' and there were 10 people in that room."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, he said, another person in the room yelled: "'He's
flat,' and boom--they hit me," Santo said.</TE>
<TE>   "When they hit me that was the last thing I remembered.... Then
when I woke up, I remembered everything."</TE>
<TE>   Santo had a defibrillator implanted to regulate his heartbeat, but
there were more difficult times ahead. The following month, he lost
his leg.</TE>
<TE>   His immediate goal is to be in the radio booth for the Cubs'
spring training opener Thursday. Whether he can resume full-time
duties will be determined by how he adjusts to impediments such as
stairs and showers in hotel rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Being around the Cubs will be the best tonic for Santo. Looking
trim and tan and feeling better than he has in months, he sees a much
more pleasing future, despite all he's been through.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though you take care of yourself, diabetes is a disease that
can turn on you. Like for 40 years, I had no major problems," said
Santo, who sponsors a walk every year to raise money to fight the
disease.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody had said to me that they think I'm one of the strongest
guys around. But believe me, if it happened to anybody, you do what
you have to do. You fight."</TE>

<LD>McNEIL RIVER STATE GAME SANCTUARY, Alaska--My hip boots sank into the
muck, and mosquitoes buzzed in my ears. Offshore, a snow-streaked
volcanic island puffed wisps of smoke.</LD>
<LD>   It was late June, and we were surrounded by footprints on an
isolated beach. Baby prints. Chubby prints. Prints the size of dinner
plates, with long, lethal-looking claws.</LD>
<LD>   We were not alone.</LD>
<TE>   All around us in the 4-foot-tall sedge-grass meadows, I glimpsed
brown, moving fur. Bears were everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly the underbrush to the left of us crackled, and our little
conga line came to an abrupt halt.</TE>
<TE>   "Mudface!" someone whispered loudly.</TE>
<TE>   Mudface--the biggest, baddest bear on the river--was rumored to be
close to camp.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha Wilson, our young ranger-biologist, clapped her hands,
and someone called, "Yo, Mudface!"</TE>
<TE>   One never wants to surprise a grizzly.</TE>
<TE>   We held our breath. No Mudface. We slogged on, carefully noting
where brown fur crested the top of the grass.</TE>
<TE>   For the next four days I would become one with "The Many-Headed
It," as one of our group of 10 called us. Wherever we went, we went
together, in lock-step. This was not detention camp. We were the
lucky ones, in fact. Our names had been drawn in the lottery for a
chance last summer to come to McNeil River State Game Sanctuary, on
the edge of Kamishak Bay about 250 air miles southwest of Anchorage,
to watch and live with brown bears, known fondly to some and
fearfully to others as grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   The sanctuary was created in 1967 by the Alaska legislature to
protect the McNeil River and its unusually large concentration of
brown bears, which gather here every year to fish for salmon. The
river becomes a veritable banquet table in salmon season--wide with
shallow, rocky falls creating a natural barrier to the abundant
salmon swimming upriver and thus prime fishing spots for bears.
Although bruins are primarily solitary creatures, the feast here is
irresistible.</TE>
<TE>   As are the bears. For me, seeing any animal in the wild is a gift.
It's magical to watch them in their world, even for a few short
moments.</TE>
<TE>   But the rest of the world may not see it quite that way. In fact,
when a colleague in California heard I was going to watch bears, she
asked in astonishment, "Why would anyone want to go see bears?" (This
was not a totally unexpected reaction, coming as it did from someone
who had just vacationed in Paris.) I promised I would take her
question to the field.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it is as simple as what one biologist said about the McNeil
River: "Perhaps, by learning to live with bears, people can learn to
live with one another."</TE>
<TE>   McNeil Sanctuary grants four-day permits for its bear trips from
June 7 to Aug. 25 each year. Aspiring visitors must apply for permits
by March 1; their applications are entered into a random drawing. To
control the number of visitors, only 10 are chosen for each four-day
trip, with three standbys. As luck would have it, I got standby
status.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors must be self-sufficient, bringing a weatherproof tent,
sleeping bag, foam pad, stove, fuel, cooking kit and utensils, food
for six to eight days (you'll need extra in case you get weathered
in), first-aid kit, rain gear (the weather is typically wet, windy
and cool), flashlight, backpack, day pack and hip waders. This is
wilderness camping, after all. There are no roads and no stores.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a small floatplane, I arrived at McNeil River on a
sparkling summer evening, joining a group that had already been there
for a couple of days. I began my lessons in "bear etiquette" with
Samantha, or Sam, one of the three rangers at the sanctuary. Here the
rules are made for bears. When rangers talk about "stress" and
"harassment," first-time visitors think it's humans' stress level and
harassment that are at issue. But here the world is flip-flopped; the
concern is for the bears. We learned how to tell whether a bear is
stressed, how to relieve stress for bears and how to minimize human
harassment of bears.</TE>
<TE>   The first rule is to stand your ground. Stay still. Never move
quickly or the bear will want to chase you. Prey runs.</TE>
<TE>   If the bear doesn't retreat, one should wave his or her arms
slowly, talk and clap. Some of the young bears "like to bluff and
bluff charge," Sam said. "If you don't back down, they'll veer off
and go another direction."</TE>
<TE>   Remembering this was tricky. The first day, two teenage bruins
came bounding up from the creek straight for me. I was so excited I
smacked into the person behind me.</TE>
<TE>   After the Mudface alert, we sucked through the muck of the tidal
flats, sloshed across Mitfik Creek and sank down on a grassy knoll
where we were soon within arm's length of passing bears.</TE>
<TE>   A scrappy-looking female grizzly lumbered down the opposite bank
and plunged across the creek. Another bear appeared around a bend in
the river, belly-flopped in the water, came up with nothing and
slowly, dejectedly splashed downstream.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," someone said lazily, "two bears coming down the hill behind
us."</TE>
<TE>   Two little fuzzy, golden ears popped up in a meadow of wild iris,
followed by an enormous teddy-bear head with tiny eyes and a mouth
full of sedge grasses. Soon we were surrounded by six bears,
snoozing, chewing grass and lolling around in the water. One pretty
blond female sashayed right past our front-row seats on a bear path
paralleling the creek.</TE>
<TE>   "Oooooh, she's a doll," said Ron, an engineer from the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   She swung her head in our direction, wearing a seemingly ho-hum
expression. But suddenly she stopped. She had heard something. She
swung her head in the other direction and started to pick up the
pace. A big, very black male rounded the river bend in hot pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't sure I had breathed for, oh, 25 minutes or so.</TE>
<TE>   Then, to my surprise, Herm, our group comedian, reached into his
backpack, pulled out a peanut-butter and honey sandwich and began to
eat.</TE>
<TE>   "Herm!" I said in alarm. "What are you doing? We're surrounded by
bears."</TE>
<TE>   I've lived in Alaska for 28 years and have had my share of close
encounters with bears. Bears have a phenomenal sense of smell, and
peanut butter is decidedly aromatic.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Herm wasn't the only one waving the "Come and Get Me"
banner. Down the line, Sam was eating a tuna sandwich. Jim and Ellen,
schoolteachers from an Eskimo village on the Yukon River, were
barbecuing chicken in a bag, the smoke wafting overhead like a
red-flag signal.</TE>
<TE>   Lying back in the grass for a post-sandwich snooze, Herm cocked
his head, opened one eye and said, "Don't worry, Nan. This is our
third day. You'll be like us soon. I'm just getting into 'One Day in
the Life of a Bear': Munch a little grass, catch a few fish, chase a
few girls, take a nap."</TE>
<TE>   What I would learn at McNeil in the following days was that the
bears were aware of us but not interested in us (or our food). They
were much more attuned to what the other bears were doing. Food is
plentiful, and with the careful management at McNeil, the bears have
never learned to associate humans with food.</TE>
<TE>   For six hours we lay in this field surrounded by brown bears, the
largest land carnivores on Earth. It seemed a good time to ask what
draws people here.</TE>
<TE>   "I think bears are cute," said Herm, who thought the desire could
be traced to the storybook bears of childhood, from Winnie-the-Pooh
to Yogi Bear. Ron wanted to see the "top of the food chain" and feel
the exhilaration of being close to a creature so powerful it "can
kill you with one swipe of his paw."</TE>
<TE>   Keith, a massage therapist, put that in perspective. "Yes, bears
can kill you," he said, "but so can people--and they're even more
violent and unpredictable and yet, hey, we still hang out with them."</TE>
<TE>   Back at camp that evening, I asked Tom Griffin, one of the
biologists, why he thought bear-viewing had become so popular in
Alaska in the past several years.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of philosophies about that," he said. "People are
over-urbanized. Their lives are very scheduled. People like to be in
control. Yet there's a yearning, I think, for something else.
Watching wildlife is like an unscripted movie. People leave here
feeling very relaxed."</TE>
<TE>   Part of that relaxation, I was learning, clearly came from slowing
down to Bear Time.</TE>
<TE>   The next day on our way to McNeil River Falls--a two-mile,
moderately strenuous slog, scramble and hike--we climbed up the cliff
to take the bluff walk where we could peer down and see the "bear
beds," terraced ledges where mothers often take their cubs for
napping. As many as 68 bears have been counted fishing at the falls
at one time during the height of the salmon season.</TE>
<TE>   As we pushed our way through the alders, we yelled "Ho, bear!"
"Hey, bears!" "No surprises, bears!"</TE>
<TE>   At the falls, only one bear was trying his luck at fishing. It was
Woofie, the No. 2 alpha male. (Over the years, biologists and
visitors together have christened these bears while watching their
dramas and little soap operas play out.)</TE>
<TE>   "Woofie isn't the biggest bear," Tom said, "but he has the
attitude of the biggest bear. Attitude is important. Size is also
important."</TE>
<TE>   On my last trip to the falls on Day 4, the fish were jumping,
eight bears had gathered and a barroom brawl was about to break out
on the opposite side of the river. Woofie had ambled down from the
meadow. An unidentified male was lurking near Woofie's fishing hole.
There was much salivating and lip popping.</TE>
<TE>   Then they started to do something so charming that I burst out
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," said Sam the ranger, "they're doing the 'cowboy walk.'"</TE>
<TE>   Just like two gunslingers about to go for their weapons, those two
bears widened their stance and started shifting their weight back and
forth, stamping from one foot to the other.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of shooting, they started jaw-sparring, the bear version
of air-kissing. They never made contact but slowly snapped their jaws
on either side of the other's head. It looked almost affectionate.
Then the big male took a tiny step backward, signaling his defeat.
The champ, Woofie, sauntered by disdainfully and flopped back into
his fishing hole.</TE>
<TE>   "Bears do everything in slow motion," Sam said. "But when they
move, they can move fast."</TE>
<TE>   Baldie, a big guy with a bad haircut (he had rubbed off huge
patches of his fur), sat 15 feet in front of us. We were beginning to
feel sorry for him. He occasionally swatted the water, but he
couldn't seem to catch anything.</TE>
<TE>   Four of us decided to descend to the lower viewing pad. The river
roared in front of us, and the bears were eye level to our right and
left. There was a little beaten path about 6 feet in front of us
where bears cruised the riverbank.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly Troublemaker, an active, handsome male and a big-time
swimmer, took a swan dive off the center rock. He had been
showboating all morning--snorkeling upriver, pouncing on fish,
floating the rapids downriver--right under Baldie's nose. He was now
padding through the sedges. The challenge was on.</TE>
<TE>   He was 8 feet from us. Forget the telephoto lens.</TE>
<TE>   Four of us were sandwiched together like fragile wisps of grass. I
was as close to Rich as I could get without leaping into his arms.
Bill was breathing in my ear.</TE>
<TE>   Baldie turned. He slowly started doing the cowboy walk.
Troublemaker advanced. Like gargantuan sumo wrestlers, they shifted
their weight, lumbering in circles.</TE>
<TE>   Rich and I sucked in our breath at the same instant. There was an
electric moment when one big bear was so close to us that our group
flinched as one. A voice inside me screamed, "Run!" With two
missteps, one ton of fighting fur would have landed on top of us.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, in the most dignified voice I could imagine, Rich
whispered, "Don't you think we should be leaving now?"</TE>
<TE>   We held our collective breath. When Troublemaker stepped back,
Baldie turned his back in scorn. A sore loser, Troublemaker thudded
around in circles, rubbing his head in the grass, then plunged into
the river and floated downstream, where he spied Madonna. He couldn't
win the big fishing hole, so he started chasing girls.</TE>
<TE>   He never got lucky. But he did nearly stop our hearts from
beating. I have rarely felt more alive.</TE>

<TE>   Guidebook: Grizzly Times in Alaska</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: To get to McNeil, you fly into Anchorage or Homer.
From LAX, nonstop service is offered on Alaska; restricted round-trip
fares begin at $371.20. From LAX to Homer, there is connecting
service on Alaska; restricted round-trip fares begin at $661.20.</TE>
<TE>   To those who are successful in the lottery bid, the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game, the managing agency for the McNeil River
State Game Sanctuary, will send a list of pilots and air taxi
services that fly to McNeil. Plan on spending at least $400 for this
service.</TE>
<TE>   Entering the lottery: A permit system limits the number of
visitors to the sanctuary to 10 per day from June 7 to Aug. 25. For
each four-day period, 10 regular permits and three standby permits
are issued by random computer lottery. Applications must be
postmarked no later than March 1. There is a nonrefundable $25 fee.
The regular permit costs $350 for lottery winners, and the standby
permit costs $175.</TE>
<TE>   For a lottery application, go to the state's Web site at
www.state.ak.us. Look for Wildlife and Fish, McNeil River. Or you can
request an information packet from the Alaska Department of Fish &amp;
Game, Division of Wildlife Conservation, Att.: McNeil River, 333
Raspberry Road, Anchorage, AK 99518-1599; (907) 267-2182.</TE>
<TE>   When to go: The permitting period generally corresponds to the
salmon runs on Mitfik Creek and McNeil River. Visitors spend their
time on Mitfik Creek in June and on McNeil River in July and August.</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: You will be camping and must bring everything with
you: a good tent, sleeping pads, sleeping bags, stove, fuel, all your
food, clothes, camera gear, film etc. There is a cook cabin for
cooking and eating.</TE>
<TE>   What to wear: Typical summer weather in Alaska and at McNeil River
in particular is often wet, windy and cold, with plenty of
mosquitoes. But some days can be hot. You will definitely want to
take hip waders for slogging through mud and for river crossings,
good rain gear, wool or polypropylene fleece jackets and sweaters,
bug repellent, maybe a mosquito hood; sunscreen, fleece hat, baseball
cap, sunglasses. Throw in a couple of cotton T-shirts for hot weather
(but be advised that cotton is a poor insulator when wet).</TE>
<TE>   Other bear-watching experiences: Katmai National Park and Preserve
in southwest Alaska. Prime bear-viewing times are July and September.
Permits for the campground at Brooks Lake are needed. For
information, Katmai NP&amp;P Field Headquarters, P.O. Box 7, No. 1 King

<HD>Some Great Bargains in Great Britain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARTHUR FROMMER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is no doubt that air fares are rising; no one could have
expected the bargain-basement rates that followed the events of Sept.
11 to remain forever.</LD>
<LD>   But Britain so far remains immune to the rising trend. Still
hurting from the downturn in tourism caused by last year's outbreak
of foot-and-mouth disease, reeling from the post-September decline in
transatlantic traffic and fearful of an ongoing economic slowdown,
British tourism interests continue to run scared. The proof is in the
prices for air-and-land packages to Britain in the coming months.</LD>
<LD>   Take London, the perennial budget buster when it comes to Old
World holidays. For nearly a month to come, a full week in this
bustling capital has been locked in by two tour operators at $399 per
person, with six nights' hotel and air fare from Boston, Newark or
New York. That's the going rate if you book with Gate 1 Travel,
www.gate1travel.com or (800) 682-3333, or Go-Today, www.go-today.com.</LD>
<TE>   Gate 1 and Go-Today remain steady at that price through March 25.
(Gate 1 services New York City at this rate, but the add-on for Los
Angeles can be as low as $136.) Go-Today increases its offer to $599
from New York between April 1 and June 12, and it offers reasonably
priced add-on fares for many cities; you'll pay $150 extra to fly
from Los Angeles, San Francisco or San Diego. Gate 1's price from New
York in April will be $579.</TE>
<TE>   The cost with Virgin Atlantic Vacations
(www.virginatlanticvacations.com) is a bit higher, $729 from Los
Angeles for travel through March 25 and $869 for travel March 26
through June 15.</TE>
<TE>   (In Virgin's defense, it includes more freebies in its packages,
offering a one-day guided bus tour, a pub pass good for one lunch and
a slew of coupons. This is in addition to the round-trip airport
transfers and daily breakfast that all companies offer.)</TE>
<TE>   What about other destinations in the British Isles? They too
remain inexpensive. Travelers to Ireland should check out Sceptre
Ireland, (800) 221-0924 or www.sceptreireland.com, for its unbeatable
rates, barely inflated from winter.</TE>
<TE>   Sceptre's Emerald Package flies travelers from Los Angeles or San
Francisco, puts them up for five nights in farmhouse B&amp;Bs (besides
placing them for the first night in a hotel, for a total of six) and
hands over the keys to a rental car for $699. That's the rate from
now through March 31; it's $739 from April 1 until May 31.</TE>
<TE>   A full Irish breakfast is included in the price.</TE>
<TE>   Sceptre also offers an alternative package that permits you to
spend one of your nights in a genuine castle, known as Dromoland.
From the West Coast the Emerald Castle package costs $799 from now
until March 31, and $939 from May 1 to May 31.</TE>
<TE>   (There is no availability at the castle in April, so the five-star
Adare Manor is substituted at a cost of $839 per week.)</TE>
<TE>   Note that all prices are per person, based on two people traveling
and staying together.</TE>
<TE>   Single room supplement: about $200. Taxes and government security
charges and fees: $110 per person.</TE>

<HD>Largest Youth Travel Agency Files in Bankruptcy Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The student travel industry has been in turmoil in the last few weeks
after New York-based Council Travel, the largest student travel
agency in the U.S., filed for Chapter 11 reorganization Feb. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Although some airlines initially refused to accept tickets issued
by Council Travel or required passengers to fly standby, they later
agreed to honor the tickets, said Michael Burns, vice president of
marketing for the agency in New York. "Our vendors have been very
supportive," he said. "We're still open and operating."</LD>
<LD>   Continental Airlines said it was accepting Council Travel tickets
on a confirmed basis but declined further comment. In filings, it
alleged it had failed to receive payment for 2,800 tickets.</LD>
<TE>   Council Travel has 76 offices in the U.S. and offers negotiated
low fares on more than 40 airlines flying to more than 400
destinations. It was long owned by the nonprofit New York-based
Council on International Educational Exchange, or CIEE, but was sold
to Ireland-based USIT World just before the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   USIT World, which runs a worldwide network of student travel
agencies, filed for "the Irish equivalent of Chapter 11" in late
January, and Council Travel soon followed, seeking bankruptcy
protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York,
Burns said. The parent company was struggling under millions of
dollars in debt, according to the Times of London newspaper; its
British subsidiary shut its doors, the newspaper added.</TE>
<TE>   USIT's major rival, Swiss-owned STA Travel, is interested in
acquiring some of the assets of Council Travel and has put in a bid
to do so with the court, said Nicholas Thomas, Los Angeles-based
president of STA Travel North America. STA runs 57 offices in the
U.S. and close to 400 worldwide.</TE>

<HD>Innovative New Airport Terminal in Detroit</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Detroit today was scheduled to open an innovative, $1.2-billion
airport terminal that serves as Northwest Airlines' biggest hub.</LD>
<LD>   The Edward H. McNamara Terminal claims to be the only airport with
an elevated, enclosed tram in the terminal; it runs the mile-long
length of the concourse. Eventually 80 restaurants and shops,
including the Motown Music Review and gift shops for General Motors
and the Henry Ford Museum, will be located there; about 65 were
expected to be open by today.</LD>
<LD>   Adjusting to security concerns after Sept. 11, the terminal was
redesigned with 21 security checkpoints, 40% more than planned.</LD>
<TE>   Other expansions include 106 ticket counters versus 64 in the old
terminal, about a mile away, and 90 electronic ticketing machines,
triple the number in the old terminal. In a bid to speed luggage
processing, there will be 24 curbside check-in positions (more than
three times as many as in the old terminal) and 18 luggage carousels
versus eight in the old terminal.</TE>
<TE>   At first only Northwest, Continental and KLM will be at the new
terminal. Eventually it is expected to handle 80% to 90% of the
airport's traffic, a spokesman said. For more information visit

<HD>Joining the Jet Set for $109,000 Per Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So you don't have the $6 million you need to buy a small jet? No
problem. It can be yours for just $109,000 a year, and that includes
the aircraft and the crew.</LD>
<LD>   As an alternative to chartering a plane or other so-called
"fractional ownership" plans, Marquis Jet Partners of New York
recently began offering travelers 25 hours of flying time a year,
"wheels up to wheels down," as Marquis CEO Alan Clingman says. The
plane is available 24 hours, seven days a week, with 10 hours'
notice.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, called the Marquis Private Jet Card, is a bit like a
flying timeshare, Clingman says, but with one important difference: A
jet is available when you want it so there are no messy arguments
over who gets, say, Memorial Day.</LD>
<TE>   Larger jets are available and cost up to $329,000 a year for 25
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Marquis is affiliated with NetJets, a company offering fractional
jet ownership whose fleet of 400 planes Marquis uses. (NetJets, in
business for about 15 years, requires buyers to make a five-year
commitment and also charges an hourly rate.) For information: (212)

<LD>Access to the National Park Service's Internet site, www.nps.gov,
which typically gets about 700,000 "hits" per day, was restored Feb.
12 after being blocked for more than two months. Access was restored
by permission of a federal court that blocked it Dec. 5 as part of a

service. The case involves the department's alleged mismanagement of
a trust fund that processes royalties from Indian lands. The court

<HD>Arrowhead's Winter Games</HD>
<DH>Sledding gives kids a taste of snow season, even when
weather won't cooperate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAKE ARROWHEAD, Calif.</DL>
<LD>We went in search of snow. It did not seem an unreasonable quest. It
was late January, after all, and we looked toward the mountains,
where snow is often found.</LD>
<LD>   Our two children had made it through the holidays, through all the
white-mantled tales and movies and songs, patiently accepting our
promises of post-New Year sledding and snow forts. We chose a weekend
when those who live in snow country said the odds were pretty dang
good. But as the preceding week ticked by, the temperature rose and
rose and rose.</LD>
<LD>   From Wrightwood to Big Bear to Arrowhead, no snow had fallen since
a dusting before Thanksgiving. This is why one never should promise
young children anything that one does not actually have stashed in
the back of the garage.</LD>
<TE>   Still, we went in search of snow and found it in the most likely
place. They don't call it Snow Valley for nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Perched between the towns of Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear, Snow
Valley Mountain Resort makes its own snow, and not just for the ski
set. It's made for the sledding set as well.</TE>
<TE>   We left Glendale with a friend's family at 10:30 on a Saturday
morning--two carloads of ski pants and sleds and granola bars and
children--and pulled into Snow Valley's parking lot a bit before
noon. Sliding out of the car, we shivered with anticipation, awaiting
the bracing rush of frosty mountain air.</TE>
<TE>   With temperatures in the low 50s, frost was not a factor;
Arrowhead was cooler than L.A. but warm enough to make Richard and me
feel more than slightly foolish shoving our kids into snow pants.</TE>
<TE>   But there was snow. We could see it from the parking lot: a whole
hill devoted to sleds and saucers, with enough piled up at the bottom
for a decent snow fight or two. So we shouldered our trusty Flexible
Flyers and went to the cashier.</TE>
<TE>   For an Easterner, paying $10 a person to sled is bad enough. But
when the cashier told me that our sleds weren't allowed--we would
have to rent plastic sleds at $5 a pop--I began to question the
wisdom of the whole venture.</TE>
<TE>   I turned to my husband to protest, only to see the three kids in
our group racing toward the snow, laughing and reveling. My friend
and I shrugged and handed the woman three 20s. "And two sleds," we
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was clear why Snow Valley didn't want heavy, traditional runner
sleds on the slopes. The place was mobbed with kids, big ones and
tiny ones, who clearly had little tobogganing training. No one seemed
to grasp the importance of leaning as a steering mechanism. The only
thing these kids knew how to do was scream.</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't matter. Our kids loved it. Loved it. Loved it. The
children made pint-size snow folks, knocked them down and made them
again. Fiona, my younger one at 22 months, wanted to slide down the
hill so many times that my rear end, sans snow pants, went numb from
the cold. My son, Danny Mac, and his friend, Bailey, both
almost-4-year-olds, had numerous races (with rules that changed
depending on who hadn't won in a while).</TE>
<TE>   We brought snacks even though food was also available at the
resort. As the afternoon wore on, the hillside got a bit crowded;
Danny was knocked off his feet by a careening teenager, and while the
little guy manfully got back on the slopes, some of the fun was gone.
Rosy-cheeked and breathless, all three kids were soon eager to get to
the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   One of the joys that offsets the difficulties of traveling with
small children is their unadulterated enthusiasm for staying at a
hotel. Any hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The Lake Arrowhead Resort is right on the water, and as we checked
in we realized we had just enough time to make the last ride of the
Arrowhead Queen, a paddle boat that takes 1 1/2-hour tours around the
lake year-round.</TE>
<TE>   The two families quickly checked out our rooms, two adjoining
units that didn't have lake views but were spacious. After a few
obligatory bounces on the beds and a brief fight over who would push
the elevator buttons, the kids thundered out of the hotel and down
toward the boat.</TE>
<TE>   It was a great big boat, and mercifully only a few
people--patient, lovely people--were on it. Because after the thrill
of watching the wheel turn and the shoreline slide away, the children
were mostly interested in running around.</TE>
<TE>   We asked the captain, who had seen our kids in action, for a
recommendation for dinner. He suggested the Cedar Glen Inn, and it
was perfect: cozy and family oriented, with a big booth in the corner
that gave the kids some wiggle room. The service was fast and
friendly, and most of the food was great. The kids ordered grilled
cheese all around. The adults had lemon pepper chicken, prime rib and
scampi.</TE>
<TE>   The shrimp, unfortunately, wasn't so great. When the waiter
noticed the full plate and discovered my friend didn't like the dish,
he took it off the bill. Everything else was delicious. The kids got
scoops of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup and lots of whipped
cream. The desserts were so large that the adults were forced to help
finish them.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the hotel, we availed ourselves of an outdoor hot tub even
though the temperature had dropped. The resort has two tubs outside,
one ingeniously set at a lower temperature for children. It was just
warm enough for the adults to enjoy, and the kids were as happy as
seals.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, my family ordered room-service breakfast: waffles,
pancakes and two "early risers," spreads that included
cooked-to-order eggs, toast, and bacon or sausage.</TE>
<TE>   While the dads got ready, the moms took the kids to the resort's
small beach, where we skipped stones. Then we all headed out to the
small outlet mall behind the hotel for a little shopping and a visit
to the Lake Arrowhead Children's Museum (admission $3 or $4,
depending on one's age).</TE>
<TE>   "Museum" may be overstating it. The place is more of an elaborate
play area. But the kids had plenty to do: an anthill climbing area, a
faux grocery store, the obligatory firefighter costumes. It was good
for an hour or two, after which it was time for lunch at nearby Casa
Coyotes' Grill &amp; Cantina, where we commandeered the banquet room and
feasted on fairly good quesadillas, tacos, chicken salads and
tortilla soup.</TE>
<TE>   We checked out and said goodbye to our friends. Richard and I had
planned to take our kids hiking in nearby Green Valley. When we
finally did set out for the trail, Fiona and Danny Mac fell sound
asleep in the car. So after driving around a bit and enjoying the
glorious views, we departed. In two hours we were home, promising
ourselves that the moment there was snow, real snow, Christmas-type
snow, we would be back.</TE>

<HD>In Alaska This Summer, It'll Be Anchors Aweigh</HD>
<DH>More cruisers than ever are visiting the state, in some
cases at lower fares than last year's. Itineraries and vessels vary
widely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's gold in them thar ports! Or so it might seem, judging by the
gold rush of cruise ships heading for Alaska this summer, including
the largest vessel ever. For cruisers it means more choices and, in
many cases, more competitive fares.</LD>
<LD>   Although Alaska cruising has been growing in recent years, the
Sept. 11 attacks sent new ships into the market as some cruise lines
decided to pull back from Europe this summer and redeploy to domestic
destinations that some U.S. travelers perceive as safer.</LD>
<LD>   This summer 25 ships from major cruise lines will ply Alaskan
waters, three more than last year, says John Hansen, president of the
North West Cruise Ship Assn. in Vancouver, Canada. They will carry
about 10% more passengers than last year, logging a record 5.5
million "berth days" (number of berths multiplied by days in port),
he says. And those figures don't count small boats from boutique
lines that dart in and out of bays.</LD>
<TE>   The growth is not without controversy. Ruling in a suit by
environmentalists, a federal judge in Anchorage last year ordered
cruise lines to reduce summer visits to scenic Glacier Bay; the
number of visits has since been restored by congressional action.
Some activists remain concerned about the impact of so many ships on
Alaska's environment, even though the industry last year adopted
stricter rules on wastewater discharge and has spent millions to
upgrade antipollution equipment (including plugging some ships into
Juneau's electric grid to avoid emitting diesel smoke in port).</TE>
<TE>   Saying cruise lines should pay their fair share of costs, Alaska
Gov. Tony Knowles earlier this month proposed a $30-per-head tax on
ship passengers to help bail out the state's deficit-ridden budget.
Hansen says his group opposes the tax and will cite the industry's
economic benefits to the state in upcoming hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska cruising continues to grow nonetheless, spurred by
spectacular scenery and sports-minded shore tours. Here's a roundup
of some cruise lines' Alaska plans this season, with an emphasis on
what's new. All prices are per person, double occupancy, mostly based
on brochure rates; lower fares may be available with early-booking
discounts or other specials.</TE>
<TE>   * Princess will send its newest ship, the 2,600-passenger Star
Princess, to Alaska this summer for weeklong cruises. It will be the
largest cruise ship to visit Alaska, says spokeswoman Denise Seomin.
Also among the line's six ships in Alaska (versus five last year)
will be the Regal Princess, which was redeployed for the summer from
Scandinavia, Russia and the Baltics after Sept. 11. It will run
10-night Alaska sailings from San Francisco. There will be 104 Alaska
departures for the line in 2002, 13 more than last year.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Princess plans to open its fifth hotel in the state, the
84-room Copper River Princess Wilderness Lodge, near Wrangell-St.
Elias National Park in south-central Alaska. It will be a base for
excursions by plane, jet boat, raft, canoe and dog sled, as well as
fishing trips. Ten-night packages that combine a stay at the lodge
with a cruise start at $1,749. Cruise-only prices in Alaska start at
$999 for a week. (For the first time, early booking discounts in
Alaska, up to 37%, will be extended through April, a spokeswoman
said.)</TE>
<TE>   * Holland America Line also will have six ships in Alaska this
season. It had planned to drop to five, but after Sept. 11 it
reassigned the 1,380-passenger Amsterdam from Europe to Seattle,
where it will make weeklong Alaska cruises, among other itineraries.
It will be the second Alaska cruise ship based in Seattle. Its faster
22.5-knot speed makes the trip possible in a week.</TE>
<TE>   Fares for Alaska cruises, which a spokesman says cost slightly
less than last year, begin at $799 per week. There are also six new
land tours, plus early-booking discounts through Feb. 28 for combined
land-cruise trips.</TE>
<TE>   * Celebrity Cruises redeployed its 1,870-passenger Mercury from
the Baltics and the Mediterranean for the summer after Sept. 11,
giving it three ships in Alaska this year versus two last year. The
others are the Infinity and Summit, each with a passenger capacity of
1,950. All three make weeklong sailings from Vancouver. Prices begin
at $949; land-cruise packages include rail tours of the Canadian
Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   * Seabourn Cruise Line, which hasn't sailed to Alaska in five
years, decided after Sept. 11 to redeploy its 208-passenger Seabourn
Spirit from the eastern Mediterranean to Vancouver for mostly 10- or
11-night sailings to Alaska. Most were sold out by early February,
and Seabourn does not plan to return to Alaska next year, a spokesman
says. Fares start at $3,499.</TE>
<TE>   * The others: Several major lines will station one or two ships
each in Alaska. Norwegian Cruise Line's 2,002-passenger Norwegian Sky
will do weeklong Alaska itineraries from Seattle. The 1,748-passenger
Norwegian Wind will make weeklong sailings from Vancouver. Fares
begin at $749. Royal Caribbean International has its 1,800-passenger
Legend of the Seas and 2,100-passenger Radiance of the Seas doing
seven-night trips. Fares, which are mostly lower than last year,
begin at $949. Land-cruise packages include rail tours of the
Canadian Rockies. Carnival Cruise Lines' 1,124-passenger Carnival
Spirit will return with weeklong Vancouver-Alaska sailings. Fares
begin at $799. Radisson's Seven Seas Navigator, with 490 passengers,
will make mostly weeklong sailings from Vancouver. Fares begin at
$2,695. Crystal Cruises' 940-passenger Crystal Harmony returns with
mostly 12-night sails from San Francisco. Fares for these begin at
$2,975.</TE>
<TE>   * "Boutique" ships: Several companies offer Alaska cruises mostly
on small vessels, many of which can enter smaller, more remote bays.
Some also offer adventurous sports or tour options. Cruise West's six
ships carry 70 to 114 people each. New offerings include bush-plane
tours of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and a 13-night cruise
between Prince William Sound and Nome. Fares begin at $1,069 for a
four-night cruise. American Safari Cruises added a third yacht, the
12-passenger Safari Escape, this year; its two other yachts carry 12
and 22 passengers each. They run various itineraries between Sitka
and Prince Rupert. New this year, you can combine back-to-back
cruises for a 14-night trip. Fares begin at $3,695 for eight days.
Glacier Bay Cruiseline operates five- to nine-night cruises on its
three boats, which carry 35 to 92 passengers each. Fares begin at
$1,380; there's no single supplement for May and September trips.
Lindblad Expeditions continues to run weeklong and 10-night
itineraries on its two 70-passenger boats. Fares begin at $3,690.
World Explorer Cruises' single ship, the 737-passenger Universe
Explorer, makes eight- to 14-night sailings from Vancouver that
emphasize the area's culture, biology and geology. Fares begin at
$1,525.</TE>

<HD>A 'City of Gold' Shines On</HD>
<DH>A wealth of ruins from a thriving kingdom gives Gyeongju
its ancient appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTIN JOHANNSEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>GYEONGJU, South Korea</DL>
<LD>Atop her tower here, Queen Seondeok must have been pleased. In the
year 640, her capital of glittering palaces and pagodas spread out in
all directions from the Cheomseongdae observatory, an architectural
star in its own right.</LD>
<LD>   Foreigners called Silla, the ancient kingdom of what is today
South Korea, the "land of bright silver and gold" and spoke of its
wealth and culture. Seondeok had ordered this stone tower built to
assist her royal astronomers in mapping the heavens, but it also
provided a splendid view over her domain.</LD>
<LD>   Fourteen centuries later, I stood gazing up at that observatory in
the heart of Gyeongju (formerly spelled Kyongju), now a city of about
300,000. The kingdom of Silla endured nearly a thousand years, from
57 BC to about AD 935, a center of arts, science and philosophy. It
was from Silla that the young nation of Japan learned Buddhism and
the art of ceramics. Today the remains of Silla's capital are one of
Asia's cultural jewels.</LD>
<TE>   My husband, Kevin, and I spent four days last autumn exploring the
city once known as Keumseong, the "City of Gold." I lived in Seoul
during the boom years of the 1980s and wanted to return to trace the
historic roots of this dynamic nation.</TE>
<TE>   Many Silla landmarks, like the star observation tower, lie in
downtown Gyeongju. Cheomseongdae, we learned, combines two Silla
obsessions: beauty and science. From a square base, the tower curves
up gracefully and tapers to a square platform. It's an elegant design
crammed with symbolism.</TE>
<TE>   The base is made of 12 stone blocks, representing the number of
months in a year. The tower walls are made of smaller blocks stacked
horizontally in 28 layers, representing the number of major
constellations. And the total number of blocks used in the tower's
construction equals the days in a lunar year. These details and the
observatory's other astronomical features are particularly impressive
given it was built more than 900 years before Galileo devised the
world's first optical telescope.</TE>
<TE>   Modern Gyeongju (pronounced kyoung-joo) makes the most of its
Silla ancestry. We stayed at the Silla-Jang Hotel, a modest,
Korean-style place where we slept on thick mats covering a heated
floor. We bought snacks in the Silla Grocery. We almost had lunch at
the Silla Restaurant, but the wait was too long. (Instead we ate a
delicious rice-and-vegetable dish called bibimbap two doors down at
Cheonmaweon.) Then there's the Silla Cinema, the Silla Bakery, the
Silla Shooting Gallery</TE>
<TE>   The most renowned Silla site is Bulguksa Temple (formerly spelled
Pulguksa). In case there was any doubt, the Korean government has
named it Historic Landmark No. 1. On the Sunday afternoon we visited,
we seemed to be jostling along with half the country.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of a lane of flame-red maples, the temple's vibrantly
painted wood pavilions floated above a terrace of golden stone.
Bulguksa means "Buddha Land," and when entering you make a symbolic
journey from the everyday world into the celestial realm. Stone
bridges and arches banded like rainbows soar from Earth to the
heavenly temple. In the courtyard, two huge granite pagodas--one
square and austere, the other as ornate as a wedding cake--enshrine
the sacred remains of the holiest monks.</TE>
<TE>   The temple's graceful curves are pictured on the Korean 10-won
coin. But Bulguksa, we were astonished to learn the next day, was not
Silla's most important temple--or even the largest. In the Gyeongju
National Museum, we saw a diorama of an enormous temple, since
destroyed, with a wooden pagoda reaching 20 stories high, another
accomplishment of the ambitious Queen Seondeok.</TE>
<TE>   The display cases of the museum are stuffed with gold. Kings and
queens wore branched crowns of gold filigree, each piece dripping
gold spangles and pale jade teardrops. Massive gold belts were
decorated with gold streamers that trailed gold pendants hung with
gold balls. Even Silla horses wore gold ornaments, and palace
retainers ate with gold-plated spoons.</TE>
<TE>   Archeologists excavating the mud of a palace pond found gilded
Buddha statues, ladles, even scissors. Silla's prosperity and
opulence were based on ever-expanding trade, advances in
technology--and the labor of slaves.</TE>
<TE>   At noon in the museum courtyard, we joined the crowd around a
12-foot-high bronze bell, waiting to hear its thunderous recorded
voice. The Emille Bell, cast in 771, is a monstrous instrument with a
monstrous tale behind it.</TE>
<TE>   Legend has it that after several attempts to cast the bell failed,
a baby girl was thrown into the molten metal as a sacrifice, and the
new casting succeeded. (Scholars debate the truth of this tale.) The
name, pronounced EM-ee-leh, meant "mommy" in the language of
Silla--supposedly the voice of the murdered child calling.</TE>
<TE>   Near the museum, local friends treated us to one of the most
spectacular meals I've enjoyed. Weonpung Restaurant serves
hanjeongsik, or "Korean set meal"--hardly a name that does justice to
the dazzling array of 41 fish and vegetable dishes placed in front of
us. It was such an elaborate banquet that waiters carried in the
entire table, already set. We were relieved to hear later that such
feasts can be quite reasonably priced--less than $10 per person.</TE>
<TE>   But in Gyeongju, such pleasures of the present are still
overshadowed by the aura of the past. At Poseokjeong, the royal
garden, we walked along the stone-lined watercourse where kings and
courtiers played a poetry game. One person floated a cup of wine
downstream to another player. If the second person couldn't finish
the verse before the wine arrived, he had to drain the cup.</TE>
<TE>   At Gyerim, an ancient grove of terrifically gnarled trees, we
learned the answer to one nagging question: Why are so many Koreans
named Kim? According to legend, a Silla prime minister was passing
this forest when he saw a mysterious gold box hanging from a tree.
Inside he found a little boy, whom the childless king declared crown
prince. He gave the boy the family name Kim, meaning "gold." Today an
estimated 20% of the population bears the name of that royal clan.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere in Gyeongju we saw huge grass-covered mounds, the tombs
of Silla monarchs. There's even a small one on the main street,
between a car-rental office and a coffee shop.</TE>
<TE>   Tumuli Park (spelled Dumulli in some books and maps) in downtown
Gyeongju, the resting place of 20 kings and queens, is a chain of
artificial miniature "mountains," the largest nearly 75 feet high and
400 feet in diameter. It felt like time made visible, each green
shape representing a reign, a life's work.</TE>
<TE>   Gyeongju's broader landscape is a wide plain surrounded by low
mountains, with bike routes fanning out to Silla sites. The brick
paths are ideal for leisurely cycling except, we discovered, in fall,
when they become handy spots for farmers to dry their crops. Dodging
mounds of rice, we pedaled rented bikes to Bori-sa temple, not a
tourist attraction but a monastery founded during Silla times.</TE>
<TE>   In Korean Buddhism, female clergy don't like to be called nuns.
Men as well as women are called monks, living in separate monasteries
but sharing equal status. Inside the Buddha hall at Bori-sa, a female
monk stood before a swirling heaven of gold, a carved panel of the
Buddha surrounded by 24 celestial beings. From the ceiling hung
hundreds of yellow and pink paper lanterns shaped like lotus
blossoms. The only sound was her chanting and the temple cat meowing
for its lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen more minutes of biking brought us to a recent Silla
revival, the Hwarang Educational Institute, opened in 1973. Silla's
hwarang ("flower youth") was an elite corps of young men who studied
warfare and martial arts, plus literature, dance and Buddhist
doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   According to the sign, the present-day school aims to train "new
Hwarangs who will glorify their fatherland in every respect." But the
complex gave me a chill. Built under Park Chung Hee, who ruled Korea
with an iron fist from 1961 to 1979, the fortress-like tile-roofed
buildings and military-precise trees looked and felt like the legacy
of a dictator.</TE>
<TE>   Farther up the road is Gyeongju Folkcraft Village, with studios
and shops in traditional Korean houses. We watched artists at the
Silla Kiln reproduce the delicate gray earthenware of the ancient
kingdom. Seated at foot-powered potter's wheels, they shaped the clay
while consulting photos of museum pieces. Just as in the National
Museum, the pottery is unglazed, decorated with complex patterns of
incised lines.</TE>
<TE>   Stopping for lunch at the snack bar, we noticed that Korean ramen
barely resembles those bland packets in U.S. supermarkets. Our bowls
of noodles were sizzling red with chili flakes, thickened with egg
drops and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   As we pedaled off on the last part of our circuit, the road turned
steep. I didn't realize we had been gradually climbing all day until
we reached the top of an incline. Suddenly we were roaring downhill
so fast my sunglasses nearly blew off. We rocketed past Bomun Lake
Resort, a grandiose complex of luxury hotels, raced through
Gyeongju's suburbs and found ourselves back downtown in no time.</TE>
<TE>   But Silla's spiritual heart can be visited only the slow way--on
foot. Mt. Namsan, just south of Gyeongju, was a long ridge covered
with temples, tombs, pagodas, hermitages, statues and rock carvings.
Nearly 300 religious sites remain, with a spider web of trails
linking them.</TE>
<TE>   Starting from Samneung, a cluster of burial mounds, we walked up
through ancient, twisted pines and came to a carved stone image of
Buddha. Though its head had disappeared centuries ago, someone had
just lighted sticks of incense at its feet.</TE>
<TE>   A hundred feet farther up, white candles and a heap of persimmons
were placed as tokens of gratitude before a rock carving of
Kwanseum-bosal, the goddess of compassion. When we finally turned
back, a well-dressed couple climbed past with yellow chrysanthemums
as an offering.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen more trails awaited, but we didn't have time. We had saved
the most remarkable Silla sight for last.</TE>
<TE>   At Seokguram, a stone Buddha is enshrined in a man-made cave 2,000
feet high on a mountainside. After centuries of neglect and
ham-handed "restorations" that nearly destroyed it, the grotto is
protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</TE>
<TE>   The road to Seokguram winds upward through miles of hairpin bends.
One Korean told me that when he went there as a child, it took half a
day to hike up the mountain path. At the road's end, a simple wooden
shelter conceals a sublime work of art.</TE>
<TE>   The Buddha inside the cave feels as though it grew from the
mountainside, like a jewel formed inside the earth. Its expression
radiates power, wisdom and tranquillity; that human hands could coax
this from cold stone seemed something of a miracle. Delicate carvings
of disciples, guardians and celestial spirits in pale granite adorn
the chamber.</TE>
<TE>   We were amazed to find a service underway behind the glass barrier
that protects the stone Buddha from sightseers. Dozens of bowing and
chanting worshipers were packed together before the Buddha, all led
by monks in flowing gray robes.</TE>
<TE>   Seokguram is the pinnacle not only of Silla's art but of its
science. Unlike the caves in India it was modeled after, this grotto
was not carved into soft sandstone but built from impeccably cut
blocks of limestone, laid without mortar. The Buddha gazes over the
Sea of Japan (or the East Sea, as Koreans call it), five miles away.
It faces 30 degrees southeast--the exact location of sunrise on the
winter solstice, when the sun begins to grace each advancing day with
a bit more light.</TE>
<TE>   After more than 12 centuries, the Buddha of Seokguram still looks
out over the water, protecting this realm. And though the Silla
kingdom has long vanished, swallowed by aggressive neighbors, we had
found its spirit alive and well.</TE>

$8 per person. Ask for hanjeongsik, or ''Korean set meal.''</TE>
<TE>   East on the same street, Cheonmaweon Restaurant has an English
menu of Korean favorites, including samgyetang (ginseng chicken, $6)
and bibimbap (rice and vegetables with egg, $5).</TE>
<TE>   Ultari Eopneun Mandujip, 106 Donggan-no, near Silla-Jang Hotel. It
serves quick, tasty meals of mandu (meat dumplings, $4). Watch the
chef in the front window making mandu by hand.</TE>

<HD>A Veritable Feast in the British Aisles</HD>
<DH>Finding food for thought--and a well-priced meal --in
London's department stores.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRENE WOODBURY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Food is comfort. And on a recent monthlong trip to London during
troubling times, my husband, Dick, and I often found comfort in some
of the greatest food halls of the world: Fortnum &amp; Mason, Selfridges,
Marks &amp; Spencer and Harrods.</LD>
<LD>   Our forays into the department stores' epicurean arenas, packed
with exotic produce, international groceries and takeout restaurants,
began innocently enough. After spending hours on tourist activities
most days, we retreated to one store or another for lunch or tea and,
along with it, some first-rate people-watching, browsing and gift
shopping. By the end of the first week, these visits were the
highlight of our days.</LD>
<LD>   The halls were often more interesting than museums, more
entertaining than galleries and livelier than the theater. More
important, when the world was rocked by conflict after Sept. 11, the
halls became a sanctuary for us. It was reassuring to see so many
international cuisines mingled under one roof. It gave us hope for
the world.</LD>
<TE>   From the prepared dishes in the delis to the takeout dishes and
packaged groceries, the selection reflected London's status as an
international hub.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out that the halls' restaurants were a good way to save
money on meals in the notoriously expensive city. Their prices are
comparable to, or lower than, what many London restaurants charge.
They're also ideal places to buy gifts and edible souvenirs.</TE>
<TE>   We found that each hall has a personality. Fortnum is regal and
traditional; Selfridges is festive; Marks &amp; Spencer, practical and
unpretentious; and Harrods, sumptuous. Each hall provided a
fascinating look at British life and cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   Fortnum &amp; Mason</TE>
<TE>   The queen mother of London food halls, this landmark on Piccadilly
has been a grocer to every British monarch since the mid-1700s.</TE>
<TE>   I surveyed dark wood shelves lined with packages of tea, jars of
marmalade, mustards, marinated vegetables and quail eggs, tins of
biscuits, chocolates and fish. More than half the products displayed
are Fortnum's brand.</TE>
<TE>   In the elegant confectionery, candied fruits glistened beside
trays of chocolate truffles. The cheese department featured an
assortment from a runny French vacherin  to the buttery English
Waterloo and Wigmore.</TE>
<TE>   The tea department, which smelled of exotic fruits and spices, was
equally impressive, with bins of loose-leaf Ceylon teas, Chinese
teas, Indian teas and India-Ceylon combinations, such as royal blend
and Queen Anne's Breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   Walking around these lavish displays--on crimson carpeting under
crystal chandeliers, and surrounded by tweedy shoppers--I felt as if
I had stepped into a scene from "My Fair Lady." Even the fastidious
professor Henry Higgins would be at home here among the stock boys in
black cutaway coats, vests and ties and the polite clerks, natty in
black or gray pinstripes.</TE>
<TE>   After all the browsing, Dick and I needed refreshment, so we
stopped at the Patio, where, for $17 each, we had a pot of robust
Fortnum &amp; Mason blend tea, Welsh rarebit crumpets with bacon, scones
with clotted cream and strawberry preserves, and shortbread. It was a
substantial tea in an elegant setting and reasonably priced by London
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Another day we tried the store's St. James for lunch, where the
menu featured a fixed price for a two- or three-course meal. A lunch
of lobster bisque followed by Shropshire blue-cheese tart with
grilled tomato, peppers and green onion cost $27. With a third course
of cheese or dessert--I chose a fruit salad, while Dick dug into a
slice of decadent chocolate torte--the price was $30. The food and
live piano were delightful.</TE>
<TE>   Formal tea in this crisp-linen setting can cost $25 to $28 per
person. Welsh rarebit with sweet-cured bacon, scrambled eggs and
smoked salmon on "granary" toast, or freshly baked scones with
clotted cream and strawberry preserves are among the choices.</TE>
<TE>   The Fountain serves the most formal breakfast offered at any of
the halls, from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. At $17, the substantial meal is,
for this city, reasonably priced.</TE>
<TE>   Selfridges</TE>
<TE>   For a food hall that's more festive than opulent, hie thee to
Selfridges. Near the Bond Street Underground station on Oxford
Street, one of London's busiest shopping areas, the hall is on the
ground floor of the block-long Selfridges &amp; Co. Department Store. An
Oxford Street landmark, the store was built by Chicago millionaire
Gordon Selfridge and opened in 1909.</TE>
<TE>   The food hall is an ongoing party. As upbeat background music
plays, shoppers sample Belgian chocolates or Spanish chorizo.</TE>
<TE>   When we visited I counted 20 lamb, chicken and vegetable
dishes--from fiery to mild--in the Indian department. There were
boxed sushi and sashimi lunches in the Japanese department, and sweet
and savory pastries, salads and dips at the Mediterranean counter.
The clerks put on a show as they fill orders, bantering with the
customers and offering samples.</TE>
<TE>   The bakery has 170 kinds of goods; the deli, 25 varieties of
salami and 30 types of sausage, from Thai style and Toulouse to wild
boar and venison. The confectionery is one of the greatest chocolate
collections in the world, with 200 types and original flavors
including pink peppercorn, juniper, Earl Grey and bittersweet orange.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, there are aisles and aisles of packaged foods
(which make wonderful gifts): coffees, teas, sauces, chutneys,
marmalades, mustards, biscuits. Our Selfridges' shopping bag held a
box of English Victorian mints ($7), a 6-ounce jar of honey from
Essex ($4), a 16-ounce can of lobster bisque ($2), a large square of
Brazil nut toffee ($5).</TE>
<TE>   Selfridges is also a great place for breakfast, lunch or tea, with
about 10 eateries in the hall and 15 throughout the store. At the
Sienna Cafe on the lower level, we took in a fashion show on a TV
monitor as we sipped tea and munched shortbread. On another teatime
visit we listened to two girls singing and playing guitars on a
nearby stage.</TE>
<TE>   On the ground floor are several more restaurants, all good lunch
spots. There's the YO! Sushi Bar, which sells sushi off a revolving
belt; the small Balcony Wine Bar, with soups, salads and sandwiches;
and the marble-countered Oyster Bar, which offers fish-based soups,
salads and seafood plates, including lobster soup ($8), crayfish and
mango salad ($11), marinated prawns ($17), smoked haddock ($6) and
hand-carved smoked salmon ($14).</TE>
<TE>   Our favorite lunch spot at Selfridges was the least expensive and
most casual. The Eat Cafe claims to serve the best soups in London.
Dick, who has a passion for soup, says this deli gets close. Each
week the list of choices is posted in small (12 ounces, about $3.50)
or big (16 ounces, about $4) sizes, and with "simple" or "bold"
spicing. When we were there, the offerings included roast pumpkin (my
favorite), Moroccan root vegetable, cream of leek and potato, Thai
chicken with ginger and coconut, vegetarian chili, carrot and
coriander, and a fine crab bisque. (Eat even has its own Web site at
www.eatcafe.co.uk so fans can check out the soups of the day.)</TE>
<TE>   Eat's sandwiches were equally tempting: cheese and Branston pickle
mayonnaise on freshly baked sweet malted bread ($2), Tuscan tuna
($3.50), lean ham and mustard salad ($2.40), smoked salmon and egg
mayonnaise ($4), crayfish and lettuce ($4).</TE>
<TE>   We ate here several times, and the food was always delicious and
complemented by the bustling atmosphere. No other London food hall is
as entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   Marks &amp; Spencer</TE>
<TE>   As we explored, we discovered there was a food hall for every
mood. When we wanted to be dazzled, we went to Fortnum &amp; Mason or
Harrods; when we wanted to be energized, we went to Selfridges; and
when we wanted to relax, we went to reliable and oh-so-reasonable
Marks &amp; Spencer.</TE>
<TE>   Marks &amp; Spencer began in Leeds Market, England, in 1912 with the
slogan, "Don't ask the price--it's a penny." That philosophy of
practicality and value is reflected in the sensible lighting, the
simple decor and the plain dark blue suits worn by food hall
employees.</TE>
<TE>   The food hall takes up the lower level of the department store. We
went there first because it's next to Selfridges on Oxford Street and
returned because of its Coffee Bar.</TE>
<TE>   We usually dragged into the store around 4 or 5 p.m., tired and
hungry after a long day of touring. Our first stop was always the
Coffee Bar, a large, cheery, family-friendly cafe with low prices.</TE>
<TE>   Many coffee and tea places in London charge about $20 for tea for
two. At the Coffee Bar, prices range from $1.50 for a regular
espresso to $3 for a large caramel latte. A pot of tea or a cup of
filtered coffee is $1.50. The place had all the usual treats that
make afternoon tea satisfying: Devon scones ($1.30), turkey and
stuffing sandwiches ($4), Black Forest cake ($3), apple and raspberry
cheesecake ($3) and, to keep the children happy, a colorful cardboard
lunchbox that contained a sandwich, pictures and colored pencils
($4).</TE>
<TE>   When we managed to extricate ourselves from the Coffee Bar, we
browsed through aisles of beautifully packaged and relatively
inexpensive items. We brought back tins of Marks &amp; Spencer Luxury
Belgian chocolate biscuits ($14), huge hits with friends and family.
And our own pantry is still stocked with tins of Cafe Chocolate Drink
Mix ($2), several large cans of Scottish salmon ($6), Marks &amp; Spencer
Boxing Day Chutney ($2), a box of 80 Marks &amp; Spencer Ceylon teabags
($3) and a box of 18 Marks &amp; Spencer petits fours ($6).</TE>
<TE>   The take-away department has modestly priced salads (from about
$3) and a line of sandwiches created by six prominent English chefs.
Among the offerings: roast chicken with harissa mayonnaise and cos
(romaine) lettuce; marinated prawns with spicy mayonnaise, baby
spinach leaves and cilantro in a chili and onion roll; pesto apple
slices, field mushrooms and butternut squash with watercress on
whole-grain bread.</TE>
<TE>   Harrods</TE>
<TE>   Although we have been to Harrods many times, we are still dazzled
by the seven cavernous rooms on the ground and lower levels that make
up its food hall. It's hard to believe this four-block-long,
multistory building with 3,000 employees and more than 100,000
food-hall products started out in 1849 as a one-room grocery shop
owned by Charles Henry Harrod.</TE>
<TE>   The present Harrods was built between 1900 and 1911 and features
many of the original details: white marble floors, carved white wood
ceilings, Royal Doulton tiles, carved marble counters and murals.
Like Fortnum &amp; Mason, Harrods is a historical landmark.</TE>
<TE>   But we didn't spend too much time looking at the walls or
ceilings; the sights and smells of the food were overpowering. The
aroma of roasting fowl, sizzling steaks, grilled sea bass and king
prawns, spicy pizzas fresh from the oven and steaming Turkish coffee
drifted through the hall.</TE>
<TE>   Choosing one of the 10 restaurants was a challenge. A
mouthwatering menu beckoned at the Tapas Bar, where Spanish music
filled the air. A choice of three tapas--for example, marinated
anchovies with olives and gazpacho jelly, deep-fried calamari with
black rice, and grilled chorizo with Spanish ham--was $21 per person.
We were equally tempted by the Salt Beef Bar, where hungry diners
lined up for hot, hefty salt beef, turkey pastrami or beef tongue
sandwiches on rye or crusty bread served with marinated cucumbers or
pickled vegetables for $18.</TE>
<TE>   In the Sea Grill we were tantalized by grilled prawns, octopus
salad, Scottish smoked salmon and oysters Rockefeller. But Dick
couldn't resist the fish and chips, a filet of cod in beer yeast
batter, for $21. He pronounced it the best he had ever tasted.</TE>
<TE>   A handsome pub on the lower level, the Green Man, serves the
traditional English fare my husband and I love. At one lunch, Dick
savored the turkey cranberry pie for $10; I sampled the English
cheese platter with generous portions of Kirkham's Lancashire,
Ticklemore and Cashel Blue.</TE>
<TE>   The bear-shaped biscuits ($11), milk chocolate truffles ($11) and
lemon biscuits ($5) we brought back from the food halls were hits
with neighbors. The fresh food departments have 350 cheeses, 150
breads, 1,400 wines and spirits, 151 varieties of tea, 27 types of
coffee, 45 homemade pates and 65 types of smoked fish, in addition to
caviars, oysters, foie gras, Scottish smoked salmon, Aberdeen Angus
beef, sushi and homemade pasta.</TE>
<TE>   Fortified, with shopping bags full and budget intact, Dick and I
headed back to London's streets, knowing we could find comfort,
culture and the world's cuisine in those hallowed halls.</TE>

<LD>While we admire those stalwart souls who set out along France's
canals in self-drive rental barges, we confess to a streak of
hedonism, preferring to let someone else do the work so we can sit
back and enjoy the countryside.</LD>
<LD>   Last summer we cruised aboard the Liberte, a vintage
eight-passenger hotel barge from French Country Waterways, with three
other American couples and a crew of four, who introduced us to
French villages we had never encountered and gave us a graduate
course in French cuisine at every lunch and dinner.</LD>
<LD>   We left the driving to Mark, the cooking to Jane, the sightseeing
excursions to Natalie and the selection of wines and cheeses to
Severine. During a July heat wave, we spent six romantic days
meandering along the scenic Nivernais Canal between Auxerre and
Clamecy in Burgundy.</LD>
<TE>   Now the mail renews our daydreams of reliving that week with news
that French Country Waterways is offering a discount for April
sailings--bringing prices on the Liberte down to $2,895 per person,
double occupancy, which includes all wines, cocktails, transfers from
Paris, daily excursions and dinner in a Michelin two-star restaurant.
(This offer is available only on individual bookings, not charters.)</TE>
<TE>   The Liberte, built in Holland in 1971, is as sturdy and sensible
as a pair of wooden shoes, and as trimly rigged inside as a sailboat.
There are four passenger cabins, each with built-in beds and
cabinetry and a bath, air conditioner and windows that open and
close. While it seems compact, there is plenty of room to store
everything. During the heat wave, the dress code aboard was casual,
usually the same shorts and T-shirts we wore for excursions.</TE>
<TE>   There is a bar and sitting room on the same level as the cabins
and, one level up, a dining table with a banquette along one wall and
five chairs on the other side and at the head and foot. A sideboard
filled the wall behind the chairs, and windows all around closed with
leather straps.</TE>
<TE>   Doors are low, so passengers have to duck going in and out of the
barge and up and down the stairs. People in wheelchairs or with
walkers would not be able to navigate the passageways outside or
below decks.</TE>
<TE>   Smoking is banned on the barge; so are children younger than 18.</TE>
<TE>   The wide deck is flat, with an outdoor dining table and eight
chairs, plus eight plastic loungers arranged between tubs of bright
petunias, marigolds and geraniums. There is no awning or sun cover,
but rather a series of umbrellas that occasionally have to be lowered
when a low bridge is ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Food, especially local wines and cheeses, is a highlight of any
barge cruise, and the Liberte served the most delicious meals that we
can recall in a decade of hotel barge sailings. Jane Martin, the
English chef, presented lunches of fresh vegetable salads--fresh corn
salad with mayonnaise and herbs, tiny fingerling potatoes boiled and
tossed with whole-grain mustard and fresh rosemary, poached turkey
breast with toasted pine nuts and sliced fresh artichoke hearts--with
local cheeses and fresh fruit for dessert, and accompanied by chilled
local wines.</TE>
<TE>   We often lunched on the deck under the shade of a giant umbrella.
Dinners were sit-down affairs in the dining room, with white and red
Burgundies, grilled fresh foie gras or cold tomato soup, grilled duck
breast with port or salmon filet with fresh ginger, salad and
cheeses, a warm tart with homemade apple sorbet or a chocolate mousse
with banana pecan ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   The Nivernais Canal is much less traveled than the Burgundy Canal,
and we encountered more self-drive rental barges than other hotel
barges. The itinerary begins in Auxerre one week, Clamecy the next,
and includes an afternoon of wine-tasting in the village of Chablis,
a visit to the Basilica of la Madeleine in Vezelay, a dinner at the
two-star Michelin restaurant L'Esperance, a walking tour of historic
Auxerre, a visit to the medieval village and chateau at
Druyes-les-Belles-Fontaines, a steep hike uphill to Mailly-le-Chateau
and a tour of the castle and park of Bazoches, home of Louis XIV's
great military engineer Marechal de Vauban.</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty of time to hike or bike along the towpaths; the
barges travel only about 5 mph, and they carry enough bicycles for
all the passengers to take on and off at the locks. Our six fellow
passengers were in their 60s.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone showed up promptly for breakfast, most of us having
already explored the village where the barge was tied up for the
night. After breakfast we walked along the towpaths or sat on deck in
the breeze as we navigated the locks, waving at fishermen and
greeting the dogs that seemed to be waiting for the Liberte. We soon
learned why: Natalie tossed bread to the swans and fed scraps of ham
to the dogs when she leaped off the barge to secure the ropes at the
locks.</TE>
<TE>   After lunch some of us napped, while others read and dozed on the
deck if there wasn't an excursion planned. In the evenings, after a
long dinner, we sat out on deck in the dark, chatting or just
listening to the sounds of the canal as we sipped coffee or cognac.</TE>
<TE>   French Country Waterways represents not only the Liberte but four
other barges that cruise in France, the Horizon II and Esprit in
Burgundy, the Nenuphar in the Loire and the Princess in Champagne and
Alsace-Lorraine. All carry from eight to 18 passengers. To get more
information, contact a travel agent, call French Country Waterways at
(800) 222-1236 or log on to www.fcwl.com.</TE>

<HD>Stretch Out in 'Extension' of Torrey Pines Reserve</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The lovely canyons and sandstone ridges just inland from Torrey Pines
State Reserve in San Diego were slated to become condo country in the
late 1970s. Developers were paving roads and chopping down trees when
conservation groups raised money to acquire additional land for the
reserve.</LD>
<LD>   The land, called the Extension, is set apart, north of the rest of
Torrey Pines State Reserve and southeast of Del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   It offers a couple of short, picturesque hikes across sandstone
formations and among rare Torrey pine trees, which grow only in San
Diego and on one of the Channel Islands, Santa Rosa.</LD>
<TE>   Although the Extension lacks the coastal access of the main part
of the reserve, it's equally intriguing--a bit of native, natural
Southern California ringed by housing developments.</TE>
<TE>   In spring, look for lots of bright yellow blossoms--the bush
sunflower, the taller tree poppy and sea dahlias. Hummingbirds hover
around even more yellow, that of larkspur. Yerba santa, with its
clusters of lavender flowers, contributes to the colorful show, as do
purple snapdragons and red Indian pinks.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: The Extension has multiple
entrances, many hard to find. First-time visitors should enter via
Del Mar Scenic Parkway. From Interstate 5 south of Del Mar, exit at
Carmel Valley Road and drive west about one mile. Turn right on Del
Mar Scenic Parkway and go to the end of this cul-de-sac.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: At road's end, join Margaret Fleming Trail, a path that
honors the niece of Abner Doubleday, who gained fame as the inventor
of baseball (a claim later proved to be false). Fleming was an
accomplished nature painter and a force in the establishment of the
Extension. The trail loops around a basin dotted with Torrey pines.</TE>
<TE>   Hikers also can follow the Mar Scenic Trail, which angles west and
connects to the engaging DAR (Daughters of the American Revolution)
Trail, which climbs a tree-shaded ridge to reach great views.</TE>
<TE>   Trails here are in decent condition, but they're a bit narrower
and less defined than paths in the main part of the reserve. Wander
at will, making a short loop or connecting paths in a figure-eight.</TE>
<TE>   Eastern views are dominated by housing developments, but western
panoramas take in Los Penasquitos lagoon, pine-covered bluffs and the
Pacific.</TE>

<LD>In May 1984 I traveled extensively in Italy with my father, mother
and sister. Our visit was to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
battle of Monte Cassino, in which my father's outfit, the Polish 2nd
Corps, which fought under the British 8th Army, played a decisive
role.</LD>
<LD>   Among the many sites we visited were three Polish cemeteries,
which stood out for me because they held the remains of thousands of
Poles who had died liberating Italy from the Germans. It therefore
came as a surprise to learn, when reading the article by Gwen
O'Sullivan Romagnoli ("Tragedy Reforges a Bond Lost to the Past in a
Onetime Home," Jan. 27), that only Americans liberated Italy during
World War II. In reality the country was liberated by an
international fighting force consisting of Americans, British,
French, Italians, New Zealanders, Canadians, South Africans, Indians,
Brazilians and Poles.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Romagnoli's article told a beautiful story of the solidarity and
sympathy shown by the Italians. It helped to explain the tender and
concerned letters I received recently from my relatives in Northern
Italy about the Sept. 11 tragedy. But it was also interesting to read
her account of events, such as the Vietnam War, that created
anti-American sentiments over those years.</TE>

<LD>Reflecting on the canal trip in Burgundy ("Do-It-Yourself Skippers in
Burgundy," Feb. 3), I couldn't help but think that author Alan
Solomon purposely set up the trip to be humorous and disastrous. No
one would consider such a trip after reading it.</LD>
<LD>   Our fall 2000 trip down the Canal du Midi in the south of France
was a little of that but not a failure, we thought. Some suggestions
for a successful cruise:</LD>
<LD>   * Have more than one couple (at least four people).</LD>
<TE>   * Make sure you are compatible, and equally divide the duties.</TE>
<TE>   * Plan the week around a major attraction. (We chose the Canal du
Midi because of Carcassonne, one of the best-restored medieval walled
cities in Europe.)</TE>
<TE>   * Stock up on local canned specialties. (Castelnaudary, our
starting point, is known for cassoulet.)</TE>
<TE>   * Finally, go downstream, and then the locks are filled. The boat
goes down in the lock, not up. The line tender gets picked up on the
other side of the lock.</TE>

<LD>How about a single room in central London, breakfast included, in
peak summer season for as little as $37 per night? It's possible by
staying on a college campus, and you don't have to be a student to
take advantage of it.</LD>
<LD>   The place: Rosebery Avenue Residence of the London School of
Economics (within walking distance of the busy Oxford Street shopping
district). I found it through the University of London Accommodations
Office, 011-44-20-7862-8880, www.lon.ac.uk/accom.</LD>
<LD>   During school holidays, campus accommodation is available to
tourists at universities around the world. Not only does it mean
reasonable rates for private rooms, but you also can use other campus
facilities, including kitchens, Internet cafes and swimming pools.</LD>
<TE>   The trade-offs? You may have to share washrooms and provide your
own sheets (bring sheet sleeping bags), and the room may show wear
and tear.</TE>
<TE>   But the English Tourist Council is taking steps to address this by
introducing a five-star rating system for campus accommodations this
spring. Each campus will be judged on cleanliness, friendliness and
efficiency of staff, food quality and facilities. The ratings will be
posted in future editions of the council's "Where to Stay" guides.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly some of Great Britain's premier university
accommodations are at the University of Stirling, which has been
described as one of the most beautiful campuses in the world. Opened
in 1967 on the 300-acre estate of 18th century Airthrey Castle, in
the Scottish heartland about 45 minutes from Glasgow and Edinburgh,
the university has an extensive selection of rooms, apartments and
"chalets" that can accommodate up to 2,300 solo, family and group
travelers. Single and twin rooms are available from about $29 per
person. The university's home page, www.stir.ac.uk, has links to
detailed information about lodgings as well as about the campus, the
town of Stirling and the surrounding area.</TE>

universities and colleges that provide holiday accommodation for
individuals and groups, try Stay on Campus, www.stayoncampus.com. Amy

<HD>Spirit of Brotherhood</HD>
<DH>A. Philip Randolph led a 12-year effort to organize the
first black union. A Showtime movie revisits his legacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before there was Martin Luther King Jr., there was A. Philip
Randolph. A socialist and the publisher of the radical, Harlem-based
magazine the Messenger, he championed black Pullman porters in their
struggle to unionize, from 1925 to 1937.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1920s, the Pullman Co., which operated the sleeping cars on
trains across the country, was notoriously anti-union, and
traditional trade unions such as the American Federation of Labor
hadn't invited black workers into its fold. Thanks to Randolph's
passion and perseverance, the first black union--the Brotherhood of
Sleeping Car Porters--was created.</LD>
<LD>   A new Showtime movie, "10,000 Black Men Named George," premiering
Sunday, dramatizes Randolph's 12-year battle to form the union. Andre
Braugher stars as Randolph, with Charles S. Dutton as Milton Webster,
the union's flamboyant, Chicago-based organizer; Mario Van Peebles as
Ashley Totten, one of the founding members of the brotherhood, who
nearly lost his life at the hands of Pullman Co. thugs; and veteran
Brock Peters as a porter who once had been a slave. Robert Townsend
("Hollywood Shuffle") directed.</LD>
<TE>   Before the founding of the brotherhood, the porters not only were
paid low wages but were sometimes humiliated and mistreated by white
passengers. They even had their names stripped away: Each porter was
called "George," after the owner of the railway company, George
Pullman.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Randolph's significance in the early civil rights movement
in the 20th century, he has been nearly forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you why he's been forgotten," Braugher says. "To me
he was never learned. There are some things that are considered being
American history and some things that are considered ethnic history.
When you consider the mainstream of American historical thought, this
is an incident rather than being the beginning, the seed, the kernel
of something that is going to shape the scope of American society."</TE>
<TE>   Townsend's great-grandfather was a Pullman porter. "I had no idea
what they really went through," the director says. And he didn't know
anything about Randolph's history, other than that the name was
familiar to him.</TE>
<TE>   "See, as a kid, Martin Luther King represented the civil rights
movement to me," says Townsend. "When they said A. Philip Randolph is
the one who taught Martin Luther King, that he was the real godfather
of the civil rights movement, that is when I started to read up and
do my research."</TE>
<TE>   The director applauds Showtime for embracing the project,
"because, for me, I want to be able to say there are [African
American heroes] out there other than Martin Luther King or Malcolm X
or Jesse Jackson or Adam Clayton Powell. I think movies can educate
and teach people, and with this particular story, I am really proud
of it because it gives you a piece of history that no one else has
ever told."</TE>
<TE>   The movie is the last project from executive producer Stan
Margulies, of "Roots" and "Separate but Equal" fame. He died a year
ago this week, a few weeks before the film went into production.
Braugher, who is one of the executive producers, insisted Margulies
receive credit on the film.</TE>
<TE>   "We work in a very cutthroat business," says Braugher. "When it
came down to credits, I said there is no way that Stan Margulies--who
conceived the idea of doing this piece, who executed it, who hired
the writer [Cyrus Nowrasteh], who sold it in endless pitches--should
go unrecognized."</TE>
<TE>   Margulies first approached Braugher about the project three years
ago. "I remember being in Toronto and doing another piece and running
into Stan there. When he first mentioned it to me, I had a vague idea
who A. Philip Randolph was. It was an education for me going through
the source material and some of the books about him and finding
exactly where he came from, the course of his struggle and his
compatriots in the formation of the union for Pullman porters and how
much foundation they were for the subsequent civil rights movement."</TE>
<TE>   "10,000 Black Men Named George" can be seen Sunday at 8 p.m. and
Wednesday at 8 p.m. on Showtime. The network has rated it TV-14 (may
be unsuitable for children younger than 14).</TE>

<HD>Second Thoughts on Tollway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like energy companies whose finances are too good to be true, toll
roads in Orange County are being second-guessed today in a more
skeptical environment.</LD>
<LD>   Directors of the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency
have decided to scale back the planned Foothill South extension from
eight to four lanes. While the reduction indicates that at least one
important lesson has been learned from the road's outsized and overly
ambitious cousin, the San Joaquin Hills tollway, the reduction still
may not be enough to warrant proceeding with construction.</LD>
<LD>   The toll road concerns of recent months have covered a range of
topics. The Foothill corridor dilemma has all of them and more. It's
the "more," the environmental price to be paid, that really raises
the biggest questions about going forward with the project.</LD>
<TE>   This road was conceived as an outlet from Mission Viejo, the new
southern cities and development yet to be built in Rancho Mission
Viejo south toward Interstate 5 near San Onofre State Beach. For
starters, this north-south route immediately raises the now-familiar
toll road problem of noncompetition clauses. Although many
improvements have been made along the freeway corridor in recent
years, the state should not be boxed into a position where it is
unable to make needed upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the question that most troubles the authority
directors. Stung by overly optimistic ridership projections, the San
Joaquin Hills tollway now is in danger of not being able to meet its
obligations to investors. The Foothill/Eastern Transportation
Corridor Agency is more successful, but thankfully some at the agency
are getting the message that anticipated ridership can't be based on
pipe dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Inflated ridership hopes at the outset could turn off investors in
view of the recent history of inaccuracy. It is encouraging therefore
to hear forthright engineers say that there is no justification for
expecting that the traffic can support an eight-lane road. Tollway
officials already are reexamining projections for the eastern part of
the county and will do a new independent analysis of the San Joaquin
Hills road. It's good to see the agency now going for down-to-earth
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   In general, demand arises from need, and it is against the public
benefit of meeting a need that any evaluation of environmental impact
must be weighed. Need now does not appear to be that compelling. But
the environmental trade-off remains high. One of two proposed routes
would carve through San Onofre State Beach, a folly that would be
irretrievable by laying pavement in one of the beauty spots of
Southern California. What justification can there possibly be now for
paying the high price for this alternative?</TE>
<TE>   Whatever route the road takes still raises questions, and both the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers have had concerns. Environmentalists worry that the 16
miles of road through remaining wild land in Orange County would harm
threatened or endangered species, and pour concrete through some of
the prettiest land in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The scaled-back design is a start, but proponents have a greater
task. That is to justify how lasting damage to the precious
environment could be warranted by the agency's desire to build
something simply because it is planned. For too long that mentality
has prevailed on infrastructure projects in Orange County, where
big-ticket decisions often have been made before the residents who
must live with them arrived. This is a different region today. True,
much open space already has been set aside, but extra care must be
taken not to damage the remaining precious wild land--especially for
a project that may not pencil out.</TE>

<HD>Panel's Report Is Needed Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the county grand jury's main missions is to serve as the
watchdog of local government, monitoring its honesty and efficiency
and reporting its findings to the public.</LD>
<LD>   To be most effective, grand jury reports of its committee studies
should be released as soon as they are completed rather than held to
the end of the jury term and disclosed as part of its final report.</LD>
<LD>   Some jury panels don't do that. To its credit, the current panel
does. For example, a recent grand jury report detailed the growing
population of rats in some South County communities and offered
recommendations for controlling the problem.</LD>
<TE>   We hope the panel is just as diligent in releasing its findings on
the in-depth study a jury committee is doing of operations in the
office of Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the district attorney, whose reelection is contested
in the March 5 balloting, term the study routine. Others see it as
more.</TE>
<TE>   What the public has seen for many months now are charges,
countercharges, news stories and allegations about internal friction
and favorable treatment for political allies. Voters would be best
served if the grand jury can complete and release its results before
March 5.</TE>
<TE>   Release of the report is needed to lift any cloud of suspicion
that knowledge of its preparation may have created, and to give
voters insight into the office's operation so they can make a better
informed decision.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury will fulfill its responsibility much better by
releasing its report before election day, rather than having voters
looking back at their decisions weeks later.</TE>

<HD>Not So Fast on Measure V</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Measure V, one of two local countywide issues on the March 5 ballot,
seems like a simple, uncomplicated change.</LD>
<LD>   Why not support letting local residents have an election so they
could choose a mid-term replacement to fill vacancies on the Board of
Supervisors instead of having representatives appointed by the
governor?</LD>
<LD>   But Measure V goes deeper than that. It is more a partisan
political maneuver cloaked in the attractive dress of local choice.</LD>
<TE>   Measure V's primary goal appears aimed at keeping Democratic Gov.
Gray Davis from appointing a replacement, possibly a Democrat, to
fill the Third District seat of Supervisor Todd Spitzer, should
Spitzer, as expected, win election to the Assembly in November.
Proponents argue that it allows the citizens to vote on vacancies
that occur on the Board of Supervisors, nothing more and nothing
less. Philosophically we're not opposed to that.</TE>
<TE>   But the measure does a lot more. It creates a charter county. And
that end-run around the more basic question of whether or not Orange
County should be a charter county, and what a charter should contain,
is what we find troubling.</TE>
<TE>   The measure has even raised a legal question over whether adoption
of the charter provision would nullify supervisors' term limits.
Proponents, supported by a county counsel opinion, insist that no
other laws would be affected. But legal challenges cannot entirely be
ruled out.</TE>
<TE>   Ballot proponents note that other major counties in the state work
under a charter rather than by general law, in which the legislature
drafts the laws of governance. That's true.</TE>
<TE>   But those other charters are meaty, seriously studied documents
taking an in-depth approach to local government and are tailor-made
to include the features residents find more desirable than the
state's general law provisions.</TE>
<TE>   They are not just a one-note motivated document like the one being
proposed on Orange County's March 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The question of adopting a charter has been kicking around Orange
County for decades. In fact, following the county bankruptcy, and yet
another serious study, it went to a vote in 1996 and was soundly
rejected.</TE>
<TE>   If Orange County is finally going to abandon its general law
status, residents should hold out for another in-depth look. That
would be better than an emotional appeal for local control driven by
a partisan political agenda and covering only one issue--changing the
method of selection for a county board vacancy. Spitzer, a
Republican, as are all the board members, is behind Measure V.</TE>
<TE>   That's understandable, considering that Republican leaders had
asked him to reconsider his Assembly run if it led to Davis naming
his replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Measure V is the insurance policy against that.</TE>
<TE>   But as an example of the broad net cast by Measure V, what about
vacancies to other elected county posts? Why not put them all before
voters and take them out of the governor's and supervisors' hands?</TE>
<TE>   If residents have changed their minds since 1996 and want to
reconsider a charter form of county government, they should reject
Measure V and hold out for a serious ballot proposition that really
addresses that question more directly.</TE>

<LD>Re "Retain the El Toro Option," Editorial, Feb. 16:</LD>
<LD>   The Times' election recommendation illuminates many of the issues
but fails to address the reality facing the citizens of Orange
County. Yes on W provides the only realistic answer at this time.</LD>
<LD>   The Times only needs to refer to its Oct. 21 editorial "Think
Again on El Toro." The Times highlighted the problems with the
airport plan and argued for the Board of Supervisors to delay
approval of the environmental impact report until a better design can
be presented for consideration.</LD>
<TE>   Needless to say, Supervisors Chuck Smith, Jim Silva, and Cynthia
P. Coad ignored your editorial and the will of the people, and
approved a flawed EIR the following week.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 28, Gary Simon, executive director of the county El Toro
program, wrote to the president of the Metropolitan Washington
Airports Authority and stated, "We will soon be embarking on a
multibillion-dollar airport project in the development of the new
Orange County International (OCX) Airport." The people in charge of
the airport have elected to ignore the citizens and ram it through at
all costs.</TE>
<TE>   Your assessment of the situation is correct as stated in the
recent editorial. "Through ineptitude and arrogance, this majority
[Smith, Silva, Coad] last year signed off on an environmental impact
report that left a host of questions...." And referring to the board
supervisors, you said they "bungled" the original plan and that the
county needs "better leadership."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Yes on W provides a better option than a legal
alternative to block the current plan in the hopes of a better
design. Perhaps we would all be better off if the Board of
Supervisors had heeded your advice last October to "Rethink El Toro."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Cooke</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial misses a major issue. If an airport were built with
realigned runways as you suggest, Newport Beach would bitterly oppose
it. Behind most of the support for an airport at El Toro is the
desire of Newport Beach and Costa Mesa residents to close John Wayne
Airport to all commercial operations. An El Toro Airport with
realigned runways would be much safer than the "Three Blind Mice"
supervisors' proposal, but it would still send fully loaded airliners
over Newport Beach and Costa Mesa. And more of them. Look at a map.</TE>
<TE>   They would have failed in their objective. Takeoffs into the wind
in Orange County require a route that crosses the coast at Newport
Beach. There is no other way. A better idea is to shift major airport
operations inland to Ontario and San Bernardino where the land is
flat, there is no sea breeze to affect takeoff and landing patterns,
and the local residents want an airport.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County already has a major traffic problem with the Costa
Mesa and Riverside freeways. A tunnel under the Santa Ana Mountains
to Riverside, and connecting with the Laguna Freeway, would allow
high-speed service to a regional air terminal and solve the Riverside
Freeway problem. New technology makes this a reasonable option that
would cost about the same as realigning the El Toro runways.</TE>
<TE>   Denver has adopted the concept that a major airport cannot coexist
with a residential population. Los Angeles will eventually come to
the same conclusion. The money spent on El Toro is wasted. It will
never be built.</TE>

<TE>   You're wrong about Orange County's not needing Measure W. While
it's true that part of what's brought us to this point is bad
leadership and Newport's fear of a John Wayne expansion, the real
reasons are rarely discussed or even recognized.</TE>
<TE>   Uncontrolled population growth and development have created this
entire situation. Rather than arguing about the need for more
airports and toll roads, we should be asking why every square foot of
open space in Orange County has to be developed.</TE>
<TE>   Who gets to decide when enough is enough? The developers and the
politicians they've helped put in office? It's about time that the
people had a voice in determining the quality of their environment,
and right now Measure W is that voice.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Page</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I certainly agree with your opposition to Measure W. However, I'm
afraid most people are unaware of the logical conclusion you
presented. For several years, the public has been subjected to bogus
arguments and a barrage of constant criticism waged against El Toro
airport by a group of people in South County. As a result, we might
soon lose our only opportunity to build a very needed new airport in
our county. It will be everyone's loss.</TE>
<TE>   John White</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am surprised that you oppose Measure W. Your editorial clearly
states "opposing Measure W does not mean we embrace a plan for an
airport that could end up larger than Boston's Logan Airport." You
summarize by writing, "Orange County does not need Measure W. It does
need better leadership." Yet the result is exactly that: a 24-7
international airport without growth limitations.</TE>
<TE>   In a vacuum, your editorial may fly. But in real life, the only
way Orange County residents can defend themselves from the deceitful
and inept three pro-airport supervisors and from the political
bungling that we are dealing with is to vote "yes" on W.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Hile</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am astonished at the facts you chose to ignore with your
recommendation against Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   1) John Wayne Airport operates at half of its designed capacity.
Why pay for a new airport when we don't use the one we have?</TE>
<TE>   2) El Toro is not the ideal location for new airport capacity,
because population growth in Southern California is expected to be
overwhelmingly in the Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   3) You express concern about air quality at Ontario. That same
concern should extend to El Toro. Airports are huge sources of
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   4) In the past 20 years, all new airports in the world have been
located outside of population centers because airports are bad for
quality of life. Duh.</TE>
<TE>   5) The supervisors who brought you a bankruptcy and an
underutilized, bond-defaulting toll road are once again trying to
steer us into economic disaster with overly optimistic projections.</TE>
<TE>   If John Wayne Airport were bursting at the seams, or if there were
10 airlines publicly stating the need for El Toro, then perhaps we
should be considering a new airport. But that is not the case. Three
supervisors are trying to ramrod an unneeded project to benefit the
colluding interests of Newport Beach and developers.</TE>
<TE>   The Times editorial stand fails the intelligence test. I hope the
voters see this airport for what it is: an unsafe, unwanted and
unneeded boondoggle. Vote "yes" on Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Summerl</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times' claim that Measure W should be defeated because "it
would zone away a more modest and better-designed aviation option" is
ludicrous. A downsized plan would become an economic disaster.
Whether 100 aircraft land at El Toro each day or 1,000, the cost of
the infrastructure remains the same, and it must be met upfront.
Restricting growth would be like limiting the number of cars using
the toll roads.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, a "better-designed aviation option" from a safety
standpoint would require takeoffs to the south and west, a pattern
that would be devastating to the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Scott</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>

<TE>   You were right on to oppose Measure W. Irvine has promised a park
like Balboa Park or Central Park, but the parks of this nature would
cost over $2.1 billion. And all Orange County residents will
eventually have to pay for Irvine's grandiose new park. To calculate
what this could cost each property owner, go to www.ocgreatpark.org.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You have got to be kidding! A large newspaper like The Times that
regularly crucifies any political party leader or public official for
even the slightest inconsistencies or appearance of impropriety has
just provided the largest example of journalistic cowardice and
hypocrisy in recent memory. Opposing Measure W because it fails to
retain a better-designed aviation option in the future? Like that's
even an option.</TE>
<TE>   The county and their consultants have misled the public, inflated
projected demand, understated environmental impacts and costs,
lobbied and arm-twisted federal officials behind the scenes to
withhold information from the public, and filed or encouraged
lawsuits against their own constituency in their attempts to build an
airport at El Toro. Yet The Times chooses to overlook these "blunders
and missteps" and still leave the door open for the county to
continue its plan for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   If Measure W does not pass, there will be no choice of a "good
airport plan" or "better Orange County leadership" as The Times hopes
for. The county will just continue pushing the same "bungled original
plan" with the same "ineptitude and arrogance." The Times editorial
was misleading to the voters and a disappointing sidestepping of the
facts.</TE>

<TE>   What good is it for us to "retain the El Toro option" when that
option is so implausible, and when by doing so we'd just perpetuate
the same costly, nightmarish struggle that your own editorial
describes? Orange County has bigger, more pressing issues to tackle,
and it's time we got back to them in lieu of this divisive,
unnecessary El Toro preoccupation. The Times' proposed solution is no
solution at all. A better and shorter editorial would have read
"Let's End This: Vote 'Yes' on W."</TE>

<TE>   Re "Planners Slow Major Irvine Development," Feb. 11:</TE>
<TE>   Here is yet another example that a Great Park will never be built.
The Irvine Co. has long-term plans for the northern sphere around the
El Toro airport for two projects that will have twice the impact of
the planned airport.</TE>
<TE>   And this is only two projects. Just imagine all of the other
yet-to-be-announced projects that will just add to the impact. The
Irvine planning commission has even said it is alarmed at the level
of pollution and congestion planned for the projects. And this will
be only the beginning if Measure W passes.</TE>
<TE>   The whole idea of open space will succumb to the whims of the
Irvine Co. and other developers' plans to build out every square inch
of land in and around the former base, since nobody will be willing
to pay taxes for this supposed Great Park. The pollution from the
cars and congestion will be so overwhelmingly burdensome that people
will have wished for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   The airport, along with designated open spaces that would act as
buffer zones, and with noise corridors that are not over any
neighborhoods, does not produce anywhere near the environmental
impacts that the developers have in mind if Measure W passes.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Bury</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   During a Feb. 4 Tustin council meeting, Councilman Tony Kawashima
stated he wanted to see options other than the Great Park or an
international airport. Rose-colored glasses now off, there are no
other options. This is the crossroad to which our county "leaders"
brought us in their blind advocacy for their airport.</TE>
<TE>   After wasting nearly $50 million and eight years of ignoring
community input, opinions from many aviation professionals, their
unions and trade associations, the intractable, unresponsive,
pro-airport supervisors trudge ahead.</TE>
<TE>   County government's attempt to frame this as a north vs. south
issue has failed. Folks in North County should be aware that after
eight years of planning, it is still not known what the flight paths
will be and whom they will affect.</TE>
<TE>   All Orange County communities are in the crosshairs of the
county's proposed airport. Let us all preserve some of the last open
space in the county and on part of that land build something for all
to enjoy and be proud of for generations to come. Vote "yes" on W.</TE>

<TE>   Aliso Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before election day is upon us, voters should know that there will
never be a Great Park. The park is merely the latest play on the part
of the South County anti-airport fanatics, similar to the previous
election, where the airport was lumped with a nuclear waste dump and
a maximum-security prison so that they could crow that 67% voted
against the airport.</TE>
<TE>   If voters choose the park, all hopes for a decent-sized,
intelligently buffered airport will be lost forever in Orange County.
Meanwhile, the plans for the park will quietly vaporize, and
eventually the bulldozers of the developers will swoop down on the
enormous airport property and build more of those "corncob" rows of
houses that make South County such a scene of charm.</TE>
<TE>   Don't let this happen. Vote "no" on Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   Keats Hayden</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We have already invested a lot of money and years into the
planning process for an airport. I think we need to stay the course,
and prepare for what we will need for the future. Measure W needs to
be rejected as a pie-in-the-sky park scheme fraught with problems and
inconsistencies that will cost us too much time and money to fix.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Root</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Voters, pay attention. Measure W is deceptive. It claims to be the
"Great Park Measure" but it is nothing more than a zoning change to
keep the El Toro property from being an airport. Ballot information
and Measure W supporters do not give voters a clue as to the enormous
costs involved in actually building that park, but several studies
indicate it will cost billions to build and maintain.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if we vote "no" on Measure W, we get a park,
golf courses, open land and the needed airport for our future. Best
of all, it won't cost taxpayers a dime.</TE>
<TE>   Sound too good to be true? It can be done because airports are
financially lucrative and pay for themselves while still having
enough left over to pay for everything else built on the property. By
voting "no" on Measure W, we get both the park and airport free.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Gallagher</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am voting "no" on Measure W because John Wayne Airport is on a
ridiculously small piece of land and locked in on all sides by
freeways and homes. Any significant expansion would be difficult,
financially prohibiting, and would significantly increase the burden
on those who live, work and go to school a mere few blocks from the
runway.</TE>
<TE>   The El Toro site is 10 times larger and has a huge built-in buffer
zone, meaning people would not be nearly as impacted as those
crowding John Wayne. A state-of-the-art airport at El Toro offers a
far more logical ending to this ongoing airport saga.</TE>
<TE>   Lori Alexander</TE>
<TE>   Tustin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Remember the old saying "You can't predict the future, but you can
prepare for it"? Without a doubt the most important issue ever to
face Orange County will be on the ballot March 5. That issue is
Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   The El Toro Marine base is 4,700 acres large, containing runways,
an air terminal and other support buildings that are all surrounded
by an additional 14,000 acres of vacant land that is not used as a
noise suppression zone. This in-place airport facility is ready to go
and will not cost the taxpayers of Orange County any money to own it.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what voters get for a "no" vote on Measure W:</TE>
<TE>   Voters get a great airport, which includes a 1,000-acre park as
well as a golf course, equestrian facilities and nature preserve, and
eventually 65,000 new jobs and millions of dollars of new revenue and
best of all, no increase in our taxes. If we let this opportunity get
away, it won't come back. Measure W is wrong for Orange County. Vote
no.</TE>

<LD>Re "D.A.'s Race Creates an Office Civil War," Feb. 17:</LD>
<LD>   The allegations against Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas are more than
"little improprieties," as some political consultant described them.
The district attorney's office is more than just some political
office. It carries the greatest moral and ethical burden to protect
and prosecute all people equally under the law. Rackauckas' actions
have struck at the ethical core of the district attorney's
responsibility by extending favoritism and protection to his
political cronies to the detriment and cost of the people he is sworn
to protect.</LD>
<LD>   Divisions within the rank-and-file of the D.A.'s office fall along
simple lines: those who are willing to tolerate or ignore repeated
unethical actions on the part of the district attorney when it suits
them, and those who will not tolerate unethical conduct, even when
that means they have to speak out against their own boss. Thank
goodness the great majority of people in the office are unwilling to
allow the reputation and integrity of the office be diminished. That
is why the Assn. of Orange County Deputy District Attorneys supports
Mr. Wade.</LD>
<TE>   Mark Sevigny</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I first met Tony Rackauckas when he was a deputy district attorney
and our California Supreme Court was under the control of left-wing
justices who had been appointed by then-Gov. Jerry Brown.</TE>
<TE>   The battle to recall Rose Bird and her left-wing cohorts was long
and bitter. Tony took a six-month leave of absence to go to
Sacramento and lobby on this matter. He was chastised and snubbed by
his peers for being politically incorrect and was accused of being on
a witch hunt. Against much negative advice, this man of justice
continued his quest, and eventually Bird and her cohorts were taken
out by the voters.</TE>
<TE>   Tony has continued his exceptional career as a municipal and
superior court judge, and his election to the office of district
attorney of Orange County was well deserved. He has proved to be a
real American law person. His opponents are the same vociferous
left-wing liberal radicals who spin the truth to their convenience.</TE>

<LD>Re "Tollway Board Cuts Lanes for the Foothill Extension," Feb. 15:</LD>
<LD>   We didn't need Wall Street to tell us that toll roads are junk; it
has been obvious from the start. The toll roads are a financial
boondoggle, an environmental catastrophe and a roadblock to public
road improvements. The Transportation Corridor Agencies have spent
years, not to mention millions, to make the toll roads look like a
success. They paid for consultants to tell them what they want the
public to believe; they had city council members sit on their board
and vote "yes" on toll roads, even if the cities they represent don't
support their votes; and they cry foul when critical habitats or
clean water laws get in the way.</LD>
<LD>   The state won't bail them out, riders won't pay more in tolls, and
people who care about open space, endangered species and clean water
won't go away. It is important that the TCA learn from its mistakes
before going ahead with plans to build the Foothill South extension.
Even if they could finance it and clear all of the environmental
hurdles before them, it is too huge of a mistake for them to say
"Oops" about later.</LD>
<TE>   Julia Dewees</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The bad news just keeps coming for the TCA, Orange County's
strangest bureaucracy. But--surprise! The agencies' staff and
contractors prosper. Foothill South traffic projections off by 50%?
No problem. Spend $3.5 million more to further review the design of a
road nobody needs.</TE>
<TE>   Need to bleed revenue from the Foothill/Eastern to prop up the San
Joaquin Hills toll road, thus making Foothill/Eastern users pay more
tolls for more years? Again, no problem.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for South County's political leadership to demand
accountability and decent accounting for the TCA, which administers
billions in debt and wants to add more by building the Foothill
South.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson is conspicuous by his silence. Yet the final
act of this debt-ridden farce could be in his district. It's time to
ask hard questions and demand straight answers. And it's time for
taxpayers to practice the following phrase: "No bailout!"</TE>

right direction for some, but it is not enough. We need to place
limits on man's intrusion into the natural world and we need to start
in our own backyard. We need to save South County. It is one of the
world's most biologically diverse areas, and it is an area of natural
wonder worth saving.</TE>

<HD>Differing Views of Losing Sewage Waiver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "County's Sewage Waiver Targeted," Feb. 15:</LD>
<LD>   Crying "Treat all the sewage fully now!" makes great headlines for
politicians in beach cities and Sacramento. Wow, citizens think my
guy is great; he is an environmentalist. However, unlike politicians
in Sacramento, the board of directors of the Orange County Sanitation
District wants evidence, before voting, that the expenditure of tax
dollars will yield benefit. This issue risks a capital expense of
$400 million and an annual operating cost of $15 million.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists are testing the ocean to find a link between the
bacteria on the beach and the outfall pipe four miles offshore. A
definitive link between the two has never been found. The district is
spending $5 million on research. A report will be completed in March.
Should any link be found, the board will immediately institute the
proper policy to solve the problem. Positive evidence of the
environmental benefit needs to precede any taxpayer expense.</LD>
<TE>   There is no documented improvement in ocean water quality tests in
the South Bay since full secondary treatment was instituted by the
city of Los Angeles. A more likely culprit of bacteria in the surf is
urban runoff from the storm drains, Talbert Marsh and Santa Ana
River. Presently all the sewage is fully treated. Half is treated
once and blended with the other half, which is treated twice. Fully
treating all the sewage twice will have a significant adverse impact
on the environment. More sludge will be hauled to inland counties for
agricultural use. This will require more energy to process and
increase truck traffic and air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sanitation District is in compliance with all
state and federal laws. The State Water Resources Control Board and
the Environmental Protection Agency must approve the discharge permit
renewal. Professionals whose job is to protect the marine ecosystem
and water quality at our beaches accomplish this oversight. This is
not the accounting firm Andersen overseeing Enron.</TE>

<TE>   Assemblyman Ken Maddox shows political leadership in his proposed
legislation requiring full secondary treatment of sewage discharged
into the ocean. Many city council members are also showing their
concern for both the health of their constituents, the ocean
environment and the economic health of Orange County, by also
opposing the 301(h) waiver renewal.</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation District General Manager Blake Anderson is distressed
that "very few people are willing to talk to us."</TE>
<TE>   Hello! The public and their elected officials are talking to you.
They are saying, "Get rid of the waiver and treat the sewage to at
least full secondary levels."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson personally presented the district's position to the Seal
Beach City Council. That council then voted 4 to 1 to oppose the
waiver, becoming the first city to do so.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to do us a favor. Get rid of the waiver. We can then
move on to address the other major source of pollution: urban runoff.</TE>

<AU>JULIE HUDASH</AU>
<BD>Julie Hudash, a former USC track captain, lives in
Irvine with her husband and five children, ages 3, 5, 7, 10 and 11.
The four oldest are involved in sports.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many parents are sprinting out of the blocks in the race sponsored by
the billion-dollar industry of youth sports. Forget values, enjoyment
and important life skills children can benefit from. We invest time,
money and ego into Junior's athletic future, often with the same
strategy used to manage a 401(k) plan. This money-market excitement
is caused by the latest phenomenon: result-based parenting.</LD>
<LD>   Should we invest him in the most aggressive funds and hope for the
jackpot, even if there's a chance we could lose it all? The better
option is to invest our spirited youngsters in "steady, mutual
funds."</LD>
<LD>   The trouble begins when competitive parents begin to perceive
diminishing returns on their investment. Recently, parents in Newport
Beach threatened to sue because their daughters didn't make the
cheerleading squad. They were disappointed after "investing thousands
of dollars" in private cheerleading coaches and camps.</LD>
<TE>   One parent said her daughter had missed out on a "life-defining
moment." Surviving cancer, the joy of a new baby, losing a loved one
in the World Trade Center, absolutely! But not making a team? I don't
think so. Tears and disappointment perhaps, but not life-defining.</TE>
<TE>   As parental expectations skyrocket, the risk of combustion
ignites. A Massachusetts father was sentenced to six to 12 years for
killing a fellow hockey dad. "Remember hockey is supposed to be fun,
but it's just a game," he wrote to his son, after sentencing. Last
summer, parents brawled on a soccer field in San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   If parents exercised more restraint, we'd recognize how sports
provide a safe place to practice the real game of life.</TE>
<TE>   We love our children, and it's hard to watch them fail. Although
it is more fun to win, we can't rob them of their chance to build
resiliency when things get rough. The more practice a child gets
dealing with life's disappointments, the better he or she will become
at handling them. Why not learn when the consequences are relatively
small, and a child has the safety net of home and family?</TE>
<TE>   Darrell Burnett, a clinical and sports psychologist in Orange
County, wrote a book called "It's Only a Game." He explains a strange
"reversed self-esteem" that takes place. "When our kids are young, we
say nice things to make them feel good, then when they're older, they
accomplish things to make us feel good," he has said.</TE>
<TE>   Burnett says Orange County is considered the "land of champions,"
where parents have more money to invest in year-round athletics.</TE>
<TE>   Our identity gets built upon how well our children perform. When
our kids commit an error, we commit an error. When our kids lose, we
lose. And when they win, boy are we hot!</TE>
<TE>   The focus on fun gets stripped away when an overemphasis is placed
on winning and achieving prescribed goals. According to the National
Youth Sports Alliance, 20 million youngsters sign up for organized
sports each year, but by age 13, 74% quit and never play these sports
again.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 1 reason stated: It's no longer any fun.</TE>
<TE>   We have fabulous programs locally, many that are taking a
proactive stand. For example, the American Youth Soccer Organization
created Kids Zone to make a safe place for kids to play, with
hundreds of coaches and volunteers working hard to create a positive
environment.</TE>
<TE>   The focus needs to shift from results to smiles, high-fives and
Rice Krispie treats. Maybe throw in a pinata for collateral damage.
Basically we need to lighten up. It doesn't matter if an 11-year-old
throws a 60-mph fastball if he doesn't like baseball anymore.
Results-based parenting is tainting our children's activities, and
it's the little guys paying the price.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately our goal is for our children to be happy, responsible
and independent.</TE>
<TE>   The real tragedy is to have an adult child, living at home, unable
to press on because she missed her life-defining moment when she was
17.</TE>
<TE>   Let's hand the games back to our children. After all, they're the
only experts in the field of play.</TE>

<HD>Everyone Gains From AmeriCorps</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX VELLANDI</AU>
<BD>Alex Vellandi, a Republican, is an attorney in Irvine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Partisan Republicans are wrong to attack President Bush's inclusion
of funds for AmeriCorps in his federal budget. It is a solid
program--essentially a cheap investment that results not only in a
lifetime of volunteerism but also in hours and funds far exceeding
initial federal dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Former Gov. Pete Wilson, when exploring a run for president, knew
the importance of AmeriCorps dollars to the state of California. The
state's Republican establishment hotly charged that California
shouldn't accept funds from President Clinton's program.</LD>
<LD>   Standing up to the pressure and doing what was right for the
state, Wilson ensured requirements were met but ultimately accepted
the money.</LD>
<TE>   America's history was built on the kind gestures of others. Our
government should seek ways to encourage volunteerism.</TE>
<TE>   Originally a Clinton administration program, AmeriCorps offers a
$4,725 education grant and small living allowance that amounts to
about minimum wage. In exchange, the 50,000 members nationwide,
nearly 7,000 here in California, work in education, health and human
services, public safety and on the environment.</TE>
<TE>   AmeriCorps has enjoyed a huge bump in interest since Sept. 11.
People are looking for ways to do their part to help our country
stand strong. AmeriCorps helps them find a way to do so. As a Wilson
appointee to the California Commission on Improving Life through
Service (renamed GO SERV by Gov. Davis), I oversaw the state's many
AmeriCorps programs and monitored the more than $17 million--now more
than $30 million--that benefited our poor and neglected. Any state
governor, including a former Texas governor, George W. Bush, will
tell you these federal funds work wonders.</TE>
<TE>   The program results in tangible results. In California, $35
million in grants go to 61 programs operated by existing nonprofit
and public agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these organizations must be able to leverage their
AmeriCorps grants with matching funds, or they will not receive the
grant dollars. With these funds, the nearly 7,000 participants are
tutoring and mentoring children and youth in classroom and
after-school settings--targeting poorly performing schools and
students in low-income neighborhoods throughout California.</TE>
<TE>   They are reaching out to homeless veterans, immigrants and other
economically challenged populations with health and social services.
They link people to local resources and enroll families with children
in Medi-Cal programs. Members help preserve our state's natural
habitat and teach the next generation the importance of doing the
same.</TE>
<TE>   California gains incredibly dedicated service people who make our
state a better place, in exchange for paying minimum wage and
offering members a chance to go to college. Who loses?</TE>
<TE>   We all gain. If we tried to accomplish what AmeriCorps members
achieve each year, we would be facing budget deficits here in
California for years to come. These members have proved what they can
get done in our communities across the state, and it is incredible.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are very real. For example, the Child Abuse Prevention
Council reports decreasing child abuse and neglect by 24%; AmeriCorps
members provide intensive at-home visitation services on behalf of
that organization.</TE>
<TE>   From fixing up shelters in Fresno, to visiting vulnerable families
in Sacramento, tutoring in Los Angeles to picking vegetables for food
banks in Orange County, AmeriCorps allows people to dedicate
themselves to helping others.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly it is necessary to ensure stringent oversight is in place
to guarantee these funds are spent wisely and well. But with those
guidelines, there is no reason why this program should be abandoned.</TE>

<HD>Community College Bond Measures on Ballot</HD>
<DH>Election: The two-year campuses hope to take advantage of
new system of obtaining state money by securing local support for
renovation projects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four community college districts are promoting bond issues on the
March 5 ballot to repair some of Los Angeles County's aging community
college campuses.</LD>
<LD>   The districts would refurbish or replace antiquated buildings with
the bond packages, ranging from $98 million in Glendale to $176
million in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Since Proposition 39, passed in November 2000, reduced the
percentage of votes necessary to approve school bonds from 67% to
55%, many districts have considered bonds.</LD>
<TE>   The success of the Los Angeles Community College District's
$1.245-billion bond issue last April has prompted every other
two-year district in Los Angeles County, except Compton College's, to
propose a bond, said Don Girard, Santa Monica College's marketing
director.</TE>
<TE>   "It made every neighbor of [the] Los Angeles Community College
[District] aware of its responsibilities," Girard said.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Farrell, the Long Beach district's interim vice president of
administrative services, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to get on the front end of this wave," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach and other districts hope to take advantage of a new
system for disbursing state money for education construction
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Under the system, districts can more readily receive state funding
if they secure local support through bond issues.</TE>
<TE>   Passing a bond issue, then, is "not a mandatory requirement, but
it's a practical one" to get a state funding application approved,
Girard said.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 39 also more closely regulates how bond money is
spent, requiring citizen oversight committees and specific lists of
projects.</TE>
<TE>   For Santa Monica College, the list includes building underground
parking structures and finding a permanent home for Emeritus College,
a program for senior citizens that during its 27 years has moved
around Santa Monica 13 times.</TE>
<TE>   The top priority, however, is replacing a building that has defied
repair since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The Liberal Arts Building has been repaired twice since it was hit
by the Letters &amp; Science Building during the 1994 Northridge
earthquake. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will pay $3
million for the new building, but that will not cover the total cost,
Girard said.</TE>
<TE>   "Although it's usable, nobody believes it's appropriate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners, Renters Would Be Assessed</TE>
<TE>   The average cost to property owners over the life of Measure U, a
$160-million bond issue, would be $19.21 per $100,000 of assessed
valuation, Girard said.</TE>
<TE>   Renters would be charged an average of $1.12 a month and
homeowners $6.42 a month over the life of the bond. The district
serves Santa Monica, Malibu and some unincorporated parts of Los
Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica has successfully passed bond packages before. Voters
approved a $23-million bond issue 10 years ago to build the science
building and the library.</TE>
<TE>   The last time a community college bond passed in Glendale,
however, was 67 years ago. And it shows, Glendale Community College
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Parking is limited for the 17,000 students attending the main
campus on North Verdugo Road. Traffic is another problem. Plumbing is
old and electrical systems are antiquated for modern technology.
Buildings need to be repaired or retrofitted for seismic safety.</TE>
<TE>   Measure G, a $98-million bond issue, would help address those
concerns, as well as other problems, said Armine Hacopian, a member
of the college's board of trustees and co-chairman of the measure.
"It would be a tremendous benefit to Glendale," she said.</TE>
<TE>   For residents and business owners in Glendale, Montrose, La
Crescenta and a part of La Canada Flintridge, the measure would cost
an annual $23.70 per $100,000 of a property's assessed valuation.</TE>
<TE>   Bond money also would go toward carving out classroom space for
the 3,500 people on a waiting list to take classes at the college's
Adult Community Training Center, which offers English and basic
computer skills.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, space for music and arts programs at Pasadena City
College is not sufficient to meet demand, said campaign consultant
Fred Register.</TE>
<TE>   The college "was first built as a high school campus," he said.
"The main buildings are still in use."</TE>
<TE>   The district is asking voters to approve Measure P, a $150-million
bond agreement, paid for through an average annual property tax of
$13 to $14 per $100,000 of assessed valuation.</TE>
<TE>   The bond would create up to 100,000 square feet of additional
classroom space. "It's the equivalent of building a new classroom
building," Register said. In addition, the college's industrial
technology programs would be housed in a new building, he said.</TE>
<TE>   District's First Bond in More Than 50 Years</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time in more than 50 years that a bond has been
proposed in the Pasadena district, Register said. If it passes, the
average homeowner in the district, which includes Arcadia, La Canada
Flintridge, Pasadena, Rosemead, San Marino, Sierra Madre, South
Pasadena, Temple City and a portion of El Monte, will be charged less
than $30 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach Community College District also expects to outgrow
its facilities, because its student population is increasing by about
3% a year, Farrell said.</TE>
<TE>   Most buildings on the district's two campuses were built in the
1950s and don't meet current earthquake safety standards, he said.
"They're getting to that age where they desperately need
infrastructure repair," Farrell said.</TE>
<TE>   The $176-million bond issue would have an average annual cost of
$14.78 per $100,000 of assessed valuation.</TE>
<TE>   The district, which includes Long Beach, Lakewood, Signal Hill and
Avalon, has never put a bond issue on its ballot since it was founded
in 1978. It did receive bond funds in the 1940s and 1970s while part
of the Long Beach Unified School District, said Karen Kane, the
district's director of community relations and marketing.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the North Orange County Community College District is
seeking passage of a $239-million bond issue. Voters in a small,
unincorporated area of Los Angeles County near La Habra Heights are
in that district and will help decide the measure's fate.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the money would be used to modernize the campuses of
Fullerton and Cypress colleges, said Donna Hatchett, the district's
director of public affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "If this bond were approved, Fullerton College would be
transformed," Hatchett said.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of the bond would be $18.50 per $100,000 of assessed
valuation. Based on the average cost of a home in the district,
officials estimate that it would cost homeowners a little less than
$3 a month, Hatchett said.</TE>
<TE>   The bond measures have generated little formal opposition.</TE>
<TE>   A group called Anaheim Home Owners Maintaining Their Environment
opposes the Orange County measure, arguing that construction money
should be taken from administrative salaries.</TE>
<TE>   The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., which routinely opposes tax
increases, filed ballot arguments in Pasadena and Long Beach
protesting the funding mechanisms created under Proposition 39.</TE>

reported that the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. wrote a ballot argument
against the Long Beach Community College District bond measure appearing

<DH>Environment: Study cites an urgent need for cleanup at a
former battery recycler in Tijuana. But the body lacks enforcement
powers to order work.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A new report by a three-nation NAFTA panel has concluded that the
site of an abandoned battery-recycling plant in Tijuana remains
polluted eight years after the operation was closed down.</LD>
<LD>   But the report stops short of assigning blame or recommending a
cleanup strategy.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, environmentalists are branding it a tepid document
and a symbol of NAFTA's impotence when it comes to upholding
environmental standards that were enacted alongside the North
American Free Trade Agreement nearly a decade ago.</LD>
<TE>   To its neighbors, the abandoned lead smelter, called Metales y
Derivados, remains a toxin-laden eyesore and a potential health
hazard.</TE>
<TE>   "We've exhausted all the venues--all possible venues for the
cleanup," said Cesar Luna, an attorney for the San Diego-based
Environmental Health Coalition, which in 1998 joined a Tijuana group
in filing a complaint against Mexico under NAFTA-related provisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have independent recognition ... that this poses harm. But
it's a toothless report."</TE>
<TE>   The report, issued by the North American Commission for
Environmental Cooperation, concluded that although health risks have
not been determined with certainty, experts who studied the case saw
an urgent need to clean the site to prevent the spread of pollutants
that include lead, arsenic, cadmium and antimony.</TE>
<TE>   But the report, known formally as a factual record, said its
purpose was not to point blame or suggest corrective action.</TE>
<TE>   The 154-page report "is not to render judgment on whether a party
has failed to comply with its obligations," said Carla Sbert, legal
officer of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation unit that
receives such complaints. "The purpose is to shed light on all the
aspects of an issue."</TE>
<TE>   She added, however, that such findings could serve as the basis
for later reforms.</TE>
<TE>   The commission is made up of representatives from the three NAFTA
countries: the United States, Mexico and Canada. The body was set up
to address environmental concerns surrounding the projected increase
in commerce as a result of the 1994 free-trade accord.</TE>
<TE>   Among the safeguards is a complaint process under which citizen
groups can accuse any of the three countries of flouting
environmental laws. The complaint by the San Diego organization and a
group representing families who live near the former plant was the
first along the U.S.-Mexico border.</TE>
<TE>   Luna said the groups are evaluating what more to do to force the
cleanup of the plant, which has remained littered with spent battery
casings, rusted barrels and piles of lead-tainted dirt since being
closed by Mexican authorities in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican officials cited and issued an arrest warrant for the
former owner, Jose Kahn, who lives in San Diego. The statute of
limitations on those charges expired in 1999, Mexican officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn once pleaded guilty in Los Angeles to charges of illegally
transporting hazardous material. He was fined $50,000 and agreed to
take steps to clean up the site.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any recourse other than to do community organizing
and protest," Luna said.</TE>
<TE>   The groups said Mexico failed to enforce its hazardous-waste laws
and did little to keep pollutants from leaking from the site, perched
on Tijuana's industrial east side above a neighborhood of about 1,000
families.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican officials said they have sought to handle the problem,
first by closing the plant and later by building a wall and covering
the waste piles with tarps to keep people away from the pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   Sbert said it has not been decided whether Mexican law requires
the government to clean the site. "It's an open question," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cash-strapped Mexico does not have a federally funded system for
cleaning up toxic sites similar to the Superfund program in the
United States. Some advocates have suggested that the U.S. government
help Mexico clean the site, which the petitioners said contains 6,000
metric tons of lead slag, plus other debris.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Spalding, who teaches international environmental law at UC
San Diego and participated in negotiations over the NAFTA safeguards,
agreed that the Metales y Derivados case highlights shortcomings in
the provisions.</TE>
<TE>   Spalding said he and other environmental advocates had sought to
give the Commission for Environmental Cooperation stronger
enforcement powers, such as subpoena authority.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the resulting accord, over which environmentalists
were divided, was the best that activists could achieve at the time.
The San Diego group "is absolutely right that this institution is
lacking in teeth. But it is the result of politics," Spalding said.</TE>

<LD>Blind and visually impaired youngsters from throughout Southern
California participated Saturday in the Braille Challenge, a yearly
competition designed to test Braille literacy skills.</LD>
<LD>   In the contest, held at the Braille Institute in Los Angeles,
about 75 students, ages 6 to 19, competed according to age and skill
level in such categories, as speed and accuracy, spelling, word
search, and reading comprehension. The goal of such literacy-focused
programs is to prepare the students to compete in the sighted world,
Braille Institute spokeswoman Courtney Goines said.</LD>
<LD>   "A blind person who cannot read Braille would have similar
disadvantages to a sighted person who cannot read print," Goines
said.</LD>
<TE>   Winners in the 6 to 10 division, which is based on both age and
skill level, were Erica Garcia of San Diego, first, and Kyra Sweeney
of Santa Monica, second. Bianca Samaniego of San Diego and Juanita
Herrera of Whittier took top honors in the 8 to 12 division.</TE>
<TE>   Heather Bandy of Reseda and Claire Stanley of Laguna Hills won in
the 11 to 15 division. Daniel Merino of San Diego and Anthony Vasquez
of Carson won in the 14 to 17 division.</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany Kim of Oxnard finished first in the over-16 division,
followed by Deepa Goraya of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Kim also was named the competition's grand prize winner. She will
receive a personal computer system adapted to Braille.</TE>
<TE>   All 10 winners are eligible to go on to the National Braille
Challenge in June in San Diego.</TE>

<LD>An 11-year-old boy died Saturday after he and two women were wounded
in a drive-by shooting Friday in southwest Los Angeles, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The women were listed in stable condition at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center and were expected to recover, said Sgt. John Cordova of the
LAPD's Southwest Division.</LD>
<LD>   The boy's father had been shot Thursday, Cordova said, and was

<LD>When cowboy lawman Michael D. Bradbury decided to hang up his spurs
as Ventura County district attorney, prosecutors assumed the office
would pass to his second-in-command, Greg Totten.</LD>
<LD>   But a brash trial lawyer, Ron Bamieh, upset those notions last
year when he announced plans to run for Bradbury's post--forcing the
first contested election for district attorney since 1978.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with nine days left in the campaign, the two candidates
remain locked in the costliest and most divisive local race this
election season.</LD>
<TE>   It is a race between a seasoned administrator who has run the
office in Bradbury's absence and a dynamic prosecutor eager to bring
change.</TE>
<TE>   Totten, 47, wants to improve upon his boss's tough-on-crime legacy
by hiring more minorities, expanding training and seeking grants for
new programs.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh, 36, wants to overhaul middle management, put prosecutors
in the community and devote greater resources to trying misdemeanor
crimes that affect the quality of life for county residents.</TE>
<TE>   While the two candidates share similar views on most law-and-order
issues--both loathe plea bargains and support the three-strikes law
and the death penalty--they are polar opposites in terms of style,
experience and personality.</TE>
<TE>   Totten, who was raised on the edge of the California desert,
joined the prosecutor's office 20 years ago as a trial deputy and
rose through the ranks to become chief assistant district attorney.
He is soft-spoken, serious and uses words like "honor" and
"integrity" in describing his view of an ideal district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh is loud, cocky and exudes charisma. The son of a
deep-pocketed and politically well-connected San Mateo businessman,
he joined the Ventura County district attorney's office nine years
ago and quickly climbed to the position of senior deputy district
attorney, trying homicide and serious felony cases.</TE>
<TE>   Since neither one is a household name, the two men have been
campaigning almost daily since Jan. 1. They have participated in two
dozen political forums and spent more than $1 million on signs,
mailers, campaign strategists and radio and television ads.</TE>
<TE>   The largest donations have come from Bamieh's father, who has
dumped $868,000 into his son's campaign--$107,000 in the past week
alone.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh says those resources have made it possible for him to
challenge Totten, who is supported by the county's law enforcement
establishment. Totten contends his opponent is trying to buy the
election.</TE>
<TE>   As the clock ticks down, tensions are running high. But both men
say it is because there is so much at stake.</TE>
<TE>   To hear JoAnn Totten tell it, her son always wanted to be a
lawyer. "From the time he was a boy," she said in between answering
phones at campaign headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   It is here, in a cramped office across the street from the Ventura
courthouse, that Totten has launched his bid for district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   It's a hive of activity with volunteers folding mailers and
campaign strategists hustling to set up events. Huge precinct maps
line the walls--a reminder of the ground Totten must cover before the
March 5 primary.</TE>
<TE>   But he has covered plenty of ground just to get this far.</TE>
<TE>   The son of an aerospace engineer, he grew up in Riverside County,
spent a short time in Hawaii and his last two years of high school in
the Mojave Desert, where his father worked at the China Lake Naval
Weapons Station.</TE>
<TE>   After junior college, he earned a bachelor's degree in economics
from San Francisco State University and a law degree from Pepperdine
University.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, he joined the Ventura County district attorney's office
and spent the next decade handling everything from petty thefts to a
death-penalty murder case.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, he moved to Sacramento to become the executive director
of the California District Attorney's Assn., drafting legislation and
lobbying on behalf of 2,500 prosecutors statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Chosen as No. 2 in Command in '98</TE>
<TE>   After three years in the state capital, Totten returned to the
district attorney's office, this time as the chief deputy in charge
of the child support division. In 1998, Bradbury picked him to serve
as his second-in-command.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Totten has overseen the day-to-day operations of a
department with 600 employees and a $40-million budget. He has also
chaired the committee that makes recommendations to Bradbury on when
to seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "He is an extraordinarily fine lawyer," said Bradbury, who is
retiring after six consecutive terms. "In almost 20 years, he has
handled every kind of case imaginable. And his judgment is
impeccable."</TE>
<TE>   Those credentials have helped Totten win close to 200 local
endorsements, including a wide cross-section of elected officials,
minority community leaders and labor and police unions.</TE>
<TE>   "We may differ on other issues or candidates, but on this one we
are together," said Hank Lacayo, chairman of the Ventura County
Democratic Central Committee and president of El Concilio del Condado
de Ventura, the county's largest Latino advocacy organization.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a special kind of candidate to unite a diverse group of
leaders," Lacayo said. "I have personally seen Greg Totten in action
for the past three months; he cares and his work in our communities
is earning him [broad] support."</TE>
<TE>   Totten is not without detractors.</TE>
<TE>   Some deputy district attorneys say he is closed off and has done
little to improve a culture of fear that permeates the office. They
worry that he will brush aside management changes they believe are
badly needed.</TE>
<TE>   And as the race has heated up, some have been startled by what
they see as a mean-spirited tone coming from his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Totten called a news conference to bring attention to a
Spanish-language television ad run by his opponent that features a
72-year-old Santa Paula man who, unbeknownst to the Bamieh campaign,
was convicted of selling cocaine more than decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Totten said he found his opponent's ties to a drug dealer
reprehensible. Bamieh backers say Totten's conduct was reprehensible
for dragging the elderly man's past into the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, that shows his true colors," said Maeve Fox, a senior
deputy district attorney. "We should applaud people who have made
mistakes and come back and prove that they can be contributing
members of their community. It was mean-spirited and it was nasty,
and I think people should take note of that."</TE>
<TE>   Totten said the issue isn't the elderly man.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is about Mr. Bamieh's judgment," he said. "He
acknowledged that he doesn't even know this man and that is a fact
that should be important to voters. District attorneys should not be
dealing with people who are convicted drug dealers."</TE>
<TE>   'There Is No Looking Back'</TE>
<TE>   Sitting at a conference table, Bamieh looks worried. His team has
three weeks to go and by all accounts is unprepared.</TE>
<TE>   "What can we do to get better?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   He isn't talking about his campaign team. No, he fully expects to
win on election day.</TE>
<TE>   This lecture is for the Buena High School Mock Trial team, which
he has helped coach for eight years. On this day, Bamieh, who has
spent far less time with the team than usual because of the campaign,
tries to pump up a few less-experienced students.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand that when you are in Mock Trial, everyone
is very nervous," he says. "You have to act incredibly confident--you
own them. You can't show any fear in there."</TE>
<TE>   He pauses with dramatic effect, and adds: "You also understand,
once this thing starts, there is no looking back."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh could easily be describing his run for district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   He knew he was picking a fight when he decided to enter the race,
but he also believed the office needed a change and that he was the
only prosecutor with the financial backing to make it competitive.</TE>
<TE>   "People thank me for running," Bamieh said. "They are happy that
they get a choice for a change--that it is not going to be anointed."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh grew up in the Bay Area, the son of a financial consultant
who made a fortune after emigrating from Jerusalem in the late 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Bamieh became involved in Republican politics, and spent huge
sums of money backing candidates whose ideology, particularly on
fiscal policy, was to his liking.</TE>
<TE>   "I have known every Republican president since Nixon," he said in
an interview last year, noting that his son grew up in that
environment. "He learned leadership from the pros."</TE>
<TE>   After earning a business degree from USC and a law degree from
Loyola University Chicago in 1991, Bamieh landed a position as a
civil attorney in the Justice Department in Washington. When former
President George Bush vacated the White House, Bamieh left too.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, he joined the Ventura County district attorney's office
and spent several years trying misdemeanor, felony and sexual assault
cases. For the past four years, he has handled homicide and
gang-related crimes.</TE>
<TE>   After promoting him in 1997, Bradbury tested Bamieh by assigning
him an unsolved slaying, which deputies and investigators in the
office had given up on. Bamieh closed the case, without a body or
murder weapon, and sent the killer to death row.</TE>
<TE>   "He is all about the case and the victims," Deputy Dist. Atty.
Audry Rohn said. "As a prosecutor, I find that really inspiring."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors who support Bamieh describe him as courageous and
savvy, a lawyer capable of making the office more efficient and
supportive of its employees.</TE>
<TE>   "The office is currently run under an atmosphere of fear," said
Fox, who has worked there for 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I know people who have been pressured to prosecute cases in which
they didn't believe," Fox said. "Ron wants to breathe new life into
the office by making people more accountable, but at the same time
giving them more discretion to do what they believe is the right
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents Question Experience, Tactics</TE>
<TE>   But Bamieh's critics fault him for having no administrative
experience. They say he is abrasive and overly aggressive in
prosecuting crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pushy, he's arrogant," said Glen Kitzmann, a district
attorney's investigator and president of the Ventura County Deputy
Sheriff's Assn., which endorsed Totten. "It can't be win at all
costs, it has to be about seeking justice."</TE>
<TE>   Kitzmann and others say Bamieh's campaign tactics show he is
willing to do and say anything to win.</TE>
<TE>   They have repeatedly criticized him for exaggerating his trial
experience in ads stating that "in over 60 cases, he has never lost a
felony trial."</TE>
<TE>   According to district attorney's office records, Bamieh has
prosecuted 20 felony trials--18 before a jury and two before a
judge--that resulted in guilty verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh contends that those statistics do not include at least 50
felony cases he took through preliminary hearings. He calls the
criticism another petty attack by his opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are losing, and you are desperate, you do whatever you
can," Bamieh said. "Their whole campaign is based on throwing mud,
and I think it is mostly due to the fact that that old boys club is
losing and there is going to be a change."</TE>

<HD>Ventura Dogs Take Path of Leash Resistance</HD>
<DH>Pets: City's first tether-free parks are a hit with four-
and two-legged visitors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They used to be outlaws, these four-legged fuzz balls romping at
Camino Real Park in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   But that was before a pack of dog lovers pressed for a public
place where their pets could sniff and socialize and chase each other
in circles until their sloppy tongues fell out.</LD>
<LD>   A month after portions of two city parks went to the dogs on a
trial basis, organizers of Ventura's first off-leash recreation areas
say the pooch-oriented playgrounds have been a big hit.</LD>
<TE>   And as long as the dogs--and their owners--stay on their best
behavior, they think they have a good shot at turning the six-month
pilot programs into permanent park fixtures.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really monitoring ourselves because we want this to work,"
said Annie Dransfeldt, a founding member of the Ventura Dog Owners
Group, as spirited canines whirled like dust devils around her.</TE>
<TE>   "You see every one of them has smiles on their faces," Dransfeldt
said. "They say dogs don't feel emotion. Well, of course they do."</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura group is one of dozens organized across the state in
recent years to lobby for play space as community parks have become
more crowded and leash laws more restrictive.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-pooch movement, dedicated as much to the concept of canine
liberation as the pursuit of responsible dog ownership, is quickly
gaining momentum.</TE>
<TE>   One Web site, dogpark.com, lists more than 600 dog parks
nationwide--more than three times the number listed in 1998.
California lists nearly 100 parks from San Rafael to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County already has dog parks in Thousand Oaks and Oxnard.
And last month state parks officials selected San Buenaventura State
Beach as the site for potential development of one of the first
off-leash areas in the California parks system.</TE>
<TE>   In the city of Ventura, doggie duty is split between Camino Real
and Arroyo Verde parks. The play areas opened Jan. 17 and as many as
100 dogs a day have visited since then.</TE>
<TE>   Dogs can only be off-leash in designated areas and during set
hours. City officials say they have received few complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "So far so good," said parks manager Mike Montoya, who in coming
months will evaluate the program for city leaders so they can decide
whether to keep it going.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ventura dog owners group has been an important part of this
process," Montoya added. "They've been our eyes and ears."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, on a U-shaped patch of grass at Camino Real
strewn with slobbery chew toys, there were plenty of both to go
around. Dozens of canines frolicked at the park's west end as their
owners kept watch.</TE>
<TE>   There were dogs of all shapes and sizes, including a coal-black
Newfoundland mix named Cosmo, so big and furry he looked like a bear,
and a sad-eyed Shar-Pei named Pudge, who sported so much loose skin
it cascaded down his body in flabby folds.</TE>
<TE>   The off-leash area is tucked between ball fields and the barranca
that slices behind the park, and is posted with signs detailing hours
and rules.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors are greeted by monitors who check in each dog and make
sure owners watch out for rough play, keep dogs from wandering and
pick up after them should nature call.</TE>
<TE>   Later arrivals are sure to be mobbed by a pack of curious canines,
tails wagging and snouts ready to sniff.</TE>
<TE>   "We just love it here," said east Ventura resident Marguerite
Hirsch, who drives 15 minutes each day so that her dogs, Guinness and
Sadie, can exercise and socialize. "They have the whole backyard and
the run of the house, but they just can't get the good run they
need."</TE>
<TE>   The push to permit off-leash exercise areas began last summer
following a fight between dog owners and a sports enthusiast who
complained about unruly dogs. Afterward, Ventura police began
cracking down on untethered canines, handing out a flurry of $135
tickets at parks and other public areas.</TE>
<TE>   Dog owners were not about to take that lying down. They began
holding monthly meetings aimed at lobbying leaders for a share of the
city's green space.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to be criminals," said Dransfeldt of the days before the
play areas were created, when she and others would set their dogs
loose.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lot of work, but it was well worth it. We are all
devoted to our animals."</TE>
<TE>   The dog park activists aren't done yet. If city leaders make the
play areas permanent, the dog owners want to start looking for ways
to fence their animals off and provide drinking fountains.</TE>
<TE>   They also want to see if dog owners who live near other
neighborhood parks want to establish similar play spaces.</TE>
<TE>   It has made all the difference to Maxine George. The retired real
estate property manager brings a black ball of fur named Nicky to
Camino Real's dog park each day.</TE>
<TE>   The pint-sized poodle mix barely weighs more than the collar and
tags jangling around his neck. But he has a big dog's mentality,
running and jumping with the biggest of breeds until he grows tired
and leaps into George's lap, his tiny tail swishing like a windshield
wiper.</TE>
<TE>   "Walking him on a leash around the neighborhood was just totally
unsatisfactory," she said. "Now, all I have to do is say, 'It's park
time,' and he's waiting for me at the door."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FYI</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's dog parks are open during the following hours:</TE>
<TE>   Camino Real Park (Dean Drive and Varsity Street)--seven days a
week, 3 p.m. to dusk.</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo Verde Park (Foothill and Day roads)--Tuesday through
Friday, 6 to 9 a.m., and Saturday and Sunday, 6 to 8 a.m.</TE>

<HD>Most Voters Oppose Airport at El Toro Base</HD>
<DH>Survey: Sixty percent of Times poll respondents don't want
a commercial airport at the former Marine base. But they're not all
behind park plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opposition to a new airport at El Toro continues to grow in Orange
County, boosting the chances for approval of an anti-airport measure
by voters next month, according to a Los Angeles Times-commissioned
poll.</LD>
<LD>   The election March 5 marks the fourth time county voters will be
asked to decide the airport issue. Measure W would rescind the
airport's approval by voters in 1994 and rezone the 4,700-acre base
to public parkland and other development.</LD>
<LD>   The park measure is favored by 55% of likely voters, the poll
conducted for The Times by Baldassare Associates shows. Support
jumped to 58% among likely voters when they were told the measure
could kill the airport.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, 60% of Orange County voters--the highest percentage since
1994--are opposed to the county's plan to turn the base into Southern
California's second-largest airfield.</TE>
<TE>   The telephone poll of 800 registered voters, including 582 likely
voters, was taken from Feb. 14 to 18. It has a margin of error of
plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Many think the El Toro airport fight has been led by South County,
a dozen cities closest to the former Marine base.</TE>
<TE>   But the poll found that opposition is growing countywide and in
every demographic group. For the purposes of the poll, Newport
Beach--which strongly backs an El Toro airport--was included in North
County results.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the respondents said they don't believe a new airport is
needed, despite regional transportation planners' insistence that the
county must share in handling as many as 30 million of the 150
million passengers expected to travel by air in Southern California
by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   "That argument is not very persuasive to Orange County voters,"
said Cheryl Katz, who conducts polling for The Times. "The airport is
really battling the widespread perception that it is not needed."</TE>
<TE>   Differing Views on Economic Impact</TE>
<TE>   Pam Vliss of San Clemente, who was interviewed for the poll, is
among those ready to stop the airport for good.</TE>
<TE>   The director of global sales for a high-tech manufacturing
company, Vliss said she uses John Wayne and Los Angeles International
airports and San Diego's Lindbergh Field and sees no need to add a
"polluting, lifestyle-altering" airfield in south Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the character of South County would dramatically change,"
she said. "I don't think the economy would suffer without an
airport--I see just the opposite, the economy of South County
actually withering with an airport. It would reduce property values,
bring in [undesirable] types of businesses and have a domino effect
quite to the contrary."</TE>
<TE>   But Vliss isn't quite ready to embrace an urban park at the base.
She said her vote for Measure W is strictly against the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "A park would be lovely, but I'm just not quite sure if the
current plans are the best thought-out use for the land," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Another voter surveyed, retired pollution control worker Mark
Schafer of Los Alamitos, also doesn't think a park is the best use
for El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   He believes Orange County will need more airport space. John Wayne
Airport, with one runway on 500 acres, can't be expanded enough to
make a difference, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schafer said he's seen more anti-park mail in the last week, an
indication of how important North County voters are to the No on
Measure W Campaign. North County makes up 70% of the county's
registered voters, meaning that a higher turnout in the north could
offset greater support in the south.</TE>
<TE>   "This park will probably create a tremendous tax and it'll never
happen," Schafer said. "[The base] will lie fallow out there. The
idea of a park is wonderful but ... people aren't going to pay for
it. We need an airport there."</TE>
<TE>   Southern California transportation planners also argue that El
Toro is needed to help handle the millions of air travelers that
Orange County exports every year to other airports.</TE>
<TE>   Airport Proposal Has Become Regional Issue</TE>
<TE>   County residents have made El Toro a regional issue--not just a
local one--by flocking to those airports, said Bruce Nestande,
president of Citizens for Jobs and the Economy, formed in 1994 to
promote an El Toro airport.</TE>
<TE>   About 6 million passengers leaving from or traveling to Orange
County booked flights at Los Angeles and Ontario last year, according
to a passenger survey by Los Angeles World Airports.</TE>
<TE>   About 7 million passengers used John Wayne Airport last year. The
airport is about one-fifth the size of El Toro's proposed airfield
and has restrictions on the number of flights and passengers through
2005. Newport Beach, the city most affected by John Wayne, has long
fought expansion plans there and wants the restrictions on operations
to be extended.</TE>
<TE>   "If [local foes] say they should be able to kill the airport, then
the people in Los Angeles and Riverside should be able to not allow
Orange County residents to fly out of their airports," or should be
able to impose a surcharge on Orange County passengers and cargo for
using their airports, Nestande said.</TE>
<TE>   The airport has been propelled by a majority on the Board of
Supervisors who have voted repeatedly to use El Toro's four runways
as the centerpiece of a 2,200-acre commercial airfield.</TE>
<TE>   But if Measure W passes next month, the 3-2 bloc could collapse:
Two of the pro-airport supervisors have pledged to follow the "will
of the voters." One of them, board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, is
also locked in a reelection battle against an El Toro airport
opponent, Fullerton City Councilman Chris Norby.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, similar pressure against a major expansion of
LAX--fueled by last year's hotly contested mayoral race--led the city
to abandon its plan in favor of a much smaller one.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-airport sentiment in Orange County has grown in recent years,
according to The Times polls. Majority support for an airport
alternative--no matter which one--also hasn't wavered.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, 56% of voters backed a plan for homes and businesses at
the former Marine base--but that plan didn't make it to the ballot.
In February 2000, a year after it surfaced, the park plan also was
backed by 56% of voters.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Times poll found that among the arguments against
Measure W, the most potent with voters is the potential cost of the
so-called Great Park, the plan upon which Measure W is based.</TE>
<TE>   More than half do not believe the park can be built without tax
dollars. However, concerns raised in recent months that the base is
too contaminated to develop as a park held little sway on either
side, with the majority of voters saying they don't believe this
argument.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about an El Toro airport's effect on the county, six in 10
voters cited negative effects--noise, pollution, traffic--and four in
10 noted positive ones--jobs, convenience. Even those who support the
park acknowledged that an airport would bring jobs and economic
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Unhappiness over how the future of the base has been handled
resonates throughout the county. Half of voters disapprove of the
county's actions, with approval coming from one in five.</TE>
<TE>   Poll respondent and airport foe Ron Cedillos of Laguna Niguel said
backers hope Measure W will finally convince the Board of Supervisors
to drop its airport planning and concede to voters.</TE>
<TE>   If Measure W passes and supervisors give up on the airport, Orange
County will have lost the economic opportunity of an airport and will
have abdicated its role as a good neighbor by forcing millions of
local passengers to use other airports, Nestande said. He doesn't buy
the argument that South County's suburban lifestyle would be
destroyed by developing El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   "People in Orange County bought into an urbanized community," he
said. "Within that, certain infrastructure is needed to support job
growth and sustain the economy. If they didn't want to deal with
that, they moved to the wrong area."</TE>

<TE>   But Vliss isn't quite ready to embrace an urban park at the base.
She said her vote for Measure W is strictly against the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "A park would be lovely, but I'm just not quite sure if the
current plans are the best thought-out use for the land," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Another voter surveyed, retired pollution control worker Mark
Schafer of Los Alamitos, also doesn't think a park is the best use
for El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   He believes Orange County will need more airport space. John Wayne
Airport, with one runway on 500 acres, can't be expanded enough to
make a difference, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schafer said he's seen more anti-park mail in the last week, an
indication of how important North County voters are to the No on
Measure W Campaign. North County makes up 70% of the county's
registered voters, meaning that a higher turnout in the north could
offset greater support in the south.</TE>
<TE>   "This park will probably create a tremendous tax and it'll never
happen," Schafer said.</TE>
<TE>   "[The base] will lie fallow out there. The idea of a park is
wonderful but ... people aren't going to pay for it. We need an
airport there."</TE>
<TE>   Southern California transportation planners also argue that El
Toro is needed to help handle the millions of air travelers that
Orange County exports every year to other airports.</TE>
<TE>   County residents have made El Toro a regional issue--not just a
local one--by flocking to those airports, said Bruce Nestande,
president of Citizens for Jobs and the Economy, formed in 1994 to
promote an El Toro airport.</TE>
<TE>   About 6 million passengers leaving from or traveling to Orange
County booked flights at Los Angeles and Ontario last year, according
to a passenger survey by Los Angeles World Airports.</TE>
<TE>   About 7 million passengers used John Wayne Airport last year.</TE>
<TE>   The airport is about one-fifth the size of El Toro's proposed
airfield and has restrictions on the number of flights and passengers
through 2005. Newport Beach, the city most affected by John Wayne,
has long fought expansion plans there and wants the restrictions on
operations to be extended.</TE>
<TE>   "If [local foes] say they should be able to kill the airport, then
the people in Los Angeles and Riverside should be able to not allow
Orange County residents to fly out of their airports," or should be
able to impose a surcharge on Orange County passengers and cargo for
using their airports, Nestande said.</TE>
<TE>   The airport has been propelled by a majority on the Board of
Supervisors who have voted repeatedly to use El Toro's four runways
as the centerpiece of a 2,200-acre commercial airfield.</TE>
<TE>   But if Measure W passes next month, the 3-2 bloc could collapse:
Two of the pro-airport supervisors have pledged to follow the "will
of the voters." One of them, board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, is
also locked in a reelection battle against an El Toro airport
opponent, Fullerton City Councilman Chris Norby.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, similar pressure against a major expansion of
LAX--fueled by last year's hotly contested mayoral race--led the city
to abandon its plan in favor of a much smaller one.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-airport sentiment in Orange County has grown in recent years,
according to The Times polls. Majority support for an airport
alternative--no matter which one--also hasn't wavered.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, 56% of voters backed a plan for homes and businesses at
the former Marine base--but that plan didn't make it to the ballot.
In February 2000, a year after it surfaced, the park plan also was
backed by 56% of voters.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Times poll found that among the arguments against
Measure W, the most potent with voters is the potential cost of the
so-called Great Park, the plan upon which Measure W is based.</TE>
<TE>   More than half do not believe the park can be built without tax
dollars. However, concerns raised in recent months that the base is
too contaminated to develop as a park held little sway on either
side, with the majority of voters saying they don't believe this
argument.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about an El Toro airport's effect on the county, six in 10
voters cited negative effects--noise, pollution, traffic--and four in
10 noted positive ones--jobs, convenience.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who support the park acknowledged that an airport would
bring jobs and economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Unhappiness over how the future of the base has been handled
resonates throughout the county.</TE>
<TE>   Half of voters disapprove of the county's actions, with approval
coming from one in five.</TE>
<TE>   Poll respondent and airport foe Ron Cedillos of Laguna Niguel said
backers hope Measure W will finally convince the Board of Supervisors
to drop its airport planning and concede to voters.</TE>
<TE>   If Measure W passes and supervisors give up on the airport, Orange
County will have lost the economic opportunity of an airport and will
have abdicated its role as a good neighbor by forcing millions of
local passengers to use other airports, Nestande said.</TE>

<HD>Surf City's Holiday Dilemma</HD>
<DH>Safety: Should Huntington resume a downtown July 4th
celebration marred in past by violence? It's a painful debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A debate over fireworks has left civic leaders wondering whether
downtown Huntington Beach has truly put its uncivil ways behind it.</LD>
<LD>   The beach town has had a long history of Fourth of July violence,
and memories of the summer nights when police squad cars were set
ablaze and officers were pummeled with firecrackers have not faded.</LD>
<LD>   The memories are strong enough that a proposal to bring the town's
annual fireworks show back to the shoreline this year was snuffed by
city officials who feared it might reignite a riotous past.</LD>
<TE>   But fireworks fans say the wild and reckless behavior that once
defined downtown during the holiday is a thing of the past. The area
has matured, they say, and is ready for a second chance at a slice of
Americana enjoyed by beach cities up and down the coast.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, which the City Council recently rejected on a 4-1
vote, has kindled a debate over the identity of downtown Huntington
Beach, an area once dominated by surfers but now being redeveloped
with an older crowd in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of resuming the aerial display say the gentrified
downtown now draws families as well as youth and that a strong police
presence with zero tolerance for unruly behavior has kept violence in
check for several years running. Others worry that downtown
Huntington Beach still isn't ready.</TE>
<TE>   The beach fireworks display was moved a couple of miles inland to
a high school football stadium in the mid-1970s after city officials
agreed that the pyrotechnics added an element of danger that downtown
could no longer handle. Even without the fireworks, the zone entered
an era of Independence Day violence with police marching in riot gear
and makeshift jails set up along the beach. . As recently as five
years ago, more than 500 people were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, downtown Huntington Beach has undergone several
changes in character. In the '30s and '40s it was a vibrant but small
community and Independence Day on the beach was easygoing and fun.</TE>
<TE>   Old-timers remember the cozy nights as the fireworks' bright
bursts of color were reflected on the shimmering ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Wentworth, 75, the city's historian, moved to town in 1947
and recalls an intimacy to the holiday that faded as the crowds grew
bigger.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very small, about 5,000 people. Everybody was able to sit
on the beach and watch the fireworks. It was just home folk," said
Wentworth. "They were simple fireworks but they were still awesome to
us. It was beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   But as the city grew--and with it the surf subculture that shaped
downtown--so did the popularity of the festivities on the beach. By
the '70s, the beach crowd appeared to have more control of the area
than the police. By the '90s, even with the beach fireworks display
long gone, downtown was an area under siege when the holiday rolled
around. Hundreds of city police, sheriff's deputies and Highway
Patrol officers roamed the streets, rounding up revelers by the
score. But that was then and this is now, said Mayor Debbie Cook, the
only City Council member who favored resuming fireworks at the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't write it off because there was a problem in the past," Cook
said. "It's different now and the people who go to see the fireworks
are much more of a family crowd. As the city matures, it should be
given another opportunity to have a fireworks display at the beach."</TE>
<TE>   The area has changed, but the question remains whether it has
changed enough.</TE>
<TE>   "It still tends to attract youth and attracts them from all over,"
said Bob Mandic, a former councilman and owner of Mandic Motors a few
blocks up Main Street from Pacific Coast Highway. "There's a lot of
good people out there, but there's the 1% who make it bad for
everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   The surf culture is still in play downtown, with shops such as
Jack's Surfboards, Sokal Surfboards and Rockin' Fig Surf
Headquarters. Wetsuit-clad surfers saunter up and down the street.
Posters advertising surf contests are plastered on shop windows.</TE>
<TE>   But coffee shops such as Java Point at Pacific Coast Highway and
Main, and restaurants such as Duke's and Chimayo's Tropical Grill in
a city-owned building at the foot of the pier, point to a steady
transformation from a scruffy surfer hangout to a family destination.</TE>
<TE>   New complexes, such as Pierside Pavilion, Oceanview Promenade and
Main Promenade, account for nearly 100,000 square feet of office and
retail space that rakes in $166,000 a year in sales tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Those projects, along with the Waterfront Hilton Beach Resort, and
a Hyatt Regency Resort and Conference Center under construction,
signal a "new Huntington Beach," said Jennifer Wise, a real estate
agent who does business downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Wise said the city gets "a bum rap" over the past violence and
points to the family flavor of the annual Independence Day parade
down Main Street, which last year was extended down Pacific Coast
Highway to accommodate spectators.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never any problems with the parade," Wise said.</TE>
<TE>   Connie Young, spokeswoman for the Fourth of July Executive Board,
which organizes the festivities, said the group took stock of
downtown's changes and felt it was time to bring the fireworks back
to the beach. The group had hoped that this year--with patriotism
running high--it would be possible to return to the beach with a
larger aerial display. .</TE>
<TE>   The high school stadium where the fireworks display was moved
holds about 5,000 people. Admission is $6 and the event sells out
quickly. At least 50,000 people could fit on the beachfront near
downtown. Other beach cities in the county put on Fourth of July
fireworks and violence has been minimal. In San Clemente, for
instance, 16,000 people typically head to the sand for the show.</TE>
<TE>   "That's as packed as San Clemente can take," said Richard Chew, a
lifeguard supervisor who says he usually spends the Fourth at a
friend's house high in the canyons above Laguna Beach, where he can
see fireworks arcing into the sky from Emerald Bay, Monarch Bay, Dana
Point Harbor and San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire Department sees an advantage to moving the fireworks from
the stadium to the shore. Police, though, say the beach presents
crowd control problems and that in a stadium setting they can check
bags and knapsacks for illegal fireworks and alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "I see [the proposal] as just asking for unruly behavior problems
in downtown," said Councilwoman Connie Boardman. "Also, a lot of the
parking will not be available, and inviting tens of thousands of
people down to the beach and not give them a place to park would
create tons of problems."</TE>
<TE>   Boardman also said the city would lose about $20,000 a year in
stadium ticket sales while spending about $65,000 for additional
police protection.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't want to do something that would provide a return to
past problems," she said.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Patrons Beset by Politicians</HD>
<DH>Finance: Candidates from throughout the nation seek out
celebrities' star power to raise campaign funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanley Sheinbaum is a living institution of Hollywood fund-raising,
so it's no surprise to find him at home in Brentwood tonight with
Warren Beatty, greeting dozens of deep-pocketed liberals coming to
pay homage--and cash--to Robert Reich's bid for governor of
Massachusetts.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich (D-Ohio) and Beatty's wife, actress
Annette Bening, are schmoozing as Reich holds court. The foyer table
is littered with name tags for people such as actor-director Rob
Reiner and director Paul Schrader. "MASH" alumnus Mike Farrell walks
in, but Barbra Streisand has failed to show, and someone is loudly
deriding the "low celebrity wattage."</LD>
<LD>   Not enough celebrities?</LD>
<TE>   Maybe that's because another political premiere--a gay rights
dinner honoring Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)--is
opening across town. Ellen DeGeneres and "Sex and the City" star Kim
Cattrall are there, mingling with Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and
Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   It's political fund-raising season again.</TE>
<TE>   A time when leaders of the Free World descend on Los Angeles for
that high-stakes trick-or-treat of cocktails, banquets and power
brunches.</TE>
<TE>   When phones ring with pleas for $1,000-a-seat soirees for senators
with presidential aspirations. And these days the dinners for
national candidates are on a collision course with fund-raisers for
California primary contenders.</TE>
<TE>   There are only so many rainmakers--and it's pouring.</TE>
<TE>   "I am just inundated with requests," said Sheinbaum, a
silver-haired raconteur with a colorful youth who, at 81, still seems
anything but avuncular.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now I'm in a fight with John Kerry. I love John Kerry," he
said of the Massachusetts senator. "But Kerry wants me to do a
fund-raiser, and it turns out I'm doing one the same day for Robert
Reich."</TE>
<TE>   During last week's congressional recess, this lament became a
refrain.</TE>
<TE>   "We're mad at the Lieberman people," said a political consultant
after another head-on collision with operatives for Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.).</TE>
<TE>   "It's like everyone in Washington has descended on us. It's wild,"
said Casey Wasserman, the young gun of a Hollywood dynasty built by
his grandfather, studio chief Lew Wasserman.</TE>
<TE>   "You name it, they're all here," said Haim Saban, who has helped
raise millions for Democratic causes and was just named finance
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "They're all on top of
the other. It's a very, very, very busy season."</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raisers are beset, besieged--and unrepentant.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to raise the money," said Beatty, whose on-screen alter
ego, Sen. Jay Bulworth, mounted a rapping kamikaze run against big
money and politics.</TE>
<TE>   In real life, Beatty flirted with a run for president, and tonight
he is a co-host of the Sheinbaum affair.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what you are subjected to if you're running for office,"
Beatty said as guests milled around him. "That's why there should be
public financing of campaigns."</TE>
<TE>   If fund-raising hosts are a longtime pillar of campaign financing,
they may also be the wave of its future.</TE>
<TE>   If campaign finance is reformed, it would reduce the power of
individual contributors, who would no longer be allowed to write
unlimited "soft money" checks.</TE>
<TE>   But the power of the rainmakers--people who know lots of people
who will give $1,000 to their favorite candidates--will grow.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Picks Up the Slack From New York</TE>
<TE>   David Rosen, a Democratic fund-raiser who was finance director of
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign, said Los Angeles is "picking
up the slack" from a slowdown in New York fund-raising after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "A large percentage of the Democratic dollar is from New York, and
it was seen as crass to go after the donor dollar there," Rosen said.
"People kind of felt, 'Go get your dollars in Los Angeles while New
York recoups.'"</TE>
<TE>   So as elected officials in Washington debate the Shays-Meehan
bill--which could cap soft money donations--their staffers are
reaching out to Los Angeles hosts.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the other day a senator called me who wants to raise money
for six years hence," said Sheinbaum, who encouraged Bill Clinton to
make his first presidential run and raised six figures to help him
along.</TE>
<TE>   "The amounts have just skyrocketed, and the competition is huge,"
he said. "So you get in there early, and you scare off the
competition. Look at Gray Davis: He's been raising money since he got
elected."</TE>
<TE>   Sheinbaum is in his dining room, framed by an enormous blue Robert
Motherwell abstract. He flips through a typed list of political
events he is invited to. He wonders aloud: How do Washington
politicians find time to meet constituents? When he was a kid,
politicians picnicked with voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, they don't even go to kaffeeklatsches anymore," he said. "On
a face-to-face basis, who do they see? Haim Saban, Jeffrey
Katzenberg, Lew Wasserman. That's one of the reasons Democrats have
become increasingly conservative. It's why people have developed an
aversion to politicians--and not without some reason."</TE>
<TE>   So Many Events, So Little Time</TE>
<TE>   A few days after the Sheinbaum affair, the political decathlon
started to rival the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) was one of seven
congressmen attending a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
fund-raiser where donors paid from $500 for guests to $2,500 for
chairmen ("Yes, I want to take back the House!" pledge cards
trumpeted ).</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt headlined an overlapping event later that night at a
Bel-Air home where Ray Charles, Whoopi Goldberg and Roseanne Barr
performed. Guests were asked to "please join" Goldberg--along with
Norman Lear--at another overlapping reception across town honoring
John Garamendi and his bid for California insurance commissioner
($500-$10,000).</TE>
<TE>   That same Wednesday night, more than 50 people paying $1,000 each
somehow managed to make it over to the home of radio syndication
mogul Norm Pattiz to support to Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.),
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   It is no secret that Hollywood fund-raisers are not just an
all-access backstage pass to politics, but a place where people can
network with potential patrons of their television pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. chief Alan Horn and his wife, Cindy--who also
sponsored the Garamendi event--held a fund-raiser Feb. 12 for Los
Angeles City Council candidate Wendy Greuel.</TE>
<TE>   Guests sipped white wine and perused the Horns' collection of
paintings of Indians on horseback by Western masters such as
Remington and Russell. Greuel, a former DreamWorks SKG executive,
spoke of how she would work to keep film production in town.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas Insurance Commissioner Kathleen Sebelius moved through the
room, passing her card around and telling people of her planned run
for governor of Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to have her come back and do fund-raisers sometime in
April," said Beverly Thomas, a friend, as she handed out invitations
for a get-acquainted gathering for Sebelius the next night.</TE>
<TE>   Some fund-raisers, like Pattiz, view their longtime support for
local and national candidates as a civic responsibility. If people
don't contribute money to candidates and causes they believe in, he
reasons, who could afford to run for office? Multimillionaires?</TE>
<TE>   Pattiz, chairman of Westwood One, never finished college, but he
did build an extremely successful radio syndication empire. And he is
among the people whose names surface and resurface on fund-raiser
invitations.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of networking that goes on," he said. "Often the
way to get the most bang for your buck is to support the candidates
and causes of your friends who all support your candidates and
causes. I know I can count on Haim Saban."</TE>
<TE>   Politicians often come out to Los Angeles for informal visits
between fund-raising stints, Pattiz said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like they're expecting you to write a check at that
moment," he said. "If they need fund-raising help, they can pick up
the phone. It's a lot easier for them to ask for your support if
they've already met you."</TE>
<TE>   Pattiz got into politics 20 years ago as a supporter of Edward
Kennedy. He also began writing checks for a little-known assemblyman:
Gray Davis--and eventually, lending his name to fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   Same Names Pop Up in Tight-Knit Community</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the same names keep popping up on fund-raiser
invitations makes them interesting little documents of Los Angeles
politics.</TE>
<TE>   The Horns co-chaired a Dec. 12 Democratic Party event honoring 11
U.S. senators at the home of supermarket baron Ron Burkle. So did the
Sabans and Streisand ($100,000 for event chair, $50,000 for vice
chair, $25,000 for co-chair or $10,000 a couple).</TE>
<TE>   An "Andrew Cuomo for Governor" fund-raiser Jan. 10 ($5,000 a
couple) counted among its co-chairs Lew and Casey Wasserman,
DreamWorks political czar Andy Spahn, music czar Irving Azoff and
television syndication czar Michael King.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the interchangeable names is a tight-knit Westside milieu
with the kind of nightly cocktail party contact more familiar to
Manhattan than Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   It is in this world that Gray Davis and one of his Republican
opponents, Richard Riordan, make their home. So when Davis ads attack
Riordan for his past opposition to abortion, mutual friends in both
camps cringe.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the same friends. They're all at the same dinners,"
said a woman who is prominent in this world.</TE>
<TE>   Collective social life marches bravely forward. Nancy Daly Riordan
was at an annual all-women's dance party. So was Gray Davis' wife,
Sharon. The Sabans, supporters of Davis, invited the Davises and the
Riordans to their son's bar mitzvah a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   It looks even cozier on paper.</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire Eli Broad has taken family vacations with Riordan.
Haim Saban once went to Israel on a taxpayer-supported trip hosted by
Gray Davis. Nancy Daly Riordan is a Democratic Party rainmaker who
has contributed to Davis. So has her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Davis used to run a Burkle foundation. Former studio chief
Frank Biondi and his wife, Carol, who support Riordan, are a
Democratic power couple who bade farewell to the Clinton presidency
at Camp David--along with Burkle and the Sabans.</TE>
<TE>   This cast might seem as confusing as a Russian novel. But all
these names reside in the Palm Pilots of Democratic Party operatives.
One name they flip to often is Casey Wasserman.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman is the grandson of the legendary mogul Lew Wasserman,
who led Hollywood into a new era of political activism when he began
hosting fund-raisers for John F. Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Casey was playing golf with Bill Clinton at the Hillcrest Country
Club by the time he was 23. GQ magazine called him a "princeling."</TE>
<TE>   When Wasserman was 18, Patrick Kennedy--then a young Rhode Island
state legislator--called his grandfather and asked him to hold a
fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Wasserman told him: "You should really talk to my
grandson, because he's much closer to you in age."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy is now a Rhode Island congressman. A few days ago Casey
Wasserman co-hosted a cocktail reception, with Kennedy as guest of
honor, at the Sabans'.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like osmosis," Wasserman said.</TE>
<TE>   If Hollywood's most visible contribution to the political process
is "The West Wing," Stanley Sheinbaum was one of the early pioneers
of the kind of liberal clout now considered synonymous with
Hollywood. Sheinbaum once belonged to a group of activists known as
the Malibu Mafia.</TE>
<TE>   So did Beatty, and when he and Bening step out of a long black car
in front of Sheinbaum's house, it's easy to see how the term
"limousine liberal" was coined--and how it became an institution.</TE>
<TE>   "Warren Beatty wouldn't come unless I let him introduce the
speaker," Sheinbaum is telling his guests. "At that point, the
speaker almost didn't come." Everybody laughs.</TE>
<TE>   Beatty quipped back, calling Sheinbaum "Chekhovian," and looking
around for Sheinbaum's wife, the former Betty Warner.</TE>
<TE>   "Betty," he says, "I don't need to tell you that if I were dumped
tomorrow by Annette, I would be here trying to make as much trouble
as possible between you and Stanley."</TE>
<TE>   More laughter.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the night, the Reich campaign was $40,000 richer.</TE>

<HD>Breaking the Cycle of Teen Dating Violence</HD>
<DH>An L.A. agency educates youths on abusive relationships and
how to escape them. Most similar programs neglect the young.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is jealousy a sign of love? Can words hurt?</LD>
<LD>   By the end of a Break the Cycle education program, students should
know the answers to these questions. But at the beginning, they're
not so sure.</LD>
<LD>   "Is it ever OK to hit someone?" Break the Cycle staff member
Michelle Lilienfeld asked a group of 15- to 18-year-olds at the
Maxine Waters Alternative Education Work Center in South Los Angeles.
A few held up the color-coded cards Lilienfeld gave them on the red
side for no. The majority picked green for yes, then proceeded to
tell each other the appropriate time for violence.</LD>
<TE>   This accepting attitude toward violence is what Break the Cycle
hopes to dissipate through its work. The Los Angeles-based nonprofit
organization's mission is to empower youths, through preventive
education and knowledge of the law, to break the cycle of domestic
violence.</TE>
<TE>   While she was growing up, Break the Cycle founder and Executive
Director Meredith Blake said she "had never heard the term domestic
violence or dating violence." It wasn't until Blake was an
undergraduate at UC Berkeley that she realized that her first
boyfriend in high school was abusive.</TE>
<TE>   And when a friend was date-raped in the dorm Blake lived in during
their freshman year, the issue became very real to her. There were
tons of places for adult women to get help. But, she said, "I was
frustrated with the fact that there was no program that dealt with
young people, boys and girls."</TE>
<TE>   So, in her final year of law school at UCLA, Blake developed a
program herself. One that not only targeted dating violence among
teens but also incorporated her knowledge of the law. After she
graduated in 1995, she set up shop in her West Los Angeles apartment
and, with a $30,000 budget, began offering her own free legal
services to 12- to 22-year-old victims of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Today she has an actual office, 11 employees and a $750,000
budget. Break the Cycle has taught at more than 100 Los Angeles-area
schools, youth groups and juvenile facilities and reaches more than
10,000 young people each year. And the service is still free.</TE>
<TE>   "We've grown quite a bit," Blake said. The problem of teen dating
violence, however, continues.</TE>
<TE>   According to an August article in the Journal of the American
Medical Assn., which was based on a Harvard study, 20% of schoolgirls
are physically or sexually assaulted by their dating partners.
Analyzing data from the 1997 and 1999 Massachusetts Youth Risk
Behavior Surveys, researchers from the Harvard School of Public
Health also found that such girls are susceptible to other health
risks, including drug use, pregnancy and suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Traci Swanson, a 16-year-old Santa Monica High School student,
volunteers at Break the Cycle, and said she has told several friends
with obsessive, controlling boyfriends to get help there.</TE>
<TE>   "They never did," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At least one friend really needed the help. In an uncharacteristic
abusive relationship, Swanson's friend hit her boyfriend on occasion.
When he took a stand and broke up with the girl, Swanson said, "she
kind of went psycho." Swanson said the girl attempted suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Although Swanson is not able to help everyone, her work as a
volunteer has made her more aware of the signs of abuse in a
relationship: extreme jealousy or insecurity, isolation, drastic mood
swings, financial control and constant put-downs, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Students in Break the Cycle education programs also learn the
types of abuse--physical, sexual and emotional--and the cycle of
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Using numbers and arrows on the blackboard at the Maxine Waters
center, Lilienfeld explained the escalating stages of an abusive
relationship: the tension-building phase when petty annoyances pile
up, the explosive incident when the abuser lashes out at the abused,
the honeymoon stage when they make up, and back to tension building.</TE>
<TE>   This information, called Domestic Violence 101, is delivered the
first day of Break the Cycle's three-day curriculum. The second day,
students are taught the definitions of crimes such as assault,
battery, stalking and date rape.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps them understand that domestic violence is not just
hurtful, but it's also illegal," Blake said. In addition, the
students are taken through the scenario of an abusive couple, Robert
and Lisa, and decide that Lisa needs a restraining order against her
boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   The third day, Blake said, the classroom becomes a courtroom and
the students go through the motions of obtaining a restraining order.
"It helps to demystify the process for them," Blake explained.</TE>
<TE>   The classes are for girls and boys. Though the subject is often
hard for teenagers to talk about, Lilienfeld said a student's nod or
facial expression tells her "that this valuable information is
getting across to them." After each program, Lilienfeld hands each
student a Break the Cycle business card with the Web site and phone
number (www.break-the-cyle.org and (888) 988-TEEN) on it. Some call
months later, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Half of the kids who call us and seek help come to us from our
education programs," Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Jimenez is a 20-year-old USC student who said dating
violence is an often overlooked issue. "I think it's a problem that
isn't really addressed well enough in the community," she said.
Jimenez is an intern at Break the Cycle, and she invited a staff
attorney to speak to a group of middle school girls she mentors.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't realize that young people can be involved in abusive
relationships, too," she said.</TE>
<TE>   To get out the word, Break the Cycle is in the process of a
three-year expansion that would call for opening offices across the
country, including San Francisco, New York City and Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Reaching more youths is important, Blake said, "to keep them from
getting into abusive relationships. The best job we do as lawyers is
to prevent people from ever becoming clients."</TE>

<HD>Volunteers Fan Out on Rural Paths to Look for Missing Girl</HD>
<DH>Search: Urged on by her mother's plea, hundreds join an
effort to find Danielle van Dam, 7.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Haunted by a mother's plea, Tracie Ichikawa of Long Beach woke up at
4 a.m. Saturday and drove to San Diego to help look for the
gapped-tooth, blond 7-year-old girl who was last seen three weeks
ago.</LD>
<LD>   "I heard the mother asking for help on TV last night," she said.
"I had to come. If it was my daughter, I'd want everybody to help."</LD>
<LD>   Ichikawa, mother of a 10-year-old daughter, felt compelled to
volunteer in the search for Danielle van Dam, who disappeared from
her family's Sabre Springs home sometime after her father put her to
bed on Feb. 1.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, San Diego police arrested David Westerfield, a neighbor
of the Van Dams, on suspicion of kidnapping. The 49-year-old
self-employed engineer was questioned and put under surveillance two
days after Danielle disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested after DNA tests confirmed that the blood found on
Westerfield's clothing and in his motor home was that of the
7-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   Along the meandering route that Westerfield told police he drove
his motor home early Feb. 2, hundreds of volunteers spread out
Saturday, searching for any sign of the missing girl.</TE>
<TE>   The search is divided among three command centers, in Poway, near
where the Van Dam family lives, Julian, and the desert around Borrego
Springs, nearly 100 miles from the Van Dam home.</TE>
<TE>   In Poway, retired San Diego Police Officer Diane Halfman directs
the Danielle Search Center. She said more than 200 volunteers
registered by 9:30 a.m., and estimated another 100 "walk-ins" arrived
during the day.</TE>
<TE>   In a borrowed real estate office, the center is staffed by locals
who organize volunteers into search parties and send them to remote
command posts.</TE>
<TE>   "The response has been incredible," Halfman said Saturday, as the
center buzzed with activity. "We've had people from everywhere from
Northern California to Arizona to Chicago."</TE>
<TE>   A line of volunteers wearing fluorescent green vests adorned with
pictures of a smiling Danielle was given a crash course in search
techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Stick mostly to normal paths of traffic, they were told. Doc
what you see, look for anything out of the ordinary. Don't touch
anything. Armed with their newfound knowledge, volunteers like
Ichikawa headed to their assignments.</TE>
<TE>   Ichikawa reported to a command center in a rock-strewn, dusty
turnout off Interstate 8, where private investigator Bill Garcia
divided volunteers into groups with specific tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Next to an RV with U.S. Forest Service maps, Garcia gave another
briefing.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep an eye out for freshly cut brush," he told the recruits, who
ranged from teenagers to seniors. "We're looking for fresh mounds of
dirt, smelling for strange odors. You need to be physically and
mentally prepared for whatever you find."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, a former forest service employee, said he has given
logistical support in more than a dozen searches for missing
children.</TE>
<TE>   He assigned people tasks suited to their abilities, people like
Linda Farmer, an administrative assistant from Poway who compiled a
registry of the names and locations of the more than 60 volunteers at
the site.</TE>
<TE>   Archeologist Steven Pfingst, a Native American who monitors
construction on protected lands, led a search on the site of a former
Indian village high in the hills of the Cleveland National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "There's room up here to bring a motor home," he said, after
stooping to examine some deer bones found by another volunteer. "It's
close enough to Highway 8 for someone to bring something, but the
thing that isn't supposed to be here will jump out."</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Poway search center, Halfman said the volunteer effort
is getting "a high level" of cooperation from law enforcement.</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>3 Rivals Court Latino GOP Leaders, Activists</HD>
<DH>Politics: Riordan, Simon and Jones attack Davis over the
budget and schools, saying Republican policies would be better for
the ethnic group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Appearing together for the final time in their gubernatorial
campaign, the three leading candidates for the Republican nomination
on Saturday refrained from the intramural attacks that have
characterized the race in its final weeks and instead directed their
ire at incumbent Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, businessman Bill Simon
Jr. and Secretary of State Bill Jones each addressed a Latino
Republican summit in Los Angeles, and each argued that California
Latinos, who have moved heavily toward the Democratic Party in recent
years, should reconsider the state GOP and its gubernatorial
standard-bearers.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan was particularly emotive, citing his efforts on behalf of
Latinos as mayor and accusing Davis of secretly working to undermine
the anti-bilingual education initiative, Proposition 227.</LD>
<TE>   The State Board of Education, which Davis appoints, is drafting
rules on how to implement the initiative. Some proponents are
suspicious because Davis opposed the 1998 ballot measure.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan stood with a woman who said her English-speaking
5-year-old son was being kept in a Spanish-language class in
elementary school against her will. Riordan blamed the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis, in the name of God, in the name of our children, stop
this!" Riordan shouted.</TE>
<TE>   He then joined his rivals inside the ballroom of the LAX Marriott
to address about 300 Latino leaders and activists. All three
candidates argued that their Republican vision would be better for
Latinos than the policies pursued by Davis, whom they accused of
letting schools and the state's budget fall into disrepair with his
free-spending ways.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis has never signed the front of the check, like many of
us," Simon told the crowd. "He signs the back of the check."</TE>
<TE>   The summit was the latest effort by the Republican Party to woo
back Latinos, who have deserted the GOP in droves since the party
backed the anti-illegal immigration measure Proposition 187 in 1994.
In 1998, Davis won 71% of the Latino vote against Dan Lungren, the
Republican candidate that year.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Roger Salazar dismissed the attacks, taking
particular issue with Riordan's assertion that Davis, who vetoed
legislation that would have overturned Proposition 227, is now
working to undermine the measure.</TE>
<TE>   After largely ignoring his Republican competition for months,
Riordan last week unleashed a negative ad against the financier, a
friend. Simon parried with his own spot. Jones, who has raised less
money than Simon or Riordan, has had little presence on television.
Simon and Riordan are expected to launch more spots before the March
5 primary.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar, meanwhile, was equally dismissive of the GOP's pitch to
Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice for the Republican Party to finally come in and try to
appeal to Latinos," said the governor's spokesman. "We'll see if
there is any substance behind their sound bites.... It's not just
rhetoric from the governor. He's actually done things."</TE>
<TE>   State Republican Party chair Shawn Steel acknowledged that the GOP
has a long way to go to win the support of Latinos. Outlining a
program to recruit top Latinos to run for local positions on city
councils, water boards and other offices, Steel estimated it could
take 10 years before Latinos were solidly in the Republican column.
"At the end of the day, it's trench warfare in the neighborhoods,"
Steel said. "That's the only way I see us becoming a majority party."</TE>
<TE>   The three candidates tried to tailor their themes to a Latino
audience Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who drew 62% of the Latino vote in his second race for
mayor against liberal Democrat Tom Hayden, unveiled a
Spanish-language television spot that began airing Saturday outside
Los Angeles. In the 30-second ad, a series of Latinos praise
Riordan's mayoral record.</TE>
<TE>   Davis last week began airing a Spanish-language spot on television
featuring Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante.</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference before addressing the gathering, Riordan
presented three Latinos whom he appointed to various Los Angeles city
commissions, and he noted that Latinos held high positions in his
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the banquet hall later, he drew the loudest applause from
the crowd after gleefully mispronouncing the words: "Buenos tardes,
yo soy el ex-alcalde de la ciudad de Los Angeles, Ricardo Riordan."
("Good afternoon, I am the ex-mayor of the city of Los Angeles,
Richard Riordan.")</TE>
<TE>   "Latinos represent the future of the Republican Party, as well as
the future of our state," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Simon put in a far briefer appearance at the event, leaving
directly after his speech. In a brief interview in the hall, he said
Latinos would support him because his policies on education, the
budget and the state infrastructure would help them.</TE>
<TE>   "The policies I've been talking about--empowerment--are very
important to Latinos," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Jones cited his support from two Latino groups and
said that the reapportionment plan he helped push through the
Legislature in 1991 helped Latinos win state office.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans did that," Jones said. "We did not do it just for
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   In response to a question from a reporter after the speech, Jones
criticized Simon for voting only once between 1983 and 1988. Simon
said it was his record of "community service" that mattered. The
secretary of state, who is in charge of California elections,
disagreed. "It's appalling," Jones said. "Totally unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   But Jones, who usually laces his stump speech with digs at his two
wealthier rivals, refrained from those attacks Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't necessary today," he said. "This was a different
message today. This was a message to the people who were there to
keep them coming back."</TE>

<HD>For Jones' Fans, Th-Th-That's Not All</HD>
<DH>Remembrance: Patrons of cartoonist's Laguna Beach gallery
admire a humble man with the charm of Pepe Le Pew.</DH>

<LD>They brought flowers and pasted collages of his cartoons. Some took
away framed pieces of his life's work. Others dropped by just to
admire his wicked sense of humor.</LD>
<LD>   A day after Chuck Jones died at his Corona del Mar home, hundreds
of fans flocked to his Laguna Beach gallery on Saturday to say
farewell to the artist who helped create such widely loved icons as
Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Wile E. Coyote.</LD>
<LD>   By lunchtime, blank spaces dotted the gallery walls where framed
pieces of Jones' art once hung. The store's priciest item--an oil
painting of an armor-clad Bugs Bunny kneeling to receive
knighthood--had sold hours earlier for $15,000. Phones chirped
constantly as fans called the store to offer condolences.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a lot of grief," said senior consultant Randy Young. "It
gets really emotional. They love him.... It's like losing a family
member."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who died of congestive heart failure at 89, was described
as a beloved local figure, as unpretentious and colorful as his
animations.</TE>
<TE>   By lunchtime, about 300 people had come and gone. Illustrating the
scope of his appeal, his admirers included the young and the old and
ranged from professional artists to people who hadn't tried their
hand at painting in years.</TE>
<TE>   As Charlie Gustason, 65, admired a limited-edition print of Wile
E. Coyote, she laughingly said she realized five years ago that she
and Quin Gustason should get married when he revealed that he
identified with the frustrated cartoon character who could never
quite catch the Road Runner.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my hero," Quin, 75, said about the persistent coyote. "He
gets up again and always dusts himself off."</TE>
<TE>   Sam and Rachelle Hall, 12 and 9, arrived with their mother to pay
their respects.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the artist drew them a special picture of Bugs and
Marvin the Martian playing pool.</TE>
<TE>   Now the children returned the gesture, rising early Saturday to
paste pictures of Bugs and his friends on a tribute card for Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Jones created more than 300 animated films and won three Academy
Awards for his work. In 1996, he was presented with his final Oscar
for career achievements and was lauded as the "Orson Welles of
animation."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the praise, friends said that Jones remained a humble
figure whose life was focused on his love for art. In what became a
self-deprecating trademark, Jones frequently told reporters he felt
little in common with the self-assured, carrot-chomping rabbit he
helped create.</TE>
<TE>   "I dream every night that I'm Bugs Bunny," Jones once said. "But
when I wake up, I look in my mirror and see Daffy Duck."</TE>
<TE>   Those who knew him thought the comparison unfair.</TE>
<TE>   Edward John Adams, an art consultant at the Laguna Beach store,
described Jones as more closely resembling another of his animated
characters: the skunk with the French accent and a passion for
l'amour.</TE>
<TE>   "Chuck was Pepe Le Pew," Adams said. "He loved the ladies--I don't
think he would mind me saying that. He was the most charming man I
ever met. Every lady was treated right."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, in a speech to fans at the Laguna Beach gallery, Jones
chose to dwell on the artistic accomplishments of Walt Disney rather
than on his own.</TE>
<TE>   "He would rather talk about someone else than absorb the adulation
himself," said Adams. "He was my hero. I feel like I lost my
grandfather."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I applaud the actions of the [Thousand Oaks] City Council
majority--[Andy] Fox, [Dan] Del Campo and [Dennis] Gillette--for
having the courage to take the appropriate and necessary steps of
removing former planning commissioners [Nora] Aidukas and [Michael]
Farris, who violated the commission's rules of decorum and failed to
maintain the integrity, honesty and independence demanded of their
appointed office.</LD>
<LD>   They simply steamrollered their will against the will of the City
Council and the clearly significant majority of citizens who attended
the meeting and wanted the Western Plateau plan hearing to go forward
and [be] approved.</LD>
<LD>   We elected these three council members because we believed they
were right for the job. They have proven that we were right and that
they will vote their consciences without regard for whether their
decisions will affect their electability in the next election. I look
forward to another four years of these excellent incumbents.</LD>
<TE>   Please join me in saluting Fox, Del Campo and Gillette.</TE>
<TE>   Please remember to vote on March 5 and elect Randy Hoffman--a
clear choice for independence, strong leadership and action in
government.</TE>

<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The last time I looked, we hold trials before convicting
someone--everyone--even war criminals.</TE>
<TE>   The Thousand Oaks City Council in an emergency session fired two
planning commissioners and censured Linda Parks simply because they
asked for more information about the Western Plateau deal.</TE>
<TE>   Later, it will decide whether these folks broke the law.</TE>
<TE>   Excuse me? Parks is right. This deal should go before the people.
The overwhelmingly popular Parks Initiative was made law to guarantee
that exactly this sort of land deal could not take place without
voter approval.</TE>
<TE>   Think you can trust developer-backed [Randy] Hoffman to protect
SOAR?</TE>
<TE>   Think again and vote for Parks for county supervisor. She's proven
time and again that she follows the law, not the money.</TE>

<HD>Danger Feared Lurking in Classroom Walls</HD>
<DH>Safety: Teachers at an Agoura Hills school blame health
problems on toxic mold that officials say was mostly eradicated in
1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kim Cooper pointed to a dried-up yellow water stain in her notebook
that formed when rain dripped from her classroom ceiling. Amused by
the incident, she drew a circle around the stain with blue ink and a
line connecting it to a description that read: "a splotch from the
ceiling in social studies."</LD>
<LD>   Although the eighth-grader was able to laugh about the leaky roof,
teachers at Lindero Canyon Middle School in Agoura Hills say they are
sick of the problem.</LD>
<LD>   They fear that toxic mold, removed from the school two years ago,
still lurks behind classroom walls and above ceilings and may be the
cause of various ailments, from migraines and burning eyes to
respiratory problems. Teachers are demanding that the classrooms be
retested for mold, the product of years of accumulated moisture.</LD>
<TE>   School district officials say the rooms were cleaned of any
serious threats of mold in 1999, and that additional testing is
unnecessary and unreasonable.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is emblematic of a growing and complex issue that has
plagued schools across the country:</TE>
<TE>   * Medical experts have little understanding of how mold hinders
health.</TE>
<TE>   * There are no federal, state or local laws regulating mold
levels.</TE>
<TE>   * School districts often don't know how to identify a mold
problem, and when they do, increasingly tighter school budgets make
it difficult to eradicate.</TE>
<TE>   * Even an expensive cleanup doesn't guarantee that symptoms will
disappear or that mold won't recur.</TE>
<TE>   "It can become a nightmare," said Kevin Gordon, executive director
of the California Assn. of School Business Officials. "How much money
do you spend on a problem, and when do you stop? These cleanup
efforts can become a black hole."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1992, teachers and students have complained to the district
of health problems at Lindero Canyon, which is built on a high water
table, said Donald Zimring, deputy superintendent of the Las Virgenes
Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   After the complaints increased through the years, Las Virgenes
district officials hired a Long Beach firm in 1999 to find the source
of the problem. Gray Environmental Inc. found molds, including
aspergillus, penicillium and stachybotrys, in 12 classrooms and a
faculty room.</TE>
<TE>   The district then hired Pacific Health &amp; Safety Consulting Inc. of
Irvine and spent $80,000 to clean up 20 rooms, replacing walls and
carpets and removing mold.</TE>
<TE>   "In light of the resources we have available, our district has
gone above and beyond," Zimring said. "We're proud of what we've done
and will continue to be."</TE>
<TE>   But teachers aren't as confident. Stachybotrys was found again in
one classroom by Pacific Health in December. Zimring, who ordered its
removal, said the sample was too small to pose health risks.
Nevertheless, teachers called again for aggressive testing.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't get why they're not [testing]," said Barbara
Brammer, who has taught at the school since 1967 and sees an
allergist for symptoms she has had since the early 1990s. "We want to
be assured that we're working in a healthy place."</TE>
<TE>   Principal Ronald Kaiser said he is not sure whether his staff's
health problems are related to the school's indoor air.</TE>
<TE>   "The district has really tried to do its absolute best," he said.
"We don't want teachers and students in environments that are
unhealthy. In years of budget crunch, you can't keep pouring money to
test and test if there's no evidence."</TE>
<TE>   But there are signs of discomfort at Lindero Canyon. Carol
Pessara, a teacher with chronic allergy problems, has a photograph on
her classroom door that reads: "Mold Loft." She has had sinus
headaches for three years, and has been on a prescribed antihistamine
for two years.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is there are mold spores," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Special education teachers Sharon Lee and Heather Simmer, who
share a room, have air filters running all day, but they say they
continue to experience burning eyes and migraines.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I want to scratch my eyes out," Lee said. "It burns
all the time in here."</TE>
<TE>   Mold can be hard to find, but is sometimes detected by its
mildew-like odor. Testing can be as simple as taking air samples in
the classroom and comparing them with the air outside.</TE>
<TE>   Testing can also be as drastic as tearing away walls or ceilings
to look for mold. An extensive examination, which could include both
tearing open walls and testing the air, can cost as much as $3,000 a
room, Zimring said.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers at Lindero Canyon said in 1999 that the mold was found
clinging to walls behind cabinets and hidden from view by drop
ceilings. They also said carpets in many classrooms were soaked with
water because of leaky roofs, creating a welcome environment for
mold.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the health complaints, medical experts still cannot
explain why some people exposed to mold become ill. A sick person may
be diagnosed with allergies or migraines, but tests do not reveal
that mold is the cause. Also, individuals may react differently to
mold exposure, making it difficult for medical and safety officials
to determine how much mold may be unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such an exceedingly complex problem because there are
hundreds of thousands of varieties of mold," said Sandy McNeel, an
environmental epidemiologist for the state Department of Health
Services. "We're still at the bottom of the learning curve when
finding out what makes people ill.... There are just too many things
unknown to develop hard standards at the moment."</TE>
<TE>   Angelo Bellomo, director of environmental health and safety for
the Los Angeles Unified School District, said he believes more
medical research will reveal that mold can adversely affect health.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because a school district throws money at a problem, it
doesn't mean they've dealt with it effectively," Bellomo said. "The
evaluation process has to be done with good scientific principles.
Some [districts] are responding to fear and anxiety."</TE>
<TE>   One only has to look to Charles Helmers Elementary School in the
Saugus Union School District, where fear of toxic mold in portable
classrooms resulted in a $500,000 cleanup in 1999. Later, the state
Department of Health Services determined that poor ventilation, not
toxic mold, caused the headaches and nausea among students and
teachers there.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a painful experience," said Mark Fulmer, a former Saugus
district administrator who is an assistant superintendent in the
Visalia Unified School District. "People think you're hurting their
kids."</TE>
<TE>   Some public agencies have developed recommendations for schools to
monitor the environmental quality in classrooms and other public
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Lindero Canyon is one of an estimated 10,000 schools nationwide
that have recently adopted the Environmental Protection Agency's
Indoor Air Quality Tools for Schools in some form or other. The
program recommends educating faculty and staff, such as custodians,
to monitor ventilation, air conditioning and humidity. Schools can
apply the suggestions as they see fit.</TE>
<TE>   Principal Kaiser said his staff is watching for problems so mold
damage can be prevented. The district will soon repair the leaky
roof, for example, he said.</TE>
<TE>   More teachers than students have complained of symptoms, some
believe because teachers spend more time in one room than students,
who move from class to class. But others theorize that many students
are just unaware of possible health hazards.</TE>
<TE>   "We could be oblivious," said eighth-grader Katie Felber.</TE>

<HD>Danger Feared in Classroom Walls</HD>
<DH>Safety: Teachers at an Agoura Hills school blame health
problems on toxic mold that officials say was mostly eradicated in
1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kim Cooper pointed to a dried-up yellow water stain in her notebook
that formed when rain dripped from her classroom ceiling. Amused, she
drew a circle around the stain with blue ink and a line connecting it
to a description that read: "a splotch from the ceiling in social
studies."</LD>
<LD>   Although the eighth-grader was able to laugh about the leaky roof,
teachers at Lindero Canyon Middle School in Agoura Hills say they are
sick of the problem.</LD>
<LD>   They fear that toxic mold, removed from the school two years ago,
still lurks behind classroom walls and above ceilings and may be
causing various ailments, from migraines and burning eyes to
respiratory problems. Teachers are demanding that the classrooms be
retested for mold, the product of years of accumulated moisture.</LD>
<TE>   School district officials say the rooms were cleaned of any
serious threats of mold in 1999, and that additional testing is
unnecessary and unreasonable.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is emblematic of a growing, complex issue that has
plagued the nation's schools:</TE>
<TE>   * Medical experts have little understanding of how mold hinders
health.</TE>
<TE>   * There are no federal, state or local laws regulating mold
levels.</TE>
<TE>   * School districts often don't know how to identify a mold
problem, and when they do, increasingly tighter school budgets make
it difficult to eradicate.</TE>
<TE>   * Even a costly cleanup doesn't guarantee that symptoms will
vanish or mold won't recur.</TE>
<TE>   "It can become a nightmare," said Kevin Gordon, executive director
of the California Assn. of School Business Officials. "How much money
do you spend on a problem, and when do you stop? These cleanup
efforts can become a black hole."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1992, teachers and students have complained to the district
of health problems at Lindero Canyon, which is built on a high water
table, said Donald Zimring, deputy superintendent of the Las Virgenes
Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   After the complaints increased through the years, Las Virgenes
district officials hired a Long Beach firm in 1999 to find the source
of the problem. Gray Environmental Inc. found molds, including
aspergillus, penicillium and stachybotrys, in 12 classrooms and a
faculty room.</TE>
<TE>   The district then hired Pacific Health &amp; Safety Consulting Inc. of
Irvine and spent $80,000 to clean up 20 rooms, replacing walls and
carpets and removing mold.</TE>
<TE>   "In light of the resources we have available, our district has
gone above and beyond," Zimring said. "We're proud of what we've done
and will continue to be."</TE>
<TE>   But teachers aren't as confident. Stachybotrys was found again in
one classroom by Pacific Health in December. Zimring, who ordered its
removal, said the sample was too small to pose health risks. Still,
teachers called for aggressive testing.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't get why they're not [testing]," said Barbara
Brammer, who has taught at the school since 1967 and sees an
allergist for symptoms she has had since the early 1990s. "We want to
be assured that we're working in a healthy place."</TE>
<TE>   Principal Ronald Kaiser said he is not sure whether his staff's
health problems are related to the school's indoor air.</TE>
<TE>   "The district has really tried to do its absolute best," he said.
"We don't want teachers and students in environments that are
unhealthy. In years of budget crunch, you can't keep pouring money to
test and test if there's no evidence."</TE>
<TE>   But there are signs of discomfort at Lindero Canyon. Carol
Pessara, a teacher with chronic allergy problems, has a photograph on
her classroom door that reads: "Mold Loft." She has had sinus
headaches for three years, and has been on a prescribed antihistamine
for two years.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is there are mold spores," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Special education teachers Sharon Lee and Heather Simmer, who
share a room, have air filters running all day, but they say they
continue to experience burning eyes and migraines.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I want to scratch my eyes out," Lee said. "It burns
all the time in here."</TE>
<TE>   Mold can be hard to find, but is sometimes detected by its
mildew-like odor.</TE>
<TE>   Testing can be as simple as taking air samples in the classroom
and comparing them with the air outside. It can also be as drastic as
tearing away walls or ceilings to look for mold. An extensive
examination can cost as much as $3,000 a room, Zimring said.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers at Lindero Canyon said in 1999 that the mold was found
clinging to walls behind cabinets and hidden from view by drop
ceilings. They also said carpets in many classrooms were soaked with
water because of leaky roofs, creating a welcome environment for
mold.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the health complaints, medical experts still cannot
explain why some people exposed to mold become ill. A sick person may
be diagnosed with allergies or migraines, but tests do not reveal
that mold is the cause. Also, individuals may react differently to
mold exposure, making it difficult for officials to determine how
much mold may be unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such an exceedingly complex problem because there are
hundreds of thousands of varieties of mold," said Sandy McNeel, an
environmental epidemiologist for the state Department of Health
Services. "We're still at the bottom of the learning curve when
finding out what makes people ill."</TE>
<TE>   Angelo Bellomo, director of environmental health and safety for
the Los Angeles Unified School District, said he believes more
medical research will reveal that mold can adversely affect health.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because a school district throws money at a problem, it
doesn't mean they've dealt with it effectively," Bellomo said. "The
evaluation process has to be done with good scientific principles.
Some [districts] are responding to fear and anxiety."</TE>
<TE>   One only has to look to Charles Helmers Elementary School in the
Saugus Union School District, where fear of toxic mold in portable
classrooms resulted in a $500,000 cleanup in 1999. Later, the state
Department of Health Services determined that poor ventilation, not
toxic mold, caused the headaches and nausea among students and
teachers there.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a painful experience," said Mark Fulmer, a former Saugus
administrator who is an assistant superintendent in the Visalia
Unified District. "People think you're hurting their kids."</TE>
<TE>   Some public agencies have developed recommendations for schools to
monitor the environmental quality in classrooms and other public
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Lindero Canyon is one of about 10,000 schools nationwide that have
adopted the Environmental Protection Agency's Indoor Air Quality
Tools for Schools in some form. The program recommends educating
faculty and staff to monitor ventilation, air conditioning and
humidity. Schools can apply the suggestions as they see fit.</TE>
<TE>   Principal Kaiser said his staff members are watching for problems
so mold damage can be prevented. The district will soon repair the
leaky roof, for example.</TE>
<TE>   More teachers than students have complained of symptoms, some
believe because teachers spend more time in one room than students,
who move from class to class. But others say the reason may be that
many students are just unaware of possible hazards.</TE>
<TE>   "We could be oblivious," said eighth-grader Katie Felber.</TE>

<LD>A masked gunman burst into a Newport Beach bank Saturday afternoon,
put a gun to a customer's head and ordered tellers to fill a bag with
cash, police said.</LD>
<LD>   No shots were fired in the 1:30 p.m. holdup at the Union Bank of
California on Westcliff Drive, said Newport Beach Police Lt. Mike
Jackson. The robber fled with an undisclosed amount of cash.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson said the robber grabbed a woman about to leave the bank
and walked her over to the first teller's window at gunpoint. The
robber threw a large bag on the counter and ordered the teller to
fill it and pass it to the next teller.</LD>
<TE>   The bandit was described as about 28 years old, 5 feet 6 and 140
pounds, with a black ski mask and red sweatpants.</TE>

<HD>UC Irvine Student Body Not Quite Ready for Sexuality Course</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Eighty degrees in late February, strolling around a University of
California campus on a Friday afternoon. Sometimes this job is a bit
much.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, there was research to be done.</LD>
<LD>   How would a random group of UC Irvine male students feel about the
suspending of a "male sexuality" course on their sister campus in
Berkeley, following allegations that the student instructor had sex
onstage at a gay strip club, held an orgy at his home and that some
students played a game in which they photographed their genitalia and
then tried to match the Polaroids with their classmates.</LD>
<TE>   Or, as I politely phrased it to the UCI students, why doesn't UCI
have a class like that? And if it did, would they sign up?</TE>
<TE>   The guys took the question a lot more seriously than I intended
it.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus seemed to be that there's Berkeley and then there's
Irvine. Same family, not much in common.</TE>
<TE>   "I just have better things to do with my time," said 25-year-old
Joel Wilcox. "I'm here to get an education.... There's plenty of
exploring of sexuality around campus without making it part of the
curriculum," Wilcox suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "The premise is fascinating, but the field trips?" asked
wise-cracking Jeff Cashin. "That's why I'm glad all the liberals went
to Berkeley." That said, Cashin, 19, added that he isn't repulsed by
the idea of the class; it's just not one he'd sign up for.</TE>
<TE>   Two medical school hopefuls said the Berkeley class, for which
students get two credits, speaks well for the school. However, both
said they're too busy pursuing their majors to give much thought to
whether they'd enroll if UCI offered it.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't attend the class; it's just not my personal interest,"
said Sameer Menda, 23. But he was quick to add that the
open-mindedness the class symbolizes is good for society. "I'd like
to think these kids [on the UCI campus] aren't a direct reflection of
Orange County," he said. "I hope the kids aren't that conservative."</TE>
<TE>   Bio-Chem Major Would 'Feel Weird' in Class</TE>
<TE>   His buddy, Sumeet Kadakia, echoed that. He's a biology-chemistry
major, doesn't have a whole lot of elective-class choices and
couldn't squeeze in a class like male sexuality. Plus, he said, "I'd
feel weird."</TE>
<TE>   Tell me about it, dude. When I was in college, I'd have signed up
for astrophysics before enrolling in male sexuality. Not that it was
in the picture--Nebraska U. in the early '70s wasn't ready for such
things, although degrees were offered in animal husbandry.</TE>
<TE>   Biology major Amine Chahbouni said he doesn't have time for a male
sexuality course but refused to condemn it.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be interesting to study sexual behavior, to see what
other people think about it, and the stereotypes about men,
especially from radical feminists," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Would such a class fly at UCI? "Berkeley is liberal; we're very
conservative," he said. "You've got to study hard to keep from
falling behind. Sociologically, a class like that would make students
more aware of what's going on around them. Life is not just about
books and studying, but unfortunately, the environment around here
forces you to do that."</TE>
<TE>   This got me thinking that UCI does have a different breed of
student. I would have expected any group of 10 guys to ask where the
line formed for such a class.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so Irvine isn't Berkeley. We all know that.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was heartening to conclude my research with 20-year-old
psychology major Dante Mapanao. He reminded me much more of the guys
from my dormitory floor. He guffawed when hearing about the Berkeley
class but, under pressure, conceded that a class like that "is not
what we really came here for."</TE>
<TE>   I asked about his class schedule. "I have a full load," he said.
Then, after pausing for a second, he added with a big laugh, "But I'm
sure I could fit it in somewhere. I'd figure out a way to do it."</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Vying to Be the No. 1 Crime Fighter</HD>
<DH>Election: No ordinary Democrat, Davis is endorsed by law
enforcement. But GOP rivals are not impressed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Contemporary California history offers at least one reason for Gov.
Gray Davis to be worried about his chances for reelection: Of the
four Democratic governors to hold the state's highest office in the
20th century, three lost bids for reelection when voters turned on
them over issues of crime and punishment.</LD>
<LD>   But Davis is no ordinary Democrat--with his support of the death
penalty and his long list of law enforcement endorsements, he has
built a public safety resume hard to assail from the right--and these
are not ordinary times. Because of those two facts, the quest to
capture voters' sentiments on public safety issues remains an open
one in the race for governor of California.</LD>
<LD>   "When you look back on the history of this state ... the Achilles'
heel for Democrats was public safety," said Garry South, Davis' chief
campaign strategist. But this year, he added: "On this issue of
public safety--that is going to be one of the definitional issues of
the campaign--ironically and paradoxically, the Democrat has the
advantage."</LD>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones, financier Bill Simon Jr. and former
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan--the three Republican candidates
hoping to unseat Davis--unequivocally disagree, and each has made
public safety a mainstay of his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who built the Los Angeles Police Department to its
largest force ever but fell short of his pledge to put 3,000
additional police officers on Los Angeles streets, says he will put
his record against Davis' any time. Under Riordan, crime in Los
Angeles fell precipitously, as it did across the nation during those
years; it also turned up slightly near the end of Riordan's term,
just as it was leveling off elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what people are looking for is a strong leader who has a
record like I have in the city of Los Angeles, cutting crime and
making life more secure," Riordan said. "I believe in strong law
enforcement, obviously."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who wrote the "three-strikes" law in 1994 when he was a
state assemblyman, said he is unfazed by Davis' law enforcement
endorsements and that he too finds the governor's public safety
record dismal.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on what I've seen, the governor has not done anything to
improve public safety on his own," Jones said. "Among all the
candidates, Republican or Democrat, I have the best record, period."</TE>
<TE>   Simon points to his experience as a federal prosecutor to show
that he is tough on crime and criminals. A recent radio advertisement
notes that he is the only candidate who has put criminals behind
bars. Simon also has capitalized on the support of his onetime boss,
former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a firm law enforcement
advocate.</TE>
<TE>   For the Republicans, history suggests reasons for hope, as state
voters have often dumped Democratic governors over public safety
issues.</TE>
<TE>   There was, for instance, Culbert Olsen, a Democrat elected in 1939
who was ousted after one term by Earl Warren. Olsen was soundly
rejected by voters in his bid for a second term mainly because he
pardoned a militant San Francisco labor organizer and released from
prison several others alleged to have Communist sympathies, political
consultants say.</TE>
<TE>   The next Democrat to serve as governor, Pat Brown, succeeded in
winning a second term but lost his bid for a third to Ronald Reagan
in 1966. Brown's defeat, political analysts say, was largely due to
his avid opposition to the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   His son, Jerry Brown, while governor, lost his race for the U.S.
Senate in 1979 in large part because of his veto of the death penalty
reinstatement and his appointments of liberal anti-death-penalty
judges. Brown was succeeded by George Deukmejian, a Republican
attorney general who ran on a tough anti-crime platform and presided
over a state prison construction boom.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a Hard-Line Approach</TE>
<TE>   Those lessons have not been lost on Davis, who served as chief of
staff under Jerry Brown and who has studiously worked to protect
himself from any charge that he is soft on crime.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has long championed the death penalty. And when he was
elected in 1997, Davis vowed that no murderers would be released
while he was governor. His refusal to consider parole for killers has
set off a number of legal challenges by inmate advocates who argue
that he has undermined a fair hearing in those cases. Federal public
defenders, for example, asked a judge earlier this year to prevent
Davis from acting on a clemency request, saying the governor was
biased.</TE>
<TE>   For three years, the Davis administration escaped any serious
challenge to its record on crime and safety--no riots, no big union
strikes, no huge flare-ups over capital punishment. Prison
populations even declined during his tenure in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   But the events of Sept. 11 instantly thrust safety back to the top
of the public agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Since the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, Davis has
created an anti-terrorism task force, appointed a high-level
anti-terrorism advisor, increased the budget for the California
Highway Patrol to monitor major state infrastructures, and boosted
the budget for the National Guard.</TE>
<TE>   The political nature of those moves was made clear as Davis
invited the irritation of the Bush administration when he issued a
warning of possible terrorist attacks against four major bridges,
including the Golden Gate and the Vincent Thomas. Davis said he based
his announcement on information from the FBI and two federal
agencies, but other federal officials said the threat had not been
verified and later said it wasn't credible.</TE>
<TE>   Though Davis' announcement was seen by some political analysts and
others as an overreaction, others said the governor's actions did not
tarnish his image with the public. On the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that the public reaches the same conclusions that
close observers would reach," said Roy Behr, a Democratic consultant
who is not involved in the gubernatorial race but works on state and
national campaigns. "Even if they thought he was hyping it, that is a
far less serious political mistake to make than to underestimate the
risk and be caught with your pants down. He made sort of the safer
mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Jones countered that Davis showed weak leadership in the bridge
episode.</TE>
<TE>   "When the government in Washington did not respond to the same
information with the same level of concern, then you have to call
into question the [governor's] decision-making process," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Law Enforcement Lauds Davis' Actions</TE>
<TE>   CHP Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick, whose officers are charged
with monitoring the state's infrastructure, applauded Davis for his
caution.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't interpret it as political grandstanding," said Helmick,
a Davis supporter who was one of Davis' first appointments. "I
believe his intent was good."</TE>
<TE>   In his State of the State address, Davis endorsed an expansion of
the state's authority to tap phone lines, another move he said was
motivated by his determination to respond to security threats. That
measure sputtered in the Legislature after that body's lawyer
concluded that the Davis proposal would overstep the state's
authority under federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Some political consultants warn that candidates can go too far in
responding to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be death to any candidate who overplays this issue," said
Ray McNally, a Republican media consultant who is working on Jones'
campaign. "Voters are looking for someone to protect them, but boy,
if they get a sense that any candidate is playing on their fears or
trying to exploit a national tragedy, that will be death."</TE>
<TE>   South, Davis' chief strategist, said that because Davis is the
incumbent governor responsible for protecting the state, voters give
him "high marks" in preparing California for any potential attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Whichever of the three Republicans wins the nomination, if they
try to make the issue of security post-Sept. 11 a defining issue and
put the governor in a negative light, it will be detrimental to their
own standing," South said. "They have no standing to talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   That view is echoed by other analysts who say a public still
jittery about terrorism may be inclined to stick with incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in some ways it gives Gov. Davis an advantage since he's
in office," said Bill Carrick, a Democratic political consultant who
is not involved in the governor's race. "This is one area where he
can ... take decisive action. For governors and mayors, it gives them
an opportunity to focus the public's attention on their executive
abilities."</TE>
<TE>   Simon agreed that most incumbents would benefit, but added: "An
exception is Gray Davis. I believe he may be one of the few [who is
voted out of office], and I think that tells you something."</TE>
<TE>   For Davis, the image intended to convey his law enforcement bona
fides is the recurring shot of him backed by men and women in
uniform. He has tied up most of the large rank-and-file and
management law enforcement endorsements, primarily by maintaining
strong ties to state police, sheriffs and prison guard unions. Davis'
ads criticizing Riordan pointedly note, for instance, that even Los
Angeles police are not backing the former L.A. mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the state, those unions responded to Davis' attention
with campaign contributions and are considered key to his reelection
efforts. The prison guards union, one of the most prolific campaign
contributors among state labor groups, donated more than $2 million
to elect Davis in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, some political consultants say Davis' law enforcement
endorsements offer only limited help.</TE>
<TE>   "He still has to prove that he's good for public safety," McNally
said. "In a high-profile, top-of-the-ticket race like this,
endorsements will only take you so far."</TE>
<TE>   Other political consultants say the Republican gubernatorial
candidates, despite their determination to make public safety an
issue, have yet to do so effectively, in part because they have not
spelled out the differences among them. Rather, they are poised to
take the fight to Davis. They are, in the words of Carrick, "in a
classic minority mode where everything they do is positioned against
Davis."</TE>
<TE>   The Republicans in the race and their consultants view it
differently. They say President Bush's high approval rating will help
their chances against Davis, in part because the governor is widely
viewed as at odds with the president, on issues ranging from public
safety to energy. That, they add, will amplify what they see as a
natural Republican advantage on crime.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a Democrat, you work very hard to get someone in
uniform to say something nice about you," McNally said. "Education,
environment are Democratic issues. Tax relief, public safety
typically are Republican."</TE>
<TE>   Voters' Fears Have Subsided for Now</TE>
<TE>   One recent survey showed terrorism and security concerns declining
on voters' list of most important issues, falling to fourth--behind
education, the economy and the state's electricity supply.</TE>
<TE>   But public safety is an issue on which voters occasionally have
turned quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Campaigns, political experts agree, can rise and fall on a single
high-profile crime that horrifies the public and spurs the electorate
to quick action.</TE>
<TE>   Take the murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas, for instance. Her
death in 1993 became the impetus for the three-strikes law.</TE>
<TE>   Or the Stockton schoolyard killings in 1989. That shooting led
voters to approve a statewide ban on assault weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "These," Behr said, "are the types of things that drive electoral
debates."</TE>

<HD>N. Hollywood High Wins Science Bowl</HD>
<DH>Education: School team takes regional title for fifth year
and advances to national contest.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reigning national champion and perennial science powerhouse North
Hollywood High School captured the regional Science Bowl title
Saturday for the fifth year running. The five-member team will now
move ahead to national competition to defend its title.</LD>
<LD>   North Hollywood defeated the Van Nuys High School team in the
final round of Science Bowl X competition, sponsored by the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power. Venice and Grant high schools
placed third and fourth, respectively.</LD>
<LD>   Led by coach Len Soloff, the North Hollywood team members are
David Lee, 17, and Julia Hu, 16, of Northridge; George Marti and
Justin Burdick, both 17, of Studio City; and Zahra Yazdani, 16, of
North Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   The regional competition drew 42 teams from 25 of the city's
private, parochial and Los Angeles Unified School District high
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, every team that won the DWP Science Bowl has finished
among the final four in national competition. Van Nuys won the
national title in 1995. Venice captured top honors in 1996 and 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "This region has the best record of any area in the country," DWP
spokesman Walter Zeisl said.</TE>
<TE>   The theme for this year's event--"100 Years of Engineering in Los
Angeles"--saluted technical achievements in the city, among them
construction of the California Aqueduct and freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the General Electric College Bowl, the Science Bowl pits
two teams--each with four students and an alternate--against one
another. The students must answer rapid-fire questions on subjects
such as physics, chemistry, calculus, earth and space science and
current events in technology.</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood will compete among 64 regional championship teams
from 40 states in the U.S. Department of Energy National Science Bowl
in Washington, D.C., May 3-6.</TE>

<HD>Eu's Name a Hurdle for Foes</HD>
<DH>Primary: Democratic secretary of state rivals Alioto and
Shelley press to overcome recognition edge of woman who held the job
for 20 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Her opponents wish she'd stick with oil painting and golf. But March
Fong Eu--who turns 80 next month--has had it with retirement and
wants to be California's secretary of state. Again.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not done yet," declares Eu. She held the job for nearly 20
years, but insists, "I still have some things to finish up."</LD>
<LD>   For fellow Democrats in the race, Eu's renewed interest is
unfortunate. Analysts say her enduring name identification among
voters gives the petite, energetic grandmother a solid edge heading
into the March 5 primary election.</LD>
<TE>   Polls confirm that assessment, showing Eu--who resigned from the
job in 1994 to become an ambassador--with a solid lead over rivals
Michela Alioto and Assemblyman Kevin Shelley (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who holds office for 20 years is going to infiltrate the
voters' consciousness to some degree," says Dan Schnur, a Republican
strategist. "But if your name is on the sample ballots they receive
every election, that adds up to a lot of name ID."</TE>
<TE>   Alioto, who nearly ousted incumbent Bill Jones four years ago,
concedes that Eu is a formidable force and that her own candidacy is
"in some ways a shot in the dark."</TE>
<TE>   But Shelley, who enjoys the support of the Democratic
establishment, says that once voters get to know him, he'll surge
past Eu on election day. "March Fong Eu performed during her time.
But now California needs a modern approach," he says.</TE>
<TE>   To overcome Eu's advantage, Shelley and Alioto must get their
names into California households--quickly. But waging a statewide
campaign requires television, and TV time is expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Alioto, who has raised about $600,000, says she simply has no
money to go on the air. Shelley has raised $1.4 million, and is
running ads featuring his endorsement by California's U.S. senators,
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, and Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante.
What remains to be seen is whether he can be on TV with enough
frequency to make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary of state is California's chief elections officer,
charged with enforcing electoral laws, printing ballot pamphlets and
supervising voting. In addition, the office keeps records of lobbying
activities and campaign contributions and expenditures. The secretary
also handles the registration of corporations and trademarks and is
custodian of the state archives.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, the race for the $131,250-a-year job is a sleepy one.
It's a relatively unglamorous post, and with the exception of Jerry
Brown, no California secretary of state in modern times has gone on
to become governor.</TE>
<TE>   But in the wake of what has been dubbed the "Florida fiasco"--the
disputed count of thousands of ballots in the 2000 presidential
contest--the post seems to have new appeal. Five Democrats, three
Republicans and five minor party candidates are vying for the job
Jones must vacate at the end of his second term in January. Jones, a
Republican, has been widely credited with modernizing the office and
expanding the online reporting of campaign documents and lobbyist
filings. His successor's most pressing task will be to oversee
California's switch from the much maligned punch-card voting machines
to a new system.</TE>
<TE>   Punch-card voting--still used by most of the electorate, including
Los Angeles County--fell out of favor after the Florida controversy
over ballots with "hanging" or "pregnant" chads.</TE>
<TE>   Touch-Screen Voting a Key Issue</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge has ruled that the punch-card machines in
California must go by 2004. The preferred choice is computer
touch-screen voting, in which voters press selections on a machine
resembling a bank ATM. The computers offer choices in different
languages and permit voters to correct mistakes before sending their
electronic ballot.</TE>
<TE>   So far, only Riverside County is using touch-screen voting on a
widespread basis. Other counties are waiting for money from the
federal government--an estimated $300 million is expected to come
California's way--or from a bond measure on the March ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley, 46, is the author of Proposition 41 and is selling
himself as the candidate with the experience and new ideas to see
California through the voting transition. A former San Francisco
supervisor, he was elected to the Legislature in 1996 and serves as
Assembly majority leader. But he must leave the lower house at the
end of the year because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he won Gov. Gray Davis' signature on a bill allowing
Californians to apply for permanent absentee voter status. He also
authored a bill--now stalled in the state Senate--that would increase
poll worker training, create a "voters' bill of rights" and fund a
voter education campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Like his rivals, Shelley says one of the secretary of state's
priorities should be reversing the steady decline in voter turnout.
Toward that end, he would allow people to register to vote up through
election day, and he proposes a "youth voting corps" to rally
interest in suffrage within the younger generation.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can teach the public to stop smoking, to recycle and to
wear seat belts, why can't we use the same moral imperative to get
them to vote?" Shelley asks.</TE>
<TE>   Alioto also talks passionately about electoral participation, and
says she would push a school-based voter education program modeled
after the presidential physical fitness awards. She also believes
that voting must be made more convenient for today's busy families
and recommends holding polls open for multiple days.</TE>
<TE>   Alioto, 33, is a partner in a Napa Valley winery and has never
held elective office. But she is the granddaughter of the late San
Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto, and she nearly upset Jones in 1998,
falling short by about 60,000 votes. This time, however, Shelley has
locked up the Democratic Party support, as well as endorsements from
environmental, labor and women's groups.</TE>
<TE>   Paralyzed from the waist down in a skiing accident, Alioto has
made access to the polls for the disabled a feature of her platform.
She decided to run for office, she says, because of her frustration
with polling places that were inaccessible to people in wheelchairs.</TE>
<TE>   Alioto Formerly Worked for Al Gore</TE>
<TE>   A domestic policy staffer to former Vice President Al Gore, she
also favors improving the online reporting of campaign finance
documents, and making it possible for business owners to complete all
required paperwork via computer.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still really far behind in making these sorts of things
possible online," Alioto says.</TE>
<TE>   Eu burst back onto the political scene last year in dramatic
fashion--by using an ax to smash a punch-card voting machine on the
Capitol steps. Her slogan is "no more chad," and she totes a
touch-screen voting machine along on campaign stops.</TE>
<TE>   Eu was named ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia by
President Clinton in 1994, prompting her to leave office near the end
of her fifth term as secretary of state. During her tenure, she
launched registration by mail and put candidate statements in the
statewide ballot pamphlet.</TE>
<TE>   Some have questioned her return to politics, but Eu says the
Florida debacle made her "really mad" and determined to protect
California from a similar disaster: "We've got to get rid of these
old machines. I already know my way around [Sacramento]. I have the
experience to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Eu has broken barriers throughout her political career, becoming
the first Asian American woman elected to the Legislature--in
1966--and the first Asian American to hold a statewide constitutional
office. Now, by running as an almost 80-year-old, Eu believes she's
proving that older Americans still have a lot to offer.</TE>
<TE>   Her age, she says, "comes up all the time, and it's quite
insulting. We people of advanced years are still quite capable."</TE>
<TE>   Like her opponents, Eu wants to boost turnout by focusing on young
people and permitting election-day voter registration. She also
favors more detailed online disclosure of campaign finance documents
and wants to expand the Golden State Museum to display artifacts
currently stored in warehouses.</TE>
<TE>   Eu, who says she loathes fund-raising, has recorded contributions
totaling about $858,000. Of that amount, $220,000 represents loans
she made to her campaign, and a substantial chunk comes from the
auction of many of her paintings.</TE>
<TE>   Although she trails Shelley in money raised, she isn't worried:
"Everywhere I go, people say they remember me," she says
matter-of-factly. "I'm thrilled."</TE>
<TE>   Two other Democrats are running, but lack the money to mount a
statewide campaign. They are Long Beach attorney Carl Henley and
Santa Monica author Shawn Casey O'Brien.</TE>
<TE>   On the Republican side, former Assemblyman Keith Olberg of
Victorville is expected to defeat the lesser known Barbara Jean Marr
and Mike Schaefer of Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Heat Wave Throws Skiers for Loop</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Warm weather creates slushy runs and can keep
resorts from making their own snow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is one word that local ski and snowboard enthusiasts have been
using a lot lately. But it's not snowplow, halfpipe or even slalom.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, it's slush.</LD>
<LD>   The calendar says we're still mired in winter, but at local ski
resorts, snowfall is down and temperatures are hovering near 60
degrees. What snow there is on the mountains, mostly man-made, has
become, under a strong February sun, the slushy consistency of a
Slurpee.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, Gretchen Walters, 43, a waitress from Corona and
season-pass ticket holder at Mountain High, took her 10-year-old
daughter, Hannah, to the Wrightwood resort for a day of snowboarding.
But by 11 a.m., she was considering calling it a day. "It's like
mashed potatoes out there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although much of the snow had frozen into ice the night before,
the 2-foot base seemed to be disappearing fast in the heat of the
midday sun.</TE>
<TE>   In a few areas, snow had melted away altogether, leaving bald
patches of dirt; in others, the man-made snow had been reduced to
puddles of water more suitable for summer sports. For both veterans
and those snowboarding or skiing for the first time, such conditions
are less than ideal.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get much control with the snow this way," said Kent
Kvammen, 74, of Newport Beach, a longtime skier. "If you ski too
fast, you are likely to catch an edge and fall."</TE>
<TE>   B.J. Yabut, 26, a biochemist who lives in Pomona, had done just
that. He had a fresh scrape across his right cheek--the result of an
icy encounter with a Mountain High slope. "I hit a jump, landed and
caught an edge," said the snowboarder. "I went face first."</TE>
<TE>   For ski resorts, spring-like conditions at this time of year can
be a mixed blessing. Warm weather often brings out skiers in droves.
But high temperatures preclude snowmaking. And without snowmaking,
there has been no new snow.</TE>
<TE>   For effective snowmaking, temperatures must be near or below 32,
with relatively low levels of humidity. Using electric or diesel
power, the snow machines spray water into tiny particles, cool them
and distribute the resulting snow onto a surface. But temperature is
crucial.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have an at least four-hour window of the right
temperatures to make it worth your while," said Brad Farmer of Bear
Mountain, a resort that can make its snow up to 24 hours a day using
water from Big Bear Lake. But the resort has made little snow
recently.</TE>
<TE>   Still, said Farmer, 90% of the resort's runs are open. But he
worries that "when people don't see snow on the hills, they often
assume there's no snow on the hills."</TE>
<TE>   Brad Wilson, assistant general manager of Mountain High, said
attendance there has been down for much of the last week, in part
because of the condition of the snow. But he said the number of
people visiting the resort for the year is higher than usual. "It's
very cyclical," he said. "We can go up and down with the
temperatures, whether it's January, February or March. But still,
this weather is unusual for February."</TE>
<TE>   Katie Gelbart and Lauren Dunlop, both 13, from Rancho Santa
Margarita, said they ski in Wrightwood almost every other weekend
when conditions are prime, usually in late February and March. This
time, said Katie, "it's either slush or ice packed together."</TE>
<TE>   "And then it gets sunny, and it all melts again," said Lauren.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson of Mountain High said he's not overly concerned about the
current warm weather or the spring conditions. "We'll be back to
winter next week," he predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he added, "I kind of enjoy the weather. Every time is
different. That's what makes skiing different than bowling."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 1-year-old boy was killed in the driveway of his Cypress home
Saturday morning when he fell under a family car being moved by his
father, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred in the 5100 block of Edgemont Circle about
10 a.m., police Sgt. Steven Ramsey said.</LD>
<LD>   Alan Paulson, 23, was moving his car a short distance with the
driver's door open, the engine off and the transmission in neutral,
Ramsey said. His son walked into the path of the open door, was
knocked to the ground and pinned under the car, he said.</LD>
<TE>   When police officers arrived, neighbors were performing CPR on the
boy, who was no longer breathing and had no pulse.</TE>
<TE>   Officers, and later paramedics, continued to treat the child but
to no avail, Ramsey said.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, it just looks like a tragic accident," Ramsey
said. "But we are continuing to investigate."</TE>
<TE>   The boy was taken to Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, where he
was pronounced dead of major head trauma, Ramsey said.</TE>

<DH>Palos Verdes: Allegations that locals protect turf by
intimidation come to a head in assault case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fight reportedly started with the question, "Hey, where are you
from?" It came from a self-appointed enforcer of a Palos Verdes
Estates credo: If you don't live here, don't surf here.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Banas, who was joined by his teenage son, Tommy, wasn't about
to back down. Surfboard tucked under his arm, he told the "locals" he
was going surfing, "right here," just as he has done for 25 years. "I
probably surfed here with your parents," he said, tossing in a
mouthful of expletives for emphasis, according to one account.</LD>
<LD>   Rocks began to fly. So did punches, until Banas' 18-year-old son
ended the brawl, onlookers say, by throwing a rock that lacerated the
skull of a man grappling with his father.</LD>
<TE>   Tim Banas wound up with a broken tooth and a knee injury. Chris
Millican, 21, suffered a two-inch gash to his scalp.</TE>
<TE>   The incident in early January--and a subsequent misdemeanor
assault charge against Tommy Banas--has uncorked three decades of
pent-up fury over contentions that rich kids from Palos Verdes
Estates use street-gang tactics to keep outsiders from surfing at
public beaches.</TE>
<TE>   The fight may seem mild compared with fatal gang attacks in other
parts of Los Angeles County. But beaches often breed territorial
tensions, even on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, with its
multimillion-dollar bluff-top homes.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting surfers complain of threats and menacing stares called
"stink-eye" from local surfers who belong to cliques such as the Bay
Boys and Dirty Underwear Gang.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors complain that they have returned to their cars after
surfing to find flattened tires, snapped antennas and other
vandalism. Others admit that they have fled before getting in the
water, chased away by local toughs.</TE>
<TE>   Local surfers don't like being compared to gang members. They
consider their cliques more like fraternities, created to prevent
their backyard surf spots from getting crowded.</TE>
<TE>   Some also contend that the fight between Banas and Millican was a
rare instance in which tough talk erupted into violence.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the incident, resulting, as it did, in charges against an
outsider but not against any of the locals, has put the spotlight on
surf access in Palos Verdes Estates and raised questions of equal
treatment by local police.</TE>
<TE>   Beach access, ironically, was a cause celebre on the Palos Verdes
Peninsula during the Save Our Coastline campaign of the early 1970s,
resulting in laws protecting the public's right to enjoy California
beaches.</TE>
<TE>   The South Bay chapter of the nonprofit Surfrider Foundation
recently released a statement declaring "war on localism." Its
members, mostly from Torrance, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach,
have scheduled a March 9 nonviolent "beach clean-up and paddle-out"
to reassert the public's right to use Palos Verdes Peninsula beaches.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the group have met several times with Palos Verdes
Estates Police Chief Timm Browne to settle on a strategy that will
end beach intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   Palos Verdes Estates police say they will lend the group
waterproof cameras to snap pictures of any offending locals. They
also are helping organize "Surf Watch" volunteers to stand guard over
prime surf spots during big swells, when the wave action is most
likely to draw visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Police Step Up Coastal Patrols</TE>
<TE>   Browne, a police chief who surfs, said he understands "everybody
has a right to get to the ocean." He has increased uniformed patrols
along a stretch of coast that includes popular surf spots such as The
Cove, Haggerty's, Indicator and Lunada Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Browne also has been running undercover stings to nab car vandals.
He even mounted an Internet camera with a powerful zoom lens atop his
house, city-owned property with a bird's-eye view of the surfing
beach where Banas tangled with the locals.</TE>
<TE>   The "surf cam" allows Internet viewers to watch the waves, or any
mischief taking place on the beach, at www.surfline.com. Police hope
the camera will act as a crime deterrent, much like a video camera in
a convenience store.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, a Torrance lawyer representing Tim Banas is
preparing to sue the group of local men that he says provoked the
Jan. 4 fight. The lawyer refers to them as the Dirty Underwear Gang.
The nickname grew out of the rump-scooting descent on the steep,
muddy trail down the bluff to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Sisson said he will try to invoke the state law that in
Los Angeles triggered numerous court injunctions against violent
street gangs, forbidding them from congregating in certain
neighborhoods. "You have a violent gang assaulting and attacking
non-locals to keep them off their 'pristine' beach," he said.
"There's no difference between these guys and the Crips and Bloods,
except perhaps money."</TE>
<TE>   The facts of the fight are in dispute. Banas said he was jumped by
Millican and others. The locals told police that Banas provoked the
fight with combative language and threw the first punch.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the district attorney's office has declined to file
charges against anyone but the younger Banas, citing a lack of
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Cohen, Tommy Banas' lawyer, said he expects his client to
be found innocent of the assault charge.</TE>
<TE>   "He and his dad were attacked," Cohen said. "He was doing his best
to protect his father and he ends up being charged. It's outrageous."</TE>
<TE>   The hostility toward outsiders known as localism is not unique to
the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Surf breaks in Hawaii, Oxnard, La Jolla
and Hollister Ranch in Santa Barbara County have similar reputations.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles area, parts of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan
Beach reportedly have cliques that maintain a pecking order in the
lineup of surfers competing for waves.</TE>
<TE>   The overarching problem is too many surfers chasing too few waves.</TE>
<TE>   Although the coastline seems vast, not all beaches are created
equal. Some surf spots draw bigger waves. The best of these surf
breaks have sand bars, rocky reefs or points of land that allow waves
to unspool in long ridable ribbons, instead of crashing all at once
in an unbroken wall of water.</TE>
<TE>   Rocky Shoreline Easily Defended</TE>
<TE>   The Palos Verdes Peninsula is blessed with some of the best point
breaks in Southern California. The gorgeous, rocky shoreline is also
easily defended.</TE>
<TE>   A clutch of local surfers can often be found on the bluffs
overlooking these beaches, checking the surf and greeting anyone who
happens by.</TE>
<TE>   To get to these beaches, surfers must pick their way down
cliff-side trails, where they are vulnerable to rocks thrown from
above. Once they are on the beach, the towering bluffs block any view
of their cars left behind.</TE>
<TE>   A group of about 200 to 300 Palos Verdes Estates residents surf
regularly at the prime spots. They range in age from pre-teens to
graying, balding men in their 50s. Most of them recognize each other
by face, if not by name. An unrecognized face is likely to prompt the
question, "Where are you from?"</TE>
<TE>   Some of these locals admit to misgivings about intimidation
tactics. Others worry more about attracting unwanted attention to
their beaches.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't talk to the press," said one thirtysomething man in
wraparound sunglasses, interrupting an interview with another surfer
at Lunada Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Dia, 28, who grew up in Palos Verdes Estates, said his fellow
locals are mad at him for recently getting arrested on a misdemeanor
charge that grew out of another beach confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   Their anger is not over the fact that he challenged a pair of
out-of-town surfers Jan. 16, but because his arrest has drawn
attention, more "heat," to the surfing beach. Dia fears he may lose
his standing in the group.</TE>
<TE>   He said locals are misrepresented as gangsters. The Banas fight,
he said, was the first he ever saw at Indicator.</TE>
<TE>   "There was 10 of us and one of him," Dia said. "We could have done
some serious damage to the guy. Instead, we asked him to leave."</TE>
<TE>   Locals Have to Wait for Their Turn Too</TE>
<TE>   Even locals get hassled, he said, if they don't wait their turn to
catch waves.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone comes down there to poach waves, it makes the regular
surfers pretty damn angry," he said. "You have to wait in line. You
aren't going to get a front-of-the-line pass. No way. It takes
years."</TE>
<TE>   To protect their home turf, some local surfers are lobbying for a
new city ordinance to limit parking on public streets to only
residents with permits.</TE>
<TE>   Others are circulating fliers that warn of falling property values
to pressure the City Council into removing the Web camera and to
prevent the installation of a second one that would scan the surf at
Lunada Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "Your neighborhood and surfing spots will be viewed by over 1.5
million surfers on the leading Internet Web site--Surfline.com," the
flier states. "This will drive hordes of people to come to these surf
spots. Will PV become the next Huntington Beach or Malibu surf
Mecca?"</TE>

<HD>It's Boss vs. Employee in Fiery D.A.'s Race</HD>
<DH>Tony Rackauckas is praised for fitting punishment to crime
but panned for his role in some cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON and STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man on a mission, Tony Rackauckas hung up his judge's robes in 1998
to rid the Orange County District Attorney's Office of what he called
the political cronyism and destructive prosecutorial policies that
had tarnished the agency.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly four years later, Rackauckas finds himself accused of
waging his own political crusade, with his loudest critics--and his
challenger in the March primary election--coming from within the
ranks of the district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   The attacks have done little to dent the resolve of a man who rose
from being a Long Beach street ruffian to a respected Superior Court
judge and the county's top prosecutor. His up-by-the-bootstraps
success story helps explain Rackauckas' abundant self-confidence,
which served him well on the bench and during his years as a deputy
prosecutor trying murder cases.</LD>
<TE>   As district attorney, however, Rackauckas has been a magnet for
controversy, attracting scrutiny from the state Attorney General's
Office and an Orange County grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Rackauckas was forced to dissolve his nonprofit
charity after state investigators found it mismanaged its assets.
Earlier, he came under fire for ordering prosecutors to withdraw from
a lawsuit against a firm owned by now-Ambassador to Spain George
Argyros, an Orange County GOP stalwart, whose apartment company
donated $1,000 to Rackauckas' 1998 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas has dismissed the accusations of political favoritism
and interoffice retaliation as the handiwork of his political
enemies--he calls them a few "disgruntled attorneys" left over from
former Dist. Atty. Mike Capizzi's administration, an administration
that Rackauckas said voters elected him to dismantle.</TE>
<TE>   He has accused his political opponents of orchestrating and hyping
the investigation, which he said is nothing more than a "routine
audit."</TE>
<TE>   "We have this situation where we've got these people who are
basically trying to take the office back [and] are doing all this
complaining," Rackauckas said last week. "I see it as a organized
effort to get my opponent elected, so I think a lot of that is going
to change after the election."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas urged voters to look at his record.</TE>
<TE>   Since taking office, gang murders have dropped 50%, child support
collections are up 60% and the county's overall crime rate has been
on a steady decline, he said. He's launched outreach programs in the
Latino and Vietnamese communities and made prosecuting environmental
crimes a priority, as when felony charges were filed against the city
of Huntington Beach for allowing millions of gallons of raw sewage to
leak from aging underground pipes.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask yourself, do we have a safe community? How are we doing?
What's the crime rate look like around here? In that regard, we're
doing great," said Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas was known as both a tough trial lawyer and fair-minded
judge before being elected district attorney in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He served for 16 years as a deputy district attorney, and was
named 1986 Prosecutor of the Year by his peers before then-Gov.
George Deukmejian appointed him as a municipal court judge in 1990.
Three years later, Gov. Pete Wilson elevated Rackauckas to the
Superior Court bench.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas, 58, lives in Santa Ana with his son, Zack, and wife,
Kay, who also is one of his deputy district attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Before serving on the bench, Rackauckas led efforts to remove
Chief Justice Rose Bird from the California Supreme Court and
coauthored the Crime Victim's Justice Reform Act. In response to the
1979 case against Larry Singleton, who served an eight-year prison
sentence after he raped and cut off the arms of his victim,
Rackauckas authored a new "torture statute" that mandates a life
sentence for such crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "When Tony walked down the hall, people held him in awe. He was a
consummate homicide prosecutor, considered one of the top prosecutors
in the office," said Assistant Dist. Atty. Bill Feccia, an Orange
County prosecutor for 23 years, who joined the office when Rackauckas
was in the homicide unit and now serves as one of his managers.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters say Rackauckas is extraordinarily fair, and
interested in justice above all else.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said he chose to run for district attorney in 1998
because he thought Capizzi was unfairly pursuing the maximum
punishment in three-strikes cases for such offenses as petty theft.</TE>
<TE>   He also wanted to do away with Capizzi's policy of prohibiting
plea bargaining, insisting that it forced judges to deal exclusively
with defense attorneys and led to lighter sentences. Prosecutors say
the change has given them a renewed voice in the process--and made
them more credible in the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "What he restored is our ability to seek justice, to seek the
appropriate punishment for the crime and gave us a voice in the
system," said Assistant Dist. Atty. Marc Rozenberg, head of the
office's gang unit.</TE>
<TE>   Along with boosting salaries, Rackauckas' supporters emphasize
that he has improved the technology available to his staff.
Prosecutors have their own computers and e-mail access, and routinely
bring computers into the courtroom. Rackauckas hired a full-time
grant-proposal writer who helps the office obtain millions of dollars
each year, said Chuck Middleton, chief assistant district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "He simply says, 'I trust you to make the right decision.' And he
gives us the tools to do our job efficiently," said Assistant Dist.
Atty. Rosanne Froeberg.</TE>
<TE>   He's also placed an emphasis on gang prosecutions, adding three
full-time prosecutors and three investigators to the office's
existing gang unit.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the praise for Rackauckas has been tempered by a series of
questionable personnel moves and prosecutorial decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the Assn. of Orange County Deputy District Attorneys
endorsed Rackauckas' opponent, veteran prosecutor Wally Wade. It was
the first time the association has not endorsed an incumbent district
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "He is like a two-headed monster. He has some ideas that are good
and some that are completely unethical," said Christopher Evans,
former top assistant to Rackauckas, who left the office and is now
supporting Wade. "The problem is, you can't have a district attorney
[who] has ethical issues."</TE>
<TE>   When Rackauckas took office, it was the first time in more than
four decades that an outsider was elected district attorney--and he
did so by defeating Wade, Capizzi's choice as a successor.</TE>
<TE>   For Rackauckas, it was similar to a hostile corporate
takeover--with one major difference. Because of civil-service
protection for county employees, Rackauckas could demote but not fire
Wade and his political supporters in the district attorney's office,
many of whom were top managers.</TE>
<TE>   Within three years, the office was hit with at least four employee
lawsuits, and accusations that Rackauckas was retaliating against
critics.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most controversial moves was Rackauckas' decision to
fire veteran prosecutor Mike Jacobs, the man who once headed the
homicide unit. Rackauckas claimed he had legal cause for the
termination. But Jacobs denied that and filed a wrongful-termination
lawsuit that is pending.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the only one in management who stood up against him and
challenged his breaches in ethics and breaches in following the law,
which seemed to be almost constant," Jacobs said.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs and two other prosecutors eventually flew to Sacramento and
urged state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer to investigate Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   They did so after learning that Rackauckas' nonprofit foundation
had plans to issue district attorney badges--like those issued to
prosecutors--to some donors. They also told state officials that
Rackauckas was using public employees to help run his foundation,
specifically to conduct background checks on potential foundation
board members. State investigators also said the charity had
mismanaged its assets, but would not reveal details.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the attorney general's office dropped the
investigation after Rackauckas agreed to shut down the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "If a cop or prosecutor misuses their badge, they face serious
consequences, including the loss of their job," said Deputy Dist.
Atty. Joe Smith, who said he was reassigned after he complained to
Rackauckas about the badges. "But what consequence befalls a rich,
politically connected friend of Tony Rackauckas who gets pulled over
by the CHP and flashes the badge?" Smith asked.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas also came under fire earlier this year for intervening
in a case involving a friend, Newport Beach businessman Patrick
DiCarlo, who came to him in 1999 to say he was being threatened over
a business deal.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney. assigned two investigators to the case but
pulled them off weeks later, saying they were treating DiCarlo more
like a crime suspect than a victim. Rackauckas then placed the
investigators on paid leave and publicly accused them of stealing
tapes and other records related to the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   After being criticized for his actions, Rackauckas asked the state
attorney general to take over the case.</TE>
<TE>   The incident that has attracted the most attention was Rackauckas'
involvement in a consumer-protection case involving Argyros.
Rackauckas ordered prosecutors to withdraw a lawsuit against Argyros'
company, accused of unfairly keeping security deposits from thousands
of tenants, and then Rackauckas took over negotiations himself. After
critics faulted his actions, Rackauckas handed the case over to the
state attorney general. Argyros' company settled for $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said most of the complaints against him are thinly
veiled political paybacks orchestrated mostly by Wade, whom
Rackauckas trounced in the 1998 election. In his latest campaign,
Wade has used the allegations to attack Rackauckas' integrity.</TE>
<TE>   "So many of these complaints that were being raised were
encouraged and exacerbated by Wally all along the way," Rackauckas
said. "Ultimately, he's the beneficiary of them."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the turmoil, Rackauckas is confident that the majority of
the prosecutors in his office are happy, both with their jobs and his
tenure in office.</TE>
<TE>   As a kid growing up in Long Beach, Anthony Rackauckas' future as a
judge and Orange County's top law-enforcement officer appeared to be,
at best, a longshot.</TE>
<TE>   While in high school, Rackauckas hung out with what he now
jokingly calls a "social club"--a band of teenage boys hyped on fast
cars and no strangers to trouble.</TE>
<TE>   After a fight with a rival club, Rackauckas wound up in Juvenile
Hall in Los Angeles, charged with assault.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an important reality check," he said. "I didn't have my

<HD>Juror Relief May Turn to Grief</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judges say prosecutors' chronic failure to be ready
on time could jeopardize the effectiveness of the 'one-trial' system.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County district attorney's chronic failure to be
ready for trials on time threatens the effectiveness of the popular
"one-trial" jury system, scheduled to expand to the largest
courthouses downtown next month, top legal officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Several judges said that although the one-trial system is working
elsewhere, delays blamed on prosecutors in Los Angeles could create a
ripple effect that limits juror availability. They are concerned that
dozens of jurors would not be used the day they report to court--as
required by state law--and therefore would, under the one-day,
one-trial system, be excused for at least a year.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the downtown district, which draws jurors from within
a 20-mile radius, would cause strains in other court districts by
pulling jurors from shared territories. "We're going to have vacuum
cleaners sucking up jurors in districts with overlapping radii," said
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Paul Gutman.</LD>
<TE>   Judges say prosecutors in Los Angeles are especially responsible
for the concerns because they are repeatedly unprepared for trial.
Although defense lawyers also ask for delays, they usually file their
requests before jurors have been summoned for trials, judges say.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Supervising Criminal Judge David Wesley assigns cases to
judges for trial in the downtown Criminal Courts Building. He said he
receives 10 to 25 motions from prosecutors each week to continue
trials. That means hundreds of jurors could be wasted weekly if there
are not any improvements before the jury system reform expands next
month, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very rare day when there isn't a motion by a [deputy]
district attorney to either continue or trail a case," he said. "I'm
not in that court to hear continuance motions all day. I'm in there
to send cases out to trial."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles already has had more problems than other counties in
implementing the jury reform, which started Jan. 1, 2000. The
one-trial system is in use in the 57 counties required to adopt it,
and in all of Los Angeles County except for the four courthouses
serving downtown. Of those four, the Metropolitan Courthouse and
Central Civil West are starting the reform this week, and the County
Courthouse and the Criminal Justice Center will be on board by the
end of March, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to make jury service more convenient and to increase
the number of jurors who show up for their civic duty. Although there
have been scattered glitches, the program is working well throughout
California, said Riverside County Superior Court Judge Dallas Holmes,
the head of a statewide task force on jury reform.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for the one-trial system, Superior Court Judge Dan Oki
began warning the district attorney's office last year that the court
system would be required to use jurors more efficiently. He advised
prosecutors and defense lawyers that they no longer could wait until
the end of the 60-day speedy trial period to begin criminal trials.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Oki, who supervises the criminal division, began
requiring that all prosecutors and defense lawyers be ready to start
trials no later than two days before that time period expires.</TE>
<TE>   Several judges said that when the one-trial system kicks in
downtown, jury administrators will have to summon about three times
more prospective jurors than they have called in under the old
system. That means they will need to summon almost every eligible
citizen once a year to provide the 7,000 to 10,000 people needed each
day for trials countywide.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Dist. Atty. John Allen, who oversees trial operations,
said prosecutors have cooperated with Oki's policy and are just as
concerned as judges about having enough jurors. But Allen said that
often his prosecutors need postponements because they are handed
cases the same day the trial is supposed to start. The office is also
short-staffed, Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been hustling and scraping and struggling ... because it
can cause a great deal of headache to us," Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with last-minute delays came to a head last month when
Wesley refused to grant a prosecutor's 11th-hour request for
postponement of an attempted-murder trial and dismissed the case.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Lincoln, a 56-year-old man accused of attempted murder, was
scheduled to be tried at the beginning of January. On Jan. 2, a
prosecutor told a judge that the district attorney's office was ready
to try the case.</TE>
<TE>   But later that day, Deputy Dist. Atty. Molly Long looked at the
case and realized that her office had failed to subpoena the
witnesses for trial. She immediately filed a motion citing the
mistake and requesting a delay.</TE>
<TE>   When she got to court the next day, she told Wesley she was not
ready and wanted to postpone the trial until Jan. 4, the final day
under the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial.</TE>
<TE>   Wesley rejected the request, saying she failed to give an adequate
reason for needing the delay. He then granted the defense motion to
dismiss the case.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley wrote a strongly worded letter to Oki
protesting the dismissal. He said his prosecutors do not have to
provide a good reason for wanting delays within the 60 days. "We are
not going to relinquish the legal right to adequately prepare cases
for trial," he wrote. Cooley's office also appealed Wesley's actions.</TE>
<TE>   Oki responded with his own letter to Cooley, saying judges will
continue denying his prosecutors' motions for postponements if they
refuse to give a satisfactory reason.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office is awaiting the outcome of the
appeal on Wesley's decision before refiling charges against Lincoln,
who was released from jail after last month's dismissal, Allen said.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County Supervisor Kathy Long is proposing to designate the

Highway."</LD>
<LD>   A portion of the highway, from Fillmore to the Golden State
Freeway, already carries the designation. But a war veterans' group
wants to extend the recognition west to the highway's intersection
with the Ventura Freeway in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   Long agreed, but supervisors must unanimously back the proposal
before it can go back before the Legislature for approval. Long said
the highway would still officially be called the Santa Paula-Fillmore

<HD>It's Boss vs. Employee in Fiery D.A.'s Race</HD>
<DH>Wally Wade wins accolades for ethics and judgment. Foes
question his leadership abilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He has the name of a character straight out of Boys' Life magazine,
and friends of Wally Wade say the Orange County district attorney
candidate is as squeaky-clean as those profiled in that Boy Scout
periodical.</LD>
<LD>   They describe the 55-year-old San Juan Capistrano resident as a
Jesuit-schooled "prosecutor's prosecutor," whose resourcefulness once
saved the life of a colleague who plunged through the surface of a
frozen lake. Wade's campaign, they say, is a bid to "restore
integrity" to an office that has been roiled by charges of political
favoritism and divisive management.</LD>
<LD>   "Wally Wade has a good sense of right and wrong," said political
activist Shirley Grindle, as she voiced Wade's main campaign theme.
"He doesn't allow friendship to sway him and he's apolitical. His
attitude is, 'Justice is justice and this is how it's going to be.'"</LD>
<TE>   But as Wade seeks to unseat Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas, his boss,
in the March 5 election, critics say the deputy D.A. is not the white
knight his supporters paint him to be.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents charge that Wade has sought to obscure his record as a
former longtime assistant district attorney, saying that under Wade's
supervision, the county's Family Services Division failed repeatedly
to meet federal efficiency standards and was ranked among the state's
worst.</TE>
<TE>   According to division data, the unit complied with state and
federal guidelines about half the time and, in the final year of
Wade's stewardship, it collected little more than half of the $176
million that courts had ordered for child support.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also say that Wade has waffled on the issue of plea
bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   These starkly contrasting portraits of Wade are emblematic of a
race that has shaped up to be one of the nastiest grudge matches in
the history of the D.A.'s office.</TE>
<TE>   Wade's election loss to Rackauckas four years ago has only
heightened the bitterness. Rackauckas, who had left a Superior Court
judgeship to run for office, raised substantially more campaign money
than Wade and had sewn up key endorsements before Wade even announced
his candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost because I was stupid," Wade said of his 1998 bid. "This is
a completely different race though. This time, Tony Rackauckas has a
record and it's not a good one."</TE>
<TE>   Wade points to Rackauckas' handling of a consumer-protection case
involving billionaire businessman and now ambassador to Spain, George
Argyros.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas ordered prosecutors to withdraw a lawsuit against
Argyros' apartment company, which was accused of illegally keeping
the security deposits of thousands of renters. Critics said it was
unseemly, because the apartment company had donated $1,000 to
Rackauckas' D.A. election campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Wade also says Rackauckas has sown division in his staff by
passing over experienced prosecutors for promotion in favor of less
experienced ones who support the incumbent. Because of this, Wade
says, experienced staffers have left the office. . Rackauckas denies
he's biased, insisting that the promotions were based on merit.</TE>
<TE>   Wade, who is married to a nurse and has two adult daughters,
credits his parents and his education in Catholic schools for his
sense of justice and fair play--qualities he says are lacking in his
opponent. At one point, Wade flirted with the idea of entering the
priesthood, but settled for church lector.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Wade says, he would institute a merit system of
promoting staffers with extended experience to supervisory jobs. He
says he also plans to "bulk up" staffing in the fraud unit and devote
more resources to prosecution of elder abuse, child abuse and
domestic abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Children, the elderly and domestic violence victims, they don't
have lobbies," Wade said. "I think we need to do more to protect
these people."</TE>
<TE>   Wade says he would increase training for prosecutors on plea
bargains and encourage his staffers to participate in outreach, such
as lecturing students or speaking to civic groups.</TE>
<TE>   Wade, who earned his undergraduate and law degrees at Loyola
University, began working in the district attorney's office in 1980,
after briefly pursuing work in journalism and teaching.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal law--prosecutorial work, specifically--appealed to his
sense of public service and personal accomplishment, he says. "When
you're teaching, you don't know how your kids are going to turn out
until 20 years later."</TE>
<TE>   In law, however, Wade saw a "scoreboard" by which to measure his
performance. Being a prosecutor was even more appealing, he says,
because he was secure in the knowledge that he was doing the "right
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after joining the D.A.'s office, Wade was tapped to handle
some of the office's most delicate cases: political corruption
investigations and grand jury presentations. Maurice Evans, formerly
an assistant D.A. and supervisor of Wade's, said he was impressed by
Wade's seriousness and demeanor in the Special Assignments division.
While many young deputy district attorneys quailed before judges or
superiors, Wade showed confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a maturity that a lot of new prosecutors don't have,"
Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Evans says Wade's presence of mind saved his life 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The two were fishing with co-workers on a frozen lake in the High
Sierra, when they saw a small boy fall through the ice. Evans
scrambled to grab the boy, but tumbled into the frigid water.</TE>
<TE>   While Evans managed to heave the boy to safety, his own
predicament grew serious. Weighed down by boots and soaked woolen
clothing, Evans broke the ice whenever he tried to pull himself up.
"Then, when I was getting very scared, I saw somebody's hand reach
over the ice and I grabbed it," he said. "It was Wally."</TE>
<TE>   Wade had ordered members of the fishing party to lie flat on the
ice, one behind the other, each holding the ankles of the man in
front of him, forming a human ladder. By distributing their weight
evenly over the ice, the men were able pull Evans to safety without
breaking through.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Wade explained that he'd learned the technique as a
Scout.</TE>
<TE>   While Wade's campaign literature does not mention the rescue, it
does boast that the candidate won all nine homicide cases he has
handled and has prosecuted dozens of other types of cases, including
drunk driving, kidnapping, rape, drug smuggling, bookmaking and home
invasion robbery. Former Dist. Atty. Michael Capizzi said Wade
acquitted himself well in each.</TE>
<TE>   "Wally's very thorough; he doesn't do anything rash or
impulsively," Capizzi said. "He exercises excellent judgment."</TE>
<TE>   Rescues and campaign statements aside, Wade's opponents insist
that his performance as a supervisor shows that he's not cut out to
be a district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas describes Wade's supervision of the Family Services
Division as a prime failure. In the roughly six years that Wade
supervised the division, and immediately before Rackauckas' election
victory, Family Services routinely flunked federal administrative
compliance standards and ranked at the bottom among counties
statewide, according to department reports.</TE>
<TE>   "When Wally was in charge, the office was neglected and starved
for resources," said Michael Schroeder, the former state Republican
Party leader who is running Rackauckas' campaign. Upon taking office,
Rackauckas says, he expanded the division's staff and collections
increased 60%.</TE>
<TE>   Wade concedes that staffing remained low during his tenure in
Family Services but says that was the responsibility of then-D.A.
Capizzi, who held the purse strings.</TE>
<TE>   Wade says he took steps to improve services to families, and
insists that Rackauckas has benefited from them as well. Among other
things, Wade says, he hired an outside consultant to examine ways of
improving efficiency at Family Services. The office also created an
ombudsman position, increased automation and grouped employees into
more efficient teams, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mind giving Tony Rackauckas credit for having the good
judgment to increase staff, but he's also taking credit for changes
made before he arrived," Wade said.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas campaign leaders have also faulted Wade for what they
say is his involvement in the prosecution of Republican former
Assemblyman Scott Baugh, for suspected voter fraud. Critics charge
that the case was a matter best left to the state's Fair Political
Practices Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Wade, however, says he had nothing to do with the case, that he
was concentrating on prosecuting figures in the county's bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Wade no longer supervises a division in the D.A.'s office; he
handles welfare fraud and major fraud cases.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have also faulted Wade for his apparent wavering on the
issue of plea bargaining. In his 1998 candidate's statement, Wade
wrote: "I insist on no plea bargaining with criminals. Criminals
should be prosecuted, not pampered."</TE>
<TE>   In this race, however, Wade has said plea bargaining is sometimes
necessary to ensure appropriate punishment and that prosectors should
be trained on bargaining guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Wade vaguely recalled his stance on the matter in the previous
election and registered surprise when shown a copy of his statement.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I say that? I guess I did," Wade said. "Anti-plea bargain is
what every district attorney would like to be, but in reality it
happens. In the world we live in, that's the way it has to be,
because it's a human system."</TE>

<HD>Big Lotto Winners Angling to Retire</HD>
<DH>Jackpot: Orange County couple were on a fishing trip when
they realized they'd won millions. They'll work only a little longer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Rose Briscoe says she usually buys five Lotto tickets, sometimes
seven, her lucky number. But on Valentine's Day, the Tustin resident
bought 10, and it was that 10th bet that held a winning combination
for the largest jackpot in California history.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just fate," Briscoe, 45, said at a news conference Saturday
in Santa Ana, where state lottery officials introduced her and her
husband, Paul, 49.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County couple held one of three winning tickets for the
Feb. 16 SuperLotto Plus jackpot and will share the $193-million
prize. A Northern California man was the first to claim his portion.
A third winner, who bought a ticket in Montebello, had not yet
stepped forward.</LD>
<TE>   The Briscoes, dressed casually and accompanied by friends and
family, were smiling Saturday morning as they clutched a mock check
for $64.3 million, their portion if they had chosen to be paid in 26
annual installments. Instead, they opted for the lump-sum cash
payment, which means they will receive nearly $33 million before
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   But there were no immediate visions of mansions and fancy cars for
the new millionaires, who said they plan to ease into their new
lives. "We are just modest people," Rose Briscoe said.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, striking a more serious note during the jolly press
conference, said, "You've still got to keep life in perspective. You
can't change the way you live your life and the way you treat other
people.... You have to be the same person you were before you won the
lottery."</TE>
<TE>   But some things inevitably will change. The couple, who have an
adult daughter from Paul's previous marriage, said they will quit
their jobs soon. Both work for Los Angeles County as administrators.
They have continued to work, the couple said, and will help their
departments find their replacements.</TE>
<TE>   Then they will embark on a "premature retirement," Paul Briscoe
said, and pursue their interests: travel and fishing.</TE>
<TE>   The anglers got engaged on Valentine's Day nine years ago in Pismo
Beach, and every year they celebrate with a fishing trip to the same
spot.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, as the lottery jackpot swelled to a record, the
couple were preparing for their annual sojourn.</TE>
<TE>   On Valentine's Day, Rose walked into a 7-Eleven in Orange. "I love
their hot chocolate," she said. She also bought 10 lottery tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, her husband, whose past luck includes some meager
lottery winnings and a $12,500 video poker jackpot in Las Vegas three
years ago, bought five more tickets at another store.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, they left for Pismo Beach, where Paul bought 10 more
tickets, not knowing, he said, "we already had the winning ticket."</TE>
<TE>   Searching Their Tickets for Winning Numbers</TE>
<TE>   Saturday evening, the two settled in their hotel room to watch the
Winter Olympics. During the broadcast, the station flashed the
winning Lotto numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Paul pulled out his 15 tickets and quickly saw he hadn't won. Rose
checked her stub with the 10 sets of numbers and spotted the winning
Mega Number, 20, in the last row. The numbers looked instantly
familiar, she said, but she couldn't remember one of the winning
set."What was the third number?" she asked her husband. "What was the
third number?"</TE>
<TE>   It was 31.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just in shock," Paul Briscoe said. "We slept three hours
that night. Your adrenaline just runs."</TE>
<TE>   The next day they went to a local store and rechecked the numbers.
They also bought some Scratchers to avoid drawing attention to
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Paul placed the winning ticket in a plastic pouch that had held
his fishing license, and they returned home on Presidents Day.</TE>
<TE>   They waited to alert lottery officials. During Saturday's news
conference, the couple were often cautious, declining to detail their
investment or charitable plans.</TE>
<TE>   Rose recalled seeing television news shows last week that focused
on the 7-Eleven in Orange and speculated about the winner.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very strange watching news reports that you are directly
involved in," she said. "It's kind of unsettling, actually.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an unfathomable amount of money."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>40 Is Just a Number to Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The Angels opened for business in 1961, and no one--not Reggie
Jackson, not Don Baylor, not Bobby Bonds, not Tim Salmon--had hit 40
home runs in a season.</LD>
<LD>   Until Troy Glaus. In 2000, in his second full season in the major
leagues, Glaus hit 47. Last season, he hit 41.</LD>
<LD>   It's not supposed to be that easy. He's 25, an age at which
hitters are far from polished. And, the Angels insist, Glaus is far
from polished.</LD>
<TE>   "When he realizes there's another part of the field out there,
he's going to get better," batting coach Mickey Hatcher said. "He
works on those things hard.</TE>
<TE>   "You haven't seen what this kid is capable of doing. Right now,
he's a swinger. I really believe this kid can hit for average and be
a power hitter."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus, blessed with the ability to let a bad pitch go and drive a
good pitch a long way, still succumbs to the temptation of trying to
pull pitches he would be better off volleying into the opposite
field. In each of the last two seasons, the third baseman has ranked
among the American League top 10 in home runs, walks and strikeouts.
The Angels believe he can raise his batting average close to .300 and
drive in 130 to 140 runs--he hit .250 and drove in 108 last
year--without sacrificing power.</TE>
<TE>   He switched on the power early this year, beating Barry Bonds, Jim
Thome and Luis Gonzalez in successive rounds to win the Home Run
Challenge in Las Vegas two weeks ago. Yet Glaus says he is not
shooting for 50 home runs, or any other number, this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't put goals on myself. The only goal I have is to try to
get better every year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather hit 25 home runs and win the World Series than hit 40
and not win."</TE>
<TE>   Been there, done that--Glaus hit 40-plus in each of the last two
seasons, and the Angels did not win. But his teammates nonetheless
watch in awe when he erupts on one of his home run streaks--four
homers in seven games last June, four in six games in July, four in
seven games in August.</TE>
<TE>   "You get jealous watching that," center fielder Darin Erstad said.
"I'm glad he's on our team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When General Manager Bill Stoneman suggested the Angels sign
Dennis Cook as a left-handed reliever, Manager Mike Scioscia endorsed
the move. Scioscia knows all too well how tough Cook can be on
left-handed hitters.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, 39, held left-handers to a .215 average last season. He's
been playing so long that he faced Scioscia five times when the Angel
manager was the Dodger catcher. Scioscia walked once, but he never
got a hit off Cook.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia insists that his lack of success against Cook was not the
determining factor in the Angels signing him.</TE>
<TE>   "If we did that, we'd have a heck of a lot of pitchers in camp,
with the way I hit," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   In his 13-year career, Scioscia batted .259 overall and .235
against left-handers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the thought that a team built around pitching ought to field
a defensively gifted shortstop, the Angels have considered signing
free-agent shortstop Rey Sanchez. If the Angels add Sanchez, David
Eckstein and Adam Kennedy could compete for the second-base job.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, 34, has been unable to find a job after splitting last
season between the Kansas City Royals, for whom he hit .303, and the
Atlanta Braves, for whom he hit .227.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The post-Sept. 11 visa crackdown revealed another Angel is not as
young as his birth certificate claimed: Outfielder Elpidio Guzman
turns 25 today, not 23. Guzman, a prospect from the Dominican
Republic included on the Angels' 40-man roster, hit .244 with seven
home runs at double-A Arkansas last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels learned earlier this month that Dominican pitcher Ramon
Ortiz is 28, not 25. More than a dozen Latin players have aged
instantly this spring, including Rafael Furcal of the Braves, Rey
Ordonez of the New York Mets and Bartolo Colon of the Cleveland
Indians.</TE>

<HD>Padres' Harrington Is Sharp</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Right-hander Matt Harrington was impressive in his first public
workout since last summer, throwing three perfect innings Saturday
against participants in an open tryout in the San Diego Padres' minor
league camp at Peoria, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   Harrington, the Padres' second-round draft pick last June and a
first-round pick by Colorado in 2000 from Palmdale High, consistently
reached 91 mph with his fastball. He's coming off shoulder soreness
that forced him to stop pitching last summer for the independent St.
Paul Saints.</LD>
<LD>   Harrington turned down a reported $4-million bonus offer from the
Rockies. The Padres have yet to make a contract offer, other than the
$850 tendering offer necessary to retain his rights.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Indians signed left-hander C.C. Sabathia to a
$9.5-million, four-year contract that contains a club option for a
fifth year and could be worth up to $19.75 million over five years.</TE>
<TE>   Sabathia was 17-5 with a 4.39 earned-run average last season and
finished second to Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki in the American League
rookie-of-the-year voting.</TE>
<TE>   He tied for sixth in the league in victories, held opponents to a
.228 batting average and struck out 171.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop Jimmy Rollins, an All-Star and the National League
stolen base champion as a rookie in 2001 with 46, and the
Philadelphia Phillies agreed to a $365,000, one-year
contract....Left-hander Joe Kennedy, third among AL rookies with a
4.44 ERA last season, signed a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays....Former Toronto Blue Jay manager Cito Gaston was hired
as a special assistant to team President and Chief Executive Paul
Godfrey. The team offered Gaston the position when he was dismissed
as hitting coach at the end of last season....Ken Griffey Sr.
reported to the Cincinnati Reds' training camp at Sarasota, Fla., to
start scouting for the team, one day after he resigned as first-base
coach. Griffey, 51, declined to talk to reporters after leaving a
meeting with Red General Manager Jim Bowden, but later said on his
show on WCIN-AM in Cincinnati that he "was tired of being treated
like dirt." He claimed that members of the front office knew he was
unhappy with how things were going, but didn't go into specifics....
Former Dodger outfielder Trenidad Hubbard agreed to a minor league
contract with the Padres.</TE>

<KH>BIG WEST ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Green Scores 29 in Finale at Irvine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Green made his final home game a memorable one as UC Irvine
squeaked by UC Santa Barbara, 71-67, before 4,664 Saturday at Bren
Events Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Anteaters' all-time leading scorer tallied 29 points, giving
him 1,916 in a four-year career that includes 112 consecutive starts.
Already the school's leader in steals (159), free throws made (514)
and field-goals attempted (1,371), Green's eight field goals Saturday
moved him into the top spot in that category with 645.</LD>
<LD>   Green also moved into seventh place on the Big West Conference's
all-time scoring list. Moreover, his performance helped Irvine (20-8,
13-4) reach the 20-victory mark for only the fourth time in the
school's 37-year history. Last season's conference player of the year
led the Anteaters to a 25-5 record in 2000-01, the best in school
history.</LD>
<TE>   With the win, Irvine solidifies its hold on second place in the
Big West standings, one-half game behind Utah State heading into
Thursday's season finale at Long Beach State. The Anteaters led by
nine points with four minutes to play, but the Gauchos responded with
a 13-3 run to claim the lead with 45 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Green's leaning 10-footer gave Irvine back the lead. Santa
Barbara's Mark Hull missed a three-point attempt and Green grabbed
the rebound and was fouled. Green made both free throws with 16
seconds to play to give Irvine a 70-67 advantage. The Gauchos (15-10,
9-7) had a chance to tie the score, but J.R. Christ drew a charging
foul to give the ball back to the Anteaters.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve Mike Hood scored 13 points and Jordan Harris added eight
points and five rebounds for Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Branduinn Fullove scored a team-high 19 points and Adama Ndiaye
finished with 11 points for Santa Barbara, which kept the score close
by making all 18 of their free throws.Tim Dermody</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State 83, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 80--Chris Jenkins'
three-point basket with 47 seconds remaining in overtime at Long
Beach proved decisive for the 49ers (12-16, 8-9). Kevin Roberts'
driving layup with 15 seconds left accounted for the final points.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Reed scored 25 points and senior guard Ron Johnson tied a
career-high with 23 points to lead Long Beach State to its fourth
consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers trailed by seven points with 1:30 left but managed to
tie the score at 75-75 on Johnson's three-point basket with 25.7
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson missed a three-point shot with one second left in
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Geary's three-point attempt at the overtime buzzer bounced
off the rim as Cal Poly SLO (14-10, 8-8) lost its third in a row.
Geary had five three-point baskets and 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge 73, Cal State Fullerton 59--Jermar Welch
scored 17 points for the Matadors (10-15, 9-7) at Fullerton.
Northridge has won two in a row after losing five in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Matadors' Markus Carr, the conference's third-leading scorer
(16.5 points) and leader in assists (5.2) and steals (2.8), had only
eight points and three assists in 37 minutes. Carr had a wart removed
from his right foot on Feb. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Dillon scored a season-high 19 points for Fullerton (4-21,
1-15). The Titans, who have lost nine consecutive games and 16 of
their last 17, failed to score for 9:43 after tying the score at
43-43.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific 87, Riverside 75--Forward Mike Hahn made 10 of 11 shots
and had 25 points for the Tigers (17-9, 9-7) at Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific made nine of its first 10 shots and took a 30-16 lead. The
Tigers shot 68.2% in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   John Galbreath scored 16 points for Riverside (8-16, 5-11).</TE>

<LD>   California (7-19, 2-15) at USC (14-12, 10-7), 1, Fox Sports Net,
KMPC (1540)--A victory would help the Trojans secure fourth place in
the conference, which would be their best Pacific 10 finish since
1997. USC has not swept the season series against Cal since the
1997-98 season, but is 15-3 all-time against the Bears at home.</LD>
<LD>   No. 2 Stanford (27-1, 17-0) at UCLA (8-18, 4-13) 2, KXTA (1150),
KACD (850), KEWS (1350)--Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer has made it a
goal for the Cardinal to finish the Pac-10 regular season undefeated,
so few Cardinal reserves will play. All of UCLA's conference
victories have come against Washington State and California.</LD>

<HD>Bonds Drive Himself? That's a Stretch</HD>

<LD>When Barry Bonds reported to camp in a chauffeured stretch limo,
Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle was suitably impressed,
noting that the car "stretches more than Barry does."</LD>
<LD>   Ostler continued: "But it's good to see him putting his new money
to use. With the energy Bonds saves by not driving himself to work,
the man might hit 83 homers.</LD>
<LD>   "Barry also brought his doggie to camp, a Yorkshire terrier named
Clyde. It's a cute pooch, but not the kind of pet you'd expect to see
with a fearsome slugger. Clyde looks more like a figure skater's dog.</LD>
<TE>   "But don't be fooled, the rumor is that Clyde is trained to snarl
at reporters, which will further ease Barry's workload."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another dog tale: There are those who will recall why former
Virginia basketball coach Terry Holland named his dog Dean.</TE>
<TE>   For those who don't, Holland said he named the mutt after former
North Carolina coach Dean Smith because "it whines so much."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Where does David Duval keep the silver claret jug he
received last year for winning the British Open at Royal Lytham &amp; St.
Annes?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A bad bounce: Michael McCrary's unfortunate encounter with
bouncers in a nightclub earlier this month left the Baltimore Sun's
Mike Preston siding with the Raven player.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the bouncer types, big stiffs who couldn't play high
school sports," Preston wrote. "Then one day they discover weights,
then steroids and creatine. They wear their little brothers' T-shirts
to make themselves look bigger. To build self-esteem, they beat up
little guys."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Is it real or is it ... ? When a jersey Pele supposedly had worn
while winning the 1970 World Cup came up for auction in England
recently, soccer reporters in Brazil questioned whether it was the
real thing.</TE>
<TE>   English reporters might ask the same question now that an
exhibition of what might be called Pele-iana has opened at Sao
Paulo's Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   The displays include what are said to be the shoeshine box Pele
worked at as a kid more than half a century ago and his first soccer
ball--a stocking filled with newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A losing proposition: The fact that the American racehorse Zippy
Chippy recently lost his 92nd consecutive race was noted with some
alarm in England.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because the hapless thoroughbred is rapidly closing in on
Quixall Crossett, an English horse with a 103-race streak of
futility.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A fighting chance: Honest, there really is such a thing as the
National Women's Football League, and now one of its teams has an
owner whose name will ring a bell: world light heavyweight champion
Roy Jones Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Jones opened his wallet and bought his hometown NWFL team, the
Pensacola Power, when financial woes had the Florida outfit on the
ropes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: On the counter in the golf shop at Pablo Creek, his
home course in Jacksonville, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: From Bud Geracie in the San Jose Mercury News:
"Instead of expanding to 40 teams, the National Invitation Tournament
should be looking to reduce the field to, like, zero."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With two defenders all over him and the clock ticking down, Earnest
Shelton jumped into the air to take what would have been a tough
shot.</LD>
<LD>   Then, he saw teammate Antoine Pettway alone under the basket.</LD>
<LD>   Shelton fired a pass to Pettway, who laid it off the glass just as
the buzzer sounded to give No. 5 Alabama a 65-64 victory over No. 8
Florida on Saturday at Tuscaloosa, Ala., and at least a share of its
first Southeastern Conference regular-season championship in 15
years.</LD>
<TE>   "I looked up at the clock and it said zero-zero," Pettway said.
"It was time to go home."</TE>
<TE>   Well, not quite.</TE>
<TE>   As fans chanted "SEC! SEC!" and a horde of students stormed the
court, Pettway and two teammates leaped on the scorer's table, with
the reserve guard hollering "We're No. 1." Some other students soon
paraded onto the court with a banner proclaiming Alabama "2002 SEC
Champions."</TE>
<TE>   The Crimson Tide--23-5 overall, 11-3 in conference and a winner of
18 consecutive home games-- trailed by as many as 13 points midway
through the second half before rallying to set up the frantic finish.</TE>
<TE>   Erwin Dudley's free throws with 53 seconds left gave Alabama a
63-62 lead, its first of the half. Orien Greene of Florida (20-6,
9-5) answered with a jumper 13 seconds later.</TE>
<TE>   The Gators' James White missed the front end of a one-and-one with
16 seconds left after teammate Matt Bonner had stripped Kenny Walker
of the ball. Maurice Williams rebounded White's miss and dribbled up
the court, passing to Shelton. The freshman appeared trapped in the
corner by two Gators with about three seconds left, but managed to
get the ball to the wide-open Pettway.</TE>
<TE>   "I went up to take the shot but Pettway was so wide open and he
knocked it down," Shelton said. "I don't know how he got so wide
open."</TE>
<TE>   Bonner, who had 18 points and nine rebounds, said he came within
"two or three inches" of deflecting Shelton's final pass.</TE>
<TE>   "We loaded the ball and they went to Shelton and we trapped him on
the sidelines," Florida Coach Billy Donovan said. "If we take away
that last cut [from Pettway], they're probably going to throw up a
prayer. We had a breakdown for one second, and that one second cost
us."</TE>
<TE>   The Crimson Tide also clinched its last SEC regular-season
championship in a thrilling fashion against the Gators. In 1987, when
Coach Mark Gottfried was a senior guard, Alabama won the title with
an 86-85 overtime victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody asked me if I was thinking about 1987," Gottfried said.
"I was thinking about Earnest Shelton passing the ball, that's all I
was thinking about. I'm just glad to be back here and be part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Gottfried became the third person to win an SEC championship as
both a player and a coach, joining C.M. Newton (Alabama and Kentucky)
and Joe B. Hall (Kentucky).</TE>
<TE>   The win over Florida also gives Alabama a chance to finish with
its highest ranking since 1956, when it was No. 5 after going
undefeated in the SEC at 14-0.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great thing, but we've still got other things we want to
accomplish," said Dudley, who had 14 points and nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama has two games remaining before the SEC tournament in
Atlanta, but is assured of its first NCAA tournament berth since
1995.</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 Oklahoma 96, Texas 78-- Ebi Ere scored 21 of his 23 points
in the second half, and Aaron McGhee had 20 points and 10 rebounds at
Norman, Okla., as the Sooners (22-4, 11-3) locked up the second
seeding for the Big 12 tournament. Oklahoma had a season-high 12
three-point baskets in winning its 21st home game in a row and
defeating Texas (17-10, 8-6) for the seventh consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 Kentucky 71, Arkansas 58--Tayshaun Prince had 16 points to
lead five scorers in double figures for the Wildcats (19-7, 9-5 in
the Southeastern Conference) at Lexington, Ky. Kentucky has won
fourth of its last five games and Arkansas (13-13, 5-9) has lost five
of seven.</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 Oklahoma State 77, Baylor 64--Ivan McFarlin had 20 points
and 14 rebounds, and Victor Williams scored 18 points at Stillwater,
Okla., as the Cowboys (22-6, 9-5 in the Big 12) won their fourth in a
row. Lawrence Roberts had 22 points and 15 rebounds for Baylor
(14-13, 4-10). The Bears have lost 16 in a row on the road.</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 Illinois 56, Northwestern 41--At Evanston, Ill., the Illini
(21-7, 9-5 in the Big Ten) won its sixth in a row, holding the
Wildcats (16-10, 7-7) to season lows in scoring and shooting
percentage (29% from the field). Northwestern missed all 17 of its
three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame 90, No. 17 Miami 77--Freshman Chris Thomas matched his
career high with 32 points and had 12 assists at Miami as the
Fighting Irish (19-8, 9-5 in the Big East) ended a losing streak at
three to the Hurricanes (21-6, 8-6). Thomas, also 10 for 10 from the
foul line, made four free throws over the final 1:16 to seal the
victory. Miami's Darius Rice scored 20 of his 23 points in the second
half, including six three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 Georgia 55, Louisiana State 54--Rashad Wright's jumper from
just inside the three-point line with 22 seconds to play at Baton
Rouge, La., was decisive for the Bulldogs (20-7, 9-5 ) in the
victory. Louisiana State (14-13, 4-10) didn't get much out of its
last chances at winning the game as Ronald Dupree shot an airball and
then lost the ball out of bounds with 3.9 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Ohio State 77, Purdue 66--Brian Brown scored 18 points at
Columbus, Ohio, to pull the Buckeyes (19-6, 10-4) within a half-game
of Big Ten-leading Indiana. Purdue (12-17, 4-11) has the most losses
in Gene Keady's 22 seasons at the school and went winless in Big Ten
road games (0-8) for the first time since 1966. The Boilermakers'
Willie Deane, the Big Ten's leading scorer at 17.6 points, had only
12.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech 82, No. 22 Virginia 80--Marvin Lewis made a
three-point shot from the top of the key with one second to play for
the Yellow Jackets (13-15, 5-9 in the Atlantic Coast Conference) at
Charlottesville, Va. Tony Akins had 23 points for Georgia Tech and
Lewis had 15, all on three-point baskets. Virginia (16-9, 6-8) missed
four consecutive free throws in the last minute in blowing a
six-point lead and losing for the seventh time in nine games.</TE>
<TE>   No. 24 Western Kentucky 65, Middle Tennessee 61--Chris Marcus
scored 27 points and had 11 rebounds as the Hilltoppers (25-3, 13-1
in the Sun Belt) won their 15th consecutive game overall and 23rd in
a row at Diddle Arena in Bowling Green, Ky. John Humphrey made eight
of 12 three-point shots and had 26 points for Middle Tennessee
(13-14, 6-8).</TE>

Virginia (8-18, 1-13) at Storrs, Conn ....Andrew Bryant had five

<HD>Clippers Lose Pace</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Gentry is unhappy about team's lack of
effort during 106-88 loss to Indiana.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Clippers didn't need to be flawless to win Saturday. No one
expected perfection from them against the Indiana Pacers--a team they
battered by 31 points Dec. 2 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   But the Clippers committed an unpardonable sin in the eyes of
Coach Alvin Gentry when they failed to put forth the effort required
to defeat an opponent on its home court.</LD>
<LD>   "I wish I knew the reason why," Gentry said after the Clippers
lost to the Pacers, 106-88, in front of a sellout crowd of 18,345 at
Conseco Fieldhouse. "We have to play with much more energy than we
did tonight. We didn't play hard and come up with the loose balls. We
didn't compete the way we usually do.</LD>
<TE>   "I was very disappointed. They played and competed harder. I don't
care who we have out there; we gave up way too many easy baskets.
It's tough to win on the road even when you play well. And we didn't
play well."</TE>
<TE>   That was true of a majority of the Clippers, but there were two
exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Power forward Elton Brand scored 23 points, took 21 rebounds to
match his career high and hit the floor several times in an attempt
to secure loose balls. Point guard Jeff McInnis also scored 23
points.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, the Clippers appeared resigned to absorbing a beating
from the Pacers, falling behind by 22 points in the second quarter.
The Clippers rallied in the fourth quarter, cutting the deficit to a
mere 89-83 on Tremaine Fowlkes' tip-in of Quentin Richardson's miss.</TE>
<TE>   Fowlkes, signed to a 10-day contract Saturday, capped an 11-0 run
and gave the Clippers a fighting chance at completing an improbable
rally. After all, there was 7:47 still to be played.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Jermaine O'Neal made a hook shot and Reggie Miller scored
on a jump shot for two of his 28 points and the Pacers' regained
their lost momentum. Soon enough, they stormed away with a 14-0 run
that sealed the Clippers' ninth consecutive loss at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   In the final analysis, the game wasn't won or lost in the fourth
quarter. It was determined by the Pacers' 21-7 run before halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers trailed, 39-35, after Brand's driving layup and a
free throw after he was fouled with 4:10 remaining in the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the Clippers couldn't score and couldn't defend and the
game was a laugher after Indiana went on a 17-0 run in roughly three
minutes. Indiana led, 60-42, at the half.</TE>
<TE>   "In that second quarter, when they turned up their defensive
pressure, we folded," McInnis said. "I know I came out pumped up for
this game. I thought everyone else would be, too.</TE>
<TE>   "We cut it to six, but we couldn't do anything after that. It's a
big disappointing loss."</TE>
<TE>   There's no question the Clippers aren't the same team without
Lamar Odom, who has a sprained wrist and ankle, and Corey Maggette
(dislocated fourth and fifth fingers on his right hand).</TE>
<TE>   And anyone who watched Darius Miles realized his sprained right
shoulder and muscle spasms on his right side were the reasons he was
rendered earthbound Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, Quentin Richardson, who suffered a strained right hamstring
in the Clippers' loss Thursday to the Orlando Magic, didn't seem to
be moving at anything resembling top speed.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry refused to make excuses, however.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing we can't start doing is feeling sorry for
ourselves," he said when asked about the string of injuries that have
threatened to derail the Clippers' charge toward a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   "That's inexcusable. As long as we play hard and complete, we can
have a chance to win on most nights."</TE>
<TE>   Brand agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It just comes down to the fact that we didn't play well at all,"
he said. "We can't make excuses. We put a talented enough [starting]
five out there and we should be able to do something."</TE>
<TE>   Brand would not use the stretched tendon in his right ring finger
as an excuse. He said it continues to trouble him. Frustrated after
shooting a first-quarter airball, he ripped off the protective tape
on his finger and began to make shots and take rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Neither he nor McInnis could make enough shots or enough plays to
bail out their teammates, however, and the Clippers lost their second
in three games to start this five-game trip.</TE>

<HD>It's a Day of Firsts for Fowlkes</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Tremaine Fowlkes made his first NBA basket on his first shot in his
first game Saturday, a third-quarter put-back of a miss by Clipper
teammate Quentin Richardson.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers signed Fowlkes, who had been playing for the Columbus
(Ga.) Riverdragons of the National Basketball Development League, to
a 10-day contract Saturday. The Clippers desperately need help at
small forward because Corey Maggette has two dislocated fingers on
his right hand and Lamar Odom continues to be sidelined by a sprained
right wrist and ankle.</LD>
<LD>   It has been a long, strange trip for Fowlkes, but he finally got
into an NBA game, almost four years after the Denver Nuggets took him
on the second round of the 1998 draft.</LD>
<TE>   Fowlkes was a standout at Crenshaw High, the Pacific 10 freshman
of the year at California and a standout scorer and rebounder after
transferring to Fresno State. But it was quite a journey before he
reached the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Fowlkes has played with Yakima of the now-defunct Continental
Basketball Assn. and Cincinnati of the International Basketball
League. He has also played in Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever there's a first time for anything, you have a little
jitters," Fowlkes said. "But this team makes you feel comfortable and
the coaching staff helped a lot. It was an easy adjustment."</TE>
<TE>   By game's end, Fowlkes had seven points and six rebounds in 17
minutes in a reserve role. He earned praise from Coach Alvin Gentry
after the Clippers' 106-88 loss to the Indiana Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   "He's only been with us for 12 hours and I was happy with what he
did tonight," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clipper game March 26 against the Kings at Sacramento has been
added to TBS' schedule and their April 4 game against the Mavericks
at Dallas has been picked up by TNT.</TE>

<HD>Gagne Wants to Give Them Another Option</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>In baseball business parlance, pitcher Eric Gagne is out of options,
which means he would have to clear waivers before the Dodgers can
send him to the minor leagues. This is not necessarily bad for Gagne.</LD>
<LD>   It essentially forces the Dodgers, who have an abundance of
rotation and bullpen candidates, to keep Gagne in the big leagues or
risk losing the promising young right-hander to a team that claims
him off waivers.</LD>
<LD>   But the fact he is virtually assured a big league job, if not in
Los Angeles then elsewhere, is of no comfort to Gagne, who had a 6-7
record and 4.75 earned-run average in 33 games--24 of them
starts--for the Dodgers last season.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to be here, that's all I care about," Gagne, 26, said.
"I've been in this organization for six years, I have a lot of
friends here, it's like a big family. I hope they don't want to trade
me because I want to be here."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have had plenty of chances to deal Gagne. The Chicago
White Sox asked for Gagne in trade talks about reliever Bobby Howry
this winter, but the Dodgers, who have placed a greater emphasis on
bolstering the farm system and building from within under new General
Manager Dan Evans, turned them down.</TE>
<TE>   If Gagne doesn't edge out Omar Daal and Odalis Perez for the final
rotation spot, he will probably win a relief spot, because the
Dodgers know they'd lose him--and get nothing in return--if they
tried to pass him through waivers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to weigh our decisions based on short-term and long-term
plans," Evans said. "We're going to make decisions based on who the
best 11 or 12 pitchers are, but other things do factor in."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne does not want to win a big-league job by default, though. He
added some upper-body mass this winter, and it's apparent to many in
camp that he wants to earn his spot.</TE>
<TE>   "He's way ahead of everybody right now because he worked out all
winter and he's on a mission," pitching coach Jim Colborn said.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne compiled some impressive statistics last season. His
hits-to-innings-pitched ratio (144 to 1512/3) was good, and his
strikeout-to-walk ratio (130-46) was excellent. But he was
inconsistent, giving up five or more earned runs in seven starts and
failing to pitch five innings in six starts.</TE>
<TE>   "If he was on, he was really on, and if he was off, he was way
off," Colborn said. "He has to learn how to get through it when he's
not on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ace Kevin Brown, recovering from elbow surgery, threw 50 pitches
off a mound Saturday, a slight increase from his 40-pitch effort
Thursday. Brown said he "felt fine" afterward, but Colborn said the
right-hander "wasn't too pleased" with the workout.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he looked good," Colborn said. "For me, It's just what
I expect, knowing what his capabilities are and knowing where we are
in spring training."</TE>
<TE>   Kazuhisa Ishii threw off a bullpen mound for the third consecutive
day, and Colborn said the left-hander will throw again in the bullpen
today, a marked increase in workload from most Dodger starters, who
throw every other day. In fact, Colborn said Ishii will probably
throw six days a week.... The Dodgers, continuing contract
negotiations on a multiyear deal with reliever Matt Herges, made a
second two-year offer Saturday. They are also believed to have made
an initial multiyear offer to catcher Paul Lo Duca.... Hideo Nomo
will pitch in an intrasquad game Wednesday, and Gagne and Perez will
likely pitch in the Dodgers' Grapefruit League opener against Florida
on Thursday in Viera, Fla.</TE>

<LD>For those NHL players not going to the Olympics, last week was bonus
time.</LD>
<LD>   But Mighty Duck forwards Jeff Friesen and Matt Cullen weren't
working on their tans or relaxing on the couch during the Olympic
break. They had family matters to attend.</LD>
<LD>   Helmut Voelcker, Friesen's 82-year-old grandfather, got married
last Sunday. Helmut and Marie Voelcker held a ceremony before family
and friends in Edmonton.</LD>
<TE>   "This is really good for him," Friesen said. "It's hard to be
alone at that age."</TE>
<TE>   Ermgard Voelcker, Friesen's grandmother, died a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Helmut Voelcker immigrated to Canada after World War II. He was a
German paratrooper, but spent much of the war in a prisoner-of-war
camp.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't like to talk about that much," Friesen said. "He told
me he will write me a history so I can know all about it."</TE>
<TE>   Cullen returned to Minnesota, where he was able to watch his
brothers play hockey and his sister win her region in Minnesota high
school gymnastics.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck right wing Dan Bylsma worked out with the defensemen during
Saturday's practice.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to balance the sides for a scrimmage," Coach Bryan
Murray said. "I tell you what we learned. Dan won't be playing
defense."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, but Bylsma has tried everything except goalie this
season, even coach. He ran the Ducks' workout on Feb. 3, the day
after the All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oleg Tverdovsky (Russia) and Ruslan Salei (Belarus), who played in
Saturday's bronze-medal game at the Olympics, won't rejoin the team
until Monday at the earliest. Russia defeated Belarus, 7-2. ... Paul
Kariya, who plays for Canada against the United States in today's
gold-medal game, probably will not be back until Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Million Things on Longshots' Minds</HD>
<DH>Golf: Sutherland, McCarron reach final of match-play event,
where a seven-figure payday awaits today's winner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>There's nothing like a million dollars to capture the hearts and
minds of pro golfers, not to mention their attention. With a
$1-million paycheck going to the winner of today's 36-hole final of
the $5.5-million Accenture Match Play Championship, even the players
have to admit there is a lot on the line at La Costa Resort and Spa.</LD>
<LD>   The main events usually involve herbal wraps and mud baths around
here, but by the end of the day either Scott McCarron or Kevin
Sutherland is certain to feel delightfully refreshed, not to mention
quite a bit more wealthy. So it comes down to the No. 45-seeded
player (McCarron) and the No. 62-seeded player (Sutherland), and if
anyone says they saw that one coming, they're clairvoyant.</LD>
<LD>   Anyway, in this day of big-money tournaments, is a million dollars
still a lot? "What do you think?" McCarron joked. "Hey, for 36 holes,
I won't be thinking about the money ... at least I hope not."</LD>
<TE>   Dead even on the 18th green in Saturday's semifinal match with
Paul Azinger, what McCarron was thinking about was that his curling
39-foot putt was going to hit the bottom of the hole. He just hoped
the ball had enough speed, which it did, but just barely,
disappearing into the cup and ending its long journey to the hole.
Azinger, whose ball was in the deep rough off the back left of the
green, could only watch it drop. Azinger's only hope was to chip in
and he gave it a good swing, but he left his ball about 10 feet
short, and McCarron posted a 1-up victory.</TE>
<TE>   If McCarron's putt looked as though it was good all the way, Brad
Faxon's three-foot putt at the 18th had a much different destination
in mind. Faxon, who needed to make the putt to keep his match going
with Sutherland, pulled it just to the left. Sutherland had missed
the green with his second shot, chipped to 12 feet and pulled his
birdie putt, then watched Faxon putt for his birdie that would even
the match. Sutherland was already thinking about extra holes.</TE>
<TE>   "Brad doesn't miss putts like that at 18," Sutherland said. "I was
shocked. If he's not the best putter in the world, he's top two or
three. But strange things happen."</TE>
<TE>   Faxon did miss. So Sutherland got another chance and rolled in a
two-footer to finish off a 1-up victory and put himself in position
for his first PGA Tour victory.</TE>
<TE>   For Faxon, it was an ignoble end for one of the tour's premier
putters, to three-putt from 15 feet on the last hole. He was far from
happy. After he congratulated Sutherland, Faxon angrily tossed his
golf ball and it accidentally struck Sutherland in his left shoulder,
which was covered by a towel. Sutherland wasn't hurt, just tired, and
said he was ready for a nap. McCarron said he was ready to play right
away.</TE>
<TE>   It will be an all-Sacramento final between players who have known
each other and played against each other since their junior days. In
fact, in the 1982 Sac-Joaquin junior at Butte Creek near Chico,
Sutherland defeated McCarron in the final. "I tell you what, I don't
know if a lot of the people in the country are going to be watching,
but everyone in Sacramento is going to be watching," McCarron said.</TE>
<TE>   Sutherland says when he turned pro in 1996, McCarron sent him a
photo taken from that day. "It's amazing," Sutherland said of playing
McCarron. "If there was one person who would be better than that, it
would be my brother."</TE>
<TE>   Jose Maria Olazabal's exit in the morning round meant that no
international players were left. But at least he accomplished
something no one else had been able to do--force Faxon to play the
18th hole. Olazabal's five-foot birdie putt at the 18th squared the
match, but Faxon saved par with a four-foot putt on the 19th hole,
then won it when he made a 20-foot putt for birdie on the second
playoff hole, No. 11. Olazabal, who was 3-up after three, said there
wasn't much he could do to stop Faxon as the match wore on.</TE>
<TE>   "If you putt the way I did and you putt the way he did, then he
will win," Olazabal said. The losing quarterfinalists did not go away
empty-handed, not with a consolation prize of $342,000.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron won the last six holes--four of them with birdies--to
come from behind and beat Tom Lehman, 4 and 3. That should have given
him momentum in his semifinal against Azinger, but Azinger probably
had some of his own going, after closing out Bob Estes, 2 and 1, with
a birdie on the 17th hole. Estes had his chance at the end, with a
10-footer, which he missed. Azinger's ball was eight feet away.</TE>
<TE>   "I hit kind of a big, right-to-left [putt] with about a foot
break," Azinger said. "And it went in."</TE>
<TE>   As for Sutherland, the lowest-seeded player in the field, defeated
the sixth-seeded David Toms with ease, 3 and 2. Sutherland never
trailed and the match was even only once, after the first hole.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Sutherland thought he had a good chance against Faxon.
"I think I can win," he said. "Everyone I beat, it's a huge upset,
but I'm playing really well."</TE>
<TE>   No one can say Sutherland did not earn his way to the final. In
his first-round match against No. 3 David Duval, Sutherland was two
holes down at the 17th tee and went 20 holes to win. He also defeated
Paul McGinley, 14th-seeded Jim Furyk, Toms and then Faxon. "The
finals, my expectations were never near that, to be honest," he said.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron's path was equally bumpy. It actually began a week ago
when he bogeyed two of the last three holes at Riviera and lost to
Len Mattiace on the last day of the Nissan Open. McCarron started off
here by defeating Colin Montgomerie, then Mike Weir, then No. 4
Sergio Garcia, leading up to Saturday's victories over Lehman and
Azinger.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have loved to win last week, but this would be the best
revenge," McCarron said.</TE>
<TE>   The runner-up wins $550,000. Faxon and Azinger play an 18-hole
consolation match worth $450,000 to the winner and $360,000 to the
loser.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, tourists come to this
city with one of two frames of mind. Some feel an obligation to visit
ground zero, the site where the World Trade Center stood. Others feel
an aversion.</LD>
<LD>   In that regard, the Lakers are no different from any other group
of out-of-towners.</LD>
<LD>   For example, Coach Phil Jackson, who played for the New York
Knicks, was not planning on viewing the place where nearly 3,000
people lost their lives.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not an ambulance chaser," he said, "but I do understand
people's desire to go there."</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant was planning on visiting the site.</TE>
<TE>   "In some strange way," he said, "going there feels like you are
offering support and comfort to people who lost family there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In an obvious mismatch today, Laker center Shaquille O'Neal, 7
feet 1 and 335 pounds, will go against New York's Kurt Thomas, a 6-9,
235-pounder who seems better suited for a forward position.</TE>
<TE>   But the Knicks have no choice since their starting center, Marcus
Camby, is far from ready to return because of a torn hip muscle that
has already left in him on the sidelines for three weeks, and maybe
out of the Knicks' plans permanently.</TE>
<TE>   New York General Manager Scott Layden tried to deal Camby before
Thursday's trade deadline, but other teams remain wary that Camby is
damaged goods.</TE>
<TE>   That's understandable. The Knicks originally estimated Camby would
be out three to six weeks. After three, he is still on crutches and
has decided to get a second opinion on his condition from an
independent orthopedist.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When was the last time you had to set your alarm for a Laker game?
Today's starting time of noon in New York (9 a.m. PST) is not that
unusual for the Knicks. Half of their six Sunday home games this
season start at noon or 12:30.</TE>

New York averaged 85 points. Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston
averaged a combined 48 points in those two games, 56.5% of their
team's total. O'Neal has only 11 rebounds in his last two games.
Power forward Samaki Walker won't be around to help him out today,
instead spending his third game on the injured list because of a
hyperextended elbow.</TE>

<DH>Dodger Catcher Lo Duca Is Determined to Prove Last Season
Wasn't a Mere Fluke</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The embodiment of the Dodgers is a stout, sturdy, barrel-chested,
5-foot-8, 195-pound catcher, a guy whose frame and slugging prowess
bring to mind former Dodger Jimmy Wynn, who was known as the Toy
Cannon.</LD>
<LD>   He is Paul Lo Duca--as in bazooka--and he emerged as an offensive
force in his first full big league season, batting .320 with 25 home
runs and 90 runs batted in last year. But he was more than just
another productive bat.</LD>
<LD>   "He was a leader, a true Dodger, and there's a lot that goes with
that," Dodger hitting coach Jack Clark said. "The Dodgers, throughout
the minor leagues, teach kids how to be men on and off the field, how
to dress and act and play the game a certain way.</LD>
<TE>   "When [Lo Duca] hits a grounder back to the pitcher he runs hard
to first base. He does that in spring training and in the regular
season. When you look at Lo Duca you see the pride of the
organization, the history of the franchise, all in one man."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca seemed awed by Clark's remark.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great compliment from a great person," Lo Duca said. "For
me, to spend three hours a day playing a game you're paid well to
play, it's easy to play hard."</TE>
<TE>   When you spend six full years in the minor leagues, have been
tabbed as too small and too slow, and had to scratch and claw just to
get to the big leagues, you tend to appreciate every day you're here.</TE>
<TE>   That showed in 2001; Lo Duca was hungry, and his relentless work
ethic in spring training and the regular season, in the weight room
and on the field, helped him win the No. 1 catching spot and the
respect of his teammates during the season.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just a solid player, and when you see his consistency every
day, those are the guys you like to surround yourself with," Dodger
utility player Dave Hansen said. "He keeps the pitchers locked in and
everyone focused. He doesn't have to be a rah-rah type person in the
clubhouse. That's not what we're looking for. We're just looking for
guys who want to win."</TE>
<TE>   Now that Lo Duca has had a breakthrough season, new expectations
await him. Odd as it sounds, he may be better off not trying hard to
fulfill them.</TE>
<TE>   "When I try to hit home runs, I don't," Lo Duca said. "That's
always been a big thing for me. If I relax, just put the ball in
play, use all fields, the home runs will come."</TE>
<TE>   They came at an unusual pace last season. Lo Duca hit only six
home runs in 2000, four in 78 games at triple-A Albuquerque and two
in 34 games for Los Angeles. The most home runs he hit in any
previous season was eight in 126 games at Albuquerque in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But a confluence of developments--increased strength, a better
offensive approach and an improved ability to pounce on mistake
pitches--led to a monster 2001 for Lo Duca, whose primary objective
last spring was to make the team.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my first spring where I won't be fighting for a job,
where I know I'm going to be here, and that's made it a lot more
relaxed of an atmosphere," Lo Duca said. "I'm not going to try to do
anything more than last year. I'm going to take the same approach.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure others will perceive me differently, knowing that if I
don't have the same year as last year I'll be a disappointment. But
my feeling is if we win, I'll be happy. There will be more pressure,
but I'm going to go about it the same way."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy is confident Lo Duca won't look at last
year's numbers and think he has to be the next Mike Piazza. He wants
Lo Duca to concentrate not on his home run total but on numbers such
as on-base percentage, average with runners in scoring position and
walks-to-strikeouts ratio.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca had a .374 on-base percentage last season and hit .379
with runners in scoring position, third best in the National League.
He had 39 walks and only 30 strikeouts, almost unheard-of figures in
today's slugger-dominated game, in which players routinely strike out
more than 100 times a year. Lo Duca was the third-hardest player to
fan in the NL, striking out once every 17.3 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "Offensively, all he needs to do is be the same type of player,
and that doesn't necessarily correlate into big power numbers or 130
RBIs," Tracy said. "Just be a tough out, use the whole field like you
did a year ago. When you do that, there's no such thing as a
prolonged slump.</TE>
<TE>   "If he wants to hit more home runs, that can lead to some
problems, but he's intelligent enough to understand exactly the kind
of offensive player he is, and he won't deviate from that."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca is a known commodity now, but no matter what adjustments
pitchers make in their approach to him, Tracy believes Lo Duca can
counter.</TE>
<TE>   "When you search for flaws in a guy who has a short swing, makes
contact and uses the whole field," Tracy said, "they're not easy to
find."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca hits for average, power, and he's one of the toughest outs
in baseball. As far as his defensive ability, he threw out 39% (31 of
79) of would-be base stealers in 2001 and improved his game-calling
skills throughout the season. He also played through several nagging
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   He showed his versatility, too, by playing catcher, first base,
left field and right field, and hitting in six spots in the batting
order--all while never complaining.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone likes to talk about home runs, but he brings so much
more to the party," Clark said. "He's an outstanding defensive
catcher, he throws and runs well, he's smart. He was always tagged as
a guy who was too small, but he's obviously blown that out of the
water."</TE>
<TE>   With a toy cannon.</TE>

<HD>Women Are No Longer Poles Apart</HD>
<DH>Track and field: Sauer, part of group that is closing gap
on Dragila, sets L.A. Invitational record in pole vault.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The gap between Stacy Dragila and the other top women pole vaulters
in the United States could be closing.</LD>
<LD>   The latest evidence of that came in the L.A. Invitational indoor
track and field meet at the Sports Arena on Saturday night when Mary
Sauer of San Dimas set a meet record of 15 feet before missing three
attempts at an American record of 15-51/2.</LD>
<LD>   Dragila, winner of the first Olympic women's pole vault
competition at the 2000 Games in Sydney, was selected as Track &amp;
Field News magazine's world woman athlete of the year for the 2001
season after winning her second world title and setting eight world
records during the indoor and outdoor seasons.</LD>
<TE>   Her final indoor record of 15-5 has been bettered three times by
Svetlana Feofanova of Russia this year and Sauer had a couple of
decent--if not great--attempts at topping that mark Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if I just would have done the same jump [ I had] at 15
feet I would have made it," Sauer said of her first, and best,
attempt at 15-51/2.</TE>
<TE>   "But I [jumped with a stiffer] pole and raised my grip a little
bit. I figured that when you've got a record on the line, you just
have to go for it."</TE>
<TE>   Sauer, a native of Green Bay, Wis., took up the pole vault in
November 1997 after competing in the high jump and triple jump during
her two years at San Dimas High and four years at Azusa Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   She cleared 13-111/4, 14-51/4 and 15 feet on her first attempts
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   She initially asked to have the bar raised to a career-best
15-21/4 after clearing 15 feet with three or four inches to spare,
but then decided to take a shot at Dragila's mark.</TE>
<TE>   A clearance at 15-21/4 would have topped Sauer's previous best of
15-11/2 and moved her to third on the all-time world indoor list
behind Feofanova (15-6 1/4) and Dragila, but she wanted to take a
shot at the national record.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I would be very upset if I made [15-21/4] by a whole
bunch," Sauer said. "I mean, I've jumped [15-11/2]. I know I can jump
[15-21/4], but I feel like I can get the American record right now.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have the opportunity to go for a record, you just have
to go for it. I would have been very upset if I made [15-21/4] by a
whole bunch and missed [15-51/2]."</TE>
<TE>   Mel Mueller, who trains with Sauer twice at week under the
guidance of UCLA assistant coach Anthony Curran, finished second at
14-51/4 with Canadian Ardin Tucker third at a career-best 13-111/4.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller had cleared an indoor career-best 15-11/4 to defeat Sauer
in a meet in Flagstaff, Ariz., on Feb. 9, but she struggled Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   She cleared 13-111/4 on her first attempt, but needed two tries to
get over 14-51/4 and had only one decent attempt at 15 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller predicted last month that a woman would break the 16-foot
barrier in the pole vault during the upcoming outdoor season, but
added it might not be Dragila, the current record-holder at 15-91/4,
or Feofanova.</TE>
<TE>   Sauer agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are going to have our share coming along," she said.
"Stacy has been jumping for a long time. I haven't. Everyone is
jumping up a notch."</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Lagat of Kenya won the men's mile for a record-tying
fourth consecutive time to highlight several other high-quality
performances in the meet.</TE>
<TE>   Lagat, the second-fastest 1,500-meter runner in history at 3
minutes 26.34 seconds, let former San Bernardino Valley College
standout Ricky Etheridge lead through the first quarter-mile in 57.2,
but surged into the lead after four laps on the 160-yard wood track
and was never seriously challenged after that.</TE>
<TE>   He had a 10-yard lead on two-time Olympic finalist Jason Pyrah of
the U.S. when he came through the 880 in 1:57.5 and his lead
continued to grow as he passed the 1,320 in 2:57.2 and finished in
3:56.34.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathon Riley closed well to finish second in 3:59.92 with Pyrah
third in 4:00.25.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to run faster than I did here last year," said Lagat,
the silver medalist in the 1,500 at the world championships last
year. "Last year I [ran 3:57.61] so I wanted to run something faster
than that."</TE>
<TE>   Angela Williams of USC was a runaway winner in the women's
50-meter dash while Mickey Grimes defeated Jon Drummond in a photo
finish in the men's event.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, the only woman to win three consecutive NCAA titles in
the 100, won her second consecutive L.A. Invitational title with a
6.17-second clocking that equaled her career best and gave her a
comfortable margin of victory over former USC runner Torri Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   Grimes and Drummond, members of the U.S. 400 relay team that won
the world title last year, were each credited with times of 5.73 in
the men's 50.</TE>

<HD>Trail Blazers Keep Going Forward</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The absence of two forwards wasn't enough to slow the Portland Trail
Blazers.</LD>
<LD>   Damon Stoudamire had 24 points, 11 assists and six rebounds, and
Rasheed Wallace scored 23 points to lead Portland over the Denver
Nuggets, 101-90, Saturday night at Portland, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   The Trail Blazers won their fifth in a row and sixth of seven
since the All-Star break. It was Portland's first game without
forward Shawn Kemp, suspended Friday for violating terms of the
league's anti-drug agreement. Forward Scottie Pippen sat out his
second consecutive game with a viral infection.</LD>
<TE>   "This is why we have a deep team," said guard Bonzi Wells, who
scored 18 points. "When a player or two is down, guys have to step up
and take their game to another level."</TE>
<TE>   George McCloud had 20 points in a reserve role to lead Denver,
which lost its fourth in a row. Juwan Howard had 16 points and six
rebounds in his first game with the Nuggets. Howard, Tim Hardaway and
Donnell Harvey played their first game for Denver since being
acquired in a trade with Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Hardaway had 11 points and five assists. Harvey had three points.</TE>
<TE>   Portland took control in the third period, outscoring the Nuggets,
33-17, to take an 80-63 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "The first half was a little slow," Portland Coach Maurice Cheeks
said. "Our defense wasn't very good to start off, but then we began
to run our offense better and I think that was the difference. We ran
our offense much better in the third quarter and pulled away."</TE>
<TE>   Houston 99, Boston 89--Cuttino Mobley scored 40 points and the
Rockets rallied from a 20-point deficit at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The rally, Houston's largest this season, was the fifth-best
comeback in club history.</TE>
<TE>   Kelvin Cato had 14 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks for the
Rockets, who got their fifth consecutive home victory against the
Celtics dating to Jan. 18, 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "Our defense was outstanding against a very good team," Houston
Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. "Cato was tremendous. He's been playing
very consistently for us and when he plays like that, it increases
our chances of winning a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pierce had 30 points for Boston and Antoine Walker had 25.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 97, Washington 95--Brian Grant made a 16-foot baseline jump
shot with 1.4 seconds remaining to lift the Heat at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Jackson preserved the victory by blocking Richard Hamilton's
layup at the buzzer. Jackson was beaten on an inbounds pass but
recovered just in time.</TE>
<TE>   "He got by me," Jackson said. "All I could hear was Pat Riley's
voice in my head yelling at me."</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Jones scored 25 points for the Heat. Rod Strickland, booed
every time he touched the ball in his return to Washington, had 18
points and 14 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan had 37 points and seven assists, but also four of
the Wizards' 11 turnovers. Hamilton had 19 points for the Wizards,
who have lost four in a row and are 1-6 since the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 112, San Antonio 88--The Timberwolves used 30 points and
11 rebounds from Kevin Garnett, and a 30-8 run in the final 8:40, for
the rout at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota avenged its worst loss this season, a 103-83 setback to
the Spurs at San Antonio on Feb. 4.</TE>
<TE>   "We came in here and got kicked hands down last time," Garnett
said. "So that was more than enough motivation."</TE>
<TE>   Garnett helped put the game out of reach with a steal and a dunk
that gave the Timberwolves a 105-86 lead with 3:00 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota, which trailed, 56-47, at halftime, opened the third
quarter with a 22-4 run.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 105, Philadelphia 87--Tracy McGrady had 22 points, 11
assists and 11 rebounds for his first career triple-double, and the
Magic extended its home winning streak to four games.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Miller had 25 points and 11 rebounds for the Magic (29-25),
which moved to a season-best four games over .500.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson had 32 points on 11-for-30 shooting to lead
short-handed Philadelphia. The 76ers were without starting forward
Derrick Coleman and guard Aaron McKie.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, expected to return following a two-game suspension after
he choked Indiana's Reggie Miller on Feb. 17, was sidelined with flu.
McKie missed his third consecutive game with a left ankle strain.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 105, Golden State 91--Reserve Marcus Fizer scored a
career-high 30 points at Chicago and the Bulls have a three-game
winning streak for the first time since January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve Travis Best had 16 points and nine assists for Chicago,
and Jalen Rose had 15 points and six assists.</TE>
<TE>   "Jalen has been giving me the ball in great situations, and so has
Travis," Fizer said. "They make it a whole lot easier. We don't have
to work nearly as hard to score."</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls are 3-0 since making a deal with Indiana on Tuesday for
Rose and Best.</TE>

<LD>Wake up, little Lakers, wake up.</LD>
<LD>   Wake up, little Lakers, wake up.</LD>
<LD>   You've all been fast asleep.</LD>
<TE>   Wake up, little Lakers, and weep.</TE>
<TE>   It's Feb. 24, you're two games out and Shaq's got problems too...</TE>
<TE>   With apologies to Phil and Don Everly</TE>
<TE>   What we've got here is a dead duck walk.</TE>
<TE>   They're having a season, after all. The NBA schedules one each
year, but as late as Dec. 5 when the Lakers were 16-1, it looked as
if the league might have to call this one off for lack of opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for everyone except the Lakers, they nodded off and
haven't dominated anything since.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the ever-popular hubris angle, in which Shaquille
O'Neal learns he can't float like the Hindenburg, miss camp and play
himself into shape.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he's returning from his third stint on the sidelines (two
trips to the injury list, one suspension), his arthritic piggy is
still throbbing and Coach Phil Jackson is talking about resting him
again at season's end, hopefully after they overhaul Sacramento,
which would spare the Lakers the indignity of starting any postseason
showdown with a cowbell serenade in Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Catching the Kings will be no cinch in any case. Assuming
Sacramento maintains its 60-victory pace, the Lakers must go 23-6 to
catch the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Phil, being Phil, exuding guru-like serenity and Alfred
E. Neuman-like confidence (what, them worry?), doesn't assume that at
all.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to think about it as how do we do it, getting him
[O'Neal] ready for the matchup, head on head?" Jackson said last week
before heading East.</TE>
<TE>   "They [Kings] still haven't proven themselves as a real quality
road team yet. We know they're really solid on their home court. They
have a bandbox and they play in front of their fans very well. They
just got over .500 as a road team in this last month and I think the
jury's still out on them. They play 41 games on the road and if
they're 20-21 or 21-20....</TE>
<TE>   "We think they're going to lose some more games at home. You don't
sustain that kind of record [27-2].... If they lose 20 games on the
road and three or four at home, that's 24 losses. I don't know, can
we play to that level?"</TE>
<TE>   We'll see. If the Kings go 58-24, the Lakers still must go 22-8,
no mean feat, given O'Neal's feet.</TE>
<TE>   With Shaq at 100%, the Lakers are in a league of their own. The
Kings are soft, the San Antonio Spurs don't score enough, the
Minnesota Timberwolves don't weigh enough and the Dallas Mavericks,
who are still children in a grown-ups' conference, have a wag-the-dog
problem, with their manic owner, Mad Mark Cuban, reconfiguring them
every midseason.</TE>
<TE>   However, with Shaq at 80% or 90%, the Lakers are in the same
league as everyone else. In his last 13 games, they're 7-6, with
opponents averaging 98.2 points. That's a tidy 6.6 more than they've
given up in their other games.</TE>
<TE>   In big games, O'Neal works on defense. When he's hurting and/or
bored, he lurks in the lane and lets opponents see what they can do
with wide-open looks.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when he's at 0%--out--everyone gets unmasked.</TE>
<TE>   Without O'Neal, the Lakers were 7-6, looking less like defending
champions than Orlando, with a great perimeter player and a small
supporting cast.</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker, trying to grow into a front-line power forward, is
even less imposing as a center. Robert Horry, who's actually playing
again after a prolonged crisis of confidence or energy, is a
converted small forward. Slava Medvedenko, 18 months removed from the
Ukraine, is coming but not yet there.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Jackson has faced similar predicaments, having won
three of his eight titles after overcoming an opponent's home-court
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Dynasts do that stuff, like the Boston Celtics, who prolonged
their 11-year, nine-title run by winning a Game 7 in Philadelphia in
the 1968 Eastern Conference finals and an even more famous Game 7 in
the Forum in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   These Lakers did it too, demolishing No. 1-seeded San Antonio last
season, but that cuts two ways.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what they say, having thrown a switch late in a lost
season, the Lakers think they can do it again. In the meantime,
they're still playing to the level of their opposition and getting
into fights on the bus.</TE>
<TE>   Uh, fellows? Last season is way over.</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   You leave me b-r-e-a-t-h-l-e-s-s: Like the class cutup, squirming
in his desk, Cuban has to be doing something: answering e-mails,
instructing the league in his myriad fields of expertise or, worst of
all (or best, depending on how you're rooting), redoing his roster.
He just struck again, unloading Juwan Howard for Nick Van Exel and
Raef LaFrentz. Of course, the Mavericks already had an All-Star point
guard, Steve Nash and Van Exel both need the ball in their hands, and
one of them is known to get unhappy. Nick is putting on a happy face,
but that won't last beyond this season.... Too bad they couldn't
televise that heartwarming Nick-Del Harris reunion, when the little
tempest embraced the Maverick assistant and former Laker coach he has
been calling a "cancer" and blaming for all his problems since
leaving L.A.... The Mavericks' "prize," the 6-11 LaFrentz, makes
three-point baskets and blocks shots (No. 2 in the league), but he's
soft and only marginally productive at 15 points and 7.4 rebounds a
game. He probably blocked so many shots because no one cared enough
to watch out for him in the Nuggets' layup-line defense.... In
Cuban's first season, he signed Dennis Rodman, derailing the team's
late-season run. His second season, Cuban got Howard, who had two
more years--at $39.5 million--left, to be the No. 4 scorer they
didn't need. His third season, Cuban dumped Howard for LaFrentz, who
isn't that far ahead of Wang Zhi Zhi, but as a free agent in 2003,
will soon demand--and get--a $70-million contract.... Despite the
cheering by the Dallas media, this isn't a coup made possible by
Cuban's disdain for the luxury tax. Since there's a salary cap, every
dollar he pays LaFrentz is one he can't offer someone who could
actually make them better. To move Van Exel, they'll have to take
someone else's high-priced problem, like Boston's Kenny Anderson or
Minnesota's Terrell Brandon....  Aside from that, I like the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Plumbing the low life, or Nick as in up the creek: After saying
he'd opt out of two years, and $26 million, on his contract, he
recanted, sinking trades to the Celtics for Anderson and Timberwolves
for Brandon. Then, assuming he was stranded in Denver, Van Exel
announced he might need season-ending surgery to his left elbow,
which came as a surprise to the Nuggets. Said General Manager Kiki
Vandeweghe: "The only thing that was indicated to me from Nick and
his agent was if he was traded, he would be playing." ... Then,
before the eleventh-hour Dallas deal, Van Exel's agent, Tony Dutt,
whom Nick had fired but then rehired to help him escape, said, "I
personally feel like, that if it doesn't happen now, it could happen
in the summer." ... I personally feel if the Nuggets hadn't gotten
rid of Nick in the summer, they would have put out a contract on him.
The big question is: Now that he's out of there, will he fire Dutt
again? ... Sunrise, sunset, etc.: The good news for the Phoenix Suns
is that owner Jerry Colangelo and his son, team president Bryan, run
a first-class operation and have already rebuilt the franchise twice.
The bad news is, they have to do it again. They offed Coach Scott
Skiles, reportedly fearing he was on the outs with Shawn Marion, a
2003 free agent. Of course, Skiles had won 50 games in each of his
two seasons before they traded Jason Kidd. They finished the week,
trading top reserves Tony Delk and Rodney Rogers as they turned their
sights to the future, but must unload over-priced artifacts Penny
Hardaway and Tom Gugliotta.... Not that the new program is off to a
slow start, but Stephon Marbury, their foundation, blew off interim
Coach Frank Johnson's first shoot-around, didn't start that night,
argued with Johnson and played 14 minutes.... Lifestyles of the rich
and meshuga: Police in St. Petersburg, Fla., used tranquilizer darts
to subdue a 2,000-pound pet buffalo named Big Daddy that got loose
from the estate of recently retired Matt Geiger.... Boy, do I love
this game.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The newcomers fit in nicely for the Dallas Mavericks. But Steve Nash
and Dirk Nowitzki still led the way.</LD>
<LD>   Nash scored 28 points and Nowitzki had 26 points and 21 rebounds
and the Mavericks, with key contributions from Raef LaFrentz and Nick
Van Exel in their debuts, defeated the Sacramento Kings, 111-97,
Saturday at Dallas in a battle of division leaders.</LD>
<LD>   "We looked good and the new guys fit in well," Nowitzki said. "It
will be a while before we really know how to play with each other,
but the future is bright."</LD>
<TE>   LaFrentz had 14 points and six rebounds, and Van Exel had eight
points and eight assists. Each played about 30 minutes only two days
after being acquired from Denver with Avery Johnson and Tariq
Abdul-Wahad.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Mavericks' two All-Stars still made the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   Nash shot 10 for 13 and scored 15 consecutive points in a 22-6
third-quarter run that put Dallas ahead to stay. Nowitzki had his
second consecutive game with more than 20 points and 20 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a few good looks. I knocked them down and got my confidence
going. That made it easy for me," Nash said. "With the new guys, we
can really spread the floor and give a lot of different looks."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings led, 58-51, when Chris Webber made a 19-foot jumper with
9:07 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Nash ignited the turnaround for Dallas, making consecutive
three-point baskets to begin his scoring run.</TE>
<TE>   "He can do that in a heartbeat," Nowitzki said. "He's the heart
and soul of the whole team."</TE>
<TE>   Nash tied the score, 64-64, on a short jumper with 4:09 left in
the third quarter. After Scot Pollard traveled, Nash drove for a
layup that put the Mavericks ahead to stay, and ended his stretch of
15 points in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Webber had 28 points and 14 rebounds. Sacramento, despite losing
three of four, still has the league's best record (40-15) and a
two-game lead over the Lakers in the Pacific Division.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas (39-17), the Midwest leader, has the league's second-best
record.</TE>
<TE>   "They got to running and took control, and we got impatient," King
Coach Rick Adelman said. "They've got that many more weapons to go
with. It was a good trade for them."</TE>

<LD>Penn State pole vaulter Kevin Dare died Saturday after landing on his
head during the Big Ten indoor championships at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   After being treated by emergency medical technicians at the
University of Minnesota Fieldhouse, Dare was taken to Hennepin County
Medical Center. He never regained consciousness, and was pronounced
dead shortly after arriving at the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said the 19-year-old sophomore tumbled backward,
headfirst, onto the metal "box," the area 8 inches deep that is used
to plant the pole. He was attempting a vault of 15 feet 7 inches,
well below his personal best.</LD>
<TE>   "He swung upside down and sort of stalled with his jump,"
Minnesota assistant coach Mario Sategna said. "It looked like he
became disoriented and didn't know where he was. I believe he thought
he had cleared the bar and was on the other side of it."</TE>
<TE>   Dare's mother, Terri, and father, Ed, were at the meet. His older
brother, Eric, throws the javelin for Penn State during the outdoor
season and is a defensive back for the football team.</TE>

charge in a shooting death at his New Jersey estate.</TE>
<TE>   New York's WNBC, citing an unidentified investigator, reported
that Williams would be charged with manslaughter during a Monday
meeting with authorities in Hunterdon County, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Costas Christofi, 55, a limousine driver, was found shot to death
at Williams' 65-acre estate Feb. 14. Published reports have quoted
unidentified law enforcement sources saying Williams was holding a
shotgun when it accidentally went off. Authorities have not said who
fired the gun.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis star Andre Agassi has sued the luxury watch manufacturer
Rolex for using his name and likeness without consent, his attorney,

<LD>Besides the closing ceremony, one Super-Bowl-like event remains: the
gold-medal hockey meeting between the United States and Canada.</LD>
<LD>   Canada was the power of Olympic hockey in the early years, winning
six golds, two silvers and a bronze in the nine Olympics in which
hockey was contested from 1920 through 1960 (missing the war years of
1940 and '44). Its last gold medal was in 1952, and after winning a
bronze in '56, it finished second to the United States in the 1960
Games at Squaw Valley. The Canadians' only loss that year was to the
U.S. team.</LD>
<LD>   Many assumed the Canadians would come back strong, but they have
not, boycotting a few Olympics out of anger at the Soviet bloc for
sending its pro machine to face a field of Olympic amateurs, and then
not getting it done when they returned in the '80 Games in Lake
Placid.</LD>
<TE>   Not even in Nagano in '98, when pros were allowed officially,
could the Canadians win. They were fourth there.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has not lost an Olympic hockey game on home soil since
the 1932 Games in Lake Placid. It was unbeaten in '60 at Squaw Valley
and '80 at Lake Placid. In '32 at Lake Placid, the Americans were
beaten and tied by the same team. Canada.</TE>

features a strong Russian contingent that may or may not compete in
the aftermath of the recent disqualification of one of its members in
a relay race for testing positive for an elevated number of red blood
cells. It also will be the last race of American Nina Kemppel. She is
a four-time Olympian and a medal performance, which would be her
firstin a sport dominated by Europeans, is a longshot.</LD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>It's fast. It's freaky. It's butts on the ice, heads on the boards,
and they cheat more than figure skating judges on casino night.</LD>
<LD>   Is short-track speedskating the perfect sport for these Winter
Olympics or what?</LD>
<LD>   Which pretty much makes Apolo Anton Ohno the perfect Winter
Olympian.</LD>
<TE>   You've seen him. You can't take your eyes off him. Like 15,600
fans at the Salt Lake Ice Center on Saturday, you wanted to tape a
tiny cardboard soul patch to your chin and look like him.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno is everything that television, for the last two weeks, has
wanted us to embrace in an Olympic athlete.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he is everything that made these two weeks so unsettling.</TE>
<TE>   Have we cheered him for his skill and athleticism?</TE>
<TE>   Or for his regal name and a snowboarder's haircut?</TE>
<TE>   Have we been so charmed by his skeleton recklessness that we have
ignored his bobsledder's ruthlessness?</TE>
<TE>   And hasn't anybody noticed that he pulls it all together with the
feigned naivete of a Canadian pairs skater?</TE>
<TE>   Cover boy or not, Ohno has a checkered past, a controversial
present, and a future with the Bay City Bombers.</TE>
<TE>   It was thus only fitting that, on Saturday night, this
made-for-Salt-Lake Olympian had a B-movie finale.</TE>
<TE>   He was disqualified in the 500-meter race for shoving a guy.</TE>
<TE>   He was then overtaken by the Chinese team for third place in the
5,000 relay after teammate Rusty Smith had put them in that position
by falling.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno thus finishes not only with two medals, but also batting
1.000.</TE>
<TE>   Four events, four strange endings.</TE>
<TE>   One gold medal for a race in which he finished second.</TE>
<TE>   One silver medal for a race that he finished on his rear end.</TE>
<TE>   One disqualification.</TE>
<TE>   One fourth-place after a teammate's fall.</TE>
<TE>   He now steps into the arms of a marketing machine that will ignore
the two weeks of questionable crashes and South Korean appeals and
churn the 19-year-old Seattle into some sort of hero.</TE>
<TE>   "This puts it all to rest," Ohno said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Hardly.</TE>
<TE>   This, instead, resurrects an ancient Olympic question.</TE>
<TE>   Given that most of these athletes come into our lives every four
years as strangers, why do we applaud some louder than others?</TE>
<TE>   Ohno was surrounded by dozens of reporters Saturday night despite
winning nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, of Sunset Beach, who earned the bronze medal in the 500
before falling in the relay, was surrounded only by a handful.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno answered a few questions, shrugged, and was rushed off.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, despite coughing constantly because of a bad cold, answered
until the questions ended.</TE>
<TE>   Said Ohno: "Lots of crazy things happen in the Olympics. You ask
any athlete, if something crazy is going to happen, it's going to
happen here."</TE>
<TE>   Said Smith: "I got what I've been searching for.... I'm so proud
to be an American."</TE>
<TE>   Is that we like crazy, and have grown weary of patriotism?</TE>
<TE>   Is this one reason we like Ohno?</TE>
<TE>   Before the Games, Ohno and Smith were accused of being the
masterminds behind a rigged pre-Olympics race that would help Ohno's
buddy Shani Davis make the team.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations were judged to be without merit, and Davis made
the team, and came to Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   But after a couple of days, officials decided Davis wasn't needed,
and sent him overseas.</TE>
<TE>   For Ohno, it was the start of a week that was weird at best, and
conspiratorial at worst.</TE>
<TE>   In his first event, the 1,000 meters last weekend, he crashed with
South Korean Ahn Hyun Soo and China's Li Jiajun on the last lap,
sending their spandex bodies into the boards like brightly colored
bowling pins.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno earned a silver medal simply by emerging from the mess and
sliding across the finish line on his butt.</TE>
<TE>   It was a pretty good insurance settlement for an accident that may
have been at least partially caused by him.</TE>
<TE>   "People can think what they want," he said last week. "People who
watch the sport, they understand."</TE>
<TE>   In his second event, Wednesday's 1,500, Ohno finished second, but
won a gold medal after Korean Kim Dong-Sung was disqualified for
skating into Ohno's lane.</TE>
<TE>   Again, it was on the last lap. And, again, it was unclear who was
at fault.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged infraction wasn't nearly as blatant as Ohno's
hands-thrown-into-the-air gesture that convinced the judges he was
impeded.</TE>
<TE>   The Koreans protested that Ohno had been faking.</TE>
<TE>   Others in the race thought Ohno was faking.</TE>
<TE>   But Ohno would never cop to anything, not even acknowledging
whether he was actually touched.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll have to look at the tape," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials let him keep the medal, bringing this story to its final
chapter Saturday night, Ohno's chance to become the Americans' only
four-medal winner.</TE>
<TE>   The first chance ended on the final lap of the 500
semifinals--yep, that final lap again--when Ohno pushed Japan's
Satoru Terao into the wall and was ejected.</TE>
<TE>   The second chance ended in a relay in which, even after Smith
fell, the Americans had a chance for a medal, but Ohno was clearly
gassed.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, it wasn't his fault, it was my fault, totally my fault,"
Smith said. "After I fell, we were cooked."</TE>
<TE>   And so Apolo Anton Ohno leaves here with plenty of suspicion, but
no fault, and a marketing future as bright--if not as awkward--as
those canary helmets.</TE>
<TE>   When he took the ice to huge cheers for one of the final times
Saturday, a certain fan named Michelle Kwan held up a sign that read,
"Oh yes, Ohno," next to the drawing of a big pair of lips.</TE>
<TE>   Oh yes, he has a great name. Oh no, we shouldn't confuse it for
greatness.</TE>

<DH>Hays wins four-man silver, and Shimer gets bronze as U.S.
men finish strong to end a 46-year drought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY TEMKIN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The great U.S. men's bobsled drought ended Saturday in a flood of
medals.</LD>
<LD>   The United States, which hadn't produced an Olympic medal in this
sport in 46 years, grabbed silver and bronze in the four-man event at
Utah Olympic Park when drivers Todd Hays and Brian Shimer moved past
Switzerland's Martin Annen on their fourth and final runs.</LD>
<LD>   A miracle on ice? Not quite, but it was close, at least when it
came to Shimer, a seemingly washed-up 39-year-old whose virtuoso
driving couldn't offset his crew's mediocre starts and who probably
wouldn't have tried for his fifth Olympic team if the Games hadn't
been on U.S. soil.</LD>
<TE>   Germany's Andre Lange won the gold medal in a total time of 3
minutes 7.51 seconds. Hays was second in 3:07.81, with Shimer third
in 3:07.86. "It's a fairy-tale ending," said Shimer, who is retiring
after 17 years in the sport. "I've dreamt of this my whole career.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I'm concerned, that bronze is as shiny as gold."</TE>
<TE>   Hays had a lead of 0.09 of a second after Friday's two runs, but
he raced first on soft ice in Saturday's opening heat and finished in
47.22 seconds--the heat's fourth-best time--and slid into third, 0.29
behind Lange and 0.02 behind Annen.</TE>
<TE>   Shimer, who started the day in fifth place, 0.30 from a medal, had
a strong 46.98 run to move into fourth, 0.15 behind Hays. In the
fourth heat, as snow swirled, Shimer was the first of the top four to
drive, followed by Hays, Annen and Lange. Shimer moved into first
with a 47.23 run that would stand as the heat's fastest.</TE>
<TE>   But when Hays produced a 47.33 to move 0.05 ahead of Shimer, it
looked as though the latter would barely miss a medal again. In 1998,
Shimer missed a bronze medal by 0.02 after his sled mysteriously lost
speed just before the finish. That capped a series of Olympic
misadventures for Shimer that had started in the 1992 Games and
included a four-man disqualification in 1994 for having runners that
were too warm.</TE>
<TE>   After 1998, two of Shimer's push athletes, Garrett Hines and Randy
Jones, left him for Hays, the new hot U.S. driver. Then a series of
leg injuries made Shimer a non-factor on the 1999-2000 and 2000-01
World Cup circuits. When one of his top pushers injured his back in
October, the former Morehead State football player seemed unlikely
even to make a fifth Olympics. Shimer gambled by skipping five of the
seven World Cup races to assemble a workable crew and prepare for the
Olympic trials.</TE>
<TE>   In last Sunday's two-man competition, slow starts helped relegate
him to a ninth-place finish, and he didn't figure to do a lot better
in the four-man event. Saturday he watched in wonder as Annen's
interval times made it possible that Hays and Shimer might wind up on
the medal podium.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Oh my God, is it possible?'" said Shimer, who began
his Olympic career as a push athlete in the 1988 Games. "I thought
maybe I had passed out after the second run and was dreaming."</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't. Annen, a cheese maker, finished his run in 47.49 to
slide 0.09 behind Shimer and set off a tumultuous celebration, with
the eight U.S. medal winners climbing on the walls of the track and
each other. Lange's final run clinched the gold, but that didn't put
a damper on the party.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't describe my emotions," Shimer said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither could Jones and Hines. Both had just missed on Shimer's
1998 four-man team, and Hines had missed a bronze medal by 0.03 last
Sunday on Hays' two-man sled.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, they recorded the best Winter Olympic finishes ever by
African American males.</TE>
<TE>   "This makes up for just about everything," Hines said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, whom Hays had to lure out of retirement after 1998, said he
would have struggled to cope with another near miss.</TE>
<TE>   "An 0.02 here, and I might have jumped off that tower," he said,
gesturing nearby. "But we broke that curse with silver and bronze."</TE>
<TE>   To win silver, Hays had to overcome the late-January suspension of
push athlete Pavle Jovanovic, who failed a December drug test. He
added Bill Schuffenhauer of nearby Ogden and still produced start
times that were the fastest or second-fastest in all four runs.</TE>
<TE>   "Losing in the two-man stings like nothing ever has," Hays said.
"But we took that pain and put it into preparation, and here we are."</TE>
<TE>   Shimer and his crew of Mike Kohn, Doug Sharp and Dan Steele had
starts that ranked from ninth- to 17th best, but Shimer overcame it
with his driving.</TE>
<TE>   Shimer and Hays might not have overcome the drought without a
boost from NASCAR driver Geoff Bodine.</TE>
<TE>   Bodine noted the U.S. struggles in the 1992 Games and realized
matters probably wouldn't improve as long as U.S. drivers had to use
second-rate European sleds that were the best they could get.</TE>
<TE>   He began the USA Bobsled Project to build state-of-the-art sleds,
seeding it with more than $100,000 of his own money.</TE>

<HD>Disappointed Russians Settle for a Bronze</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Russia's latest Olympic medal won't be a highlight in the nation's
rich hockey history.</LD>
<LD>   Slava Fetisov expected his team to earn more than bronze--and the
coach still isn't happy Russia finished its Olympic run one day
early. Alexei Kovalev had two goals and an assist as Russia won the
bronze medal in Olympic men's hockey with a 7-2 victory over Belarus
on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   With an uninspired but productive performance against the
tournament's most surprising underdog, the Russians claimed their
12th medal in Olympic hockey--a record their nation will share with
Canada after the gold-medal game.</LD>
<TE>   Still, it was disappointing for Russia, which won silver in Nagano
and gold in three of the previous four Olympics. "It's an honor to be
part of that tradition," said goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, who made 21
saves to finish with a .930 save percentage for the tournament. "We
knew we couldn't go home empty. We couldn't lose to Belarus, but it
was a tough game for us. We spent a lot of emotions last night."</TE>
<TE>   Many observers thought Russia's 3-2 semifinal loss Friday to the
U.S. was caused by the latest in a series of slow starts by Russia's
phenomenal forwards, who were outshot and outskated over the first
two periods. Russia had another slow start against Belarus but picked
up in plenty of time.</TE>
<TE>   Fetisov, in the tenor of the Russian Olympic delegation's
complaints about fairness in Salt Lake City, blamed the semifinal
loss partially on Bill McCreary, NHL referee from Canada. Fetisov
claimed he has video evidence that McCreary's calls in the second
period unjustly favored the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   All games in the tournament featuring more than 50% NHL players
were officiated by an NHL staffer, in accordance with the league's
agreement with the International Ice Hockey Federation.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians took out their frustrations on Belarus in a physical
game. "We hate those guys. Put it in the paper," Fetisov barked
earlier in the week when asked about Belarus.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, Khabibulin trained with the Belarusian team last summer,
and Sergei Fedorov is among several Russian players who once trained
in Minsk. Fetisov and Belarus Coach Vladimir Krikunov warmly shook
hands afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "All of our players are in a very good mood right now," Krikunov
said. "I think they've reached their maximum, not only for these
Games, but maybe for their whole lives."</TE>

<HD>No Fanfare for Muehlegg</HD>
<DH>German-born skier gets cold reception from Spanish media
after winning third gold for adopted country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>After winning his third gold medal of the Winter Olympics, Johann
Muehlegg expected to be warmly embraced as a true son of Spain.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the German-born cross-country skier drew sideways glances
from the media for two prerace blood tests and an almost mocking
request to answer a query in his limited Spanish.</LD>
<LD>   Muehlegg failed, then passed, the blood test before staging a
strong comeback over the final 10 kilometers of the 50K classic-style
race Saturday, overtaking Russia's Mikhail Ivanov for the gold.
Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu won the bronze.</LD>
<TE>   "I race today for Spain," said Muehlegg, who became a Spanish
citizen in 1999 after a falling out with the German ski federation.</TE>
<TE>   A Spanish reporter asked Muehlegg whether he would like to thank
anyone for his success, which is unprecedented for Spain at a Winter
Olympics. Muehlegg, who has learned just enough Spanish to get by,
started to answer in English before the reporter stopped him. "En
Espanol," he requested.</TE>
<TE>   "Many thanks to the people of Spain and to the king of Spain,"
Muehlegg said through an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the questions about the blood test. Muehlegg was among
13 men selected at random to be tested for high levels of hemoglobin,
an oxygen-carrying molecule found in red blood cells that can
increase endurance. Muehlegg's levels were above the limit for the
first test, but beneath the threshold for a second test administered
five minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   "The blood was going up, but finally it was not a problem,"
Muehlegg said.</TE>
<TE>   Two days earlier, the Russian women's relay team was forced to
withdraw from its race after Larissa Lazutina twice was tested over
the hemoglobin limit. Russian officials said the drug testers were
"hunting out" their athletes, and the incident cast greater scrutiny
on Muehlegg.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why the second test showed different levels than the first,
Muehlegg responded, "I don't know if the machine is not working
well." He also was asked what his levels were. "I think that's a
secret," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Muehlegg said a change in his diet three days before the race
might have altered his blood levels, but he said the switch gave him
enough energy to catch Ivanov. Muehlegg completed the Soldier Hollow
course in 2 hours 6 minutes 5.9 seconds--14.9 seconds faster than
Ivanov.</TE>
<TE>   Muehlegg started slowly, and by the 33.4K mark, Ivanov's lead had
grown from five seconds to nearly 39. Muehlegg found a reservoir of
energy, though, and the 6-foot, 154-pound Ivanov couldn't match his
strength.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's the strongest skier of these Olympic Games, and it's
almost impossible to compete with him," Veerpalu said.</TE>
<TE>   In his previous victory, Muehlegg had enough time to grab a
Spanish flag from the grandstand and carry it to the finish line.
This time, however, he had no such cushion. When he came across, he
was doubled over in pain.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it was the toughest race ever," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Muehlegg competed in three Olympics for Germany, but the troubles
with his own ski federation began in 1993. Frustrated by his poor
performance, he went to Munich to seek the advice of a Portugese
medicine woman. She told him that someone on his team was poisoning
him. Relations with his coaches, teammates and trainers deteriorated,
and he left in 1998. He took the 1998-99 season off, then stormed
back to win the World Cup title in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Spain was glad to have him. Before these games, the country's only
Winter gold medal was Francisco Fernandez Ochoa's 1972 slalom
victory. After his pursuit win, King Juan Carlos called Muehlegg to
congratulate the skier Spanish fans call "Juanito."</TE>
<TE>   Others consider him a turncoat, however, and Ochoa has denounced
him as a "mercenary." Since his three-year contract with the Spanish
ski federation runs out this year, there is speculation that
Muehlegg, 31, might one day go back to competing for Germany, where
he lives most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy to have won for those guys in Spain," he said.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>I remember sitting in a crowded conference room in Calgary, Canada,
14 years ago when the U.S. Olympic Committee announced it had
appointed George Steinbrenner to whip our winter sports athletes into
shape.</LD>
<LD>   It was easy for skeptics among the media to make jokes about the
Big Chinook. There seemed to be some similarities between
Steinbrenner and the hot air blowing in to transform Calgary in
February into a site more suited for the Spring Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Five Winter Olympics later, Steinbrenner still has critics within
the movement who are offended by his commission's subsequent 111-page
report that declared winning medals should be the USOC's primary
goal. They believe that he should have placed more emphasis on the
United States' role in encouraging peace and friendship among nations
through sports.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, what they really believe is that someone besides
Steinbrenner should have headed the commission.</TE>
<TE>   But no matter what Baron Pierre de Coubertin ("The important thing
in life is not victory, but the fight") might have thought of
Steinbrenner, you have to give him credit.</TE>
<TE>   He identified a goal and set a path. It involved identifying good
young athletes and financing not only their training but also their
living expenses so that they could prolong their Olympic careers.
Whether it's Derek Jeter or Derek Parra, they need the same
essentials in order to hone their skills.</TE>
<TE>   The USOC has followed that path vigorously. In the last four
years, the committee has</TE>
<TE>   spent more than $40 million in athlete support while building its
most experienced and most talented Winter Olympic team in 70 years.</TE>
<TE>   The United States will win its 34th medal in today's men's ice
hockey final, including perhaps as many as 11 golds, and finish
second in the medal standings to Germany. The Americans won six in
Calgary, two golds, and finished ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Before we toss our Roots' USA berets into the sky in celebration,
we should point out the extenuating circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, the Big Red Machine isn't what it used to be. When
competing as one country,</TE>
<TE>   the former republics of the</TE>
<TE>   Soviet Union dominated the Winter Olympics. When they separated,
some believed they would win even more medals because they would have
12 times more competitors.</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't happened in the Winter Olympics. There is no longer
enough government support to sustain excellence in sports that aren't
all that popular at home. Competing separately, they had won only 20
medals through Saturday. Russia had won 16, seven fewer than their
goal. Only two other former republics, Estonia and Belarus, had won</TE>
<TE>   any.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor in the United States' improvement that can't be
overlooked is the addition of so many new events to the Winter
Olympic program. International Olympic Committee members aren't hip,
but they are hip to the extra dollars that U.S. networks will pay if
U.S. athletes are winning medals.</TE>
<TE>   Americans, dude, are good in snowboarding, freestyle skiing and
skeleton.</TE>
<TE>   Of the United States' 34</TE>
<TE>   medals, 16 are in events not included in the Winter Olympics in
1988.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is impressive that the United States won 18 medals in
events that were on the program in Calgary. That would have placed
them third in those medal standings behind the Soviet</TE>
<TE>   Union and East Germany and</TE>
<TE>   first among countries that still exist.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans won medals in two sports in 1988, figure skating and
speedskating. They won medals in all but four sports here--biathlon,
curling, cross-country skiing and ski jumping. They even won two
medals in men's bobsled Saturday, a sport in which the United States
had not won anything in 46 years.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge now for the USOC is to build on--or at least
maintain--the momentum it built here.</TE>
<TE>   The next four years will not be as easy for U.S. winter athletes
as the last four. They have been able to train at the Olympic venues
more than athletes from other countries. Tristan Gale, a gold
medalist in skeleton, said she knew the track here so well that she
could slide down it blindfolded.</TE>
<TE>   That became even more of an advantage after Sept. 11, when foreign
athletes didn't want to travel to the United States and American
athletes didn't want to travel abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Games began, U.S. athletes had another edge because of
the home crowds.</TE>
<TE>   They no doubt will be welcome in 2006 in Turin, Italy. But not
this welcome.</TE>
<TE>   Norway, a traditional winter power that slumped during the '70s
and '80s, began building for the 1994 Games in Lillehammer seven
years in advance. It finished third in the standings in Albertville,
France, in 1992 with 20 and second at home in 1994 with 26. That
success carried over to Nagano in 1998, when it again finished second
with 25 medals, and Salt Lake City, where it had 22 medals through
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But Japan, which marshaled its efforts for Nagano in 1998 and was
rewarded with a national record of 10 medals, has fallen to two here.</TE>
<TE>   Which way will the United States go?</TE>
<TE>   The most successful Winter Games for the United States have been
at home--in 1932 at Lake Placid, in 1960 at Squaw Valley, 1980 at
Lake Placid and 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Americans didn't do so well in subsequent Olympics overseas, but
they didn't have Steinbrenner's plan. He might not have won the World
Series last year, but he has beaten most of the world.</TE>

<KH>MEN'S HOCKEY GOLD-MEDAL GAME Today, Channel 4, Noon</KH>
<HD>Summit Meeting</HD>
<DH>National pride is at stake when two dream teams, the U.S.
and Canada, take the ice for a friendly faceoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>After two weeks of international competition among 77 countries, the
last contest of the 2002 Olympics has turned into a neighborhood
get-together.</LD>
<LD>   It's Canada vs. the United States for the men's hockey gold medal.
Two countries that share a border. Two countries that differ on the
little things (such as how to pronounce "organization") but generally
collaborate on the large issues (such as wars).</LD>
<LD>   And two groups of hockey players with so much talent, who know
each other so well that they probably would put together a great game
under any circumstances.</LD>
<TE>   "I was going to ask Herbie [Brooks, the U.S. coach] this morning
if we could find a backyard rink someplace and let the two teams go
at it," Canada Coach Pat Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   There's too much corporate involvement to hold this anywhere but
the designated venue, the E Center today at noon Pacific time. NBC
expects a ratings blowout. The NHL loves the fact that two rosters
filled with its players will have the sporting world's attention.
United States forward Jeremy Roenick might have been talking about
more than just the highly paid players when he said: "There's a whole
lot of money on that ice tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   And national pride.</TE>
<TE>   "In Canada, this is all they think about is hockey," Roenick said.
"If they don't get the gold medal, then they've fallen short of their
goal. On the flip side, we're on our own ice surface, we're in front
of our fans, we haven't lost here in [24 Olympic] games on U.S.
soil."</TE>
<TE>   Said Team Canada Executive Director Wayne Gretzky: "I think
there's a sense of a North American championship here. I think it's
going to be great for hockey. One of the greatest things that's
happened for the NHL in a long time. It's going to pit the best
players in North America against each other."</TE>
<TE>   Canada is 9-2-3 against the United States in the Olympics,
including a 4-1 victory in Nagano in 1998. But for all of its
greatness, Canada hasn't won a gold medal since 1952, before the
Soviet Union rose to dominate the sport on the international level
for 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   Desperation isn't too strong a word. You can see it in Gretzky's
facial reactions in every game. You could hear it in his voice during
his the-world-is-against-Canada news conference last week.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Lemieux, the owner and star of the Pittsburgh Penguins, has
jeopardized his team's NHL playoff chances to keep his aching hip as
fresh as possible for the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked all along the last couple of months that the most
important thing for me was to play in the Olympics and to try and
help this team achieve our goal, which is winning a gold medal,"
Lemieux said. "That's why I skipped a lot of games with Pittsburgh. I
didn't play any back-to-back games. Whatever happens after Sunday is
something I can't control. Hopefully my hip is going to get better
over the last couple of months of the season and try to help my team
get into the playoffs. [The gold-medal game] is my priority right
now."</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics have featured top performances by the game's top
players. Even players who have won Stanley Cups are going all-out to
get a gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all competitive people," said U.S. goalie Mike Richter of
the New York Rangers, one of 25 players in this game who have won the
Stanley Cup. "Anytime you have a chance to play against the best in a
tournament like this, like the NHL Stanley Cup is or the Olympics is
now, guys want to play as well as they can and prove themselves. I
think there's not a lot of coasting. Everybody's giving their best
effort and they want to come out on top. It brings out the best in
all the athletes."</TE>
<TE>   And Brooks' coaching has brought out the best in the American
team. He hasn't had much time, with only a two-day mini-camp in
September and one practice with the full team here in February the
day before final-round competition began.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a lot of give and take," Brooks said. "I'm smart enough
to know that the key thing in any communications is to ask questions
and listen."</TE>
<TE>   Forward John LeClair of the Philadelphia Flyers said, "Coach
Brooks has been very open to everything we have to add. There's some
guys that have played a lot of hockey in our room. They know quite a
bit about the game. Between everybody, we figure out a good game plan
for each game."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Brooks' questions are designed to make his players change
their thought process. The day before they played Germany, he asked
them how many games are in an NHL season.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Modano of the Dallas Stars answered: "82."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks turned to John LeClair from the Philadelphia Flyers and
said: "Do you agree?"</TE>
<TE>   LeClair said "I'm going to say no, because I think you want
something else."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks told them the correct answer was one--times 82.</TE>
<TE>   During a desperately needed timeout in the third period of
Friday's semifinal, after Russia had chopped the United States' 3-0
lead to 3-2, Brooks simply emphasized a word he first used at the
September camp: rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "There are key words that will trigger a thought process and
reaction," Brooks said. "I just mentioned that one word."</TE>
<TE>   Said Richter: "He's a good reader of people. Because of that, he's
able to push the right buttons."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks has said all along that this tournament is about the
players. And no team has more great NHL players than Canada. The
roster consists of the North American all-star team from earlier this
month at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   But some observers believe the best player in this tournament has
been the United States' Mike Modano. He speeds the puck into the
offensive zone, he makes passes as precise as laser eye surgery and
he gets back on defense to reach in and swipe away the puck.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a chance to play with Mo on a bunch of U.S. teams,"
LeClair said. "He's always been our best player. He's incredibly
talented. When you play with him, you really have an appreciation for
what he does on the ice. I don't think there's anybody better at both
ends of the ice than him.... He's on the top of everybody's list. I'm
sure of it."</TE>
<TE>   The defense and goaltending have allowed only five goals in five
games. LeClair leads the Olympics with six goals. Brett Hull is
getting off a tournament-high 4.6 shots a game and has scored three
times.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout its five games, Canada progressively managed to impose
its style of play despite the international playing rules and wider
rink. That means dumping the puck into the offensive zone, then going
in to knock someone over and get it back.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks differs from that philosophy, saying, "I think the game is
a little more profound than that."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Doug Weight said, "We're going to try to control the
tempo. We're going to play our game the way we've been playing the
whole tournament. That's very disciplined as far as staying out of
the [penalty] box, as far as playing our system. We want to hit too,
but we want to make sure we're not going out of our way, we're not
wasting energy, we're not creating openings behind us on this big
ice."</TE>
<TE>   All of the NHL connections make the relationships a little too
intimate for genuine hatred. Richter, for example, will try to keep
Ranger teammates Eric Lindros and Theo Fleury from scoring. Brooks
scouts for the Penguins, which makes Lemieux his boss.</TE>
<TE>   But anything goes for the gold-medal game.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my Mario Lemieux bobble-head doll; I'm sticking pins in
his hip," Brooks joked.</TE>
<TE>   Roenick discounted statements attributed to him that the Americans
would kick Canada's butt. "To say that we're going to kick their
[butt] would be crazy," Roenick said. "But the desire to is there."</TE>

<LD>Gold Medal Men's Hockey Game, today, noon, Channel 4.</LD>
<LD>   Matchup at a Glance</LD>
<LD>   Even though the players from Canada and the United States were
raised on a North American style of hockey, they'll have to contest
this game under international rules. Among the differences are a rink
that is 15 feet wider than the NHL and the absence of the red line,
which allows for longer passes.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. has been more willing and able to play the wide-open
style, while Canada took a little longer to adjust. The United States
wants to keep the puck moving freely. Canada would rather use its big
forwards such as Eric Lindros to bump and bruise the Americans.
Canada has more scoring threats on its roster, while the United
States has relied primarily on the line of John LeClair, Mike Modano
and Brett Hull.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Coach Herb Brooks is worried about Canada's Mario Lemieux on
the power play. Both teams can be confident in their goaltenders,
since America's Mike Richter (New York Rangers) and Canada's Martin
Brodeur (New Jersey Devils) have won the Stanley Cup.</TE>

<TE>   Confusing Allegiances</TE>
<TE>   SALT LAKE CITY--Mario Lemieux and Steve Yzerman are U.S. citizens,
but they will play for Canada today in the Olympic gold medal men's
hockey game.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Hull was born in Belleville, Canada, and Adam Deadmarsh was
born in Trail, Canada, but both forwards will play for the U.S. in
today's game at the E-Center.</TE>
<TE>   Confusing, eh?</TE>
<TE>   To sum it up:</TE>
<TE>   Many Canadian-born hockey players who play for U.S.-based teams
become U.S. citizens, primarily for tax reasons.</TE>
<TE>   But Lemieux and Yzerman can't switch allegiances and play for the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   According to International Ice Hockey Federation rules, "Once a
player has represented a country in any IIHF championship or in the
Olympic competition or in the qualification to these competitions he
will not be eligible to represent another country."</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux and Yzerman played for Canada in international tournaments
when they were in junior hockey, before they reached the NHL level,
so they can't switch jerseys.</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh was born in Canada to a Canadian father and American
mother, giving him dual citizenship. He played for Canada's under-18
team in the 1992 Pacific Cup championship but never played for the
junior national team. He joined the U.S. junior national team in 1993
and has been a mainstay ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Hull, son of Bobby Hull, also was born in Canada but had dual
citizenship because of an American mother. Brett tried out for the
Canadian junior team but was told he wasn't good enough, yet the U.S.
hockey program found room for him and was delighted to have him. He
played for the victorious U.S. team in the 1996 World Cup of hockey
and again represented the U.S. at the 1998 Nagano Olympics.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Is the Olympic bobsled/luge/skeleton run, adjacent to the Olympic
90K/120K ski-jumping stadiums, obsolete today, the last day of the
2002 Winter Games?</LD>
<LD>   Will some big real estate developer come through here and take
what was Utah Olympic Park, attracting about 25,000 people a day for
the last 16 days, and make it into Super Large Ski Run and Condo
City? Will the residents sit around their fireplaces high up on the
mountain 12 years from now and tell their kids that they are sitting
on the very spot that Jim Shea started on his gold-medal skeleton
run?</LD>
<LD>   Nope.</LD>
<TE>   The Utah Olympic Park will remain just that. It will be a place
for U.S. athletes to slide and jump and train and prepare for Winter
Games in places not even decided yet. No bulldozers, no cul de sacs,
no condos.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Perelman of Los Angeles, the venue chief at Utah Olympic
Park, said the mountains where he has spent the last month are part
of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's legacy to Utah.</TE>
<TE>   "It cost $62.5 million to build," Perelman said, breaking that
down with $33 million for the luge and bobsled runs, $21 million for
the ski jump areas, $2.5 million for the lodge and training pool area
and $6 million for park infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   "It was paid for by the state of Utah, then the state was
reimbursed by the Salt Lake Committee," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Such situations are often overlooked in the plus columns when
aftermath stories about Olympic host cities are written.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be a steady stream of World Cups here, in both
sliding and the ski jumping," said Perelman, who was the press chief
for the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. "In fact, the 2005 World
Championships in luge are already set for here. That was the thought
right from the start. That was why this was built."</TE>
<TE>   The only luge and bobsled runs reasonably available before Salt
Lake's for U.S. athlete training were in Lake Placid, N.Y., and
Calgary.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be open year-round," Perelman said, pointing out that
the sliding runs are refrigerated and usable during all but the
hottest times of the summer, and ski aerialists work hard here all
summer on ramps that send them hurtling into a 750,000-gallon
swimming pool. The ski jumpers do warm-weather training on plastic
runs.</TE>
<TE>   The Joe Quinney Sports Center on the premises, used during the
Games for press facilities, will become a winter sports museum.</TE>
<TE>   And, perhaps best of all, people who watched the Games and got
hooked on the sliding sports will be able to try them after the
Games. There will be a special run, not as long and not as high and
not as hard, but a real bobsled run, nevertheless. The cost for a run
probably will be around $40, or just slightly more than one of those
Olympic berets that are all the rage.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: After the Games, Utah Olympic Park will be open
year-round for the training of U.S. athletes. A special run will be
available at a cost of about $40 for daredevils who want to
experience a real bobsled run.</CP>

<HD>Baldwin: Russians 'Anti-American'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The president of the U.S. Olympic Committee accused Russia's top
Olympic official Saturday of waging an "anti-American" campaign in a
string of protests over results at the Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   Vitaly Smirnov, an International Olympic Committee executive board
member, was upset by a poorer-than-expected medals showing by
Russia's athletes and turned his displeasure to the host country,
USOC President Sandy Baldwin said from Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   Asserting that "every Games needs a little drama," Baldwin said
the protests from such countries as South Korea and Canada over
figure skating, skiing and speedskating were part of the Olympics and
helped attract attention around the world. Russia's protests,
including an aborted threat to pull out of Salt Lake City, were
another matter, she said.</LD>
<TE>   "I haven't felt, except for the Russians, that it was
anti-American," Baldwin said. "That was unfortunate. It doesn't have
anything to do with the athletes, the referees or the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we may be seeing a lot of Mr. Smirnov's feelings about a
shift in fortunes of Russian athletes."</TE>
<TE>   A visibly upset Smirnov denied Baldwin's accusation. "It's not
anti-American," he said. "No! The answer is no! She's wrong!"</TE>
<TE>   Smirnov said he had personally praised U.S. management of the
Games, including telling Mitt Romney, the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee chief, that these were among the best Games he has seen in
31 years on the IOC. "The Russian team and myself have nothing, no
criticism, for the United States or SLOC," Smirnov said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An "angry" International Ice Hockey Federation President Rene
Fasel issued a statement in response to Russia Coach Slava Fetisov's
comments after Russia's 3-2 loss to the United States in the
semifinal game. Fetisov said: "It is designed to have finals between
Canada and USA" and added that the NHL officials used in the Games
were prone to bias toward North American teams.</TE>
<TE>   Fasel responded: "You can always criticize certain calls and try
to prove that the referee made a mistake in a certain situation. But
when a coach of a team tries to undermine and question the integrity
of the Olympic ice hockey tournament, it makes me very angry and
disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   When Fetisov's comments were relayed to United States Coach Herb
Brooks, Brooks said: "My friend Slava said that? That's preposterous.</TE>
<TE>   "I know they might be feeling a lot of pressure. I heard their
president called Slava. And all I know is, Bush hasn't called me."</TE>
<TE>   Marie-Reine Le Gougne, the French judge in the middle of the
figure skating controversy, said she was under pressure from Canada,
not her country's federation, before voting for the Russians in the
pairs final, the New York Times reported. Le Gougne, in an interview
from her lawyer's office in Salt Lake City, said that despite the
pressure she voted with her "heart and soul."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Chambers, president of the Canadian Olympic Assn.,
dismissed the claims, also made last week in an interview with the
French sports paper L'Equipe. Le Gougne said sheblamed the French
federation only because she lost her ability to fight accusations
being made by other skating officials. "I was so mixed up in my mind,
I had trouble thinking properly," Le Gougne told the Times</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Heiden, vilified by some in the media for saying he had
turned down a chance to be one of the final torchbearers in the
opening ceremony because he hadn't been chosen to light the caldron,
believes he got an unfair rap.</TE>
<TE>   Heiden, who swept five men's speedskating gold medals at the 1980
Games, told the Salt Lake Tribune he believed NBC had dictated the
choice of who would light the caldron, tainting the honor. He said he
had been offered a chance to be among the first to carry the flame in
the U.S., after it arrived in Atlanta from Greece in December, but
couldn't leave his medical practice on short notice. "I told them,
just kind of joking, that I wanted to be the last," Heiden said.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>It was going to be great. It was going to be Britain. It was going to
be a news conference to discuss the medal-winning achievements of
Great Britain's Olympic team at these Salt Lake Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   It was going to happen in 15 minutes, we were informed via
loudspeaker.</LD>
<LD>   Five minutes later, the same loudspeaker announced that the news
conference had been canceled.</LD>
<TE>   Great Britain Olympic officials must not have been able to find
their athlete.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, that's not totally accurate. Thursday, a plucky group of
Scottish lasses brought home the women's curling gold, Great
Britain's first Winter Olympics gold medal since 1984 and Torvill and
Dean. But you know what they say about curling: It's curling. Wasn't
an Olympic sport until 1998. Didn't quite measure up to Torvill and
Dean turning the Sarajevo ice into a steam bath, now did it?
Broomsticks or "Bolero"--you make the</TE>
<TE>   call.</TE>
<TE>   But Alain Baxter winning the bronze in Saturday's men's slalom,
that was something to get excited about. The British and Alpine
skiing--they go together like Eddie the Eagle and ski jumping. Before
Baxter, the Brits had never medaled in skiing. Oh-for-78 years, that
was the extent of the great Britain drought. It would have been
longer, but the Winter Olympics didn't debut until 1924. For the
British ski program, it has been all downhill from there.</TE>
<TE>   Typical of the British, and their history with the sport, team
officials nearly booted Baxter off the squad before his historic
race. Reason: a bad hair day.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, lives in Aviemore, and can
often be seen at the lodge wearing a kilt, causing Austrian skiers to
nickname him "the Highlander." Characteristically, he arrived Salt
Lake with his hair dyed blue and white in the shape of the Cross of
St. Andrew, the design on the Scottish flag.</TE>
<TE>   The British Olympic Assn. considered the dye job a political
statement--a violation of the International Olympic Committee
charter--and threatened to remove Baxter from the ski team unless he
got rid of the flag. Earlier in the Games, the BOA made the same
demand of Baxter's cousin, halfpiper Lesley McKenna, who was forced
to remove the Scottish flag from her attire before she could compete.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter complied and dyed out the white cross, maintaining his
Olympic eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   Even more surprising, he outskied Norway's double-gold medalist
Kjetil Andre Aamodt, all the Austrians and U.S. double-silver
medalist Bode Miller, who fell once and missed a gate and eventually
finished 25th.</TE>
<TE>   A fitting finale for the U.S. Alpine team, which underachieved all
U.S. competitors here, including Michelle Kwan. The American
Alpiners, despite having Picabo Street and Daron Rahlves and Kristina
Koznick and the home-slope advantage, won only two medals in Salt
Lake.</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, both of them were won in stirring fashion by
the charismatic Miller.</TE>
<TE>   On the downside, that's only one more Alpine medal than Great
Britain won.</TE>
<TE>   But let us not dwell on the negative. Besides, as you know, we're
a bobsledding nation.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. broke a 46-year medals drought in bobsled Saturday when
its sleds won the silver and the bronze in the four-man competition.
Compared to a 78-year drought, 46 years doesn't sound like much.
Canada has gone longer between hockey gold medals. But the four-man
bobsled bronze medal won by the United States in 1956 is two years
older than Prince Albert of Monaco, the Grand Old Man of the Bob, who
nearly caused an international incident when his sled capsized
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Headline of the day:</TE>
<TE>   Monaco's Prince Overthrown;</TE>
<TE>   Off With His Sled</TE>
<TE>   But the Prince walked away from the crash, along with the other
three members of his crew. For the record, the Royal Sled finished
28th, equaling the Prince's four-man finish in Nagano. In three
previous Olympics, in two-man and four-man bob, the Prince has never
placed higher than 25th.</TE>
<TE>   You might call him the official fantasy camper of the Winter
Olympic Games, but that, of course, would be disrespectful. There are
strict rules of decorum here. According to the Salt Lake 2002
information system, Monaco's ace bobsled driver "should be referred
to as 'Prince Albert,' 'Prince Albert of Monaco,' 'The Prince of
Monaco' or 'Sir.' He should not be referred to in interviews or news
stories by his given name 'Albert Grimaldi.'"</TE>
<TE>   Let me rephrase that earlier reference then.</TE>

<HD>Rogge Defends Giving Duplicate Medals</HD>
<DH>IOC president says he has no regrets in controversial
decision to award golds to Canadian skating pair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said Saturday
the IOC has no regrets in ratifying the move to award duplicate gold
medals last week to a Canadian pairs figure skating duo.</LD>
<LD>   He also said that though the Salt Lake Games have been marked by a
number of judging controversies, the IOC has not been and will not be
inundated by complaints by those aggrieved by sporting results in
Games past and present.</LD>
<LD>   "We have not opened a can of worms," said Rogge, a Belgian
overseeing his first Games as IOC president.</LD>
<TE>   He was elected last July to an eight-year term, replacing Juan
Antonio Samaranch of Spain, IOC president for 21 years.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge, an IOC member since 1991, said, "When we took the decision,
we knew that could trigger during these Games more gripes. I'm not
naive. We knew that."</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, not to award duplicate golds to Canadian skaters
Jamie Sale and David Pelletier "would have been profoundly unjust,
because there had been manipulation of the judgment."</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier finished second in the pairs skating event,
which ended Feb. 11, behind Russia's Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was reconsidered after a French judge told
International Skating Union officials she had been "pressured" to
vote for the Russians, although she later recanted.</TE>
<TE>   After intense media pressure and an appeal from the Canadian
Olympic Assn., the IOC's policy-making executive board accepted an
ISU proposal to award Sale and Pelletier golds as well.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the South Korean delegation has protested a decision
last Wednesday in which short-track speed skater Kim Dong-Sung, who
had appeared to win the men's 1,500-meter race, was disqualified
after impeding the progress of U.S. skater Apolo Anton Ohno on the
final lap.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno, who crossed the finish line second, was awarded the gold
medal</TE>
<TE>   The Lithuanian delegation protested the judging of the free dance
portion of the ice dancing competition, claiming an Italian couple
and a Canadian couple had not been penalized--as stipulated in the
rule book--for falling.</TE>
<TE>   And Russian officials have protested a variety of decisions, in
figure skating, cross-country skiing and men's hockey. Rogge took the
extraordinary step of sending a letter to Russian President Vladimir
Putin saying there is no evidence of a campaign against Russian
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Olympic Committee President Sandra Baldwin--who at these
Games was also made an IOC member--said she intends to take up in the
coming weeks the case of boxer Roy Jones Jr., who took silver behind
a South Korean boxer at the 1988 Seoul Games.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, most ringside observers believed, had won the fight easily.
Later, according to minutes from the IOC's board minutes, boxing
judges at those Games admitted receiving $300 per day from South
Korean officials, purportedly for meals and taxi rides.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is extremely clear," Rogge said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever is done in good faith but is the result of human error,
athletes have to accept that.</TE>
<TE>   "Where there is corruption, flawed judgments, then we will act.
But that has to be substantiated and proved, absolutely, yes."</TE>
<TE>   He explained: "In tennis, you have a line call and they say the
ball is out of the line but you can see on the replay that the ball
is in, you don't change the result of the match. You have to accept
that. That's our point of view."</TE>
<TE>   He also said the IOC intends over the next few months, after the
glare of the Games spotlight has faded, to consult with officials of
the skating union and other international sports federations, to see
"how we can defuse in the future the protestations."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Rogge said, "You can not just turn a blind eye on
people getting emotional. Much of it is really non-objective [but] we
have to try to make sure that things work in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "People have short memories," he said, adding that controversies
over judging are "not a new fact. It's probably going to happen in
the past. It's probably going to happen in the future."</TE>
<TE>   He also recalled that as an Olympic athlete--he was a sailor for
the Belgian team in three Summer Games--he was on hand for the "whole
controversy about the basketball match in 1972," the Soviet Union's
51-50 victory over the United States.</TE>
<TE>   That result took place after referees had put three seconds back
on the clock though the game had appeared to be over--with the United
States ahead, 50-49.</TE>
<TE>   Given three extra seconds, the Soviets threw a pass the length of
the court, which led to a layup and victory.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the outrage that lingers in many quarters from that
game 30 years ago, Rogge drew a comparison to the controversies that
have erupted at the 2002 Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   "This here was peanuts compared to that," he said.</TE>

<HD>It's an 'Oh, Canada!' Day</HD>
<DH>Canadians capitalize on U.S. miscues and win gold medals in
men's 500 and 5,000 relay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The catch phrase for two weeks at the Olympics has been, "Ohno? Oh,
yes!"</LD>
<LD>   But Saturday night at the Delta Center, short-track speedskating
star Apolo Anton Ohno's name was prophetic for the U.S. team.</LD>
<LD>   It was "Oh, no!" in the men's 500-meter race, from which Ohno was
disqualified, then "Oh, no!" again in the 5,000 relay, when Rusty
Smith stepped on a lane block and fell, leaving the Americans to
finish fourth, a lap behind the winning Canadians. Italy won the
silver medal, China the bronze.</LD>
<TE>   Smith, of Sunset Beach, gave the U.S. its only bright spot,
earning the bronze in the 500.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here twice now," he said. "I'm finally coming away with
something I'm really excited about."</TE>
<TE>   The big winner Saturday was Canada. Marc Gagnon and Jonathan
Guilmette won gold and silver in the men's 500, then joined
Francois-Louis Tremblay and Mathieu Turcotte in successfully
defending Canada's title in the 5,000 relay.</TE>
<TE>   Yang Yang (A) of China won her second gold medal of the Games in
the women's 1,000, having earlier won the 500. She finished ahead of
1,500 winner Ko Gi Hyun of South Korea and her unrelated teammate,
Yang Yang (S).</TE>
<TE>   Ohno, for whom some had predicted four medals, is not going home
to Seattle empty-handed, however. He won a gold and a silver in
earlier races.</TE>
<TE>   "My first Games and I got two medals," he said. "There's nothing
better than that.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we were in perfect position [in the relay]. No doubt in
my mind, if we wouldn't have went down and I was there in the end, I
could have done some magic. But that's how it is. We hit a block or
something and it just happened. Short-track is such a crazy sport."</TE>
<TE>   Ohno got as far as the semifinals in the 500, then was
disqualified for obstructing Japanese skater Satoru Terao. Starting
from the inside position, Ohno got off slowly and dropped to third,
behind Guilmette and Terao. Moving inside on the last lap, Ohno
tangled with Terao and sent him spinning into the boards.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good call," Ohno said. "I tried to set up the Japanese
skater on the inside. I tried to hold the track and ran out of room."</TE>
<TE>   With Ohno on the sideline, Smith went immediately to the lead in
the 500 final and held it through four laps. Then, with half a lap
left, Gagnon passed him for the lead, and Guilmette got by him at the
finish line. The U.S. team was skating second in the relay, behind
Canada, when Smith went crashing into the boards.</TE>
<TE>   "I hit a block and got caught between my boot and the ice," he
said. "I had no part of my blade on the ice. It was completely my
fault.... I apologized to all [of my teammates]."</TE>
<TE>   No apology necessary, said Dan Weinstein, who skated the relay
with Smith, Ohno and Ron Biondo.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us understand that this can happen," Weinstein said. "We
can't be mad."</TE>
<TE>   The night's activities ended a tumultous Olympics for Ohno and the
short-track team.</TE>
<TE>   In qualifying for the 5,000 relay final 10 days ago, Smith and
South Korean Min Ryoung collided, Smith keeping his feet but the
Korean sliding hard into the boards and requiring a visit to the
hospital. The South Koreans were disqualified for interference and
the race was re-skated.</TE>
<TE>   Then a week ago, Ohno, apparently on his was to victory, was
involved in a spectacular four-skater crash at the finish of the
1,000-meter race.</TE>
<TE>   With Ohno leading coming out of the last turn, Li Jiajun of China
went down, taking South Korean Ahn Hyun Soo, Turcotte and Ohno with
him.</TE>
<TE>   Australian Steven Bradbury, who had been fifth, collected a free
gold medal and Ohno had the presence of mind to scramble across the
finish line for the silver. Ohno suffered a gash in the melee and
needed stitches to close the cut in his inner thigh.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later, however, he won the 1,500 in another
controversial finish.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno finished behind South Korean Kim Dong Sung but threw his
hands in the air just before the finish and Kim was disqualified for
cross-tracking, stepping in front of another skater, Ohno in this
case.</TE>
<TE>   A Korean protest was ultimately rejected and early Saturday, an
appeal to an arbitration panel also was turned down.</TE>
<TE>   In preliminary racing Saturday, defending Olympic champion
Takafumi Nishitani of Japan missed qualifying for the 500 final when
he finished third in a quarterfinal.</TE>

<HD>Gold or Bust ... and Bode Busts</HD>
<DH>Miller goes off the course in second slalom run. French go
1-2, with Britain getting its first Alpine medal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEER VALLEY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Fans flocked here Saturday to see history made in the men's slalom,
and history, indeed, was made.</LD>
<LD>   It was not rendered by home-country favorite Bode Miller, though.
It was etched in soft snow by a Scot, with a brogue, skiing for Great
Britain.</LD>
<LD>   It was a strange day from the start-gate get-go, one that ought to
be spliced and forwarded to "Alpine's Funniest Home Videos."</LD>
<TE>   Seventy-seven racers started the day, but only 34 finished, the
other 43 skiing up, down and off the course in a series of almost
comical pratfalls and face plants.</TE>
<TE>   Among those left standing in the end were France's Jean-Pierre
Vidal, who won the gold medal with a two-run time of 1 minute 41.06
seconds. He was joined on the podium by countryman Sebastien Amiez,
who finished 0.76 back to claim the silver and Alain Baxter of Great
Britain, who fell into the bronze with a time of 1:42.32.</TE>
<TE>   The bronze was Great Britain's first ever in Alpine skiing.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter was not even in the finish area when he received the good
news.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the tent, taking my boots off," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller? He was trying to become the first U.S. Alpine skier to win
three Olympic medals but ended up 25th, sandwiched between a
Bulgarian and a Latvian.</TE>
<TE>   Did we say it was a strange day?</TE>
<TE>   Miller was faced with an intriguing choice after finishing second
in the first run.</TE>
<TE>   Vidal held an 0.36 advantage over Miller, but after that the
bottom dropped out of the field. Miller had almost a second lead over
Benjamin Raich, third after the first run.</TE>
<TE>   Miller could have raced conservatively and probably assured
himself of his third silver medal in the Salt Lake Games.</TE>
<TE>   Playing it safe, though, has never been Miller's style. This guy
once skied out of 17 consecutive World Cup slaloms.</TE>
<TE>   There was no doubt in his mind or anyone else's about the options:
Bode was going for the gold.</TE>
<TE>   He bolted out the start gate on his second run and lasted only
about 20 seconds on course when he caught an edge and went off
course. Miller recovered to make the gate, but his second-run time of
1:04.42 was only good enough to beat a Turk and a Hungarian.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going for it," Miller said. "I was going for gold. That's
the way it is."</TE>
<TE>   Did Miller consider playing it safe?</TE>
<TE>   "If I could guarantee myself silver if I backed off, maybe I would
have done that," he said. "But there are no guarantees. If I had
backed off and come down in fifth place, I would have been really
disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Miller began the race as the No. 2 slalom skier in the world but
didn't even end up as the top American finisher.</TE>
<TE>   That honor went to Chip Knight, who finished 12th. Erik Schlopy,
who withdrew from his specialty, the giant slalom, after a poor first
run, finished 14th in the slalom.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Rothrock, who earned a second-run start in the top group after
racing to 15th place from the 34th start position, had a great
opportunity to crack the top 10 or better, but he skied off course on
his second run.</TE>
<TE>   Rothrock wasn't alone.</TE>
<TE>   An unusual set of snow conditions made for a treacherous track.
Temperatures in Deer Valley were warm, in the 40s, which made it
difficult for racers to dig their edges into the snow.</TE>
<TE>   The race became a matter of survival. Five of the top 15 racers in
the second run failed to finish, and that's not counting Miller, who
skied off course but eventually made his way down.</TE>
<TE>   Vidal, skiing last, knew the race was his to lose after Miller
faltered. Vidal had a huge time advantage from his first run. Even
though he skied tentatively and gave a lot of that time back, Vidal
still won the gold with relative ease.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he will take all the risks," Vidal said of Miller. "And
that if he is in the finish corral it will be very difficult for me,
that I must do the best I can. But when I knew that he is out, if I
just finish the race, it is OK."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday marked the first time the French have finished first and
second in an Olympic Alpine event since Jean-Claude Killy won gold
and Guy Perillat the silver in downhill at the 1968 Grenoble Games.</TE>
<TE>   The story of the day, though, belonged to Baxter, who made Alpine
history for Great Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter, a native of Aviemore, Scotland, also became the first
skier to deliver his post-race news conference in a thick brogue.</TE>
<TE>   "The course was ripple-y," he said. "Your skis were chatterin'.
You couldn't get a good carve in thar like it had been all week."</TE>
<TE>   Baxter, who said he once ranked 180th in the world, grew up
watching Alpine races on television broadcasts known as "Ski
Sundays."</TE>
<TE>   Baxter's luck began to change when the British ski team brought in
hired guns, the Austrians, as coaches. Baxter eventually moved his
full-time training to the Alps.</TE>
<TE>   "I pretty much live in Austria in the winter," he said. "We pretty
much train like the Austrians."</TE>
<TE>   The work paid off. Alain's brother, Noel, finished in 21st in
Saturday's race, and Gareth Trayner, another Brit, ended up 23rd.</TE>
<TE>   All three Brits can go home and brag to their friends that they
defeated the great Bode Miller in the men's Olympic slalom.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter said he figures he'll get a fine reception back home.</TE>
<TE>   "The Scots are known to party, you know?" he said.</TE>

<LD>Speedskater Clara Hughes of Canada, not to be confused with U.S.

<TE>   Although Hughes was part of an unlikely medal-winning trio
Saturday, the three women had in common the ability to tap reserves
they didn't know they had. Together, they produced a splendid finale
to the Salt Lake City Olympic speedskating competition, in which
eight world records were set in 10 races at the lightning-fast Utah
Olympic Oval.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Pechstein of Germany won her fourth gold medal and seventh
medal overall by blazing around the track in 6 minutes 46.91 seconds,
breaking the 90-minute-old world record set by Gretha Smit of the
Netherlands. Pechstein, who turned 30 Friday, trailed the pace Smit
had set in clocking a time of 6:49.22 but blazed through the final
lap in 32.05 seconds to win her country's eighth speedskating medal
of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   The Netherlands (three golds, five silvers), Germany (three golds,
three silvers, two bronzes) and the United States (three golds, one
silver and four bronzes) led the speedskating medals table.</TE>
<TE>   Pechstein had finished second to compatriot Anni Friesinger in all
five World Cup 5,000-meter races this season, but Pechstein's time,
recorded in the next-to-last pair, was too fast for the fast-fading
Friesinger to match.</TE>
<TE>   Friesinger finished sixth, leaving Pechstein the second
speedskater to win gold medals in three consecutive Olympics at the
same distance. Bonnie Blair of the U.S. accomplished that feat by
winning the 500 in 1988, 1992 and 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely watched [Smit] race. She had a really, really good
time," Pechstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I needed to reduce my personal best by nine seconds. And I
knew I had to race consistently, or I would die, and I was able to do
that."</TE>
<TE>   Smit, a marathon skater in her skating-crazy homeland, skated in
the first pair Saturday and broke the 11-month-old world record of
6:52.44 set by Germany's Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann.</TE>
<TE>   A recent and somewhat reluctant convert to the sport, Smit
pronounced herself delighted to take home a silver medal, even though
training for the Games had gotten her fired from her job at a flower
shop.</TE>
<TE>   "I really have to think about this," she said. "Maybe I can do
this for one more year."</TE>
<TE>   But before deciding anything, Smit planned to party, no doubt with
help from some of the several hundred orange-clad fans who rang
cowbells and cheered for all the competitors and greatly enlivened
the cavernous building.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never had an Olympic dream," the 26-year-old from Rouveen
said through a translator. "I did marathons and just for the fun of
it, I tried this. I'm happy it's been working out well for me. I was
happy to get into the team. I never expected to get any medals. I was
just hoping to end up high in the ranks."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes made history by becoming the first Canadian and fourth
athlete from any nation to win Olympic medals in the Summer and
Winter Games. By finishing third in 6:53.53, she added a bronze medal
to the two bronze medals she won in cycling races at the 1996 Atlanta
Games.</TE>
<TE>   The other Summer-Winter medalists were Christa Ludwig-Rothenburger
of East Germany (speedskating and cycling), Eddie Eagan of the U.S.
(boxing and bobsled) and Jacob Tullin Thams of Norway (ski jumping
and sailing).</TE>
<TE>   "This is pretty new to me," said Hughes, a competitive cyclist for
11 years and a member of Canada's national speedskating team for two
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe being new in the sport, you don't really set limits for
yourself, and that's what I do. I don't have certain lap times in my
head. I just go out and work hard."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes also said her cycling training gave her the mental and
physical toughness to right herself after a slip nearly derailed her
with about three laps to go.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Oh no!'" she said. "But because I have a cycling
background, I was able to get back into it.... I think when I had
that slip, I was kind of getting comfortable. I started fighting
again. I guess I was lucky I had that slip."</TE>
<TE>   Pechstein began her gold-medal streak in the 5,000 at the 1994
Lillehammer Games and extended it at the 1998 Nagano Games, where she
edged compatriot Niemann-Stirnemann by 0.04 of a second.
Niemann-Stirnemann didn't compete here because she's expecting a baby
later this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really happy to get gold in the 3,000, so I didn't want to
put pressure on myself to win the 5,000," Pechstein said through a
translator. "I'm really happy to have done that, and I want to
celebrate."</TE>
<TE>   Pechstein celebrated for a few moments after her race by wearing a
red and black wig while taking a victory lap around the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to skate [laps] of 32 seconds, and I did it pretty
well," she said. "It was an amazing race."</TE>
<TE>   Neither of the two U.S. entrants was a factor, although Catherine
Raney set a U.S. record with a time of 7:06.89, good for ninth place.
Annie Driscoll was timed in 7:35.23, last among the 14 skaters who
finished.</TE>

<LD>Ganbat Jargalanchuluun didn't win any medals. In fact, he didn't make
it out of his preliminary heat in short-track speedskating Saturday
night, but he left the Games with two distinctions.</LD>
<LD>   At 15 years, 225 days old, the Mongolian athlete was the youngest
in these Olympics. And at 15 letters, his last name tied for the
longest in the Games with that of Finnish curler Markku
Uusipaavalniemi. The 500 was Jargalanchuluun's only event, which
means he waited two weeks to skate for 52.225 seconds, which was
about nine seconds slower than the two qualifiers in the heat.</LD>
<LD>   She Probably Can Afford a Really Nice Car</LD>
<TE>   Now that Sarah Hughes has the gold medal in figure skating, she
can start working on another big goal.</TE>
<TE>   Getting her driver's license.</TE>
<TE>   The 16-year-old from Great Neck, N.Y., hasn't had time to get her
license yet, not with all the hours she spends in training. She also
has a three-hour round-trip commute each day to the rink in
Hackensack, N.J., with coach Robin Wagner doing the driving.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner hopes her chauffeuring days will be over soon.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really hoping she learns to drive," Wagner said, laughing.
"That's the next thing we're working on."</TE>
<TE>   This Miracle Stuff Can Get Awfully Tiring</TE>
<TE>   United States Coach Herb Brooks has spent more time this month
discussing the 1980 "Miracle on Ice" U.S. hockey team than the
current group he's trying to guide to another gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   It was especially inevitable when the United States played Russia
a week ago in their first Olympic meeting in America since 1980 and
then again Friday when they met on the 22nd anniversary of the famous
game.</TE>
<TE>   After a tense finish, Brooks was asked if the last 10 minutes of
the game "reminded [him] of anything."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, the last 10 minutes," Brooks said. "No disrespect. I know
where you're going with that. I don't want to go that way."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is that Brooks is seen as the main link to
that team.</TE>
<TE>   When that was brought to his attention the other day, Brooks joked
that he could be the link "only if Mike Eruzione lets me," a
reference to how Eruzione continues to live as the Man Who Scored the
Winning Goal Against the Soviets.</TE>
<TE>   Men Are From Mars, Women Are Different</TE>
<TE>   Ray Bennett, a King assistant coach, was more than a dispassionate
spectator Thursday when he watched on television as Canada defeated
the United States to win the women's hockey gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett was an assistant coach in the Canadian women's program for
two years, helping the Canadians win the gold medal in the World
Championships in 1997 and the silver in the Winter Olympics four
years ago at Nagano, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "It was quite emotional for me to watch," Bennett said of the
Canadians' 3-2 victory at Salt Lake City. "I played no part in it,
but I know how I felt after losing [to the U.S. at Nagano] and to see
them win was really quite gratifying."</TE>
<TE>   Coaching the women was a great experience, Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, the girls were really receptive to almost
anything," he said. "That was the big thing I noticed, coming from
men's hockey. A lot of guys carry forward some baggage with them from
past coaches. 'We used to do it this way'--that sort of thing,
whereas the girls were always very receptive to what you were trying
to introduce, teaching-wise and tactical-wise.</TE>
<TE>   "They just said, 'OK, if you want us to do it that way, we'll do
it that way.' That's a treat."</TE>
<TE>   Can't Trust the Swiss to Stay Neutral</TE>
<TE>   It's no secret the Swiss love their bobsledders, but they finally
crossed the line.</TE>
<TE>   The six Swiss flags and four fan club banners in the stands lining
the track at the start were fine. It was that big black-and-gray
banner that caused a minor stir. On the front was Rigi Tresorbau AG,
a company that just happens to be a sponsor for Swiss driver Martin
Annen.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take Salt Lake officials long to spot it.</TE>
<TE>   "No commercialism is allowed," said Bryan Hendrickson, a sports
supervisor at Utah Olympic Park. "We don't want them to take
advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, long scarves were draped over the company name.</TE>
<TE>   After Winning Gold, They Could Clean Up</TE>
<TE>   After the men's and women's gold-medal curling matches--Norway won
the men's title, Great Britain the women's--both champions were asked
if their victories would boost the sport's profile in their
homelands.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always going to be people who slag off the sport," said
British captain Rhona Martin. "Hopefully, the TV coverage will help
raise the profile back home."</TE>
<TE>   The women's gold--Britain's first Winter Games gold in any sport
in 18 years--did cause a bit of a stir. Prime Minister Tony Blair
praised the Olympic champions, and Martin and her crew also are being
offered a deal to endorse a floor cleaning product.</TE>
<TE>   Brooms, get it?</TE>
<TE>   Funny, but That Sounds a Lot Like an Excuse</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, Erik Schlopy was more than Bode Miller's European
roommate. He was a proven success in the World Cup, a skier poised to
be a hometown hero in the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Illness wiped out his training in the late summer and fall, and
his World Cup season was awful. After his 14th-place finish in the
men's slalom Saturday, he sought out his family for hugs of
consolation as tears streamed down his cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to make excuses," he said. "As far as the facts go,
I had mono, I had bronchitis. I didn't get to train."</TE>
<TE>   Net Surfing Could Be Next Olympic Sport</TE>
<TE>   NBC is getting great TV ratings, and NBCOlympics.com and
Olympics.com have experienced record traffic through the first 16
days of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, 3.1 million visitors logged onto the sites, a
single-day high for these Games, eclipsing the 2.5 million unique
users visiting the site one day earlier.</TE>

<KH>WHERE ARE THEY NOW?</KH>
<HD>Killy Has Touch of Achiever</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1968, at the Winter Games in Grenoble, France, after the host
nation's Jean-Claude Killy had already won two gold medals in skiing,
he went for a third in the slalom.</LD>
<LD>   The race was held in fog, mist and shadows.</LD>
<LD>   The sun shone through only once--during Killy's first run, which
was good enough to put him in first place.</LD>
<TE>   That's where he ended up, winning his third gold medal. And that's
the kind of life he has had. Killy remains one of the world's most
visible symbols of the urbane, sophisticated achiever.</TE>
<TE>   Acclaimed Olympic filmmaker Bud Greenspan recently named Killy to
his list of 10 greatest winter sports athletes of all time.</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1943, Killy grew up in the resort town of Val d'Isere in
the French Savoy Alps. He dropped out of school at 15 to join the
French ski team.</TE>
<TE>   The three gold medals he won at the Grenoble Games, when he was
not quite 25, catapulted him to worldwide fame. At those Games he won
skiing's triple crown--the slalom (which he won on a
disqualification), giant slalom and downhill.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. sports marketer Mark McCormack, watching Killy in Grenoble,
called him "an Arnold Palmer in ski pants."</TE>
<TE>   Now a successful businessman, Killy is on the board of directors
of multi-national corporations such as Coca-Cola and Rolex.</TE>
<TE>   And since 1995, he has been a member of the International Olympic
Committee. He also has had a long association with the Tour de France
cycling event.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, he co-chaired the Winter Games in Albertville, France. It
was there, he said, that he learned to fly a helicopter--because the
venues were so spread out, Killy needed to maintain contact with the
mayors of 17 towns in seven valleys.</TE>
<TE>   He served as vice president of what the IOC calls a "coordination
commission" for the Salt Lake Games--that is, the IOC's liaison and
inspection committee.</TE>
<TE>   He is president of the IOC's coordination commission for the next
Winter Games, in Turin, Italy, in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Looking ahead four years, he said, "I'm very confident. I'm as
confident as I was four years ago here--when everyone was down on
Salt Lake City."</TE>

<KH>PACIFIC 10 ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Oregon Rises to Top Behind 33 by Jones</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frederick Jones scored 33 points as Oregon moved into sole possession
of first place in the Pacific 10 Conference with a 90-84 victory
against Washington on Saturday night at Eugene, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   Luke Jackson had 23 points for the Ducks (20-7, 12-4), who
finished 16-0 at home for the first time since 1937-38. The victory
also put Oregon in position to claim at least a share of its first
Pac-10 title next week when it travels south to play USC on Thursday
and UCLA on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Huskies (10-17, 4-13) did make it tougher than most of
Oregon's previous 15 opponents, as Doug Wrenn scored 27 points and
Curtis Allen had 18.</LD>
<TE>   Oregon led by as many as 13 points before the Huskies stormed back
in the final two minutes to cut an 80-71 deficit to 82-79 after Wrenn
scored on a put back and free throw.</TE>
<TE>   Jones then made his fifth three-point basket of the game, and the
Ducks made five of six free throws in the final minute to seal the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Washington outrebounded Oregon, 39-34, and shot 54% from the
field. Oregon shot 44%.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies were done in by 25 turnovers, and they made only half
of their 22 free-throw attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Washington also didn't have an answer for Jones, a senior guard
playing in his final home game. Jones made 12 of 20 shots, including
five of seven three-pointers, and had seven rebounds and five steals.</TE>
<TE>   With 4:16 to play in the first half, Allen made a three-pointer
and free throw to put Washington ahead, 35-34.</TE>
<TE>   But Luke Ridnour made a three-pointer and Jackson scored five
consecutive points to put Oregon back up, 42-37, a lead the Ducks
extended to 51-45 by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State 91, Washington State 55--Brandon Payton scored 21
points as the Beavers won at Corvallis, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Ricci and J.S. Nash each had 14 points for Oregon State
(12-15, 4-12), which scored a season high.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Kelati scored 17 points and Marcus Moore had 14 to lead the
Cougars (5-20, 1-16), who have lost 18 of their last 19 games.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State got to within 11 in the second half, but the
Beavers scored the next 17 points to open a 66-38 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Payton, a transfer from UC Santa Barbara, matched his season-high
record by making eight of 10 shots, including four of five
three-pointers. The Beavers made their first 20 free throws before
David Lucas missed at the line with 2:56 left.</TE>

<HD>Felix Wins 50-Meter Sprint in a Hurry</HD>
<DH>Track and field: L.A. Baptist junior is timed in 6.43 in
one of several impressive efforts at Sports Arena.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIME STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Junior Allyson Felix of North Hills Los Angeles Baptist High blasted
to an outstanding 6.43 to win the girls' 50-meter dash in the Los
Angeles Indoor Invitational at the Sports Arena on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   The time ties her for seventh-best on the all-time indoor list--a
place she shares with Marion Jones. Last year, Felix won the 100 at
the state meet and last summer won the World Youth Championships at
Hungary, establishing her as the best under-17 short sprinter in the
world.</LD>
<LD>   Finishing behind Felix were Long Beach Poly sophomores Shalonda
Solomon (6.50), Jasmine Lee (6.56) and Chanda Picott (6.69).</LD>
<TE>   Rachel Viau of Arroyo Grande won the girls' pole vault at 12 feet
6 to equal her personal best from last year and break the meet record
of 12-2, set in 1995 by former national outdoor record holder Melisa
Price of Kingsburg. The effort tied her for 10th-best on the all-time
national indoor list.</TE>
<TE>   "I was expecting to go 13-0 but this sure is a nice birthday
present," said the Oral Roberts-bound Viau, who turned 18 on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In the distances, Jenny Aldridge of Santa Rosa Maria Carillo,
Jenna Timinsky of Encinitas San Dieguito, Billy Nelson of Taft in the
Central Valley and Jeremy Johnson of Albuquerque Manzano were
impressive.</TE>
<TE>   Aldridge won the mile in 4:54.19, the second-fastest time in the
nation this year.</TE>
<TE>   Timinsky, who has signed with UCLA, won the 880 in 2:13.6 to rank
fifth on the yearly national indoor list.</TE>
<TE>   "I almost didn't come to the meet," Timinsky said. "I've been sick
all week, but I said 'what the heck.'"</TE>
<TE>   Nelson won the two-mile in 9:14.5, a time that ranks fifth
nationally indoors. Johnson handed the best California had to offer,
winning the boys' mile in 4:18.16.</TE>
<TE>   In the shotput and discus, which were held at USC, Noah Bryant of
Carpinteria won the boys' shotput with a nation-leading outdoor mark
of 63-51/2. Junior Billie Jo Grant of Arroyo Grande won the girls'
discus at 145-1.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Corbett of Huntington Beach Edison cleared 15-0 on his first
attempt to win the pole vault and upset defending state champion Mike
Landers of Merced Golden Valley, who also cleared 15-0 but did so on
his second attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Kaylene Wagner of Goleta Dos Pueblos won the girls' high jump at
5-8 for the fourth-best indoor jump in the nation this year.</TE>
<TE>   Jerred Morgan of La Quinta won the boys' discus at 178-2.</TE>

<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>The toughest job in sports is being a UCLA basketball fan.</LD>
<LD>   Have you taken to your bed with the covers over your head? Do you
break into a cold sweat when the opening horns trill out the first
chords of the fight song? Is your head about to bust open?</LD>
<LD>   Are you, UCLA basketball fan, happy that the Bruins upset
Stanford, 95-92, at Maples Pavilion on Saturday? Are you happy that
the Bruins scored 49 points in the first half against Stanford or
totally befuddled as to how the Bruins could score only 18 points
Thursday at California?</LD>
<TE>   Happy that the Bruins dominated Stanford with Matt Barnes watching
from the stands or furious that the full-strength Bruins were
dominated by Cal?</TE>
<TE>   Happy that the Bruins led the Cardinal by 20 with 5:20 left or
confused at how the Bruins led the Cardinal by only three at the end
of the game?</TE>
<TE>   Happy that your coach, Steve Lavin, saved himself again or
secretly disappointed that your coach didn't come home a beaten man,
a man who had finally lost his grip on this most holy job?</TE>
<TE>   Are you tired of this back-and-forth, good-and-bad,
infuriating-exhilarating basketball team? Or is this twice-a-week
adrenaline rush what you live for?</TE>
<TE>   Is it fun to guess whether Cedric Bozeman is going to play like an
All-American or a high school rookie? Is it exciting to wager with
your friends whether Jason Kapono will get 12 shots or three, whether
Dan Gadzuric will be active and dominating or stagnant and invisible?</TE>
<TE>   Do you have any hair left, UCLA rooters? Or have you pulled it all
out because a team with so much talent, a team with Andre Patterson
and Dijon Thompson, freshmen who can come into a game against the No.
10 team in the country, under circumstances of extreme desperation
and great tension, and see them play as if they didn't have a care in
the world and see them nonchalantly make layups and three-pointers
and jump shots and grab huge rebounds and play intense defense, and
yet you have a team which can play so badly so often?</TE>
<TE>   Your coach says, "I'm proud of our kids and the bounce-back and
resilience they showed. That's been the mark of our program, at least
during our tenure. Hopefully it can continue like this. We lost three
of four playing poorly, but today we played well, other than the
late-game turnovers and some missed free throws and some poor time
and score and clock management."</TE>
<TE>   And don't you just want to run screaming from the building? Or
not? It's good that the Bruins can bounce back. But is it good to
have the need to be resilient as the mark of the program?</TE>
<TE>   Analyze the rest of that sentence. Good or bad? Happy or sad?
Thrill to the good performances or bust a blood vessel from all those
late-game turnovers and missed free throws?</TE>
<TE>   Or how about this? Your coach says: "We dribbled less today and
our four-out, one-in-motion offense is starting to come together.
We've worked on it all year, but we hadn't used it in games until a
little bit in the second half against SC and in the second half of
'Nova and for most of the Arizona game. But we didn't use it much
against Arizona State and Cal."</TE>
<TE>   Dribbling less is good. But don't you want to ask someone, anyone,
about this "four-out, one-in-motion offense," and how, if it's been
practiced all year and it worked so well against Arizona and
Stanford, then why wasn't it used against Arizona State or Cal or in
the second half of the USC and Villanova games? Don't you want to
grab Lavin and beg him to tell you, the loyal UCLA fan, what has
taken so long? Why is it Game 27 and the offensive experimenting is
still going on?</TE>
<TE>   Well, take heart, UCLA fans. You're just ahead of the college
basketball curve. Lavin and the Bruins got you there first. Take a
look around.</TE>
<TE>   The more teams play, the less you know.</TE>
<TE>   Not only do you not know what's going to happen next with your
team, you have no clue about what you've just seen.</TE>
<TE>   To paraphrase college basketball's top TV analyst Billy Packer,
who was courtside here Saturday, "Who knew? Wow. How'd that happen?"</TE>
<TE>   Packer meant, of course, who knew UCLA could score so much, play
so well; and wow, we almost forgot how fast UCLA can give up a
20-point lead so quickly and easily. But you can take Packer's
amazement to another level.</TE>
<TE>   How do you figure out the Pac-10?</TE>
<TE>   As of today, the only Pac-10 teams with momentum are Cal, with big
wins over USC and UCLA; and Stanford, No. 10 in the country not much
longer, with two home losses and a baffled coach asking, "What's
wrong? I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Except for Kansas, Duke and Maryland, the NCAA tournament motto
might be: "The more they play, the murkier it gets."</TE>
<TE>   Trends? You've got to be kidding.</TE>
<TE>   Momentum? Yeah, right.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday Lavin called the Bruins "a work in progress." He said
that with a straight face, as if he believed it. Do you believe that,
UCLA fans? You might as well.</TE>
<TE>   You might as well start chanting "Four in, one out," and "bounce
back, bounce back." Those were the Lavin talking points Saturday. He
repeated each phrase at least four times during his postgame
chattering.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever that means, you, the UCLA fan, and all the rest of us,
might as well believe it means, "Who the heck knows what's happening
next. But it'll be fun watching. Won't it?"</TE>

<DL>PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>John Rocker will be flinging bodies instead of baseballs when he
makes his big-screen debut as a homicidal maniac.</LD>
<LD>   The controversial Texas Ranger reliever is playing a
slasher-killer in a movie called "The Greenskeeper," Ranger spokesman
John Blake confirmed Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The film, produced by Atlanta-based Ghost Man on Third
Productions, was shot in October in Senoia and other golf courses in
Georgia.</LD>
<TE>   It follows a 20-year-old assistant greenskeeper who gathers
friends for a country club birthday party, according to the movie's
Web site. A killer dressed as a greenskeeper and armed with golf
course tools crashes the party and disposes of naughty teens.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Greene, one of the film's producers, said they called Rocker
after a friend of a friend mentioned he knew the pitcher. Rocker was
the consummate professional, Greene said, showing up on time and
knowing all his lines.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a crazy persona and the character needed a wild streak,"
Greene said.</TE>
<TE>   Rocker's remarks on racial, ethnic and sexual minorities in a
magazine article led to his suspension for two weeks in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Blake said the Rangers have no problem with Rocker's role in the
movie.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a lot of concern," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers are planning a May premiere in Atlanta.</TE>

<LD>Had it gone better for Kasey Keller, he might have helped create a
little bit of American soccer history today at the Millennium Stadium
in Cardiff, Wales.</LD>
<LD>   That's where the English League Cup final will be played between
Blackburn Rovers and Tottenham Hotspur.</LD>
<LD>   Starting in the nets for Blackburn will be former UCLA and current
U.S. national team goalkeeper Brad Friedel. Watching from the bench
for Tottenham, in all likelihood, will be Keller, Friedel's rival for
the U.S. starting spot in the World Cup this summer.</LD>
<TE>   The symmetry--not to mention oddity--of having America's best two
goalkeepers at opposite ends of the field in an English cup final
will not have been overlooked by Glenn Hoddle, the former England
national team coach now in charge of Tottenham.</TE>
<TE>   But Hoddle has yet to show the sort of faith in Keller that Rover
Coach Graeme Souness has long shown in Friedel, first at Galatasaray
in Turkey and now at Blackburn.</TE>
<TE>   Since moving to Spurs from Rayo Vallecano in Spain last summer,
Keller has been unable to dislodge Scotland's Neil Sullivan and take
over as Tottenham's No. 1 goalie. He has started a few games but
hasn't made the position his own.</TE>
<TE>   And he can't understand why.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 32 years old and I'm not ready to be a No. 2 [keeper],"
Keller told Reuters before the U.S. team's 1-0 loss to Italy earlier
this month.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not an unknown quantity and I just want an explanation on why
I'm not playing."</TE>
<TE>   Depending on how you look at it, being a backup at Spurs is or is
not helping Keller's World Cup chances.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, while Keller is on the bench, Friedel is playing
week in and week out against top-flight strikers in the English
Premier League. That will give him a huge edge in game sharpness by
the time Korea/Japan '02 rolls around in May.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, being indispensable to Blackburn means that
Friedel, 30, is not free to join the U.S. whenever the national team
has games. As a result, Keller gets the call.</TE>
<TE>   In the recent CONCACAF Gold Cup, won by the American team, Keller
had four shutouts in five games, giving up only one goal. In
addition, he saved one penalty kick against South Korea and two
against Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Arena, the U.S. coach, is correct when he says there is
virtually nothing to choose between the keepers in terms of ability.
Both are exceptional.</TE>
<TE>   Friedel has more national team experience, with 73 games for the
U.S. compared to Keller's 55. That's mostly because Friedel was more
readily available, whereas Keller, from Lacey, Wash., has been
playing in Europe since leaving the University of Portland in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Keller was No. 2 behind Tony Meola at the Italia '90 World Cup and
was the starter, ahead of Friedel, at the France '98 World Cup.
Friedel was Meola's backup at the USA '94 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Who will start this summer still is very much up in the air.
Keller has been called in for the U.S. team's next two matches,
against Honduras on Saturday in Seattle (1 p.m., ESPN) and against
Ecuador on March 10 in Birmingham, Ala. Tim Howard of the New
York/New Jersey MetroStars will be Keller's backup.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from Keller, the only other European-based players selected
by Arena were defender Gregg Berhalter and winger Eddie Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Brandi on the Rocks</TE>
<TE>   When the U.S. women's national team leaves for Portugal this week
to take part in the ninth annual Algarve Cup, it will do so without
two-time world champions and Olympic gold and silver medalists Brandi
Chastain and Mia Hamm.</TE>
<TE>   The 33-year-old Chastain, who led the San Jose CyberRays to the
first Women's United Soccer Assn. championship last year, injured her
left knee while playing in a WUSA World Stars match in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., on Feb. 10 and has undergone surgery.</TE>
<TE>   She will be sidelined for up to a month, but should be available
to the U.S. team by the time it plays Finland on April 27 at San
Jose's Spartan Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   That game, scheduled for 7 p.m. on ESPN2, is part of a
doubleheader that also will feature the CyberRays against the
Carolina Courage at 4:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Also missing the Portugal trip, and scheduled for left knee
surgery is Hamm, the world's all-time leading goal scorer, who plays
for the Washington Freedom. She will be out at least eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. will open Algarve Cup play Friday against Sweden, then
plays England on March 3 and Olympic champion Norway on March 5.</TE>
<TE>   In six appearances in the tournament, the U.S. has won it only
once--in 2000, when it defeated Norway, 1-0, in the final on a
penalty kick by Chastain.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico Encounters</TE>
<TE>   Far more impressive than World Cup-bound Mexico's 2-1 loss to
Yugoslavia in Phoenix was the fact that 42,300 fans showed up for the
game at Bank One Ballpark on Feb. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico continues to draw as many or more fans in the U.S. as the
U.S. team itself. That's one reason the Anschutz Entertainment Group
has acquired the marketing rights to the Mexican national team for
all its games in this country through 2006.</TE>
<TE>   First up under the AEG banner will be a Mexico-Bulgaria game in
San Diego on March 13.</TE>
<TE>   After that, according to Soccer America magazine's Ridge Mahoney,
will be a U.S.-Mexico game at Invesco Field in Denver on April 3.</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy Update</TE>
<TE>   The long-delayed groundbreaking ceremony for the Galaxy's new
20,000-seat stadium, as well as the training complex for all U.S.
national teams, will take place Tuesday morning on the campus of Cal
State Dominguez Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Taking part will be defender Alexi Lalas, who is unsigned, and
goalkeeper Kevin Hartman, who has recently been linked in trade talk
with the Dallas Burn....</TE>
<TE>   Newly acquired Guatemalan striker Carlos Ruiz and American forward
Chris Albright have started well with Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Albright scored three goals and Ruiz two as the Galaxy defeated
Magallanes, 3-1, tied Colo Colo, 2-2, and shut out Universidad de
Chile's reserves, 2-0, in the first three games of the team's current
trip to Chile.</TE>

<LD>Talk of bubbles bursting, fence-sitting, scoreboard watching and
Cinderella is beginning to heat up around the country as March
Madness gets a late-February head start.</LD>
<LD>   With some conference tournaments beginning this week, the workload
for members of the NCAA selection committee will increase daily until
Selection Sunday on March 10.</LD>
<LD>   And in trying to make sense of who belongs and who doesn't--aside
from the 31 automatic bids earned by conference champions--it figures
to be quite a debate over the next two weekends.</LD>
<TE>   The Mid-American Conference, for example, might be in a pinch if
Kent State, as expected, wins the conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   If that happens, it would leave Bowling Green and Ball State, with
RPIs of 64 and 70 this week, possibly off the bracket. Could the
committee justify three teams from a conference ranked 11th best
based on RPI?</TE>
<TE>   Bowling Green is 21-6 overall and 11-5 in conference, which rates
ahead of Ball State at 17-9 and 10-5. But can Ball State's early
success in Maui--victories over Kansas and UCLA--be dismissed so
easily after everyone was ready to anoint the Cardinals as this
year's darlings?</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine faces a similar issue in the West Coast Conference,
which is rated 16th in the RPI. Should a team like San Diego win the
conference tournament, Pepperdine--despite its victories over UCLA,
USC and Gonzaga--probably would be finished. Aside from winning the
conference tournament itself, a Gonzaga victory might ensure
Pepperdine's ticket in.</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of teams that probably need to win their
conference tournament or risk seeing their bubble burst. Here are a
few interesting cases:</TE>
<TE>   * Valparaiso (22-7 overall, 91 RPI) and its strength-of-schedule
rating of 221 leave the Commodores uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   * UC Irvine (20-8 overall, 89 RPI) faces a scenario similar to
last season's, when the Anteaters were 25-4 at selection time, didn't
win the conference tournament and had to settle for the NIT.</TE>
<TE>   * Creighton (19-7 overall, 57 RPI) and Southern Illinois (23-6, 55
RPI) are the class of the Missouri Valley, but if neither wins the
conference tournament, one of them could be out.</TE>
<TE>   * Memphis (22-7 overall, 59 RPI) leads the National Division of
Conference USA, but the Tigers lack the quality wins the committee
loves. In fact, this month alone, there have been losses to Alabama
Birmingham, Charlotte and Houston.</TE>
<TE>   As far as Cinderellas are concerned, watch for these: Central
Connecticut State (23-4 and the nation's longest win streak at 15);
Hampton (22-5 and the only other team besides Kansas still undefeated
in conference play); and Western Kentucky (25-3 and a healthy Chris
Marcus pose potential problems for any opponent).</TE>
<TE>   Declawed: Northwestern may have played itself out of a possible
at-large bid by being embarrassed at home against No. 16 Illinois,
56-41.</TE>
<TE>   In a game the Wildcats (16-10, 7-7) needed to impress committee
members, they lost their way by shooting 29% from the field and
failing to make any of their 17 three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I've ever seen a team [of mine] not make a
three-pointer," Northwestern Coach Bill Carmody said.</TE>
<TE>   He was right. Before Saturday, it had never happened in 18 seasons
as an assistant and head coach at Princeton and during his two
seasons at Northwestern.</TE>
<TE>   Butler did it: Butler set a single-season record with 25 victories
after its 85-61 win over Illinois Chicago and is now 25-4.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs broke the record set by last season's team, which
finished 24-8.</TE>
<TE>   But on the other hand, Butler can't afford a fall in the Horizon
League tournament starting Friday in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   The committee doesn't look highly on such numbers as an RPI of 68
and a strength-of-schedule rating of 249.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure: At least Brian Jackson doesn't play at Duke,
Kansas, Indiana or anywhere Bob Knight is coaching.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson rejoined Oregon State on Friday two days after leaving the
program. One of his original reasons for leaving was that he said he
felt too much pressure from fans--you know those Corvallis Crazies.</TE>
<TE>   So what convinced Jackson to return?</TE>
<TE>   "Listening to the game [Thursday] night on the radio was
terrible," Jackson said. "You don't really realize how much you miss
something until you don't have it."</TE>
<TE>   The same way fans never forget.</TE>
<TE>   Tigers roar: It turned out to be a lost weekend for Yale in a
72-63 loss to Pennsylvania at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   With a chance to take control of the Ivy League race, the Bulldogs
could hardly muster a bark. On Friday, Yale was dismantled by
Princeton, 59-46.</TE>
<TE>   And after Princeton's 73-47 victory over Brown on Saturday, it
left Yale (17-9, 9-3) half a game behind in second place. Princeton
is 14-9 overall and 9-2 in league.</TE>
<TE>   Yale is seeking its first Ivy League title since 1962.</TE>
<TE>   "The Yale game we had to win, but this game wasn't any less," said
Princeton's Ray Robins. "We came in with the same mentality
[Saturday], that we had to win this game to stay in charge of our own
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   But talk of being in front with three games left never surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   "We just know if we win each game, we'll end up in first," Robins
said.</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the day: Missouri's Clarence Gilbert scored 40
points, including a Big 12 record 12 three-point baskets in a 96-83
victory over Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the weak: Southeast Missouri State, not long ago an
NCAA Cinderella, scored 18 first-half points, shot 30.6% from the
field and lost to Austin Peay, 80-47.</TE>

<DH>Bruins Put Recent Failure Behind Them for Another Rousing
Victory at Stanford</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>Having no discernable memory can be a plus.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA's listless loss 40 hours earlier? Never happened.</LD>
<LD>   Dropping five of the last seven road games? No recollection.</LD>
<TE>   Facing Stanford without suspended forward Matt Barnes, the team's
third-leading scorer and second-leading rebounder?</TE>
<TE>   Matt who?</TE>
<TE>   UCLA bounced carefree into Maples Pavilion and lived in the
moment, crashing Stanford's senior day and the probable last home
game of stellar junior Casey Jacobsen, winning, 95-92, Saturday in
front of a sellout 7,391.</TE>
<TE>   The final score was close only because Stanford made a three-point
basket at the buzzer, capping a 31-point Cardinal blitz over the last
3:41. But UCLA answered with poise, making 17 of 20 free throws
during the same stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Astonishingly, this is the third year in a row UCLA has won here.
Of course, the Bruins don't care to remember.</TE>
<TE>   "The past doesn't matter," guard Billy Knight said. "We just threw
all our little strategies out the window and played like it was a
pick-up game."</TE>
<TE>   It is also the seventh consecutive week the Bruins, 18-9 overall
and 10-6 in the Pacific 10 Conference, have gone 1-1. But who is
going to recall that if they put together a winning streak now?</TE>
<TE>   They remain in the hunt for a share of the regular-season title
with only home games against first-place Oregon and Oregon State
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully we don't go home and lose," said forward Jason Kapono,
who had 22 points on eight-of-12 shooting and five assists. "Maybe we
can get a streak going instead of this win-lose-win-lose thing."</TE>
<TE>   Continuing the toughness and intelligence displayed against
Stanford (17-8, 10-6) would help. UCLA had 13 offensive rebounds in
the first half while building a 49-40 lead and shot 66.7% in the
second half while building on and then protecting the margin.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin freshmen played with the savvy of veterans and Bruin
veterans played with the exuberance of freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   "Our coaches stressed to play freely and have fun," Kapono said.
"We felt [bad] the last couple of days and went out today like we
were starting over."</TE>
<TE>   Freshman guards Cedric Bozeman (11 points, three assists and no
turnovers), Dijon Thompson (13 points, one turnover) and Ryan Walcott
(six free throws in the last 2:09) were solid. So was freshman
forward Andre Patterson, who played 11 minutes in Barnes' absence and
had four points, four rebounds and no turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Senior center Dan Gadzuric posted his third double-double in the
last four games with 15 rebounds, 12 points, four assists, three
blocked shots and only one turnover. He also helped contain Stanford
center Curtis Borchardt, who scored 17 points but made only five of
11 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "They collapsed down the middle with their zone defense and we
couldn't find any passing lanes," Borchardt said. "That's OK if we
are making threes, but they didn't fall."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford launched a school-record 42 three-point tries, making 14.</TE>
<TE>   "They invited us to shoot jump shots and we couldn't make them,"
said Jacobsen, an NBA prospect who was three for 11 from long range
and seven for 19 overall, scoring 24 points.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA employed the 1-4 motion offense that worked well in a victory
over Arizona nine days ago.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't run any set plays," said Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery, although he wouldn't have noticed if the Bruins had.
Montgomery spent the game badgering the officials and was called for
a technical foul seconds after Knight made a three-point shot at the
buzzer ending the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono made the foul shots before the second half began,
stretching UCLA's lead to 51-40. Stanford soon cut the margin to
five, but with seven different players scoring, UCLA embarked on a
22-7 run and led, 75-55, with 5:35 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford went to a full-court press and began fouling on every
UCLA possession, eventually producing a tense moment. Cardinal guard
Chris Hernandez made a three-pointer with 50 seconds left and an
offensive foul by Kapono on the inbounds pass led to two free throws
by Jacobsen, cutting the lead to 89-83.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez stole the ball from Knight in the backcourt, but the
UCLA guard remained aggressive on defense, altering Hernandez's
errant layup attempt. Walcott ended up with the ball and made two
foul shots with 37 seconds left to stretch the margin to eight.</TE>
<TE>   Watching intently was Barnes, who sat in the first row behind the
UCLA bench, exhorting the team and sticking his head into timeout
huddles. Throwing a forearm at Shantay Legans of California on
Thursday sidelined him with a one-game suspension, and he was reduced
to taking mental notes and providing his teammates with feedback
afterward in case their memories fail again.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'll keep this one in mind," Bozeman said. "This will
have to be the way we play from now on."</TE>

<HD>Trojans' Pac-10 Title Hopes Take a Hit With Embarrassing
83-64 Loss at Cal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>With USC seemingly hitting its late-season stride, Trojan Coach Henry
Bibby talked about how his team was beginning to smell victory. He
said nothing, however, about the odor the 20th-ranked Trojans would
emit at California Saturday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   USC stunk up the joint, playing one of its worst games of the
season and falling to the Golden Bears, 83-64, in front of 12,000 at
Haas Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   This less than 48 hours after the Trojans played perhaps their
best game of the year in pounding Stanford by 19 points.</LD>
<TE>   So what happened?</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't make shots," Bibby said. "We missed layups and you've
got to make the easy ones. I think we tried to do it ourselves
instead of as a team. We don't need any heroes."</TE>
<TE>   California, though, played the perfect villain to the Trojans, who
fell out of a first-place tie in the Pacific 10 Conference with the
loss.</TE>
<TE>   USC is 19-7 overall and 11-5 in the Pac-10, while California,
which swept USC for the fourth time in five years, improved to 20-6,
11-5.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon took sole possession of first place with a 90-84 victory
over Washington on Saturday. The Ducks are a game ahead of USC,
Arizona and Cal, with games at USC and UCLA remaining. Stanford and
UCLA are tied for fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Golden Bears,, USC looked lost offensively against a
much-taller opponent. The Trojans shot 33.8% from the field, their
second-worst percentage in Pac-10 play and third-worst all season.</TE>
<TE>   USC's trio of senior starters struggled, with power forward Sam
Clancy's run of 11 consecutive double-doubles coming to an end. He
had 11 points and six rebounds. Small forward David Bluthenthal had
eight points on three-for-10 shooting. Point guard Brandon Granville
finished with 12 points and eight assists but four turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "They collapsed down on Sam a lot and when we missed shots, maybe
we started playing too fast," Granville said. "I think we had guys
trying to lead by example, but we should have been more patient."</TE>
<TE>   The Bears, who beat USC on a last-second three-pointer at the
Sports Arena last month, didn't need any miracle baskets this time
around.</TE>
<TE>   Not with 6-foot-11 freshman Jamal Sampson harassing the 6-foot-7
Clancy into a four-for-16 shooting performance.</TE>
<TE>   "He made it a little tough for me," Clancy said. "He's so big with
those long arms, and it was hard for me to get off good shots."</TE>
<TE>   Sampson scored only seven points, but he had 10 rebounds, four
blocks and a steal in 28 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "He's so big, but he likes to pull out and hit jumpers," Sampson
said of Clancy. "You have to play him like a guard."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cal Coach Ben Braun: "It was our defense that let us win this
game. But give a lot of credit to Jamal Sampson. I think this game
demonstrated how hard it can be to stop him from getting to the
basket.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Jamal felt responsible for holding people down as this
team's defensive center."</TE>
<TE>   A first-half scoreless stretch of 8 minutes 15 seconds helped doom
the Trojans as well.</TE>
<TE>   A Granville three-point play tied the score, 24-24, with 10:52
remaining in the first half. But USC would miss its next 14 shots
while the Bears denied entrance passes to the post and embarked on an
18-4 run.</TE>
<TE>   A buzzer-beating Clancy three-pointer from the right wing seemed
to give the Trojans life entering halftime, the second three-pointer
of Clancy's career pulling them within 42-31.</TE>
<TE>   But Cal scored the first five points of the second half before USC
began showing some semblance of offensive continuity. Granville
sandwiched two three-pointers around a Bluthenthal basket, and after
Errick Craven converted a fastbreak layup at the 15:13 mark, the
Trojans were within seven, 48-41.</TE>
<TE>   But they would get no closer as they blew a three-on-one
opportunity when Craven and Dupree crossed signals on the break and
Granville threw the ball into the USC bench.</TE>
<TE>   A basket would have kept the Trojans within seven with more than
12 minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>   "That just summed up the game," Craven said. "It was just
horrible."</TE>

<HD>Waves Share Title With the Bulldogs</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It started off as senior night, turned into a three-for-all and ended
with Pepperdine sharing the West Coast Conference championship.</LD>
<LD>   Few people outside Malibu thought Pepperdine would have more than
a mediocre season, but there the Waves were Saturday, thumbing their
noses one final time at the preseason WCC coaches' poll that picked
them to finish fourth.</LD>
<LD>   Pepperdine set a school record with 17 three-point baskets,
drubbed Santa Clara, 96-58, and shared the WCC title with Gonzaga, a
74-55 winner against St. Mary's.</LD>
<TE>   The Waves (20-7 overall, 13-1 in the WCC) found out afterward that
they won a coin flip with Gonzaga (26-3, 13-1) to determine the No. 1
seeding for the WCC tournament, which begins Saturday at University
of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine will play Portland (6-22, 2-11) in the first round. The
winner of the tournament receives an automatic bid to the NCAA
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in front of 1,843 at Firestone Fieldhouse, Pepperdine
finished with its best conference record since going 14-0 in 1991-92.</TE>
<TE>   The fans said goodbye to seniors Cedric Suitt and Craig Lewis,
then watched junior Devin Montgomery and freshman Terrance Johnson
bury Santa Clara with a barrage of three-point shots on the way to a
47-33 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery finished with a career-high 26 points and set a school
record for three-point percentage in a game by making all six of his
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout the whole season, I knew I could do that. Fortunately,
it was tonight," Montgomery said. "I wanted to give the seniors a
good game. They deserve it."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson scored 14 points, making four of seven three-point
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Coach Paul Westphal made a case for the Waves as an
NCAA tournament team, regardless of the outcome of the WCC
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's any way they could keep us out," said
Westphal, in his first season at Pepperdine. "We won 20 games, played
the fourth-toughest schedule in the country and beat the No. 7 team
[Gonzaga]. I think any fair-minded person who looks at it says
they've got to be in."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Ross scored 11 points and was the only player with more than
seven points for Santa Clara (13-14, 8-6).</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Gonzaga 74, St. Mary's 55--Dan Dickau scored 12 of his 17
points in the second half as the Bulldogs clinched a share of their
fourth WCC title in five years before 3,411 at Moraga, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Ronny Turiaf added 13 points and 10 rebounds as Gonzaga (26-3,
13-1) won its 11th game in a row and 23rd of 24. Cory Violette had 14
points.</TE>
<TE>   Ethnie Stubbs scored 13 points to lead St. Mary's (8-19, 3-11),
which has lost 10 in a row to Gonzaga. Ross Benson added 11.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga, which has won at least 20 games in eight of the past nine
seasons, will finish with its fewest losses ever as a Division I
member. The Bulldogs were 19-6 in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 87, Loyola Marymount 71--Andre Laws scored 32 points and
Jason Blair had 22 as the Toreros rolled to a victory at Gersten
Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   The Toreros (15-12, 7-7) held the Lions to one field goal in the
final seven minutes of the first half and led by as much as 22 in the
second.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions (9-19, 2-12) pulled within 11 on Andy Osborn's
three-point basket with 3:46 remaining, but could get no closer in
losing their 11th in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Osborn had 12 of his 14 points in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Philipp Czernin tied a career high with 17 points to lead the
Lions, who were outrebounded, 39-29.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 97, Portland 81--Darrell Tucker scored 34 points and
had 11 rebounds to lift the Dons at San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Shamell Stallworth added a career-high 24 points, including six
three-point baskets, for the Dons (13-13, 8-5), who made a
school-record 17 three-point shots. Casey Frandsen led the Pilots
with 30 points and Coky Rochin added 17 points and nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Dons will be seeded fourth in the conference tournament and
play San Diego in the first round.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After top-ranked Connecticut won its ninth straight Big East title
and moved within a game of an undefeated regular season, Coach Geno
Auriemma wanted his four seniors to let it sink in.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not easy, that's why I want these guys to appreciate it,"
Auriemma said after Connecticut beat Rutgers, 80-42, Saturday at
Piscataway, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   The four seniors to whom Auriemma was referring--Sue Bird, Swin
Cash, Tamika Williams and Ashja Jones--have posted a 129-9 record.</LD>
<TE>   Cash had 18 points, Bird had 14, and Jones and Williams shut down
the inside as the Huskies (29-0, 15-0) ran their regular-season
unbeaten streak to 37 games.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut, which has held opponents under 50 points in 18 of its
29 wins, will close out its regular season Tuesday at West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   The Scarlet Knights fell to 8-18, 5-10. The 18 losses are the most
for C. Vivian Stringer in a 30-year coaching career.</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Louisiana Tech 67, Tulsa 62--Ayana Walker had 19 points and
13 rebounds as the Techsters (20-4, 15-1) took the Western Athletic
Conference's regular-season title with a victory over host Tulsa
(16-11, 11-6).</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana Tech Coach Leon Barmore fainted and fell to the floor
midway through the first half after an argument at the scorers' table
over what he claimed was an incorrect possession arrow following a
jump ball. Barmore got to his feet seconds later and walked back into
the tunnel leading to the dressing room. He returned to the bench
after a few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   OTHER TOP 25 GAMES</TE>
<TE>   Stacey Dales scored 30 points and Rosalind Ross added 18, all on
three-pointers, as No. 3 Oklahoma defeated Missouri, 90-70, at
Columbia, Mo. Oklahoma (23-3, 13-2 Big 12) clinched the outright
regular-season conference title for the second consecutive year. ...
Jenny Roulier had 25 points for No. 11 Colorado, which beat
12th-ranked Kansas State, 79-58, at Boulder, Colo., for its 10th
victory in 12 games. Colorado is 20-8, 10-5 in the Big 12; Kansas
State is 22-6, 10-5. ... Angie Welle scored 21 points as No. 13 Iowa

<HD>Elisabeth Borgese, 83; Activist Was Thomas Mann's Daughter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elisabeth Mann Borgese, who had an eclectic career as an
environmentalist, political scientist and writer, has died. She was
83.</LD>
<LD>   The last surviving child of German writer Thomas Mann, Borgese
died Feb. 8 in a hospital in St. Moritz, Switzerland, of
complications from a lung infection. A resident of Halifax, Canada,
Borgese fell ill while on a skiing vacation in Switzerland.</LD>
<LD>   One of the organizers of the International Peace in the Oceans
Conference, Borgese was a strong presence at the first meeting in
1970 and at the 29 that have followed. The meetings helped bring
about the United Nations Law of the Seas Treaty in 1982.</LD>
<TE>   A strong proponent of aquaculture--the farming of seas, lakes,
rivers and oceans--Borgese also founded the Malta-based International
Oceans Institute, which was established to train people in developing
countries to manage ocean resources. The institute now has 20
branches around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Munich, she was the fifth of the six children of Mann and
Katia Pringsheim Mann. With the rise of Hitler, she immigrated with
her family to Switzerland, where she studied the piano and cello at
the Conservatory of Music in Zurich.</TE>
<TE>   Her father immigrated to the United States in the mid-1930s, but
she stayed in Europe to continue her musical studies.</TE>
<TE>   There she met Giuseppe Antonio Borgese, an Italian writer and
scholar who was 36 years her senior. They were wed in Princeton,
N.J., in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband took a post in Chicago teaching political science and
she took jobs as an editor and a researcher before joining the
Encyclopaedia Britannica as executive secretary of the board.</TE>
<TE>   Borgese immersed herself in her husband's view of world
federalism, which he had hoped would bring order to international
relations at the end of World War II. "That was really when I became
politically engaged," she told Macleans magazine some years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1952, the political intolerance fueled by McCarthyism
compelled the Borgeses to return to Europe. Her husband died shortly
after their return.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next decade, she raised the couple's three children while
expanding her interests. She edited an Italian-language cultural
journal for the Ford Foundation, and wrote short stories and a
feminist treatise titled, "The Ascent of Woman."</TE>
<TE>   She also dabbled in animal learning and at one time reportedly
taught her dog to play keys on the piano.</TE>
<TE>   From 1964 to 1979, she was a senior fellow at the Center for the
Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara. She later joined
the faculty at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where
she taught political science and later law.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by two daughters, a son, three grandchildren and
two great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>R. Chapman, 81; Wordsmith, Roget's Editor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most of us who have ever needed a good word have turned to an
alphabetical thesaurus and quickly found a list of possibilities more
impressive, more tantalizing or simply more accurate than the one our
feeble vocabulary had mustered. Then we wrote the sentence or filled
in the crossword and our search was over, done, finished, concluded,
terminated.</LD>
<LD>   Efficient? Yes. But not much fun, according to Robert L. Chapman,
a lexicographer and editor who spent three decades in the word
business.</LD>
<LD>   Chapman, who was 81 when he died Jan. 27 in Morristown, N.J.,
after a long illness, once described himself as a "faithful and
somewhat saucy servant of genius." He was referring to Peter Mark
Roget, who wrote the first Roget's International Thesaurus in 1852
and whose work Chapman revised more than a century later.</LD>
<TE>   Roget is famous for organizing the verbal universe by concept,
listing thousands of words under headings such as Space, Matter and
Intellect. Not intended as a mere synonym finder, Roget's thesaurus
was structured in a way meant to stimulate thought and chains of
association that may not have occurred to the user.</TE>
<TE>   Using Roget's thesaurus requires two steps: First you flip to the
voluminous index to find a word, then thumb to the referenced page. A
search for an alternative to "nice," for instance, would lead to the
category "Kindness, Benevolence," where the lengthy list of choices
ranges from "goodness" and "benignity" to "Christlike," "Robin Hood,"
"Lady Bountiful," even "flower power."</TE>
<TE>   But Roget, and Chapman, would not have wished you to stop there.
Maybe you would turn to the next, even longer category, called
"Unkindness, Malevolence." Perhaps there it occurs to you that the
idea you had in mind is better expressed in the negative, as in
"malignant," "ornery" and "cussed" or "corrosive," "sadistic" and
"invidious."</TE>
<TE>   Had you simply looked up "nice" in an A-Z word-finder, you might
not have made the journey to "devilish." That's the kind of discovery
that would have delighted Chapman.</TE>
<TE>   Alphabetical thesauri are so "jejune," Chapman once told the New
York Times. "You take one of those [alphabetical] books and you take
the head word and six or seven synonyms and that's all you get.
Whereas I would give you four or five times as many with many more
nuances and possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the difference," he said, "between roast beef and
Spam."</TE>
<TE>   Chapman took the roast beef and adapted it to modern tastes.</TE>
<TE>   A medieval literature expert who was an emeritus professor at Drew
University in New Jersey, Chapman edited the fourth edition of
Roget's, published in 1977. He added a few new categories--the first
additions in 125 years--and made enough money to indulge his passion
for sailing by buying a boat, which he christened Thesaurus.</TE>
<TE>   But he later felt he had not done enough to bring Roget's into the
modern age. When he was tapped to edit the fifth edition, he resolved
to leave a deeper imprint.</TE>
<TE>   He consulted a philosopher and a cognitive psychologist in
deciding which 325,000 words and phrases to include and in what
order. His rethinking of Roget's cosmos brought 30 new categories,
such as fitness and exercise, sports, environment, substance abuse
and computer science.</TE>
<TE>   He cast a stern eye on Roget's strict Aristotelian logic, which
had led the London physician-turned-lexicographer to scatter words
about the body among several classes. Under Roget's system, words
related to the circulatory system were found under the same heading
as pipes and conduits, for example, and those about the skeleton were
placed alongside joists and girders. Chapman unified the terms under
one roof: The Body and the Senses.</TE>
<TE>   Gender-conscious, he changed the name of the category Mankind to
Humankind. Acknowledging the different ways people perceive slang,
profanity and sexual language, he labeled racial epithets less
judgmentally, calling them "nonformal" instead of "derogatory," which
still warned users to proceed with caution.</TE>
<TE>   And he added lengthy lists, such as 104 names of environmental
pollutants, 222 phobias and 160 breeds of dogs.</TE>
<TE>   His nod to modern times was noticeable, too, in the 225 terms for
marijuana and 209 for various manifestations of intoxication. Words
such as "AIDS," "SCUD," "ziti," "prequel" and "fax" also made the
cut.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unlikely that Peter Mark Roget ever imagined most of the ...
synonyms featured in Robert Chapman's intriguing thesaurus," Los
Angeles Times reviewer Charles Solomon wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman was 72 when the fifth edition appeared in 1992, just a
year younger than Roget was when he published his first thesaurus.
"Chappy," as friends called him, took note of that, once saying that
he, like the 19th-century reference-book icon, was "a schematizing
senior citizen" with varied interests.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference I find is that he was much drier and more
humorless. I write poetry," Chapman said. "I think I'm more of a
romantic."</TE>
<TE>   Roget, the son of a Protestant pastor, also had a more genteel
upbringing. Chapman was the son of a typewriter mechanic. He worked
in factories and as a truck driver growing up in Huntington, W.Va.,
and was the first generation of his family to attend college.</TE>
<TE>   At the University of Michigan in the early 1940s, he took classes
with poet W.H. Auden. He also joined the Young Communist League and
helped unionize dormitory maids. He served in the Army Signal Corps
during World War II, which delayed the award of his bachelor's degree
until 1947. He returned to Michigan for his master's in 1948 and a
doctorate in 1952, then taught English at colleges in New York and
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   In 1942, he married the former Sarah Zeitz, who survives him along
with three sons and a brother.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman knew an eminent lexicographer at Michigan but did not
begin to work as one himself until 1960, when he was hired by Funk &amp;
Wagnalls as chief reference editor. His career there was brief. He
was nearly done editing his first dictionary when he was asked to
swear in writing that he had never belonged to the Communist Party.
Although he had quit the party when the Korean War broke out, he
could not sign the oath. So Funk &amp; Wagnalls demoted him on the title
page from editor to supervising editor.</TE>
<TE>   "I got 'disappeared,'" Chapman said, using a term heard in the
1950s when many writers and artists were blacklisted for their
political affiliations. (A few decades later, Chapman was the one who
added "McCarthyism" to Roget's, classifying it under the heading
"Misuse.")</TE>
<TE>   He found other dictionary work at Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston. Then,
in 1966, he joined the faculty at Drew, where he taught for the next
two decades.</TE>
<TE>   He was an early convert to computers, which made him unusual among
lexicographers, said Barbara Ann Kipfer, who was chosen by Chapman to
be editor of the sixth edition of Roget's, published last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Most lexicographers are afraid of computers, afraid their work
will get lost," she said. But Chapman had a computer in his office
that was linked to one at the former Bell Labs (now Lucent
Technologies) in New Jersey, where he could tap a database of
millions of words being collected from popular media.</TE>
<TE>   "I sifted, snifted, sorted and snorted and chose about 60,000
words to commend to anyone today in search of the right word," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The partnership brought him words such as "ecosystem" and
"yuppie," "crack" and "hacker"--all of which he introduced to
Roget's. He also edited the New Dictionary of American Slang and the
Thesaurus of American Slang finding new words in novels, newspapers,
magazines, and by just listening to people talk.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth edition of Roget's sold more than 500,000 copies. Its
success caused some colleagues to compare Chapman to the late
Clarence Barnhart, the enterprising American dictionary editor of the
mid-20th century who found commercial success by making definitions
simpler and more readable.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman could joust with the sharpest semanticists, but, like
Barnhart, he was no snob about language.</TE>
<TE>   "He had no qualms about putting new words in," Kipfer said. "He
just said, 'I'm pretty sure this will stick around in the language.'
That was a difference from other lexicographers in his age group, who
would really agonize over it.</TE>
<TE>   "He had some intuition and went with it, and he was right," Kipfer
said. "I doubt he ever got anyone writing to him saying you really
shouldn't have put that word in."</TE>

<LD>There is something you should know: The contents of your Voter
Information Pamphlet are incomplete. The pamphlet reveals [Senior
Deputy] Dist. Atty. Ron Bamieh's commitment to eliminating criminals
and protecting Ventura County's children, but omits the countless
hours Bamieh devotes to preventing crime and educating our children
outside the workplace.</LD>
<LD>   Bamieh's dedication to his community changed my life. When I chose
to join Buena High School's mock trial team, I had no idea what I was
getting into. At the first meeting, the tall booming figure at the
front of the room made it clear that he demanded dedication from his
mock trialers. "I ask of you only what I will give you in
return--100%," and I soon discovered that Bamieh wasn't kidding. As
coach of mock trial, his high expectations challenged me to immerse
myself in rules of objections and cross-examination. His infectious
enthusiasm for his work has inspired me to incorporate law and
education into my future career goals.</LD>
<TE>   As a coach, Bamieh invites students into his home for practices
during the summer and on the weekends during the school year. As a
teacher, he shares his knowledge of the law and the judicial system.
As a role model, he dedicates his spare time to studying a pretend
case after a long day at the district attorney's office. When
newspapers reported Bamieh's hard work in bringing Justin Merriman to
justice, they left out his tireless work after hours, devoted to
developing the youth of our community.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh has said that creating a safe neighborhood involves close
work between prosecutors and schools. His words are supported by his
actions. On March 5, I hope you join me in strengthening our fight
against crime and building the foundation for a better community by
voting Bamieh district attorney.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am proud that during my 24 years of service as district
attorney, Ventura County has achieved a reputation for being the
safest metropolitan area west of the Mississippi River. The current
election to choose my successor will be crucial to our ability to
maintain this enviable reputation. That's why I'm voting for Greg
Totten.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office employs more than 550 people and
has an annual budget of more than $40 million. Clearly, leading a
prosecutor's office of this size requires someone with experience in
successfully managing both people and budgets. But it requires much
more than this. Our next district attorney must also be a wise and
experienced lawyer who is respected by our trial and appellate courts
and local law enforcement personnel--an individual who puts the
protection of our community first. And most important, the next
district attorney must be a person of unquestioned character. The
office of the district attorney is a powerful one and if its leader
lacks integrity, there is great potential that it can be used for
unjust or personal causes.</TE>
<TE>   Totten, the chief assistant district attorney, has all the
qualities necessary to be a great district attorney. He has spent the
past 20 years helping to keep Ventura County safe. He is supported by
all of the police chiefs in the county, Sheriff Bob Brooks, the
deputy district attorneys' association, our county firefighters, our
deputy sheriffs, our cities' mayors--the list goes on and on. Why?
Because these people know both of the candidates. They have had the
opportunity to work with them, learn what they stand for and assess
their characters. These folks know that Totten is not just the best
qualified candidate, but the only qualified candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Totten has earned and deserves our support. Please join our local
law enforcers, community leaders and me in voting for Totten for
district attorney.</TE>

<HD>Carl Lindley, 83; Sign Touched Off Fad</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carl Lindley, who spurred the creation of a forest of signs that
became one of northern Canada's most popular tourist attractions,
died Wednesday in Chicago. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   He was a homesick Illinois soldier helping build the Alaska
Highway during World War II when he planted a hand-painted sign that
read "Danville, Ill., 2,835 miles" in Watson Lake, Yukon.</LD>
<LD>   The road was being constructed so that the United States could
defend Alaska from attack by Japanese forces. When Lindley erected
his hometown sign in 1942, he had no idea that thousands of
people--about 48,000 at last count--would follow him to plant what
Canadians believe is North America's largest "signpost forest."</LD>
<TE>   A row of 20-foot-high poles now stretches a village block in
Watson Lake. It is littered with everything from scribblings on
disposable pie plates to a yellow metal sign from Germany's autobahn.
The wall of signs is a top tourist draw in Canada's Yukon Territory.</TE>
<TE>   Lindley became a cult hero in Watson Lake, which became an
important staging post on the Alaska Highway. He and his wife,
Elinor, returned there for a visit on the 50th anniversary of his
unwitting founding of the signpost forest.</TE>

<HD>Westchester, Fairfax Again</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Westchester High players walked sullenly off the court Saturday night
after polishing off a game but overmatched Fremont team, 83-63, in a
City Section boys' basketball semifinal before a capacity crowd at
Los Angeles Southwest College.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps that's because the Comets realized the difficulty of the
task ahead. For the fourth time this season, Westchester will play
Western League rival Fairfax. And this time, the stakes will be
higher than ever.</LD>
<LD>   Top-seeded Westchester (27-2) will attempt to win its third
consecutive City title when it plays second-seeded Fairfax (29-3)
Saturday at the Forum. The Comets have won two of three meetings
against the Lions this season, but Fairfax prevailed, 66-62, when the
teams last played.</LD>
<TE>   "We aren't going to underestimate them again," vowed Westchester
guard Brandon Heath, who came off the bench to score 15 points
against fifth-seeded Fremont. "Last time, we weren't focused and
didn't play defense like before [in the previous victories]."</TE>
<TE>   The Comets were so focused against the Pathfinders (22-6) that
they forced turnovers on Fremont's first two possessions, forcing
Coach Sam Sullivan to use a timeout. The Pathfinders rallied from a
13-point first-quarter deficit to tie the score at 26 on Josh
Arnold's three-point play midway through the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But Fremont fell apart after being outscored, 7-0, to end the
first half.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester's Trevor Ariza led all scorers with 18 points and
Ashanti Cook added 15 as every Comet starter scored in double
figures.</TE>
<TE>   Shelvion Williams scored 13 of his team-high 15 points in the
fourth quarter for Fremont.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax 68, Dorsey 59--Evan Burns' back-to-back three-point
baskets midway through the third quarter turned a slim lead into an
11-point bulge that proved insurmountable as the second-seeded Lions
advanced to their first City final since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded Dorsey (19-7) kept the game tight early as Gary
Hamilton and Donald Wilson dominated the interior and LeBoise Gladden
knocked down jump shots. The Dons trailed by three points at halftime
after Fairfax's Fernando Sampson nailed a three-pointer just before
the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Lions (29-3) came out in the third quarter and converted
four three-pointers, three by Burns, en route to building a 15-point
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Burns, practically invisible on offense during the first half, was
sprung for open looks in the third quarter thanks to Fairfax's
improved ball movement.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-8 senior made another three-pointer in the fourth
quarter and finished with 15 points.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson scored 12 of his team-high 14 points in the first half for
Dorsey, which drew no closer than nine points in the fourth quarter.
Gladden had 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Bell scored 15 and Alex Bausley added 14 for Fairfax, which
seeks its first City championship since 1987.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Heath Slocum looked like he was back on the Buy.com Tour in the third
round of the Tucson Open on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Slocum, 28, shot an eight-under-par 64, matching the best score of
the week, to take a one-stroke lead into the final round.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel good going in tomorrow, because I'm where I want to be--on
top," Slocum said. "I feel like you play a good round [today] and,
you know, you're going to make someone have to beat you."</LD>
<TE>   Slocum made six of eight cuts last year after earning a promotion
to the big tour with three Buy.com Tour victories, but missed the cut
in four of five previous events this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think my game wasn't there with me," Slocum said. "I have
had bits and pieces of it show up at each event, but overall my
putting hasn't been very good."</TE>
<TE>   Slocum eagled the par-five second hole and had six birdies to
finish 54 holes at 16-under 200.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Magee (65) and second-round leader Brandel Chamblee (69)
were tied for second place.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ed Dougherty shot a seven-under 65 to take a two-stroke lead over
Bruce Fleisher after the second round of the Audi Senior Classic at
Naucalpan, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Dougherty, a two-time senior winner, had an eagle and six birdies
to reach eight-under 136 on the tree-lined Capultepec course that
stretches to 7,119 yards at an altitude of 7,800 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Fleisher, seeking his 15th victory in four years on the senior
tour, shot a 66. Gary McCord (66) and Walter Morgan (68) were at 140.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Karrie Webb, trying to become the first tour player to win the
same tournament five consecutive times, shot a four-under 68 for a
share of the Australian Masters lead at Gold Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Webb matched Germany's Elisabeth Esterl (71) at 10-under 206 after
three rounds at Royal Pines' East Course.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's Michelle Ellis (70) was two strokes back. Sweden's
Annika Sorenstam (71) and Italy's Silvia Cavalleri (72) followed at
209.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Owner David Milch hopes Val Royal can begin March the way Above
Perfection and Echo Eddie ended February.</LD>
<LD>   Above Perfection, a California-bred filly Milch purchased
privately in a five-horse package last spring, upset Kalookan Queen
in the $128,375 Las Flores Handicap on Saturday at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Then, a couple of hours later, Milch watched on television as
favored Echo Eddie dominated four opponents in the $100,000 Ken Maddy
Handicap at Golden Gate Fields.</LD>
<TE>   In six days, Milch hopes Val Royal, who hasn't run since his
impressive victory in the Breeders' Cup Mile Oct. 27, makes a
successful 2002 debut in the $300,000 Frank E. Kilroe Mile, one of
two graded stakes sharing the bill with the $1-million Santa Anita
Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   The 2-1 second choice in the field of four, Above Perfection
outbroke Kalookan Queen, the 2-5 favorite, surrendered the lead
briefly down the backstretch, but took over before a half-mile and
went on to win by a length in 1:083/5 for six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Corey Nakatani and trained by Darrell Vienna, who also
conditions Echo Eddie, the 4-year-old daughter of In Excess won for
the sixth time in eight starts. The Grade III Las Flores was her
first graded stakes win. Her only two defeats have come in Grade I
races. She lost by a neck to Xtra Heat in the Prioress at Belmont
Park July 4, then was fifth as the 2-1 favorite in the La Brea
earlier in the meet at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   "At this distance, I wouldn't want to trade places with anybody,
although I wouldn't mind if Xtra Heat stayed home," said Milch, who
had a third winner Saturday when Hideaway Cafe, part of the package
that brought him Above Perfection, earned his maiden victory in the
sixth race at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   "Darrell has done just a splendid job with this filly the way he
has gotten her to relax."</TE>
<TE>   In receipt of five pounds (122-117) from the favorite, Above
Perfection, who battled through 212/5 and 432/5 fractions Saturday,
certainly stepped up her performance over her win last month at
Golden Gate. The 1-2 favorite in the Orinda Handicap, she didn't seem
overpowering in winning by a length over Bullish Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Vienna shared that view, but Nakatani's declaration after the
victory left him feeling better.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought she looked pretty desperate up north, but in talking
with Corey, he said she had plenty left," Vienna said. "It didn't
look like that to me, but he assured me. It almost felt like she had
gotten beat that day.</TE>
<TE>   "This race today was an important one for my psychological well
being. It's possible, about 50-50, we could go to Dubai [for the
$2-million Golden Shaheen on March 23]. She has been invited."</TE>
<TE>   Looking for her ninth victory--and third in a row--in 19 starts,
Kalookan Queen finished three lengths clear of Enchanted Woods, who
beat Warren's Whistle by a head.</TE>
<TE>   "It just wasn't her day," said Alex Solis, the regular rider of
the runner-up. "She tried. The other filly was just better today, I
guess."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hideaway Cafe, who is trained by Vienna, provided jockey Kenny
Black with his first win at Santa Anita since April 12, 1984.</TE>
<TE>   He won the sixth race that day with Silent Siren, who was also
trained by Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Siphonic, who is scheduled to make his next start in the $250,000
San Felipe Stakes on March 17, worked five furlongs in 1:001/5 for
trainer Dave Hofmans at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   A workout a week earlier was postponed after the 3-year-old Siphon
colt came down with a slight fever, but he went well Saturday
morning. "He galloped out six furlongs in 1:132/5 and seven furlongs
in 1:274/5," Hofmans said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Descapate, a 4-year-old Dehere filly owned by Bill Heiligbrodt's
Racing Stable and Barry Irwin and Jeff Siegel's Team Valor, easily
won the $150,000 Chou Croute Handicap at the Fair Grounds in New
Orleans.</TE>

<LD>Andy Murray was back home again Saturday in Faribault, Minn., hopeful
that he will be able to take his place behind the bench when the
Kings resume their season Tuesday night against the Columbus Blue
Jackets at Columbus, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   A timetable for his return, however, still had not been set.</LD>
<LD>   Released from a hospital near his home after an overnight stay,
the King coach was ordered to rest for 48 hours before being
reevaluated Monday, at which point he could be cleared to fly into
Columbus on Monday night.</LD>
<TE>   "But we'll see what the doctor says," his wife, Ruth, said
Saturday night. "We'll see what happens the next two days. He just
has to rest and I think he will. I think he realizes now how sick he
is and that he's got to take it easy."</TE>
<TE>   She added, however, that her husband seemed much better Saturday.
His dizziness had subsided and he was no longer vomiting, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, 50, suffered a concussion, four broken ribs, a separated
left shoulder and numerous cuts and scrapes on the morning of Feb. 15
when the pickup truck he was driving skidded off icy Interstate 90
outside Sparta, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   "He did sound better today," King General Manager Dave Taylor said
after speaking with Murray by phone. "Obviously, it's a day-to-day
situation to see how he is and what the doctor thinks--if it's OK to
travel and resume coaching.... "</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, assistant coaches Dave Tippett, Mark Hardy and Ray
Bennett will run practice again today. The Kings leave Monday morning
for Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After playing for the United States today against Canada in the
Olympic gold-medal hockey game at Salt Lake City, Adam Deadmarsh and
Aaron Miller are scheduled to rejoin the Kings on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Either they'll be real [ticked] off and play hard," Tippett said,
"or they'll be full of jubilation and think they're world-beaters."</TE>

<DL>PERRIS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Rookie driver Daryn Pittman scored his first victory in the Pennzoil
World of Outlaws series by barely holding off Steve Kinser at the
finish line of the 30-lap main event Saturday in front of a capacity
crowd of 4,565 at Perris Auto Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Pittman won despite spinning out on lap eight. Kinser finished
second by a matter of inches, with Sammy Swindell in third. Mark
Kinser and Donny Schatz rounded out the top five.</LD>
<LD>   Defending champion Danny Lasoski, who broke the track lap record
with a qualifying time of 13.875 seconds, was unable to get any
closer than sixth.</LD>
<TE>   On lap eight, Pittman's right wheels caught the edge of the dirt
cushion along turn one and his J &amp; J chassis flipped over. He landed
upright, however, and was able to continue on with the race, although
seemingly falling to sixth place.</TE>
<TE>   However, as Pittman was accelerating back into the race, Joey
Saldana suddenly spun out in the same area of turn one and ended up
in the side of the wall, bringing out the yellow flag.</TE>
<TE>   Under the World of Outlaws rulebook, because the leader of that
lap, Steve Kinser, did not reach the start-finish line before the
flag came out, Pittman was allowed to return to his place at the head
of the pack.</TE>
<TE>   On the restart, Pittman started to pull away form the pack, but
thanks to two more cautions, Kinser stayed in the hunt until the
final lap, where he finally caught up to Pittman on the final turn.</TE>
<TE>   But, in a dash to the finish line, Pittman's Chevy engine pushed
him ahead just enough to take the checkered flag.</TE>
<TE>   In the other main event of the night, Santa Ana's Chris Rahe won
the 20-lap California Lightning Sprint race, holding off Visalia's
Greg Bragg.</TE>

<HD>Foothill Has Answers Against Eagles, 8-0</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The debate at the Southern Section girls' water polo finals on
Saturday was which team would win the Division I championship,
top-seeded Santa Margarita or second-seeded Santa Ana Foothill.</LD>
<LD>   By the fourth quarter, however, the only question remaining was
how long Santa Margarita would go without a goal.</LD>
<LD>   Foothill answered emphatically with an 8-0 victory at Long Beach
Belmont Plaza that secured the Knights' third consecutive Division I
title.</LD>
<TE>   "We were pumped to go out and play," Foothill junior Brittany
Hayes said. "There was definitely a different feeling going into this
game."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita starts one junior national team member and four
youth national team members, but they committed 18 turnovers in 30
possessions before they were lifted with 2:46 remaining. The Eagles
(25-4) were limited to four shots in the first half, after which
Foothill (27-2) held a 4-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Too many distractions," said Santa Margarita Coach Scott Taylor,
who had been concerned about the focus of his players, several of
whom planned to rush to their winter formal dance after the game.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara 9, Ventura 1-- The Dons won their fourth Division II
title in the last five seasons with a strong defensive effort.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Boreta had six goals for top-seeded Santa Barbara (25-6).
Ventura finishes 24-6.</TE>
<TE>   Bell Gardens 16, North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake 9--The Lancers
won an unprecedented fourth consecutive Division III title, their
third in a row against the Wolverines, behind the play of seniors
Jenny Rueda, Viviana Morales, Patty Cardenas and Alex Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Rueda, Morales and Cardenas combined for 12 goals and Lopez
stopped 10 shots. The top-seeded Lancers (33-1) led Harvard-Westlake
(20-8) at halftime, 11-3.</TE>
<TE>   Corona del Mar 11, Placentia El Dorado 6--The Sea Kings (25-7)
held El Dorado to one goal through the first three quarters in
winning the Division IV title.</TE>
<TE>   El Dorado (15-14) tied the score, 1-1, on Martha Farrell's goal
two minutes into the game, but the unseeded Golden Hawks didn't score
again until the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside Arlington 8, Riverside North 5--Jennifer D'Anna had four
goals to lead top-seeded Arlington (24-7) to its second consecutive
Division V title, both against Ivy League rival North (22-7).</TE>

<LD>The Southern Section Masters wrestling meet lived up to its billing
Saturday at Fountain Valley High, producing unpredictable results,
crowd-thrilling matches in every weight class and even a dash of
controversy.</LD>
<LD>   But when the dust settled and the sea of upsets calmed, a familiar
school stood tall among the wrestling giants of Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana Calvary Chapel, two-time defending state champion,
resumed its place atop the California wrestling scene after a rocky
regular season started whispers about the Eagles falling from the
ranks of the elite.</LD>
<TE>   Joe Williams breezed through the 171-pound weight classunbeaten,
Bryan Osuna finished second at 103 pounds and Mario Estrada was
runner-up at 119 to lead five Calvary Chapel wrestlers to top-five .</TE>
<TE>   The top eight in each class advance to the state championships,
which begin Friday at University of the Pacific in Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   It was quite a turnaround for Calvary Chapel, which did not win a
tournament all season.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, this kind of surprised me, too," Calvary Chapel Coach
Joey Coughran said of his team's performance at the Masters. "But the
tougher the tournament, the better it is for us. We've got some guys
that can wrestle at a high level."</TE>
<TE>   Williams appears to be wrestling at his own level. He pinned David
De La Fuente of Northview in 1 minute 50 seconds in the final and had
pins in 1:20 and 1:07 in the semifinals and quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just a stepping stone for state," he said. "I'm feeling
pretty good right now. I'm 100% confident and I have no doubts about
what I can do."</TE>
<TE>   Northview led all teams with six state qualifiers, including
160-pound champion James Clay, who escaped in overtime to win, 4-3,
in his final against Josh O'Hara of Redlands East Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Temecula Valley, Villa Park and Santa Ana had four state
qualifiers.</TE>
<TE>   The most notable upset occurred in the 140-pound semifinals when
Buck Barger of Villa Park scored a two-point reversal with five
seconds remaining to defeat Jeff Bristol of Temecula Valley, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol, ranked No. 1 in the state, had beaten Barger three times
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "It was about time I beat him," Barger said. "I felt it coming."</TE>
<TE>   Barger's excitement turned to frustration and a controversial
ending in his final against Danny Cadwallader of Cypress Brethren
Christian. Cadwallader built a 6-2 lead after two periods and Barger,
sensing an imminent loss, hit Cadwallader with a series of elbows to
the head. He received an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Barger said emotions got the better of him.</TE>
<TE>   "I beat the guy I wanted to beat [Bristol], then lost to the guy I
didn't want to lose to," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Turk of Lake Arrowhead Rim of the World won the 135-pound
final despite dislocating a finger in the first period. After a brief
timeout, Turk continued and won, 20-4, over Tony Martinez of Arroyo
Grande.</TE>

<LD>It's decision time for the 45 high schools that make up the Catholic
Athletic Assn.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, principals and athletic administrators will convene
at the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to take up the issue of whether to
impose transfer restrictions on athletes who don't change residences.</LD>
<LD>   A small number of individual leagues within the 522-school
Southern Section have already begun to require students who don't
move to sit out one season.</LD>
<TE>   But if athletic powerhouses such as Santa Ana Mater Dei, Santa
Margarita and La Puente Bishop Amat agree to implement transfer
restrictions, it would send a powerful message throughout the state
that change is coming.</TE>
<TE>   And change is needed. The status quo is unacceptable. According to
Southern Section records, there were nearly 3,800 athletic transfers
from the fall of 1999 through December of last year, and that doesn't
include athletes who physically moved.</TE>
<TE>   High school sports was never intended to be a minor league system
for college programs, with many of the same problems in collegiate
sports trickling down, from recruiting scandals to grade scandals.</TE>
<TE>   The growing number of transfer students is disrupting a sports
system designed to encourage competition and teach life lessons.
Instead, individuals are manipulating rules in the name of winning
championships.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994, when the state Legislature passed the open enrollment
law that gave parents more options on school choices, the movement of
athletes has accelerated. The dilemma has been what to do without
taking away a parent's right to choose what's best for their child.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the Oxnard Union High School District, made up of six
high schools, imposed the strictest transfer rule in the state. Any
student who transfers without moving can't participate in sports at
any level for one year.</TE>
<TE>   The rule appears to have helped cut transfers considerably in the
Oxnard district. In 1997-98, there were 349 intradistrict transfers.
In 1998-99, the first year of the rule, there were 261 transfers. In
1999-2000, there were 152.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches in the Oxnard district are pleased that they know which
eighth graders will end up coming to their school. They can evaluate
them and plan for the future. But they also complain that the rule is
benefiting private schools such as Ventura St. Bonaventure, which has
won 42 consecutive football games without transfer restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Two baseball players tested the Oxnard rule and were forced to sit
out their freshman seasons. Doug McGee and Matt Floryan didn't want
to attend Oxnard Rio Mesa High. They enrolled at Camarillo to be with
friends. Both played on travel teams to make up for not being
eligible at Camarillo and neither suffered athletically. But McGee's
father, Dan, vigorously fought the transfer rule.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an insult," he said. "We have a number of kids who lie
about their address and compete in sports. I didn't want to teach my
son that. I also don't think it's right for a school district to
punish a kid for telling the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, McGee was Camarillo's junior varsity most valuable
player. He'll probably start in right field on varsity this season as
a junior. Floryan is a varsity starter in left field.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking about the consequences of sitting out an entire
year," Floryan said. "I knew a lot of people at Camarillo and wanted
to play with them. There was a whole bunch of mixed emotions. I guess
[sitting out] was the consequence I had to take to play for the
team."</TE>
<TE>   But forcing someone to sit out a year for transferring isn't
acceptable to parents in urban areas who want their children to
escape poorly performing schools.</TE>
<TE>   James Powell of Los Angeles writes: "When the playing field is
even, you won't have an issue with transfers. If you feel some kid
from the inner city is taking your kid's playing time, you can always
transfer him from your nice protected surrounding to the inner city,
and he can have the spot the transfer vacated.</TE>
<TE>   "If the young athletes who transfer into your program had the same
advantages in their own neighborhoods, they would gladly stay put.
Parents transfer their children to give them the best opportunity to
succeed. You think it's only about sports. We know it's about a lot
more."</TE>
<TE>   Another dilemma is how to teach loyalty. Coaches want their
players to be loyal to their programs, but as soon as a talented
transfer checks in, a coach's loyalty usually vanishes.</TE>
<TE>   Tom from the Conejo Valley writes, "My son loved playing
basketball for his high school and was looking forward to playing
varsity his senior year. Unfortunately, the varsity coach told him in
June of his junior year that he doesn't take seniors that aren't
starters or the first off the bench [on junior varsity]. So even
though my son was loyal to his high school basketball program for
three years, doing what his coaches asked of him, he was not allowed
to play.</TE>
<TE>   "The player on the varsity team that played the same position was
a transfer student that didn't live in the boundaries of my son's
high school. My complaint about transfers is that they sometimes take
the place of a player who did want to play for their local high
school."</TE>
<TE>   There are no easy solutions to the transfer problem, but the
system is in need of repair. If the CAA doesn't act, it's only a
matter of time before others do.</TE>

<HD>Troy Steps to the Line, Holds Off Norco, 69-63</HD>

<LD>When it mattered most, in the last two minutes, Fullerton Troy showed
why it is the top-seeded girls' basketball team in the Southern
Section Division II-AA playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   It showed why it is a defending section champion. It showed why
it's important to practice free throws.</LD>
<LD>   Holding a one-point lead and reeling from Norco and its
outstanding freshman, Erika Arriaran, Troy converted nine of 12
free-throws and held on to beat the unseeded Cougars, 69-63, in a
semifinal game before a capacity crowd at La Habra High.</LD>
<TE>   A furious rally by Norco (22-8)--Arriaran scored 13 of her 21
points in the fourth quarter after making only one of her first 11
shots against the defense of Gabrielle Spence--cut a 54-44
third-quarter lead to 60-59 with 2 minutes 25 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   But Troy (27-2), which made only two of eight from the field in
the fourth quarter despite shooting 45% in the first three, finally
took a deep breath and made its free throws, including eight of nine
in the final 1:29.</TE>
<TE>   Meghan McGuire, a sophomore who finished with 19 points, made six
of seven free throws, including four in a row in the final 17 seconds
with Troy holding a tenuous 65-63 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "They're one of the best teams in the division right now, and
Erika is at full strength," said Troy Coach Kevin Kiernan, alluding
to the Warriors' 69-55 victory over Norco on Dec. 28, when Arriaran
was nursing a foot injury.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the girls at halftime [with a 32-27 lead] this would be a
character check in the second half, that we weren't going to beat
this team by 30. We haven't had many of those character checks this
season."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine-bound Alicia Komaki led Troy, last season's Division
I-A champion, with 20 points, and junior Amanda Livingston finished
with 18 points and 13 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Charmaine Utz and Kimberly Smith scored 12 each for Norco, which
led only once, 14-12.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>

<TE>   Ventura 51, Irvine Wood-bridge 45--The Cougars withstood a
fourth-quarter rally to win a Division II-AA semifinal at Ventura
Buena and advanced to its first section final since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded Woodbridge (26-4) cut an 11-point fourth-quarter
deficit to 49-45 in the final minute, but Jenni Dooley of Ventura
stole the ball from Lindsey Yocum with nine seconds to play and Katy
O'Brien made two free throws with five seconds left to seal it.</TE>
<TE>   Dooley, who scored 22 points, made three three-pointers, giving
her 101 this season and 223 in her career. Caitlin O'Neill scored 13
and O'Brien added 12.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars (27-2), who made seven three-pointers, have 258
three-pointers this season and 492 in two seasons under Coach Ann
Larson.</TE>
<TE>   Yocum scored 14, all in the second half, and Michelle Sanford
added 11 for Woodbridge, which fell in the semifinals for the second
consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura plays Troy for the division title next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Desmond</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Wilson 47, Anaheim Esperanza 40--Brandi Knight had 14
points and Tessa Petrick had 11 rebounds for Long Beach Wilson (26-5)
in a Division I-AA quarterfinal at Esperanza. The Aztecs, seeded
fourth, finish at 23-5.</TE>
<TE>   Chino Hills Ayala 59, Rialto Eisenhower 54--Kia Riley had 18
points and nine rebounds and Brittany Sieger had 16 points and seven
rebounds for third-seeded Chino Hills Ayala in a Division I-AA
quarterfinal at Ayala.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs (26-4) held an 11-point lead with four minutes
remaining in the game, but Eisenhower connected on a couple of
three-point baskets to close to within five points. The Eagles (25-4)
would get to within three points before Ayala put the game away at
the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente 69, Corona 45--Lindsey Pluimer had 24 points and 12
rebounds, Sara Brown had 16 points and seven rebounds and Kim Buffum
had 15 points and five assists to lead top-seeded San Clemente
(25-3), in a Division I-A quarterfinal at Norco High. Lyneia Gipson
had 12 points for Corona (21-8).</TE>
<TE>   Newhall Hart 68, Riverside North 59--Brandi Kimble had 21 points
and eight rebounds for third-seeded Hart (25-4) in a Division I-A
quarterfinal. The Indians will play Westminster, a 58-34 winner over
Chino, in a semifinal on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   North Torrance 43, Brea Olinda 40--Traci Elliott had 15 points,
including two free throws with eight seconds left, to clinch the
victory for fourth-seeded North Torrance (24-6) in a Division II-A
semifinal at Peninsula. Carrie Noyes scored 16 points for top-seeded
Brea Olinda (21-7), which trailed 23-18 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo 65, Santa Margarita 55--Allison Bretana had 20 points for
the Sea Hawks (22-7) in a Division II-A semifinal at Trabuco Hills
High. Julia Pederson had 18 points for second-seeded Santa Margarita
(24-5), which was outscored, 24-18, in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe Springs St. Paul 53, Cerritos Valley Christian 51--
Crystal Erwin had 25 points and 15 rebounds to lead St. Paul (23-7)
to the Division IV-AA quarterfinal victory over third-seeded and host
Cerritos Valley Christian (23-6), which missed a last-second shot.
Susie Boogaard led Cerritos Valley Christian with 34 points. St. Paul
plays Santa Ana Calvary Chapel, a 55-47 winner over Oak Park, in a
semifinal on Tuesday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'd like to thank Jeri Elster ("The Devil You Know," by Melba
Newsome, Jan. 27) for persevering within a justice system that has been
functioning in the Dark Ages while alienating and discriminating against
women, their bodies and sexual crimes. With her painful story, Elster has
opened the door for changes in legislation that can bring justice sooner
rather than later for victims of sexual crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Maria Velasquez</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The change in legislation carried by Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Santa
Ana) was prompted by a November 1999 Orange County Register investigation
by reporter Heather Lourie, "DNA Evidence in Gridlock." That story and
subsequent articles showed that crucial DNA evidence in hundreds of
unsolved Orange County rape cases had never been analyzed and was
systematically destroyed after the six-year statute of limitations
expired.</TE>
<TE>   Correa's original bill only sought to extend the statute of
limitations from six to eight years. [When] Jeri Elster and I, both rape
survivors with the Rainbow Sisters Project--a multiracial, L.A.-based
organization of rape survivors--got involved, his bill was amended to
eliminate the time limit if DNA evidence is analyzed within two years of
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Legislative aides believed that the bill would not pass in the current
climate. The Rainbow Sisters Project came up with the strategy to "marry"
Correa's bill to Senate President Pro Tem John Burton's "innocence bill"
allowing convicted felons access to DNA testing. After the bills were
joined, the Legislature passed them and Gov. Gray Davis signed them into
law.</TE>

<LD>I read with interest Benjamin Smith's story about Valery
Itzkevitch's attempt to immigrate to the U.S. from his native Latvia
("Giving Up on America," Jan. 27). I was perplexed by the ambivalent
nature of the article, which neither explored the depth of such failed
attempts by would-be immigrants nor the options that could have allowed
Itzkevitch to stay in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The article left me with the sense that Itzkevitch was more concerned
with material comforts and career standing than with fleeing
anti-Semitism and persecution. For generations immigrants have had to
forgo the high life temporarily in exchange for religious or political
freedom. It's too bad that Itzkevitch did not have the patience to do so,
or to take advantage of the resources within the Los Angeles Jewish
community.</LD>

<TE>   Scott Spolin should be commended for his attempt to integrate an
Eastern European immigrant into American society. His outpouring of
kindness is the rarest of occurrences in Los Angeles, a city that is
known for self-absorption. It is a lonely place for new immigrants. The
physical makeup of the city, with its dependence on the automobile and
strange mix of suburban lifestyles, makes interpersonal contact difficult
when compared to the congested urban atmospheres of Eastern European
cities. Spolin was trying to replicate the success stories of millions of
immigrants who have come to America. His heart was in the right place,
but his head was in early-1900s Chicago or New York. Los Angeles was
never one of those cities, and it never will be. Maybe Spolin should open
a branch office of his law firm in Riga, Latvia.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Having been an immigrant at one time in my life, I was intrigued by
Smith's article. Itzkevitch was fortunate to have been offered a job that
would have enabled him to stay here legally and, eventually, get his
green card. He blew it royally, failing to read the signs telling him
that not doing much of anything for a starter job that pays $55,000 a
year is a gift from God. Every immigrant should be so lucky to be offered
such a golden opportunity. Apparently Itzkevitch thought more of what he
missed in Riga than of what he could have gained in this great country.</TE>

<HD>The Romance of a Yellow Rolls-Royce</HD>

<LD>Anne Crawford suffers no shortage of diamonds. But her next best
friend is her butter-colored 1967 Rolls-Royce convertible.</LD>
<LD>   How she came into possession of the automobile plays like a Lifetime
Romance movie, but it's all true. "It was originally my mother-in-law's,"
Crawford says. "They used to go driving past the Rolls-Royce dealership
in Beverly Hills, and my mother-in-law would say to my father-in-law, 'If
you really loved me . . . ' It became a running joke between the two of
them. Well, it was Valentine's Day, and she was playing bridge with her
girlfriends. A [delivery] man came to the door and asked her to come
outside, and lo and behold. She drove it for 25 years." Later, the car
made the rounds to various relatives, finally coming to Crawford's future
husband, truck body maker Dudley deZonia.</LD>
<LD>   Enter Anne Crawford. "We had been dating about a year. It was right
before we got engaged--and we were coming home from an event. I was tired
and cranky and my now-husband said, 'We have to make one more stop.' I
thought, 'Oh, Lord.' So we pull up to this place where they restore cars,
and the car is parked outside and I say, 'Oh, look at that car. Isn't
that gorgeous?' And he hands me the keys." On their honeymoon, "we drove
it up to Yosemite and the wine country. We felt like Cary Grant and Grace
Kelly."</LD>
<TE>   So, 18 months later, does the car wear Crawford or does she wear the
car? "I try not to be completely unkempt," says the Hancock Park
resident, a onetime fashion director and writer in her early 40s who now
handles public relations for Martin Katz, Alberta Ferretti and Tod's. She
needn't worry. The Rolls, with its tan leather and burled wood interior,
complements Crawford's style, which you might call conservative with a
sex bomb twist--coiffed wavy blond hair, va-va-voom figure, soft colors
(think pink and brown rather than red and black), high-fashion labels
(YSL, Prada, Hermes) and, of course, the aforementioned diamonds (friend
Katz designed Crawford's wedding ring). It's also a roomy ride for
favorite passengers such as Crawford's 8-year-old stepson, Philip, and
her cocker spaniel, Bailey. "It's the world's poshest Yellow Cab," she
jokes. "Passes everything but a gas station."</TE>

<LD>Growing up on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, Leslie Carlson couldn't
have cared less about horses--or cheerleading, for that matter. "Dude, I
was always going off to the car shows with my dad and brother. I had no
time for girlie things."</LD>
<LD>   Now 37, Carlson still lives in Palos Verdes and she's still haunting
the car shows. Don't look to Carlson for the latest offerings from Tom
Ford or Jean Paul Gaultier. Her idea of a design icon is legendary
"kustomizer to the stars" George Barris of Barris Kustom Productions in
North Hollywood. A former ad executive who is now a full-time mom,
Carlson runs errands in a gargantuan black 5.7-liter V8 2000 Chevy
Suburban emblazoned with electric blue hot-rod flames to go with its
customized suspension.</LD>
<TE>   For autos no less than fashion ensembles, accessories make the look.
Wheels? Budnik is de rigueur, says Carlson. Exhaust system? Custom
Flowmaster muffler. Welded roll pan? Shaved-off roof rack? Forget South
Coast Plaza. Carlson's fashion dollar goes to such temples of style as
Foreign Auto Body in Gardena, the source of that flame job. "My mom still
has to drag me off for proper clothing," she says. "I wear jeans,
T-shirts and Doc Martens all the time." Her lone fashion concession is a
pair of Sha Sha's black with blue flames that match the truck. "They were
on the news," she says, raising her eyebrows. "Supposedly, they're drug
shoes. Check it out." Sure enough, inside the shoe is a small compartment
in the sole. "Wild, huh?"</TE>
<TE>   But surely, one wonders, Carlson dressed for success during her
executive years? Nope. "I had all the car accounts," says Carlson, who
married an advertising media director. "It was more important to know
cars than to wear the right clothes." Move over, ladies who lunch--soccer
mom 2002 is here, and she's taking no prisoners. "My car is my
statement."</TE>

<HD>This '63 Classic Answers to 'Emily'</HD>

<LD>Most young women who look like Heather Grook come to L.A. with the
idea of breaking into "the industry." But this 27-year-old Norfolk, Va.,
native is having none of that. She is trying to break into . . . the L.A.
Unified School District? "I love teaching," says Grook, who has an art
history degree from Old Dominion University and is working as a fitting
model and substitute teacher while preparing for a credential program.</LD>
<LD>   And she knows a good used car when she sees one. Grook's '63 Nash
Rambler (Emily, by name) came to her through serendipity as much as
through quick thinking. "I was living in San Francisco at the time and I
was doing volunteer work at this nursing home. I was planning on moving
here. And these four sisters, who had never married and never split up
(some sort of 'Virgin Suicides' thing), were coming in, and they had no
use for it. I got it for $1,000. It was already named Emily, and it had
like 35,000 miles on it. It runs like a dream."</LD>
<TE>   Emily is more than just transportation, says Grook. "She suits me.
She's no frills, very straightforward. She doesn't even have an FM radio.
It's Frank Sinatra or talk radio." Grook's car is a good fit
aesthetically, too. "I like to mix vintage and modern," says Grook, whose
Los Feliz apartment is eclectically furnished in a mix of styles from Art
Deco to Danish Modern. For this picture, she's outfitted in a Tim Remi
top for Swann, vintage skirt and Michael Kors high-heeled clogs. "I don't
dress to fit into the car, but I can look like a schoolteacher in the
morning--plaid skirts, knee socks, hair in a bun, Miss Crabtree, and I
can go out looking like [Velvet Underground chanteuse] Nico at night if I
want to."</TE>
<TE>   Nico notwithstanding, Grook, like Emily, likes life in the slower
lane. "New cars are easier to drive," she admits, "but Emily suits me. I
have to be content with 70 mph, tops."</TE>

<LD>Architectural designer Denise Ip only recently began her love
affair with cars, and her heart belongs to her 1969 Oldsmobile Cutlass
Supreme 442. It was one of those love-at-first-sight things. "It wasn't
rational. I just knew I had to have it," the 24-year-old says. It was a
Sunday. "I was driving through the hills in Silver Lake, and I saw it
parked by the side of the road. I don't even remember whether I knocked
on the door or the guy who owned it was standing outside. The guy was
trying to sell it. He wanted $2,500. I ran to the bank the next day."</LD>
<LD>   Ip, born in Brooklyn and reared in Hong Kong, admits she's become
something of a motor head. "This car got me into cars. You know, if
you're going to restore something, you want to do it the right way. I
haven't done anything yet; I'm waiting for money." Still, the car is her
ultimate accessory. "I still have a RAV4," she says. "My dependable car.
This is my Saturday night-Sunday afternoon car."</LD>
<TE>   The car also fits Ip's penchant for finding just the right accessory
to put a playfully ironic, slightly subversive twist on an otherwise
straight-ahead designer look. Her wearing a Harry Potter T-shirt with
Helmut Lang shoes is pure Denise Ip. "I just bought a great bangle from
Daniel Swarovski, the younger line of Swarovski, and I bought some little
cheap things in Hawaii--flowers for your hair that look great," she says.
Ip's uniform for weekdays consists of "black pants and some funky graphic
T-shirts from MOCA" paired with purple Jil Sanders-designed Pumas or
Adidas martial arts shoes. But when it's time to go out, "I love
Cacharel, Miu Miu, Marc Jacobs, Margiela, Agnes B. I have a beautiful
pair of Helmut Langs with ankle straps and a pair of Sergio Rossi's--same
look, only more S-M." She laughs.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to be all about safety, but I can see where people become
addicted to velocity," Ip says. She's never tested it, but she says she
likes knowing her car can do a 12-second quarter mile. "Every time I pull
up to an intersection, if there's a guy next to me, he will start revving
his car," she says. "They always want to race."</TE>

<LD>"I love being the blond in the convertible," says Shane McCoy.
"It's everyone's fantasy of Southern California." She certainly has the
right car for the role. A former editorial assistant at Vanity Fair who
presently works for photographer Michel Comte, McCoy tools between town
and her Malibu home in a 2001 silver Audi TT Roadster straight out of
Central Casting. "The controls are perfect," she purrs, including, of
course, the gear shift, which McCoy had to master when she got the car.
"Now, I can't imagine driving anything else."</LD>
<LD>   And McCoy, 29, loves to drive: "When I turned 16, I didn't get a new
car; my mom got a new car and I got a red Chrysler station wagon." She
drove it back and forth from Los Angeles to college in Connecticut. "I
ran that car into the ground."</LD>
<TE>   An old-line Angeleno with L.A. roots for five generations on her
father's side and four on her mother's, McCoy blends classic
understatement with a made-in-Hollywood California-girl aesthetic. She
wears turquoise earrings by her friend Jennifer Porter, Marc Jacobs jeans
("always"), a trench by Chaiken and Capone and Beatle Boots. "Planet Blue
[in Malibu] and Yellow [in Hollywood] are probably my favorite stores
right now." She also favors cuff bracelets and often wears a suede cuff
trimmed with turquoise and coral that she stitched herself. "It was
supposed to be a bookmark," she says, "but it turned into a bracelet."
For the open road, McCoy pays playful homage to her family background in
the wintertime with an English driving cap whose inside label reads,
"Made in England, Exclusively for Brooks Brothers." "I got it from my
dad," she says.</TE>
<TE>   As for being the blond in the convertible, "It's role-playing. When
you're on PCH, you figure most of the people out there are driving
Chryslers with a sticker from Budget on the back. They're visiting, and
it's fun to embody something iconic. Fortunately, the car is design
enough and retro enough that I don't end up being a parody of myself."</TE>

<DH>Thanks to Our Love Affair With the Automobile, We Can Dress Any Way
We Want. As We Report Below, Stilettos  Are Staples, Coats Are an
Afterthought  and Pantyhose Have Been Banished to Three Racks in the
Store Basement. And You'll Find Further Evidence of Our Fashion
Liberation in the Pages That Follow.</DH>

<LD>A lovely young woman leans against the back of the sofa and
shivers. It's a delicious shiver, the sort that high school girls might
use to lure the jackets off the backs of nearby football players, the
same shiver that some women use to encourage an embrace at  patio
cocktail parties. Eventually age or motherhood  removes it from the
repertoire of seduction. But our lovely young woman is still young enough
to shiver deliciously--and she has reason. Clad in a pair of hip-hugger
trousers and a houndstooth vest with a sheer beaded back, much of her
torso is bare, despite it being a winter month and quite chilly. And hers
are not the only bare arms and belly in the room. Although it's cold,
it's also Los Angeles, and our propensity for automotive travel lets us
ignore the weather.</LD>
<LD>   Among Easterners, it has been suggested that Los Angeles is an
alternate universe, and, to a certain extent, it is--a universe dictated
by the convenience and limitations of the automobile.</LD>
<LD>   And it shows in our clothes. Especially women's clothes.</LD>
<TE>   We wear sandals in November, go bare-legged on New Year's Eve. We
don't believe much in coats, and the men among us will pull on shorts,
even for semiformal events, at the drop of a hat. Not that there are many
hats around to drop, unless it's the ubiquitous baseball cap. As
accessories, some women carry handbags the size of cell phones and dogs
the size of purses, while others shoulder purses that look more like
luggage and backpacks suitable for a weeklong jaunt into the
outback--chiropractic concerns are minimal when you're only walking one
block from the parking garage to the office.</TE>
<TE>   "You really can go from the bedroom to the car to your destination
with virtually no steps in between," says Julie Gilhart, vice president
of fashion merchandising for Barneys New York. "In Los Angeles, you just
don't need as many pieces, which is why the idea of wearing just a great
top with a bottom came out of L.A. You don't need a scarf or a jacket or
a hat."</TE>
<TE>   In defiance of dress codes and decorum, we wear stilettos to the
office with clothing so short and tight and tiny that sudden movement
renders it superfluous. According to Kim Sobel, a spokeswoman for Banana
Republic, sleeveless and short-sleeve tops and dresses sell pretty much
year-round in L.A. We don't worry about layering or finding that little
go-everywhere frock; in dress-down L.A., almost everything goes
everywhere, and if we need to change, we'll drive home before heading out
to dinner. Should traffic prove an obstacle, we'll just change in the
car. Any woman with any kind of social life has at least two spare
outfits in her back seat, if only  because she keeps forgetting to bring
in the dry cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   "In L.A., women have so much more freedom," says Mark Buettell,
manager of the Christian Louboutin shoe store in Beverly Hills. "They
don't have to worry about what's sturdy or what wears well on the subway.
In New York, there's more of a uniform, women wear layers to take them
through the day. But here, you can go home or keep an outfit in the car."
 Louboutin and his like may well be the biggest beneficiaries of car
couture. His are not so much shoes as podiatric confections. With
winkle-picker toes (able to kick a spider wedged into the tightest
corner) and heels the height and width of a Virginia Slim, a Louboutin
shoe is made mostly of air. The additional materials appear to be a bit
of silk, a few feathers, a wisp of leather and a satin bow. And Angelenos
love them.</TE>
<TE>   According to Buettell, who has also worked for Barneys and Gucci,
there are more high heels sold in Los Angeles than in any other U.S.
city, including New York. Those "Sex and the City" girls may fornicate
like New Yorkers, but their footwear is strictly L.A. In New York,
Buettell says, women might take sexy shoes to work and change before
going out, but in L.A., they just wear those Manolo stilettos all day
long. "Here you see more delicate styles, more beading," he said. "Shoes
don't have to be practical at all--no one's walking 16 blocks to the
subway and back."</TE>
<TE>   Which may explain the fairly recent phenomenon of platform tennis
shoes. Suitable for neither work nor play, they dominate shoe stores all
around the city, leaving space enough only for the now-ubiquitous black
platform sandal that women of a certain age, either actual or desired,
wear year-round. According to Buettell, L.A. is a year-round sandal
market, with Labor Day just another excuse for a barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of sandals could be graphed in direct proportion to the
avoidance of pantyhose. Now on the list of life-choice motivators,
pantyhose is right up there with Need to Change the World and How Can I
Really Make My Mother Mad? A young woman I know became a surgeon mainly
because she was fairly certain that surgeons never had to wear pantyhose;
I became a journalist for much the same reason. For those contemplating a
move to Los Angeles, it can be the final deal-clincher: Come here and
you'll never have to see another reinforced toe in your life.</TE>
<TE>   In other cities, whole floors of department stores are devoted to hose
and tights; here you're lucky to find one lousy three-tiered kiosk. And
this demand-based supply trickles down to the toddler set. A mother I
know--in fact she has credit cards in my name-- found herself dashing
wild-eyed through a mall scant minutes before Christmas in search of a
pair of simple black tights for her 20-month-old. In store after store,
there were none to be found. In Gymboree, she was shown to an aisle
devoted to leggings and bicycle shorts. Bicycle shorts. For toddlers. Two
days before Christmas. Apparently that's what every 2-year-old Angeleno
is wearing under her red plaid crinolined party dress--bicycle shorts.
What we save on pantyhose, we no doubt spend on therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Hoisery companies are not the only ones who suffer from the vagaries
of Angeleno style. When Carrie Kneitel and her partner decided to create
Edward An, a coat company, they figured it was exactly what this town
needed. Heaven knows there are enough ugly coats here to save seats for
every Orc in Middle-earth. Each year, nights grow cold in L.A. much as
they do in the rest of the world, and, each year, Angelenos are shocked
and somewhat irritated by this fact.</TE>
<TE>   But Kneitel had a harder time getting the business going than she
expected. While the coat is the keystone of the winter wardrobe in other
cities, it is too often an afterthought here. We grope about in our
closets and pull out pilled-up polar fleece from Old Navy, oversized
black leather coats that do not make anyone look like Samuel L. Jackson
except Samuel L. Jackson and those unfortunate sequined jean jackets that
so many of us are inexplicably hanging on to. The coat in any form, after
all, is antithetical to the city's raison d'etre.</TE>
<TE>   "In L.A., we try to show as much skin as we can," she says, "and we're
taking the angle that it's sexy to wear a coat. It was difficult at
first." Barneys' Gilhart agrees. "You have to think in terms of lighter
fabrics, and almost always unlined. Very light cashmere is popular in
L.A. In other cities you need coats that can take you down the streets
through the weather."</TE>
<TE>   Bulky coats are also a turnoff for folks sliding in and out of the
front seat, which is why Kneitel's Edward An coats, available at Fred
Segal and American Rag, are, for the most part, lightweight and tailored.
Last year's line included a Mac-in-Pack (an unlined Macintosh that folded
into a briefcase-type packet that could easily be tucked in the car) and
this spring Edward An is bringing out its version of the driving coat--an
above-the-hip, tight-fitting blazer.</TE>
<TE>   The car coat may be the best example of how the physical environment
of the car has created a new look. The wind-whipped, convertible scarf, a
la Grace Kelly in "To Catch a Thief" (and as spoofed by Renee Zellweger
in "Bridget Jones's Diary"), is another. And, of course, the increasingly
popular driving shoe--everyone from L.L. Bean to Barneys is getting in on
the act--is in an eyebrow-raising class all its own.</TE>
<TE>   But besides offering freedom from weather and wardrobe limitations,
the car has a few fashion dictates as well. Seatbelts ratchet the wrinkle
factor higher than that of public transportation, and so many women
eschew the linen suit, or even the silk blouse. Our driving habits also
tend to show the moment we get out of the car--a shower of crumbs, a
smear of jelly on the lap instantly reveals a breakfast on the go. And
what smoker hasn't suffered that AWOL cigarette burn through the folds of
a cuff or skirt?</TE>
<TE>   While auto designers have perfected the cup holder so that not one
drop of Thai iced tea escapes en route, all bets are off when the cup
leaves the holder. One woman I know has taken to drinking her hot coffee
through a straw to avoid inter-freeway spills. A practical solution, but
it does lend a Big Gulp atmosphere to even the frothiest cappuccino, and
that can't be what the Italians had in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps what Angelenos really need is a short, transparent coat. It
could provide some insulation against those spring rains (another
inevitability that pulls us up short) while allowing Pilates-toned arms
and bellies to strut their stuff. More important, it could be quickly
wiped clean after every commute.</TE>
<TE>   Throw on a few feathers and a satin bow, and they should sell like hot
cakes.</TE>

<HD>In The Driver's Seat</HD>
<DH>Actress Michael Michele Falls Under L.A.'s Spell</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEATHER JOHN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Michele is back on the streets, with a newfound curiosity
about our central city. "Downtown L.A. represents change, and I gravitate
toward that," she says. "It's still very raw and true." Michele, who
recently left the cast of TV's "ER," has just finished filming Ron
Shelton's upcoming thriller "Dark Blue," in which she portrays an LAPD
sergeant in South-Central in the midst of the 1992 L.A. riots. Filming
on location "gave me a chance to discover a part of L.A. I didn't know,"
says the actress, who lives in New York but keeps a West Hollywood
apartment. "You can't capture the essence of a city in a closed room on a
set--and I needed to understand the rhythm of downtown, to be on the
streets and hear its sounds."</LD>
<LD>   It's not the first time we've seen her in uniform--first as Detective
Rene  Sheppard on the TV cop series "Homicide: Life on the Street,"
followed by a two-year stint in scrubs as Dr. Cleo Finch on "ER." "I'm
not typically attracted to glamorous roles," she says, although she did
"Central Park West" early in her career "because I needed the work. But
now that there are more choices, I find the antithesis more interesting."</LD>
<TE>   Of course, her looks are hard to ignore and certainly played a part in
her landing the role of supermodel Veronica Porsche in Michael Mann's
"Ali." But "Veronica Porsche is a very silently strong, intellectual
woman." And, like other dynamic women, "they wore the clothes, the
clothes didn't wear them," she adds, naming Katharine Hepburn, Marlene
Dietrich and Bette Davis. "Those women represent great intellect, great
strength" and, yes, "great glamour."</TE>
<TE>   Michele says she takes her cues from the silver-screen greats. "I
would wear anything today that Bette Davis or Katharine Hepburn was
wearing in the '30s or '40s--when women really dressed." She has remained
on the fashion radar by operating slightly below it, opting for subtlety
where others go for splash. "I've never worked with a stylist. I don't
wear 'costumes.' My father's a businessman and he taught me that you buy
the classics and you'll have them forever. I got my conservativeness from
my father and my flair from my mother. I love tailored men's suits, which
is why I love Helmut Lang. But I have to have a feminine shoe." Or many
pairs, as the case may be. She has a collection of Manolos that would
give Carrie Bradshaw pause. "I never throw shoes away," she confesses. "I
still have Manolos from '87."</TE>
<TE>   Stilettos notwithstanding, Michele is devoted to her family and her
adopted city. She's active in the Harvard Mentoring Project (a nationwide
program founded by the Harvard School of Public Health), volunteering to
help underprivileged youth, and considers Manhattan a better base than
L.A. for visiting her  parents and sister in her native Indiana. "I have
all I need," she says. "At the  moment, there is nothing that can replace
the need for family."</TE>

<DH>What is Angelyne Selling, and Why on Earth Does She Continue to
Park Her Pink Corvette in the Fire Lane?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If ever there was a poster girl for L.A., it's Angelyne. She's the
nexus of fashion, fame and four-wheeling in a city that loves all three.
Her self-promoting billboards are roadside landmarks, but it's her Barbie
doll style that stops traffic--and the bombshell is living proof that
sometimes packaging is more important than the package.</LD>
<LD>   Her fame probably could not have happened anywhere else. In L.A., you
are what you drive. So she customized her image of Hollywood glam around
a candy pink Corvette with personalized "Anglyne" vanity plates. Then,
instead of waiting to be discovered, she bought the best exposure money
can buy in a city that spends much of its time behind the wheel.</LD>
<LD>   Since the 1980s, billboards have gone up on the Sunset Strip, La Brea
Avenue and other famed corridors advertising Angelyne's name, canyon-like
cleavage and phone number. If curious motorists call that number, they'll
reach Angelyne Management, where she has several full-time  employees
dedicated to selling the sizzle to her steak.</LD>
<TE>   An actress with a handful of screen credits, including "Earth Girls
Are Easy," Angelyne has become an L.A. icon through her billboards. They
have had a better film career than she has, appearing in "Get Shorty" and
"Volcano" as well as TV's "The Simpsons," "Moonlighting" and "Futurama."
She claims a fan club of more than 22,000 and has appeared in magazines
from National Geographic to People. Angelyne is also an occasional pitch
woman for the La Brea Chevrolet dealership, which sells Corvettes. It's
where she recently bought her 2002 model.</TE>
<TE>   Spotting Angelyne racing around town has become a recreational sport.
For the uninitiated, a sighting could be a brief blip of pink on the
radar or a glimpse of a blond topknot in the rearview mirror. But for the
Angelyne aficionado, it's a sublime slice of the Southland sitting at a
stoplight-- the L.A. equivalent of seeing Bigfoot.</TE>
<TE>   Angelyne understands better than anyone the importance of dressing the
part. She pulls up in back of the Roosevelt Hotel wearing a leopard-print
spandex dress that barely reins in her colossal bust, Day-Glo pink mules
and a furry animal-print bolero that makes her appear as if she is
wearing a cat toy. Her lips and fingernails are a shade of pink that
would make Schiaparelli blush, and her eyes are heavily painted,
Egyptian-style. Her pantyhose look as if they came from a plastic egg and
are a wee too dark for her ashen skin.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to pin down her age. She doesn't look old so much as worn.
She describes herself as "ageless," attributing her physique to a daily
fitness regimen of splits. But from her taut face and perky Michael
Jackson nose, it looks as if she may have had some help. When asked
directly about plastic surgery, she says only, "I like anything that's
high technology."</TE>
<TE>   She adores all things pink, from her car to almost every accessory she
owns. "The color vibrates on a higher level mentally," she says.
"Different shades of pink are like different colors to me." She carries a
powder pink marabou purse and a Barbie knapsack that reads, "Anything is
possible." The Barbie comparison is not without merit: Angelyne's
clothing has the same fetishistic quality as the 11 1/2-inch doll's, and
it's easy to imagine packing the living doll's skimpy wardrobe into a
pink vinyl carrying case to take on a sleepover.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is, Barbie wants to be me," Angelyne says without a hint of
irony. "She wants to grow up and be human."</TE>
<TE>   Her sausage casing-like clothes scream off-the-rack Trashy Lingerie,
but all of her pieces are custom-made. For part of her wardrobe she
relies on Heathyr Lawrence of the Newport Beach mail-order company Punk
Kitty. Lawrence designed the fluffy pink bikini with cat ears that
Angelyne wore on her most recent La Brea billboard.</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't own a single pair of jeans or sweatpants. "I figure if I
own it, I might have to wear it" she says. (Besides, no one but Billy
Blanks ever got famous wearing sweatpants.) She claims purses are her
weakness. One look in her trunk, and you know she's telling the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Her car-cum-closet is a fixture in the fire lane outside Rexall Square
Drug at La Cienega and Beverly. "I could spend hours there," she says.
"And I do." She buys cosmetics and bubble bath mostly. She can't remember
the name of her favorite brand but knows "it's imported." For Angelyne,
getting dressed is a creative pursuit. "I feel like I'm a walking
painting. When I got dressed today, I tossed aside eight dresses that
were all fighting to get on me," she says. In fact, in 1999 she mounted
an exhibit at the now-defunct Artluxe Gallery in Hollywood that featured
acrylics of herself. One of her paintings, "All American Angelyne," is
reproduced on a billboard at Selma  Avenue and Vine Street.</TE>
<TE>   Angelyne has been indulging in her own brand of performance art since
she was a child, whenever and wherever that was. She coyly skirts the
issue, saying she's saving those details for her memoirs. But she offers,
"I used to get sent home from school for wearing outrageous things." Her
racy style hasn't changed much. But somewhere down the road, even
Angelyne and her iconic billboards must age. Will she do things
differently? "I'll probably have new clothes," she says.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Angelyne plans to stay in the fast lane, occupying
that rare niche where fashion, cars and kitsch converge.</TE>

<HD>Worth Looking For</HD>
<DH>G. Garvin's Is Hard to Spot, but the Newly Opened Place Is Packed</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some restaurants glide quietly into town, without a barrage of
publicity or lavish dinners for investors. The chef/owner just goes into
the kitchen and starts cooking.</LD>
<LD>   That's what Gerry B. Garvin did, and three months after opening G.
Garvin's amid the funky charm of West 3rd Street, he's filling the place
regularly--even if he still doesn't have a lighted sign out front. The
facade of his smart 40-seat restaurant is so dark I have trouble finding
it, even on a third visit. (It's between Berri's Pizza and Zen Grill,
four blocks east of the Beverly Center.) It's also small--too much so on
some nights, particularly weekends.</LD>
<LD>   As for now, the inviting dining room is lined with tall-backed
banquettes covered in suede the color of chestnut honey. The wall
sconces--candles backed with polished steel and fronted with magnifying
glasses--cast a soft, interesting light. On the tables, tea lights
flicker in cracked-glass holders, and bouquets of miniature calla lilies
add notes of rust and orange. With the dark wood bistro chairs and crisp
white linens, it's a surprisingly sophisticated look for such a congenial
neighborhood spot.</LD>
<TE>   I'm convinced every diner who's happened onto this easygoing little
restaurant is spreading the word. Some guests I took to Garvin's two or
three times have been back on their own already. Everybody in the place
seems to know Garvin from other restaurants. He did a stint as executive
chef at Morton's. He was chef at the late Kass Bah on Melrose Avenue, and
was opening chef at Keyshawn Johnson's Reign in Beverly Hills, one of the
few celebrity haunts where people were there more for the food than the
scene.</TE>
<TE>   Garvin grew up in Atlanta, where he was accepted into a Ritz-Carlton
summer program as a teen. Instead of going to cooking school, he worked
his way through the Ritz-Carlton organization and, in 1988, came out to
California to open the restaurant in the then-new Ritz-Carlton in Palm
Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Although trained in French cuisine, he can cook Southern in a style
that's both soulful and contemporary. At Reign, I loved his perfect fried
chicken, subtle smothered pork chops and fiery black-eyed peas. With his
namesake restaurant, though, Garvin is taking another direction. The only
vaguely Southern item on the menu is "too tender" baby back ribs, which,
surprisingly, are offered as an appetizer. Though they're missing the
deep wood-smoke flavor of ribs cooked in a real pit, it's all too easy to
nibble these dainty ribs down to the bone, sucking in every bit of that
dark, sweet, vinegary sauce that clings to the meat like melted
chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   What about that fried chicken? Everybody asks me that, he groans. He
doesn't want to do it every night, but he may well offer Southern
Sundays, with fried chicken and ribs and all the fixings. Just not quite
yet. Right now Sunday is his only night off.</TE>
<TE>   G. Garvin's small menu is best described as California eclectic.
Though many of the dishes are familiar, each has a twist. His carpaccio,
for example, is pounded filet, warmed and topped with spinach and
matchsticks of fried wonton skins in a soy ginger sauce. His tuna tartare
lets the taste of the impeccably fresh fish shine through. The light
dressing is perfumed with sesame oil and ginger. Salmon tartare's
fattiness is set off with a dollop of intensely briny black caviar.</TE>
<TE>   Along with those ribs, he offers three sauteed Sonoma lamb chops as an
appetizer. They're beautiful, rosy pink at the center, with a beguiling
lamb flavor. Shrimp is briefly sauteed to this side of transparent and
served in a sauce that packs a kick of tequila and hot pepper. Half moons
of pasta stuffed with goat cheese, chicken and shiitake mushrooms are
cloaked in a lovely Chardonnay sauce brightened with tomato. Few Italian
restaurants achieve a pasta dough this supple. It's a beautifully light,
graceful dish.</TE>
<TE>   When he turns his hand to salads, the results are lively and
delicious. He dresses leaves of arugula, that sharp, irresistible green,
in extra virgin olive oil piquant with Meyer lemon and shallots. Sheaves
of romaine hearts are napped in a fine Caesar dressing.</TE>
<TE>   My only disappointment is that for someone so obviously skilled,
Garvin seems to be playing it too safe. The menu hasn't changed a hair
since he's opened, except for the occasional specials. I wish he'd take a
few more chances, but perhaps that will come with time. The wine list,
too, could use more depth. But the service is always personable and
professional.</TE>
<TE>   I'd order the roasted Colorado rack of lamb or the grilled bone-in
rib-eye steak any day over the sauteed Atlantic salmon, which, despite a
white wine sauce with baby artichokes, is a bit dull. Sometimes Garvin
varies the chops with a green peppercorn sauce instead of the usual Port
reduction, which, by the way, is never too sweet or gelatinous. The
roasted half chicken is quite good, too. Spurting juice, it's lightly
scented with rosemary and garlic, and accompanied by a medley of
potatoes. Vegetables are invariably nicely done, whether it's freshly
pureed potatoes, sauteed haricots verts or a garnish of fried onion
rings.</TE>
<TE>   On a quiet weekday night after 8, Garvin is already out of his chef's
whites--dressed in a pullover, pencil stuck behind his ear, doing
paperwork--when more diners arrive. Soon he's bopping between the dining
room and the kitchen, carrying out plates and, for our table, presenting
the desserts as he dusts powdered sugar from his hands.</TE>
<TE>   There's a demure warm apple tart, a swirl of thinly sliced Granny
Smith apples on a short pastry crust with a buttery caramel sauce and a
ball of vanilla ice cream. Banana mousse cake is more like a banana
pudding crowned with sliced caramelized bananas. Try the ice cream
sundae, too, which is three chocolate chip cookies layered with vanilla
ice cream and a house-made chocolate sauce.</TE>
<TE>   G. Garvin's is off to a promising start for such a young restaurant.
Catch it before it becomes impossible to get a reservation.</TE>

<HD>Two Sons, Two Accidents, a Mother's Endless Pain</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Car crashes killed both in the space of a year. She
struggles to carry on with life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGIE WAGNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>Dust lingers on pictures of the two brown-haired boys. There are
candles from the vigils, T-shirts that haven't been washed.</LD>
<LD>   The mother guides her hand over the memories--the night light her
younger son left on when he was afraid, the Green Bay Packers pillow of
her elder son.</LD>
<LD>   The first accident was almost two years ago. A driver on drugs ran
over and killed 14-year-old Scott Garner Jr. Then, little more than a
year later, her first son, 19-year-old Joseph William Harvey, was killed
by a drunken driver.</LD>
<TE>   The pain creeps over their mother, as if her body is burning.</TE>
<TE>   "I just stay confused," Vicki Gould says. "When I have one of those
really bad days, I think, why did it have to be both of them?"</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing remarkable about that day, March 19, 2000, when
Gould dropped off her son at the Family Court building for his community
service.</TE>
<TE>   Gould and her third husband, Doug, knew Scotty was hanging out with
the wrong crowd. He was living with his father across town when he got
arrested for waiting outside a house as an older boy went inside and
stole money. It was the first time he had been in trouble, his mother
said.</TE>
<TE>   More trouble followed; Scotty was caught with marijuana at school. A
juvenile judge ordered him to perform 40 hours of community service.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturdays and Sundays, Gould would take the seventh-grader to the
court building and watch him get into a van with other juvenile
offenders. They were split into work crews assigned to pick up trash
around Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Once, Scotty told his stepfather that in between picking up trash, the
teens chased lizards.</TE>
<TE>   It hardly seemed dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   That Sunday was Scotty's fourth day of community service--he only had
one more day left.</TE>
<TE>   He had recently moved in with his mother, and the next day he was to
enroll in a new junior high, hoping to make a fresh start.</TE>
<TE>   She took Scotty to McDonald's, as she always did on those weekends.
When they got to the court building, Scotty volunteered to ride with a
different work crew. He was going to see his father--Gould's second
husband--when he was done.</TE>
<TE>   Gould went about her day, repotting plants, buying groceries. She was
at the store when her husband Doug got a call at home.</TE>
<TE>   Scotty and five other teens on the work crew had been struck by a van
driven by Jessica Williams, a 22-year-old former topless dancer who
admitted smoking marijuana and using Ecstasy before plowing into the
teens picking up trash along Interstate 15. All six were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Gould's legs felt like noodles; they buckled beneath her. She was
there, but she wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   She wanted to see him, just to be sure. A funeral home worker said she
shouldn't; he didn't look like Scotty.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Does he have just that little patch of hair here?' " she
says, pointing to her bangs.</TE>
<TE>   Yes. He had just gotten a funny haircut.</TE>
<TE>   Scotty was the daring one, the one who liked skateboarding and dirt
bikes and wanted to be a Navy SEAL. But he also would bring his mother
flowers for no reason and tea when she was sick. The day before his
death, he had brought her five pink carnations.</TE>
<TE>   After the accident, family and friends filled Vicki and Doug's house.
Her elder son, Joseph, who lived with his father in Bakersfield, arrived
the next day.</TE>
<TE>   One of Gould's pink carnations was buried with Scotty; she kept the
others. Scotty was buried in his BMX riding suit, a Christmas present
from Vicki and Doug. His stepfather had made him a deal--save your money
for a dirt bike and he would pay for half.</TE>
<TE>   Scotty never got to try out his suit on a new bike.</TE>
<TE>   Gould went into therapy and took medication for depression and
anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   She finally went to the highway to look at the crash site. A
prosecutor gave her a picture of Scotty's body on the side of the road,
but she couldn't look at it.</TE>
<TE>   Television news reports show repeated footage from the crash scene,
bodies covered with sheets.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to know which one is him," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Gould wanted to sing a song, "One More Day," for her son at the
sentencing of the driver who killed him, but it wasn't allowed. The woman
was sentenced to a minimum of 18 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Gould began spending more time with Joseph, visiting him in
Bakersfield and buying him bus tickets to Las Vegas, where they went for
drives and rode the rides together at an amusement park.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make sure he would be OK, to get him to talk about it,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph lived with his father--Gould's first husband and the father of
her two daughters--but visited often and would spend summers and
vacations with his mother.</TE>
<TE>   At 19, he was going to graduate from high school in October 2001. He
and Scotty had both repeated the fifth grade. But Joseph had been
attending summer school to catch up and worked as a security guard at a
convention center.</TE>
<TE>   He loved the job because he got to see monster truck shows and rock
groups such as Def Leppard.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph was more sensitive, the son who taught his mother the words to
a "Beauty and the Beast" song and took care of his 100-year-old
great-grandmother. He still liked to play army in the woods.</TE>
<TE>   He and Scotty talked on the phone often and put on silly plays for
their mother.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph started writing poetry about his half-brother and read the
poems to his mother.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't realize the depth of his grief," Doug says. "He wanted to
be with his brother. He wanted his brother to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Last Aug. 19, Joseph and some friends had been camping in a cabin
outside Bakersfield. A friend, 37-year-old Robert Grabinski, offered to
drive them home. Joseph was in the jump seat of the pickup truck with the
15-year-old sister of a friend who rode in front with Grabinski.</TE>
<TE>   The girl told authorities she begged Grabinski to slow down. But he
passed a car on a curve and lost control. The truck overturned; Joseph
smashed through the windshield and hit a rock. The others survived.</TE>
<TE>   The unthinkable had happened again.</TE>
<TE>   Vicki threw down the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "I just screamed, 'There's no way.' "</TE>
<TE>   Grabinski had been drinking and taking pain pills that day, the
Highway Patrol said.</TE>
<TE>   He pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter while driving under
the influence and was sentenced to four years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Friendships she formed with families of other DUI crash victims
somehow changed after her second son died.</TE>
<TE>   Her torment is constant. Doug helps wipe away her tears. She won't go
back to the McDonald's where she took Scotty. The car she drove to drop
him off for community service is in storage.</TE>
<TE>   An anti-drunk driving group planted a tree for Scotty, but not for
Joseph because he wasn't killed in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Friends call and come by, but conversation is awkward. She forgets
answers to simple questions. Often, she is in a daze and unaware of
conversations.</TE>
<TE>   She was fired from her hospital job because she took too much time off
to mourn; Doug was laid off from his job as a truck driver.</TE>
<TE>   This day, she is looking for a certain photograph of her boys
together, one she knows she has. But she can't find it and she punishes
herself with tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to think of the good memories," Gould says, clenching her
fists. "Sometimes it's like I can't find any. That bothers me."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the memory comes. It's a tree Scotty used to climb when he
was younger and always needed his mother to help him down.</TE>
<TE>   In her walks around the neighborhood she pauses at some black marks on
the concrete. They're from Scotty's in-line skates, and it soothes her to
see them, to imagine him skating.</TE>
<TE>   She can't comprehend what has happened. It's so strange, both boys
stolen from her.</TE>
<TE>   "I do wonder all the time, how can I do this?" Gould says, sitting on
the couch in her living room.</TE>
<TE>   She tries to dream about them, but never has.</TE>
<TE>   Often, she goes to the beach in California, where she spends hours
alone near the water.</TE>
<TE>   She curls up on a towel, watches the waves and looks into the sky.
Once, she swore she saw a wispy "S" in the clouds.</TE>
<TE>   "But is it because I just imagined it so much?" she wonders.</TE>
<TE>   She waits until evening comes and the sun fades, when calm envelops
her. It is then that comfort comes, if only in a small way.</TE>
<TE>   "I must be just blessed," she says. Blessed that they didn't suffer in
death. Blessed that they're together now--angels to watch over her.</TE>

<HD>Bias Breeds Bitterness, French Muslims Warn</HD>
<DH>Culture: Post-9/11 climate makes life even more difficult. 'How do
we fit into a society that despises us?' one asks.</DH>

<DL>AULNAY-SOUS-BOIS, France
</DL>
<LD>A hulking tin-sided factory that once made brake parts is now a
holy place. Each Friday, Muslims file inside to escape for a while from a
world they see turning against them.</LD>
<LD>   "We are the enemy," said Munir Mouiseddine, 24, a skilled maintenance
technician with no job. "It was bad enough before. Since Sept. 11, it is
impossible. How are we supposed to earn a living?"</LD>
<LD>   He graduated first in his engineering class of 60. But at job
interviews, he is told vacancies have been filled. "As soon as they see
my Arab face, I'm out," he said. "That makes you jealous, bitter,
desperate."</LD>
<TE>   Another young Muslim in Aulnay's immigrant quarter, who would call
himself only Abdul, repeated the lament: "How do we fit into a society
that despises us?"</TE>
<TE>   Social workers say racism is a significant part of the problem, and is
being worsened by the terrorism scare.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul makes pizzas at Charles de Gaulle Airport but fears for his job.
Other airport employees say police have canceled security clearances for
many young Arabs, usually without explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "We hate what terrorists did in America in God's name as much as
anyone," Abdul said. "And we pay the price."</TE>
<TE>   The northern end of Aulnay is a banlieue, French for suburb and now
code for any of the crime-plagued slums that ring large cities, whether
in France or elsewhere in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Government employment figures make no ethnic breakdown, but economists
see a wide gap between francais de souche, meaning European Frenchmen,
and les immigres, which refers essentially to Arabs and Africans, whether
they are French citizens of long standing or have just arrived in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "People think these are all bad kids, and that's totally wrong," said
Stephane Girard, an Aulnay city consultant. "Some employers tell me
outright they don't want Arabs. Some just quietly discriminate."</TE>
<TE>   France's 5-million-strong Muslim community is Europe's largest. Most
originate from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, former French territories,
living in banlieues or run-down inner cities.</TE>
<TE>   Although one young man from Aulnay was seized in Afghanistan and taken
to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, police investigators say that so far,
relatively few operatives of terror networks such as Al Qaeda come from
these destitute areas.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda recruiters have focused most actively on large South Asian
and Arab communities in Britain, police say. Even there, recruits
apparently number in the hundreds from a total population of 2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Sleeper" cells uncovered in Germany and Italy seem to have reached a
limited few. Zacarias Moussaoui, a French-Algerian arrested in Minnesota
and allegedly linked to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, is from a
middle-class family in southern France.</TE>
<TE>   But unless things get better, police and social scientists warn, the
potential in France--and elsewhere in Europe, with an additional 9
million Muslims--is hair-raising.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, terrorism is a natural outlet if someone sees no future,
no way out, in an atmosphere of exclusion," said Lucienne Bui Trong,
recently retired as head of France's urban violence intelligence unit.</TE>
<TE>   She said Muslim extremists began recruiting in the banlieues in 1992
but until recently had little success. Now, she added, authorities are
treating the threat with new urgency.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism is only one fear. Police worry that the banlieues, still a
cultural mix of immigrants and European French, will become desperate
ghettos with warring gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Already, handguns and even semiautomatic rifles appear with alarming
frequency. 'Le drive-by shooting' is now a familiar French term.</TE>
<TE>   L'insecurite, meaning a generalized fear of violent, disaffected
juveniles--already dominates the French presidential campaign, months
before the final vote May 5.</TE>
<TE>   A harsh stand against North African immigration has restored the
extreme right-wing candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen, to lost limelight.
Opinion polls suggest his support is back at 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Sophie Body-Gendrot, a Sorbonne University professor who has studied
urban violence across America, warned in a comprehensive report for the
French government of worsening problems if there are no changes.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids have no future, no dignity, and they have no release for
their violence," she said in an interview. "They live in cement blocks
with nothing else. What can you expect them to do?"</TE>
<TE>   Police often worsen the situation by humiliating youths, she added.
"They provoke. They order kids to look down, to avert their eyes. They
insult them. This creates an obvious mistrust and tension."</TE>
<TE>   So far, she said, the worst of European slum violence still does not
approach that of large American cities. But while U.S. figures are
stabilizing, armed robbery and assault are rising fast in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Body-Gendrot says home-grown peculiarities, such as starting fires and
then ambushing the firefighters, suggest a nihilistic rejection of social
values that leaves youths vulnerable--not just to traditional predators
such as drug dealers, but to Islamic zealots in search of recruits for
holy war.</TE>
<TE>   This in turn poisons the image of the overwhelming majority who reject
extremism.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, there is the occasional hard-core fanatic, but that's the rare
exception," said Mouiseddine, the jobless technician. "For most of us,
the mosque is the only place where we feel some hope. It makes us better,
not worse."</TE>
<TE>   A two-year French government study of 48 sermons in 23 mosques found
that imams preached nonviolence and civic responsibility, linking evils
of the world to humankind's general failings.</TE>
<TE>   Social workers with long experience in French banlieues say that
although many youths drink alcohol and skip Friday prayers, this sort of
Islam helps keep many out of more serious trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "For youngsters caught between two cultures, religion helps to frame
their life, to show them a purpose in life," said Dominique Barrot, who
has worked with delinquents for 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   All across Europe, Islamic leaders say they notice increased
attendance at Friday prayers. Many say young people express new interest
in the Koran, the Prophet Muhammad's teachings and Ramadan, the Muslim
month of fasting.</TE>
<TE>   At Aulnay's morning market, religious music reverberates from
speakers, and stalls selling Islamic texts do a brisk business. Men
collect money from passers-by to outfit the newly converted mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians have talked a lot about the need for "integration" and
"assimilation" into the mainstream, but nowadays the more commonly heard
buzzword is "exclusion."</TE>
<TE>   For generations, the French have sought to blend different ethnic
groups from their colonies around the world into a single seamless
society.</TE>
<TE>   In December, all of France mourned Leopold Sedar Senghor, a poet who
led Senegal to independence in 1960 and was its president for 20 years.
Senghor was married to a Frenchwoman, retired to Normandy, and was a
member of the hallowed Academie Francaise.</TE>
<TE>   But such concrete examples are few. In recent years many French-born
children of les immigres have gone in a separate direction, reacting to a
feeling of exclusion by returning to cultural and religious roots.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 6, French leaders attended a soccer match near Paris between
France and Algeria, meant to symbolize the end of decades of tension left
over from the Algerians' bloody war of independence.</TE>
<TE>   They grimaced as young French citizens of Algerian stock catcalled
during "La Marseillaise," the national anthem. Then, after Francescored
its fourth goal, French-Algerians spilled onto the playing field, and
millions of TV viewers saw the reconciliation match end in a brawl.</TE>
<TE>   Francois Heisbourg, head of the International Institute of Strategic
Studies in London and a veteran French defense analyst, warns that these
surface signs hide a serious threat of divided loyalties.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to find a way to make these young people feel proud or you
will lose them," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Heisbourg fears a new and permanent worldwide fight against what he
calls "hyper-terrorism," and says it's critical to avoid negative
stereotypes about Islam that play into the hands of radicals preaching
religious violence.</TE>
<TE>   Already, many Muslims are on the defensive, and apt to misinterpret
attempts to better understand their fears.</TE>
<TE>   One recent Friday, an American journalist, invited by a young man to
the cavernous former factory that is Aulnay mosque, took his place on the
worn carpets spread out on the second floor.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, an angry member of a local Islamic association ejected
him without explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is so afraid," observed Nassera Benaddi, a young mother who
helped to organize a group called 1001 Ideas to find ways to educate and
occupy Aulnay youth.</TE>
<TE>   She praised the city for funneling millions of dollars' worth of
municipal and European Union aid into the immigrant neighborhoods to
underwrite job training.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she adds, it is an uphill fight. She said her own brother
nearly broke down when, having worked so hard at school, he couldn't get
a job.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a good kid, sweet and gentle, and I've heard him crying alone
at night," Benaddi said. "If it hadn't been for my mother, I think he'd
have turned out bad like so many of his friends."</TE>
<TE>   Like many slum youths who try to avoid trouble, she added, he has a
record because he stepped in to break up a fight, and police hurrying to
the scene arrested the first person they saw--her brother.</TE>
<TE>   Down the street, Taher Boubahri, a Tunisian whose wife runs a
different organization to help youngsters, said a renewed interest in
Islam was keeping the problems in check--for now.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids learn about the prophet, practice Ramadan, and it gives
them a purpose," he said. "But that's not enough. If they haven't got
enough to buy a cigarette or sandwich, they're likely to do anything."</TE>

<HD>Onetime Oasis Beset by Sands of Time</HD>
<DH>Australia: These days, Woomera houses a detention center for
asylum-seekers. Its glory days came decades ago, as a military outpost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE CORDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WOOMERA, Australia
</DL>
<LD>Five emus pick their way out of the scrub of the Outback and wander
across a road and into a backyard as a cloud of red dust blows between
almost deserted three-story apartment buildings.</LD>
<LD>   In Woomera, a tiny town in the baking heart of Australia, the desert
seems to be trying to claw back land taken from it just over 50 years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Built from scratch in 1947 to house workers at a joint
British-Australian missile-testing base, Woomera is now making headlines
as home to Australia's most notorious detention center for illegal
immigrants--a collection of huts enclosed by high fences and razor wire
on a barren plain that stretches through a shimmering heat haze as far as
the eye can see, and well beyond.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of asylum-seekers from Afghanistan, Iraq and South Asia are
held in the camp during processing of their applications for refugee
status, which can take up to three years.</TE>
<TE>   A mile away, the town itself is an oasis of green in the vast, parched
expanse of central Australia. The green comes courtesy of fresh water
piped from Port Augusta, the nearest town, 110 miles to the south.</TE>
<TE>   Houses and apartment buildings are set out on tree-lined streets in a
roughly square grid. Models of rockets and aircraft tested at Woomera are
dotted around the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "Woomera really is a very pretty, tidy, pleasant town to live in. It
just happens to be in the middle of nowhere," said Bob McKenzie, who
oversees the community for the Australian Defense Force, which owns the
land and all the buildings.</TE>
<TE>   At the height of the missile range's use, Woomera--the name is an
Aboriginal word meaning spear thrower--boasted a population of 7,000.
Now, only about 400 people live here.</TE>
<TE>   From the early 1970s a steady stream of Americans passed through town
when they were posted at Nurrungar, a nearby U.S. defense satellite
monitoring station. But with Nurrungar's closure in October 1999, much of
the energy ebbed out of Woomera.</TE>
<TE>   "It really was great living here," said Henriette Greenfield, a
resident for 10 years. "Then the Americans left and a whole lot of
uncertainty entered the town."</TE>
<TE>   Work provided by the detention center is helping Woomera survive. But
even that is threatened, with the government saying it may close the
center as part of a deal that ended a recent two-week hunger strike by
asylum seekers.</TE>
<TE>   Greenfield, who heads Woomera Board, a panel that advises McKenzie on
community developments, is one of the few residents prepared to discuss
the town and its relationship with the detention center.</TE>
<TE>   McKenzie puts people's reticence down to Woomera's history as a
defense-dominated settlement. "Until 1982, the whole town was fenced
off," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Streets are generally deserted in the summer as temperatures hover
around 104 degrees most days, making it an ordeal just to cross the road.</TE>
<TE>   McKenzie concedes summers are uncomfortable, but says mild winters
with virtually nonstop sunny days make up for it.</TE>
<TE>   "Climatically, it's a very, very nice place," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To make life as comfortable as possible for the servicemen and women
originally sent to Woomera, the Australian military provided as many
leisure facilities as possible since the nearest city, Adelaide, is 310
miles to the south.</TE>
<TE>   The town has a movie theater, which opens on the weekends, a bowling
alley, a small wildlife park and a floodlit sports ground--the largest
patch of green grass for hundreds of miles--as well as a well-equipped
gym and a swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   There is one pub, which doubles as a hotel and restaurant and is
trying to establish itself as a "center of Outback cuisine," McKenzie
said.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent party, the chef turned out dishes including sushi,
marinated camel skewers and a terrine of hare and kangaroo. Camels roam
wild through the Outback, the descendants of animals brought to Australia
as pack animals in the 19th century by explorers seeking to open up the
Outback.</TE>
<TE>   Local authorities hope work at the rocket range will pick up again.
There are four or five consortiums looking at using the range for
projects including development of a new supersonic jet and testing of a
planned NASA escape module for the international space station, McKenzie
said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his optimism, he concedes the town probably will never return
to the days when it was thronging with 7,000 people. The projects
considering using the site are smaller than in the past, and increased
technology means fewer employees are needed.</TE>
<TE>   And with the dwindling population, even one of the great joys of life
in the Outback is not as much fun as it used to be.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to have fantastic barbecues when heaps of people came,"
Greenfield said. "We still have barbecues, but only two families come."</TE>

<DH>Austria: The warm, dry Alpine wind recalls Santa Anas. When it
howls, people get achy and sleepless, and the crime rate even spikes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM J. KOLE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>INNSBRUCK, Austria
</DL>
<LD>Puffs of snow explode from wind-whipped fir trees and sparkle in a
sunny valley. Propelled by the same gusts, pink clouds scud across an
azure sky.</LD>
<LD>   It's a postcard-perfect February day in the Tirolean Alps--and Erika
Jost couldn't be more miserable. It's not the flu, it's the foehn--the
infamous ill wind that Austrians love to hate.</LD>
<LD>   "It gives me migraines. It exhausts me. It makes me feel crabby," said
Jost, massaging her temples behind the counter of her cafe. "It's really
awful. When the foehn starts to blow, I just cringe."</LD>
<TE>   She's not alone. Across Austria, and in parts of Switzerland, Italy
and Germany, when the foehn howls, people moan. The unusually warm, dry
gusts--a touch of spring in the middle of winter--are blamed for tension
headaches, backaches, hot flashes, nausea and sleepless nights.</TE>
<TE>   Police notice a spike in traffic accidents and crime. Cattle and other
animals become restless and won't eat. Students get so distracted that
schools in Innsbruck postpone exams, and Swiss researchers have
documented a 20% rise in suicides.</TE>
<TE>   In western Austria and parts of Switzerland, the foehn is recognized
as a mitigating factor in criminal proceedings. The foehn defense won't
get charges dropped, but judges have issued lighter sentences in a few
cases.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists aren't sure why the foehn makes so many people feel under
the weather. But when it's blowing, it's the talk of Austria. Newspapers
print front-page forecasts warning that the wind is likely to aggravate
rheumatism or make scars hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything changes--even the light. The clouds look different. It's
eerie," said Thomas Poppe, a German author who lives just outside Vienna
and writes about natural phenomena. "People tend to feel very subdued."</TE>
<TE>   Hermann Hesse, the great Swiss writer, noticed. "There is nothing
stranger than foehn fever, which robs one of sleep and provokes all the
senses," wrote the author of "Steppenwolf" and "Siddhartha."</TE>
<TE>   Meteorologists call a wind a foehn (pronounced "fern") when it blows
warm and dry from the south, compressing the air as it sweeps down the
slopes.</TE>
<TE>   The Alpine foehn, which originates in the Sahara, is a cousin of the
Santa Ana winds that fan fires in Southern California, the Chinook winds
that rage across the Rockies, and the dreaded mistral known for fouling
French tempers.</TE>
<TE>   Although April is the cruelest month for foehn winds, they can occur
year-round. In winter they melt snow and raise the risk of avalanches.</TE>
<TE>   A blast of warm, dry air in midwinter might sound pleasant, but the
Vienna-based Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics likens the
foehn to standing up in a convertible while zipping down a highway in
July: It might feel good for a few seconds, but no longer.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures can soar from freezing to 60 degrees in as little as two
hours, and gusts have been clocked at 100 mph, enough to rip off roofs
and topple trees, said foehn expert Patrick Haechler, senior forecaster
at the Swiss national weather service.</TE>
<TE>   He suspects that tiny changes in atmospheric pressure might explain
the lousy moods, though he's skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be an excuse to have a bad day," Haechler said. "There does
seems to be a link between human feeling and the foehn. It's just that,
scientifically, it's very difficult to document or explain."</TE>
<TE>   But sufferers say they know a foehn when they feel it. More than one
in three people surveyed in January by Germany's Allensbach Institute
said foehn-like weather noticeably affected their health, and nearly one
in five reported a strong influence. The telephone survey of 1,000 people
gave no margin of error.</TE>
<TE>   Jost, the cafe owner, said she won't drive in Innsbruck when the foehn
is blowing "because there are so many accidents. People don't seem to pay
attention to where they're going."</TE>
<TE>   The foehn isn't all bad. It can give farmers a longer crop-growing
season and can even save lives, as five Californians discovered when they
were lost in the Alps two winters ago and a sudden foehn saved them from
freezing.</TE>
<TE>   And not everyone feels the foehn the same: It gives a lucky few an
adrenaline rush.</TE>
<TE>   "One extreme is the headache and exhaustion," said Poppe, the author.
"The other is 'Aah, great!' the way you feel when you drink a glass of
champagne."</TE>

<DH>History: Age-old conflicts have a way of resurfacing while leaders
are busy looking toward the future.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years ago, the world seemed radiant with optimism and
confidence. The Cold War was over. The Gulf War had ended in what looked
like a stunning triumph of American military might. Peace was breaking
out across the globe. Humanity finally seemed to be turning its back on
war and conflict.</LD>
<LD>   The future offered a gleaming vista of peace and prosperity, of a
global village united by trade, modern technology and peaceful resolution
of disputes. War was out of date. E-mails would replace bullets.</LD>
<LD>   A decade later, much of the hope and optimism is shattered. Wars and
rebellions that have lasted for decades, even centuries, show no sign of
ending despite the efforts of armies of diplomats and peacekeepers. The
Middle East, Kashmir, Northern Ireland, the Balkans--the bloody, baffling
list seems unending.</LD>
<TE>   The United States, which would seem far too powerful for any rational
nation to attack, faces a bewildering global fight against terrorists
motivated by historic grudges. President Bush, whose father saw out the
Cold War, now sees the West arrayed against a new "axis of evil"
consisting of Iran, Iraq and North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   To many people, especially in the West, the state of the world makes
no sense. The past keeps tripping up the future. Old wars and old hatreds
seem insoluble and unending even though many of the fighters can't
explain very clearly what they are fighting for. As the power of religion
and ideology has declined in the West, it has become harder for many
Westerners to grasp how seriously it is taken by societies elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Ford, founder of the automobile company, spoke for many, then
and now, when he said in 1916: "History is more or less bunk."</TE>
<TE>   Europe was being ripped apart by World War I and millions had been
killed. America was determined not to be dragged into the Old World's
madness, but within months it was fighting in a war that began in the
Balkans in 1914. By century's end, the Balkans would be burning again,
and American forces would be bombing Slobodan Milosevic's Serbia.</TE>
<TE>   To Ford, the past was dark and dismal. All that counted was building a
better future, and it seemed to be emerging as effortlessly as the Model
T cars that flowed off the conveyor belts of his factories.</TE>
<TE>   James Joyce saw it very differently. "History is a nightmare from
which I am trying to wake," the great author wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as now, his native Ireland was being torn by a conflict
stretching back to the Middle Ages.</TE>
<TE>   Time and again, humanity has believed it stood on the brink of a great
new future, an era of peace, prosperity and progress. Time and again, the
past seems to have reached out to wreck that hope.</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing new about the optimism 10 years ago at the end of
the Cold War. In 1900, the Western world thought it was entering a new
era of science, peace and progress. Instead, the 20th century was the
bloodiest epoch in Western history.</TE>
<TE>   Optimism tinged the dawn of the 1800s, when visionaries believed
science and the spirit of the American and French revolutions would
transform life. But that century, too, was torn by war and suffering.</TE>
<TE>   History is often positive, with people taking pride in their ancestors
and drawing on it to unite a country, shaping national character and
identity.</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans celebrate the American Revolution and the end of the
Civil War, just as the French remember their revolution of 1789 with an
annual parade.</TE>
<TE>   But why do so many people focus on the negative, fighting old battles
and old wars? Why not forget the past and build something better?</TE>
<TE>   Because, historians say, the present is only the product of the past
and no one can cut themselves off from history.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Abraham Lincoln said in the depths of the Civil War: "Fellow
citizens, we cannot escape history."</TE>
<TE>   Conflict can last for centuries because some ancient battle has become
a vital part of a nation's identity--especially when the losing side is
still living in poverty while the victors prosper.</TE>
<TE>   Modern Serbs are haunted by defeat at the Battle of Kosovo Field in
1389, believing it deprived their nation of its destiny. Lines drawn on
the map of Africa by European colonialists dividing up the continent in
the 19th century cause conflict in the 21st century because those pencil
strokes forced together rival ethnic and sectarian groups. Some Afghans
refer to Westerners as "Franks," a reference to the European Crusaders of
the Middle Ages, even though the Crusades never came within 1,000 miles
of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   History is divided into periods to make it easier to study. But the
division of time into segments like the Middle Ages or the 19th century
misleadingly suggests history has neat beginnings and ends. It doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Osama bin Laden, a product of modern tensions in the Middle East, can
also be seen as part of a historic clash between Western and Eastern
civilization dating to the ancient Greeks in the 6th century B.C. Bin
Laden brands the West as Crusaders to try to invoke historic resentment
by evoking wars that ended more than 700 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The end of the Cold War, instead of ushering in peace, saw the
reemergence of much older conflicts that had been put on hold or covered
up by the global struggle between East and West.</TE>
<TE>   In the former Soviet Union, centuries-old struggles between rival
ethnic and sectarian groups flared; Yugoslavia became a killing field of
ancient national and sectarian conflicts; Afghanistan, already shattered
by a Cold War proxy battle between the Soviets and the West, sank back
into the historic struggle among ethnic groups and meddling neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The modern struggle between India and Pakistan is shaped by the lines
drawn on the map by Britain when it divided its Indian empire into Hindu
and Muslim states in 1947. The two nations have clashed ever since,
trying to change those lines. But the conflict can be taken further back,
to the Muslim invasions of India and the clash of long-forgotten
kingdoms.</TE>
<TE>   When 19th-century novelist George Eliot wrote, "The happiest nations
have no history," she knew there was no such thing.</TE>
<TE>   Western civilization has been profoundly influenced by a belief in
progress. "It was scarcely possible . . . to conceive of historical
change except as change for the better," wrote the English historian E.H.
Carr.</TE>
<TE>   But the idea of history as progress often creates a blinkered view and
makes it hard to understand the importance of the past.</TE>
<TE>   The Middle East seems to Westerners a helpless quagmire of war and
instability. A thousand years ago, it was very different. Europe was a
welter of petty, military dictatorships, while the Middle East was
exporting scientific and philosophical thought.</TE>

<DL>ATHENS
</DL>
<LD>Athens is getting a face lift--not to hide age but to celebrate it.</LD>
<LD>   The capital is cleaning up its cluttered skyline in an effort to
restore some of the city's ancient glory for the 2004 Olympic Games.</LD>
<LD>   Armed with cranes and new legal powers, construction crews are tearing
down advertising signs that obscure views of the 2,500-year-old Parthenon
and other ancient monuments in the center of Athens.</LD>
<TE>   Glaring ads for weight-loss clubs welded to the sides of buildings are
coming down, as are insurance companies' neon signs and rooftop
billboards with giant pictures of hamburgers and cigarette packets.</TE>
<TE>   City officials aren't stopping at signs that block views. Attacking
what many people have long considered eyesores, they are removing all
10,000 advertising signs downtown that are illegally placed above the
first floor of a building.</TE>
<TE>   The work is part of a $36-million urban improvement project to
refurbish monuments and replace noisy roads that connect ancient sites
with cobbled pedestrian walkways. Sign removal is expected to cost
$685,000, after businesses are charged up to $2,700 for removing illegal
signs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very big task . . . there are signs everywhere," says Yiota
Goni, an official at the government agency in charge of the renewal
project, known as the Unification of Archeological Sites in Athens.</TE>
<TE>   The redevelopment project is Athens' biggest since Greece won its
independence from the Ottoman Empire some 170 years ago, when its main
public buildings and roads were constructed.</TE>
<TE>   Most of a new walkway around the Acropolis Hill, home to the
Parthenon, has been finished. But generally the work is going slowly in a
city crowded with more than 4 million of Greece's 11 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Each billboard takes hours to dismantle and can only be removed on
weekends, when crews do not disrupt traffic or business. And most
weekends, only one crew is working.</TE>
<TE>   But Goni maintains that sign removal, which began last year, will be
finished before the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is happy about the sprucing up.</TE>
<TE>   Business owners are furious at losing their advertising. At least one
came to blows recently with a construction crew dismantling a billboard.</TE>
<TE>   Some Athenians are also upset about lengthy road detours caused by the
work on the new pedestrian paths.</TE>
<TE>   Others have little faith that much can be done to improve the looks of
the heavily built-up city.</TE>
<TE>   "At least the advertisements add some color," said Marios Tsangaris, a
29-year-old musician. "If they take them away, there will just be gray
buildings left."</TE>

<HD>Angolan Army Claims Slaying of Rebel Leader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CASIMIRO SIONA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LUANDA, Angola
</DL>
<LD>Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rebel group that has fought the
government and frustrated peace efforts for nearly three decades, was
killed Friday in a military attack on UNITA forces in southeast Angola,
the army and government said.</LD>
<LD>   The armed forces said Savimbi, 67, died around 3 p.m. in an offensive
in Moxico province.</LD>
<LD>   There was no independent confirmation of the claim. UNITA officials,
who are hiding in the Angolan bush, were not available for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Savimbi was a key U.S. ally during the 1980s as the United States
sought to counter Soviet advances in Africa. His influence waned,
however, as the Soviet Union came apart and U.S. relations with Angola
improved over the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   If confirmed, Savimbi's death could open the way for long-lasting
peace in the southwest African country where civil war has raged off and
on for 27 years.</TE>
<TE>   Half a million people are believed to have died because of the war,
though there are no confirmed figures. About 4 million people--roughly
one-third of the population--have been driven from their homes by the
fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Savimbi's animosity toward President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who has
ruled since 1977, has repeatedly frustrated international efforts to end
the fighting. Three peace deals have collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   The government said Friday it was ready to fully implement a 1994
peace accord calling for regular democratic elections.</TE>
<TE>   Aldemiro Vaz de Conceicao, the presidential spokesman, said the army
was holding Savimbi's body in Moxico.</TE>
<TE>   In several neighborhoods, local residents hooted their car horns in
celebration Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Police urged calm. Two police helicopters hovered over the coastal
city, and red tracers from automatic weapons fired by the presidential
guard streaked across the night sky. Several thousand elite troops were
guarding the presidential palace on the outskirts of the capital.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear whether anyone from UNITA's ranks could replace
Savimbi. UNITA Vice President Antonio Dembo and Savimbi's close aide
Paulo Lukamba Gato are believed to be alive and hiding in rural Angola.</TE>
<TE>   His death could also prompt a power struggle within the ruling Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA, which was united by the
fight against Savimbi.</TE>
<TE>   The army in recent months has said it was closing in on Savimbi's
column, which was moving through the rural province of Moxico, about 480
miles southeast of Luanda. Savimbi had not been seen for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Born into a poor family in the village of Munhango in Angola's central
highlands, Savimbi was a university-educated guerrilla who spoke three
African languages and four European languages.</TE>
<TE>   He founded UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola, in 1966 to battle the colonial
Portuguese administration, and ruled the group ruthlessly for three
decades.</TE>
<TE>   Savimbi became a key player in the Cold War struggle for dominance in
Africa, becoming a proxy for the United States and South Africa in the
battle against the Marxist government.</TE>
<TE>   Savimbi enjoyed the strong support during the 1980s of the Reagan
administration, which saw him as a stalwart anti-communist rebel in his
fight against the pro-Soviet government and its Cuban allies. He was
received at the White House like a head of state in 1986, and Savimbi's
UNITA forces received millions in covert American assistance.</TE>

<HD>Pair Race to Save Castoff Horses</HD>
<DH>Animals: They arrange 'adoptions' for foals born to mares used to
produce Premarin. Otherwise, the offspring could be sold for slaughter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDY LIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SPARTANSBURG, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>Many of the farms that artificially inseminate mares are looking to
sell estrogen, not raise baby horses. That's where Mary Wisniewski and
Don Tucci step in.</LD>
<LD>   The two Pittsburgh natives started their equine adoption agency, For
the Love of Horses Inc., to rescue foals born to mares used in the
production of Premarin, a popular women's hormone replacement drug.</LD>
<LD>   Animal-rights groups say if it weren't for people like Wisniewski and
Tucci, even more of the foals would eventually be sold to feed-lot
operators who send the animals to slaughter for human consumption.</LD>
<TE>   "It's pathetic that humans try to do so much for so many things and
yet discard an offspring like that," said Tucci, 45.</TE>
<TE>   The couple first got involved four years ago when Wisniewski, 44, saw
a television newscast about United Pegasus Foundation, a California horse
adoption group that organizes an annual rescue effort by bidding against
feed lot operators for Premarin foals.</TE>
<TE>   They learned that after the farms were done harvesting estrogen from
the urine of pregnant mares to replace those no longer naturally produced
by the human body, some foals are treated as unwanted byproducts.</TE>
<TE>   Wisniewski paid $500 the next year to adopt a skinny draft horse named
Sweet Dreams. That was followed by a second foal named Harmony the next
year.</TE>
<TE>   "To see the fear in their eyes, that will change your life,"
Wisniewski said. "In fact, it was what changed my life."</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by their adopted foals, the couple decided to become one in a
number of small rescue groups across the country. They purchased a
165-acre farm in Spartansburg, about 30 miles southeast of Erie, in
November 2000 and spent the past year putting up fences, cleaning out two
old dairy barns and caring for the horses on a limited budget.</TE>
<TE>   The couple traded their spacious brick home for the farm's modest
white house, used nearly $250,000 of their own money from a small country
crafts business and toiled long days in the barn.</TE>
<TE>   In September, with the help of United Pegasus' president Helen
Meredith, the couple brought 13 foals to the Spartansburg farm. They
charge a $600 adoption fee for each horse, which covers a veterinary
test, border fees from Canada--where many of the foals come from--and
transportation costs.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to place as many young foals as possible and give them homes
where they'll get long-term quality care," said Wisniewski.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 12 have been adopted.</TE>
<TE>   Animal rights groups estimate that mares kept on so-called PMU
(pregnant mares' urine) farms live only eight to nine years, compared
with a natural life span between 20 and 30.</TE>
<TE>   When they can no longer get pregnant, they and many of the foals are
sent to slaughter, with some of the meat shipped to Europe and Japan for
human consumption, said Ellen Buck, director of equine protection for the
Humane Society.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to educate women about the source of Premarin and to let
them know there are alternatives," said Buck about synthetic and
vegetable-based drugs.</TE>
<TE>   PMU farms deny that all their horses end up for human consumption.
Some foals are sent to farms that train them as recreational or show
horses.</TE>
<TE>   "The ones the rescue shelters take may be at-risk horses," said Norm
Luba, executive director of North American Equine Ranching Information
Council, which represents 400 ranches in Canada and 22 in North Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   Luba said the farms provide a high standard of veterinary care.
Charges of mistreating the foals when they are transported from PMU farms
for sale are untrue, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Premarin maker Wyeth Ayerst Laboratories said no other drug is as
effective in treating symptoms of menopause and preventing osteoporosis.
Millions of women have come to rely on the drug since it was introduced
in 1942.</TE>
<TE>   Health care industry figures show Premarin accounts for about
two-thirds of the $1.7 billion in hormone replacement medication sold
each year.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue groups say they can barely make a dent in saving some 35,000
foals born on PMU farms, but celebrities like Robert Redford, Richard
Gere and Kim Basinger have helped the cause by sponsoring adoptions.</TE>
<TE>   "The story of Premarin has never really registered in people's minds,"
said businesswoman Andrea Eastman, who has two Premarin foals. "I used to
take Premarin not realizing what I was taking."</TE>

<DL>OVER THE PACIFIC OCEAN
</DL>
<LD>Behind the cockpit of the Gulfstream jet, flight meteorologist Stan
Czyzyk counts the seconds until the next launch of instruments tracking a
storm that is poised to threaten the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   At 41,000 feet above the Pacific Ocean, two engineers at the rear of
the specially modified plane wait for him to utter one word into their
earphones.</LD>
<LD>   "Drop."</LD>
<TE>   At that command, Richard McNamara places a cylinder into a chute and
Dan Lino pushes a button, opening a small trapdoor. The 1-pound cylinder
shoots out with the sucking sound of a vacuum tube at a drive-up bank
window. The airborne container sprouts a tiny parachute for its 20-minute
descent to the Pacific before sinking 14,000 feet to the bottom of the
ocean.</TE>
<TE>   During the seven-hour flight from Anchorage the day before the start
of the Olympics, the crew launched 26 of the pressboard cylinders to
collect data on the developing cold front. The mission was part of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's efforts to survey
severe winter storms born in the vast, largely unmonitored north Pacific
and improve weather forecasts across the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The crew averages five missions every two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're measuring the atmosphere surrounding the storm," said program
manager Jack Parrish, dressed in a blue flight suit like the rest of the
10-man crew aboard the Gulfstream G-IV. "Think of a storm as a floating
cork in a stream. It can only go where the stream takes it. We're
measuring the stream."</TE>
<TE>   From such a high altitude, that meant a smooth ride, other than a bout
of jet-stream turbulence that briefly rattled the 13-seat plane as it
soared high above a frozen cloud. But plenty of chaos lurked in the
science involved during the 3,000-mile flight from the Gulf of Alaska to
the "middle of nowhere" west of the Northern California coast.</TE>
<TE>   The cylinders, priced at $600 apiece, measure humidity, temperature
and the speed and direction of wind at various elevations of their
descent.</TE>
<TE>   On a computer, Czyzyk hustled to process the signals arriving twice
every second. He constantly flipped between screens of solid numbers and
colorful squiggly lines akin to a child's crude drawing.</TE>
<TE>   The incoming data was transmitted by satellite to NOAA's National
Centers for Environmental Predictions in Suitland, Md. There,
supercomputers develop forecast models, incorporating information from
various sources, including the Gulfstream jet, a few scattered weather
buoys and weather balloon launching sites on Adak, Hawaii, and Wake
Island on the other side of the International Dateline.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the atmosphere over the Pacific is not measured, however,
other than by the flyovers launched in 1998 through NOAA's Aircraft
Operations Center. The AOC crew works from Alaska and Hawaii with a team
from the Air Force Reserve.</TE>
<TE>   The computers in Suitland use physics to move predictions forward in
time intervals, creating current weather pictures as well as short- and
long-range forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Reports are distributed to the National Weather Service and picked up
by news outlets and organizations that handle emergency services,
agriculture, aviation and recreation.</TE>
<TE>   The cylinder drops create more accurate, far-reaching forecasts,
giving people extra time to prepare for snowstorms and blizzards,
mudslides, severe winds and floods.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, it means an extra day's lead time on the weather," Parrish
said. That extra time is crucial to plan evacuations, close schools and
warn people to stay indoors. It also helps utility companies share
resources during emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few storms catch you by surprise," Parrish said. "But they could
be 15% to 20% stronger than expected. That information makes a
difference."</TE>
<TE>   The Anchorage leg of NOAA's two-month mission ended Feb. 16. The crew
will trade places with the Air Force Reserve in Honolulu until the
program ends March 20.</TE>
<TE>   During warmer months, storm trackers chase hurricanes from Gulfstream
and other research aircraft based at the Aircraft Operations Center at
MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. Those rougher rides yield higher
doses of adrenaline--and relative calm.</TE>
<TE>   Parrish, an experienced hand at tracking storms, has flown through the
peaceful eye of hurricanes 405 times in his career.</TE>
<TE>   During the recent mission, the NOAA crew followed the northern edge of
the Pacific storm while the Air Force Reserve tracked the southern edge.
The storm was forming 1,000 miles north of Hawaii and 2,000 miles from
the West Coast, traveling east.</TE>
<TE>   Each cylinder drop brought a flurry of calculations for Czyzyk, who
barely had time to pop his lunch into the plane's microwave. But weather
is constantly changing, so speed is essential.</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon, Parrish offered to take over for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is a good time," Czyzyk said. "There's nothing to do for the next
minute, 15 seconds."</TE>
<TE>   By late in the day, the forecast showed ideal conditions for the
Winter Games.</TE>

<HD>Freed Prisoner Leaves Past Behind</HD>
<DH>Justice: He was released a year ago when DNA tests cleared him of
murder. After almost 10 years on death row, he prepares for his wedding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONJA BARISIC</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va.
</DL>
<LD>A year out of prison, Earl Washington Jr. is full of plans.</LD>
<LD>   He's getting married in May. He's studying for his GED while working
full time as a maintenance man. And he's working to get a driver's
license so that he can be a truck driver one day.</LD>
<LD>   Washington, mildly retarded with an IQ of 69, was released from prison
on Feb. 12, 2001, after DNA tests cleared him of a 1982 rape and murder
to which he had confessed. He still had to finish serving time for an
unrelated assault.</LD>
<TE>   He spent nearly 10 years on death row and came nine days away from
dying in the electric chair when he was granted a stay in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   But as Washington puts his life back together, bitterness is not part
of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "With me, I guess, being bitter means you stay mad all the time.
That's something I don't try to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was angry during his early years in prison: "The first five
years I guess I let the devil take over my mind."</TE>
<TE>   But his faith in God helped him to cope.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to stay happy all the time," he said, grinning, as he sat on
the couch in the tiny living room of his apartment, a large American flag
on the wall behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks good up there," he said of the flag, which was given to his
family when his father died in 1995. Washington wasn't permitted to
attend that funeral, or the funeral of his mother, who died three months
later.</TE>
<TE>   While in prison, Washington thought he would never again be free. So
the first week after his release felt like a dream, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's real now," said Washington, a former farm hand from Fauquier
County.</TE>
<TE>   Early DNA tests cast doubt on Washington's guilt in the rape and
murder of Rebecca Lynn Williams, 19. In 1994, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder
commuted his sentence to life and in 2000, Gov. Jim Gilmore pardoned
Washington after more tests failed to find Washington's DNA.</TE>
<TE>   Culpeper County Commonwealth Atty. Gary Close, whose predecessor
prosecuted Washington, opposed the pardon and said he thinks Washington
is guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it is hard to discount the confession," Close said.</TE>
<TE>   Close also said the DNA evidence is not conclusive.</TE>
<TE>   "It just means that somebody else was there" but not necessarily that
Washington wasn't there, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that Washington was convicted of another crime. In 1983, he
was arrested after breaking into a neighbor's home and hitting her with a
chair.</TE>
<TE>   "Those people who want to make Earl Washington a saint want to forget
what he did in Fauquier County," Close said.</TE>
<TE>   During the investigation into that assault, Washington confessed to
that crime and to Williams' rape and murder.</TE>
<TE>   Washington won't talk about the Williams case. He said his lawyer
advised him to say only, "It's in the past."</TE>
<TE>   He said he doesn't remember the 1983 assault, but he doesn't deny his
guilt. "I know I was drunk, for one thing," he said. "People do strange
things when they're drunk."</TE>
<TE>   "I still regret what happened to the woman," he added. "I always
will."</TE>
<TE>   A friend introduced Washington to Pam Edwards, 39, shortly after he
was freed. The couple are now sharing a one-bedroom apartment and plan to
get married on May 4, the day after Washington turns 42.</TE>

<HD>At 94, She Holds No Brief for Retirement</HD>
<DH>Career: Her friends gone, Selma Koch still runs the New York
lingerie shop she first entered in 1927.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH HASTINGS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Selma Koch was not aware of the passing years, or that she was an
old woman, until she was 92. Maybe it was 93.</LD>
<LD>   She is 94 now. And every day she finds a reason to believe--in life,
in work and in the importance of a bra that fits.</LD>
<LD>   Six days a week she spends 10 hours a day in the Town Shop on the
Upper West Side, a lingerie store founded 114 years ago by her
father-in-law.</LD>
<TE>   She is acutely aware that she may not live to see 95. "You don't buy
green bananas," she says, and laughs heartily at her own joke. She
doesn't fill a prescription for 100 capsules of medication. Too
expensive, she says, and tells the pharmacist to cut it by half. "I may
not make it to 100."</TE>
<TE>   Pills, she means.</TE>
<TE>   Life, and time, are not always kind. Koch has seen plenty of both.
Enough to know not to take anything too seriously; enough to know that
work and family are the secrets to contentment. And that if you don't
laugh, especially at yourself, you might as well give up.</TE>
<TE>   She also knows that progress-- be it Internet shopping or shiny
catalogs with unnaturally endowed women wearing bras of red satin--
cannot replace simple human kindness, or making a customer feel
important.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing left in New York that's a service store," she says.
"You can go into Bergdorf's, you can go into Saks, and nobody's going to
say a word to you, right?</TE>
<TE>   "Here, a customer walks through the door, someone approaches her. And
stays with her."</TE>
<TE>   Which isn't hard to do. The Town Shop, at Broadway and 82nd Street, is
about the size of a bedroom, with enough inventory to stock a house.
Outside, beneath a hot pink sign with purple letters, is an old-fashioned
glass window display with mannequins. Inside are bras in cup sizes
covering half the alphabet, panties, house slippers, stockings, nighties
from flimsy to flannel, socks, "merry widows," swimsuits. And if you
don't see what you want, just ask.</TE>
<TE>   In the back is Selma Koch, wedged behind a small desk, flanked by
boxes of underwear rising to the ceiling. She does much of the buying,
the scheduling, the phone orders that come in from around the country
and--the bane of every business owner--keeps the help happy. Not to
mention the customers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 17 people working here," she says, rapping her polished nails
on a rare bit of desktop not covered by papers. "And just try to keep
peace with 17 women. That alone, in a small space, is a full-time job."</TE>
<TE>   She does not lower her voice. It carries, creaky but strong, into the
store, where determined saleswomen stride from customer to back room,
purposefully climb stepladders and reach behind Koch's gray head to
retrieve a lacy piece of merchandise. If they have heard her comment,
their faces register nothing but brisk efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Her elder son, Peter, 72, comes to say she has faxed the same order
twice. The manufacturer is confused.</TE>
<TE>   She smiles. "I'm entitled to errors, right?"</TE>
<TE>   But at 94, she doesn't make a lot of them. Her mind, and her hearing,
are sharp. She has two sons, six grandchildren and nine
great-grandchildren. Crimson lipstick tastefully defines her lips, and a
red dress with gold buttons plunges provocatively, revealing an
unapologetic neck weathered to fine crepe paper and mottled with age
spots.</TE>
<TE>   On her feet, over sheer stockings, are dark pumps with cutout toes.</TE>
<TE>   She has been walking into the Town Shop since 1927, right before she
married Henry Koch, who was brash enough to flirt with the 20-year-old
woman who came to design his Christmas brochure.</TE>
<TE>   She'd graduated from Columbia University's School of Journalism two
years before and had done well for herself by landing a job as a
copywriter at an advertising agency. She simply refused to be intimidated
by the fact that there were few women in jobs like hers.</TE>
<TE>   The Town Shop had four stores then, and its advertising business was
coveted. She wanted the account.</TE>
<TE>   "I went in to do the interview, and this guy said, 'Where can I reach
you after hours?' "</TE>
<TE>   She thought he was married. "So, being 20 years old, I said, 'You
can't reach me anywhere but at the office.' And I flounced out."</TE>
<TE>   She is greatly amused by this memory, and laughs to herself.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the agency, a male colleague said, "I hear you got the Town
Shop account."</TE>
<TE>   "So?" she shot back.</TE>
<TE>   "So that's the most eligible bachelor around."</TE>
<TE>   That got her attention.</TE>
<TE>   "So I went back. With a little more charm."</TE>
<TE>   Her grin is devilish.</TE>
<TE>   "And that was how I married into the Town Shop."</TE>
<TE>   Henry Koch died in 1970. Left with a business to run, Selma Koch
eventually closed the other stores, leaving only the Broadway shop, where
she could walk to work.</TE>
<TE>   She was born and raised on the West Side. And she's stayed there. Home
is five minutes away by cab. "I'm a neighborhood gal," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Her younger son, David, is 70. "My baby," she calls him. He works in
advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Peter works with her in the store. "She's not as sharp as she used to
be," he says right in front of her, and laughs. "But she won't admit
that."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Koch says he doesn't worry that his mother continues to work.
"What's she going to do? She doesn't play cards, she doesn't like the
movies. Sitting at the desk has been very good for her."</TE>
<TE>   She loves working retail. Dealing with people. She has client families
spanning three generations. "Sometimes a lady will come in with either a
walker, or a wheelchair, or a nurse. She can barely move, and she'll say
to me, 'You know, you sold me my trousseau.' "</TE>
<TE>   Koch isn't sure that's a compliment.</TE>
<TE>   Brassieres were made of cotton "and not very pretty" when she started
selling them. Then came nylon, cups shaped like Sno-Cone holders, Lycra,
underwire, push-ups, and bras that worked wonders and miracles.</TE>
<TE>   The latest trend?</TE>
<TE>   "Large cups," she says. "Bosoms are getting big."</TE>
<TE>   By themselves, or with help?</TE>
<TE>   Oh no, she wags her head, she doesn't mean plastic surgery. She means
naturally. Exercise trends, the pill, other factors have resulted in an
evolutionary escalation of breast sizes.</TE>
<TE>   How does her staff measure a woman for a bra that fits but doesn't
poke, pull or pester?</TE>
<TE>   "We don't measure anything," she answers. "Never use a tape measure."</TE>
<TE>   Then how do they know what size a woman wears?</TE>
<TE>   "We know. We're trained to know."</TE>
<TE>   Who trains the staff?</TE>
<TE>   "I do."</TE>
<TE>   Who trained you?</TE>
<TE>   "I just knew."</TE>
<TE>   She knows she's not really answering, but she doesn't care. Age has
certain privileges, and this is one.</TE>
<TE>   Working is another. "When you reach my time of life," she says, "you
don't have friends. They're all gone. You don't have a social life. I
don't have the mobility to travel from museum to museum anymore. So my
days would be endless if I didn't come to work."</TE>
<TE>   She revels in telling visitors that she's "almost" 95. Her birthday is
June 29.</TE>
<TE>   How does it feel to be almost 95?</TE>
<TE>   The question stops her cold. She is not laughing now but staring down
at her desk.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very strange," she answers. "I wasn't aware of it, I think,
until I was like 92 or 93. I was not aware of time going."</TE>
<TE>   Is it frightening?</TE>
<TE>   "No. Everybody else did it, so why not me?"</TE>
<TE>   Everybody else did what?</TE>
<TE>   And now she is laughing again.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody else died," she chuckles. "So what?"</TE>

<HD>Drug Houses Getting a New Lease on Life</HD>
<DH>Crime: Law allows police to resell homes where illegal activities
have festered. Some claim rights abuses; to neighbors, it's a godsend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM IRWIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DETROIT
</DL>
<LD>The bungalow on Blackstone Street isn't much to look at. The porch
roof sags, the shrubs are a wild tangle and the security bars on the
windows make it look like a jail.</LD>
<LD>   But to Suzanne Purzycki, who lives across the street, it is a diamond
in the rough--now that it is no longer a drug house.</LD>
<LD>   "It'd be a great home for somebody with children, or a retired
couple," Purzycki, 66, says. "It's just a nice, little, cozy, cute house.
We're looking forward to having a homeowner there that is a nice, quiet,
law-abiding citizen like most of the people on this block."</LD>
<TE>   Wayne County Prosecutor Michael Duggan shares Purzycki's hope.</TE>
<TE>   That was why he went to court to obtain the title to the wood-frame
house and put it up for auction: Minimum bid, $4,500. The prosecutor's
office Web site describes it as "the perfect starter home."</TE>
<TE>   Since August, seven months after he took office, Duggan has moved to
seize more than 200 houses where drugs were bought, sold and used. So
far, his office has obtained title to 33 of those homes, including the
bungalow on Blackstone, and sold 11 of them for prices ranging from
$1,200 to $56,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to make sure these houses go into the hands of
law-abiding families," he said. "We are going to do this over and over."</TE>
<TE>   The federal government routinely seizes houses and other drug
traffickers' assets and sells them at auction. Duggan's crackdown targets
lower-level offenders who might otherwise escape federal attention.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of civil forfeiture say the practice tramples on people's
rights.</TE>
<TE>   "The laws authorizing it are sweeping and intrusive," said Lawrence W.
Reed, president of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a conservative
organization based in Midland, Mich. "The threshold of evidence required
before an asset is seized is so low that the law represents a significant
threat to the rights of all people, not just the guilty."</TE>
<TE>   In civil cases, authorities need only prove their case by a
preponderance of the evidence. That is less strict than the criminal
standard, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Because the authorities often get to keep the proceeds from assets
they seize, Reed said, "there is inordinate incentive for authorities to
push the forfeiture laws to their limits and beyond."</TE>
<TE>   Bay County Prosecutor Joseph Sheeranh's office has seized and
auctioned off a half-dozen drug houses and used the proceeds to support a
regional anti-drug law-enforcement coalition. He conceded that forfeiture
should not be pursued "just for the sake of the money," but said it is a
justifiable weapon against chronic drug activity.</TE>
<TE>   "People in neighborhoods get awfully tired of it when the police make
an arrest, the prosecutor prosecutes and the drug activity continues," he
said. "The homeowner-drug trafficker is entitled to his or her day in
court."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "If they're using the house for a drug supermarket, it only
makes sense to take the instrumentality of the crime out of their hands."</TE>
<TE>   Duggan said the bungalow on Blackstone Street, the 200th forfeiture
case handled by his office, was typical. Detroit police had raided the
place five times in the past year, making three felony arrests and
confiscating marijuana, cocaine and heroin. "This time, it's shut down
for good," Duggan said.</TE>
<TE>   Purzycki, who lives side-by-side with her daughter in houses built in
1919 by her father and uncle, welcomed the prosecutor's vigilance.</TE>
<TE>   "When people move into this neighborhood, my daughter and I go over
and introduce ourselves to them," she said. "I tell them, 'I grew up in
that house right over there. This neighborhood means something to me.' "</TE>

<DH>Wildlife: Some countries that formerly hunted whales have changed
course. But others haven't lost a taste for their flesh.</DH>

<DL>MOSS LANDING, Calif.

<LD>The barnacled gray whale breaks the clear surface of the Pacific
and blows a fine mist over awed tourists, each of whom paid $35 to board
the boat that slips alongside the migrating marine mammals.</LD>
<LD>   "The time for hunting these magnificent creatures is over," says Capt.
Steph Dutton, peering across the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary
at two more boats filled with tourists. "If sharing them with people like
this helps, then it's worth it."</LD>
<LD>   But not all whale advocates--and certainly not those who hunt
them--approve of the increased exposure.</LD>

cuts," said Charlotte de Fontaubert, Greenpeace Oceans coordinator in
Washington, D.C. "Global warming, depletion of fish stocks, direct taking
by Japan and Norway, are all making it tough for this species. Now if
whales are learning to come right up to boats, or if boats are getting
too close to them, that's another very bad sign."</TE>
<TE>   From Vietnam to South Africa, virtually every country that a whale
swims past is cashing in with close-up boat tours, shoreline viewing,
festivals and souvenirs.</TE>
<TE>   Whalers say that gives their adversaries a powerful new platform.</TE>
<TE>   "Anti-whaling activists often use whale-watching operations as an
opportunity to impose their propaganda," said Rune Frovik, secretary of
the High North Alliance that represents whalers, sealers and fishermen
from Canada, Greenland, Iceland and Norway and the Danish Faeroe Islands.</TE>
<TE>   People have, of course, been admiring--and hunting--whales for
thousands of years, from ships and shores. But whale watching as a
commercial activity didn't begin until the mid-'50s when fishermen in
Southern California began charging for tours when fish weren't biting.</TE>
<TE>   Now, whale advocates say surging interest in whale watching brings
both new security and new problems to the gentle giants which just 50
years ago were mostly appreciated for their high-protein flesh.</TE>
<TE>   This year, approximately 10 million whale-watchers will pay more than
$1 billion on tours, travel, food and hotels in 87 countries and overseas
territories, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare in
Yarmouth Port, Mass. That's up from about 4 million people spending about
$317 million in 1991, the group said.</TE>
<TE>   The world's gray whale population migrates through the nutrient-rich
waters of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, traveling between
their summer feeding grounds in the Bering Sea and their winter breeding
grounds in Baja California.</TE>
<TE>   Surveys show that about 36,000 people paid to go whale watching in the
sanctuary in 2000, information that helped Dutton convince bankers to
lend him $1 million for a two-deck power catamaran that holds up to 149
tourists.</TE>
<TE>   The industry has helped turn around depressed Third World villages
like Benito Juarez in Baja California, Mexico, a farming and ranching
community of about 90 families who have spent the past decade taking
tourists into a nearby lagoon where mother whales come to birth and raise
their calves. Passengers pay about $30, and community members share
earnings from ticket sales equally to revitalize their town.</TE>
<TE>   The whales in this area have become so accustomed to people they swim
right up to boats and let tourists scratch their heads.</TE>
<TE>   National and federal standards, as well as local codes of ethics, do
provide some safety to the animals. But in many cases curious whales
approach boats, clustering around their visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Some animal rights activists say teaching curious whales to trust
people can be dangerous. At times they are hit by speeders; it's unclear
whether such contact with humans has any long-term effect.</TE>
<TE>   That said, whale appreciation prompted Mexican government officials in
2000 to halt a $150-million expansion of a salt plant.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrities, many of whom lobbied Mexico in that case, have taken up
the cause for whales during the last few years. Musicians Bryan Adams,
Olivia Newton-John, Peter Gabriel, Midnight Oil and Yothu Yindi have
recorded soundtracks for an anti-whale-hunting film to be released soon,
while actors Pierce Brosnan and Glenn Close were among those who went on
high-profile whale-watching tours to draw attention to the issue.
Hollywood stars Robin Williams and Kate Beckinsale, among others, have
spoken out repeatedly as well.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Mader, author of "Mexico: Adventures in Nature," said that
although there are dangers in the rapidly expanding industry, "it's
certainly safer than whaling."</TE>
<TE>   Although the International Whaling Commission banned whaling in 1987
and eight species are designated as endangered, whales are still hunted
in limited numbers around the globe, primarily by Japanese and Norwegian
whalers.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Japanese officials launched a campaign to resume
commercial whaling, vowing to end the 15-year ban on whale hunts at an
IWC meeting in Tokyo this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-hunting advocates hope whale watching will galvanize the
opposition, and point to studies that show the economic benefits of whale
watching outweigh those of whale hunting.</TE>
<TE>   But whalers dispute those studies, and say increased tourism is no
reason to keep the ban on commercial hunts.</TE>
<TE>   "It is natural for many Japanese people to enjoy both watching and
eating whales," said Joji Morishita, a deputy director at the Fisheries
Agency of Japan. "It is like eating BBQ after a farm tour in New
Zealand."</TE>
<TE>   At the Japanese Embassy in Washington, First Secretary Nobuyuki Yagi
said whale watchers who see giant humpbacks or massive blues are often
under the misconception that these are the same whales that are being
hunted.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't realize that whalers tend to seek the abundant whale
species like the minke whales, that swim fast and are relatively
smaller," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese officials this month distributed leaflets to promote eating
whale meat, including a color brochure, "Let's cook," which provided
recipes for whale tempura and whale soup. "Delicious whales; eat them
properly," it said.</TE>
<TE>   Japan catches about 400 whales annually under its research program.
About 2,000 tons of whale meat is marketed.</TE>
<TE>   Whale watching is, however, keeping hunters away in the Philippines,
said Alan White at the Coastal Resource Management Project in Cebu, where
an active whale- and dolphin-watching industry has grown significantly
over the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are times when a large number of boats disrupt the
swimming and mating patterns of the mammals, White said, whale watching
has mostly been positive because it promotes conservation.</TE>
<TE>   And in Mexico City, Hector Ceballos-Lascurain, the director general of
the Program of International Consultancy on Ecotourism, said the bottom
line is this: "A live whale is worth more than a dead whale."</TE>

<HD>Iditarod Gets Support From Above</HD>
<DH>Outdoors: Volunteer air force braves harsh conditions to ensure the
competitors have everything they need.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAUREEN CLARK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE
</DL>
<LD>The small waiting room at Spernak's Airways was crowded with more
than a dozen pilots drinking coffee, eating doughnuts and watching fat
snowflakes swirl down from a milky white sky onto the runway at Merrill
Field.</LD>
<LD>   The weather would keep them grounded for nearly five hours, but
waiting on the weather comes with the territory.</LD>
<LD>   They are all members of the Iditarod Air Force, a group of about two
dozen pilots who volunteer their time and planes to support Alaska's
classic Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. The 30th annual running of the race
begins March 2.</LD>
<TE>   The Iditarod commemorates the desperate run by sled-dog teams to
deliver diphtheria serum to Nome during an epidemic in 1925. Teams of 12
to 16 dogs and their mushers run the course, usually in nine to 12 days.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next six weeks, the Iditarod Air Force will spend hundreds of
hours hauling food, supplies, race personnel and dogs between the
checkpoints along the 1,100-mile trail from Anchorage to Nome. Although
that may sound like a lot of work, there is no shortage of pilots willing
to use vacation time from their day jobs to fly with this group.</TE>
<TE>   Serving with the Iditarod Air Force gives pilots a chance to sharpen
their skills and explore wild country. It is bush flying at its finest,
said John Norris, who is serving as co-chief pilot of the air force this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen the most spectacular sights and scenery in the wintertime
in Alaska," said Norris, who takes a break from his job as president of
U-Haul Alaska to fly for the Iditarod. Though he flies hundreds of hours
each year to visit U-Haul operations around the state, flying for the
race is special.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I really look forward to. We all have such a great
time out there," Norris said.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Johnson, flying in his 14th Iditarod this year, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of camaraderie among the pilots," Johnson said. "If a
person doesn't have an extremely good time out there, it's their own
fault."</TE>
<TE>   So it was that on a Saturday morning two weeks before the race, the
pilots found themselves swapping war stories and good-natured jabs while
waiting for the snow to end.</TE>
<TE>   When the clouds finally cleared, the planes were loaded with sacks of
dog food, wooden stakes to mark the trail and bales of straw used to make
beds for the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   The planes, most of them single-engine Cessnas equipped with skis, are
the workhorses typically found in Alaska. One by one, they took off and
headed northwest to supply the race checkpoints east of the Alaska Range.</TE>
<TE>   Race manager Jack Niggemyer tries to send as many supplies as possible
to the checkpoints by mail. In addition, race sponsors Northern Air Cargo
and PenAir carry some of the larger loads.</TE>
<TE>   But the pilots, with their ability to land on small airstrips and
frozen rivers and lakes, do the bulk of the flying.</TE>
<TE>   "Flying for the Iditarod is a skill in its own right," said Niggemyer.</TE>
<TE>   Iditarod officials require that the pilots have at least a private
pilot's license, though many are commercial pilots. Each pilot must have
at least 1,000 hours of flying time, with 500 hours of that in Alaska.
They are required to have at least 100 hours of winter flying and 100
hours in a ski-equipped plane. Most are longtime Alaska pilots who have
many hours more than the minimums.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a group of qualified, high-time pilots that insurance
companies are happy with," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Iditarod spends about $50,000 to buy liability insurance for the
air force for a two-month period. Niggemyer said it's one of the biggest
expenses for the race, but about half what it would cost to hire local
air taxis to do the work.</TE>
<TE>   Though the air force has had accidents during the 30-year history of
the race, none has been fatal and no insurance claims have been filed for
the past nine years. The emphasis is on safety, Niggemyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're flying in awfully big country in awfully small airplanes and
it's not the end of the world if we don't get there today. I stress to
the guys that this is only a dog race, when it gets right down to it,"
Niggemyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been told by the feds and other people that they wish a lot of
the air-taxi operators were as organized and safety conscious as our air
force."</TE>
<TE>   During their trips up and down the trail, the Iditarod Air Force
pilots have a bird's-eye view of the dog teams as they make their way to
Nome. And a few of the pilots have taken their turn on the runners of a
sled.</TE>
<TE>   Diana and Bruce Moroney are among the few Iditarod Air Force pilots
who also have competed in the race.</TE>
<TE>   Diana has run the Iditarod nine times and developed an interest in
flying in 1986 when she spent time as a volunteer logistics coordinator
with the Iditarod Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   For Bruce, flying came first. A commercial pilot, he has volunteered
with the Iditarod Air Force since 1976. Diana and Bruce met in 1990 and,
soon thereafter, he was helping her earn her commercial pilot's rating
while she helped him train for the Iditarod. They married in 1994--the
same year Bruce completed his first Iditarod.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce, who earned his pilot's license at 17, says that although he
enjoys his time with the Iditarod Air Force, competing in the race is the
ultimate satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   Diana has a harder time deciding which she enjoys more: riding to Nome
behind a dog team or flying there in the family's Piper Archer. When she
is flying she watches the mushers with envy. But when the trail gets cold
and bumpy, a warm airplane looks pretty good.</TE>
<TE>   "To be able to fly around and come back at the end of the day and know
you've accomplished quite a bit to help the race is very satisfying,"
Diana said. "The dogs are where they belong. The vets are where they
belong. Then you can sit back and tell war stories."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX
</DL>
<LD>The director of a tough-love boot camp for teenagers says he will
be cleared of a murder charge in the case of a camper who died last
summer.</LD>
<LD>   Camp director Charles Long II, 56, was charged with second-degree
murder two weeks ago in the death of Anthony Haynes, 14.</LD>
<LD>   Haynes died of complications of dehydration after he collapsed in
triple-digit heat and two counselors put him in a bathtub to cool down,
investigators said.</LD>
<TE>   Haynes was attending a five-week boot camp near Phoenix operated by
the America's Buffalo Soldiers Reenactors Assn. The camp was shut down
after the teen's death, although the group still operates other programs.</TE>
<TE>   Long also is accused of child abuse and aggravated assault.</TE>
<TE>   "I've already won," said Long in his first interview since his arrest.
"I'm looking forward to going to court."</TE>
<TE>   Haynes' father, Gettis Haynes of Hannibal, Mo., also is eager to go to
court.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see justice," he said. "My son died unjustly. He was my
son, my only son."</TE>
<TE>   Two other supervisors at the same camp were arrested and accused of
abusing children. One has pleaded guilty.</TE>

<HD>Project to Classify Organisms Would Put Life Online</HD>
<DH>Science: The proposal to give every species its own Web site could
help researchers link all living things.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL ELIAS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>Kevin Kelly has his work cut out for him.</LD>
<LD>   Not only does he want to discover, describe and catalog every living
species on earth, he'd like to make it cool to work in the hitherto
sleepy field known as taxonomy.</LD>
<LD>   The co-founder of Wired magazine wants to give each species its own
Web page and tap the power of network computing to speed the
classification process.</LD>
<TE>   The All Species Foundation, which Kelly helped to launch with $1.2
million in private donations, is hoping the initiative will buff
taxonomy's hoary reputation and attract more people into its ranks.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't been very jazzy," said ichthyologist Dan Cohen, who has
been collecting exotic deep sea fish for 50 years. "There's an image
everybody has of fat guys in shorts running around with butterfly nets."</TE>
<TE>   There are fewer than 10,000 active taxonomists worldwide, most still
using essentially the same techniques that Charles Darwin used.</TE>
<TE>   By any measure, that's woefully inadequate for collecting, identifying
and cataloging the estimated 10 million to 111 million living things
still left undiscovered. The shortage is so acute that millions of
unidentified specimens languish in museum basements, awaiting
examination.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to go out into the woods to find new things," Kelly
said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, all you have to do is drive a few miles from the All Species'
offices in San Francisco to visit John McCosker, chairman of aquatic
biology at the California Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Just outside McCosker's basement office, behind the cafeteria, is a
huge room of shelves piled to the ceiling with 250,000 Mason jars. In
them are 2.5 million preserved fish collected over the last 150 years.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of those fish--McCosker doesn't know exactly how many--are
unidentified. Many are undoubtedly new species. But McCosker and his
colleagues don't have the expertise to identify them.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be only one person on earth who can identify some of
these," McCosker said. "And he hasn't shown up yet."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation hopes to inspire amateurs and professionals alike to
join the field, in part by augmenting the butterfly nets with
high-powered computing tools.</TE>
<TE>   One big push is to find three-dimensional imaging programs that
taxonomists could use to share detailed images of species in seconds,
rather waiting a few days to ship physical specimens. This alone could
cut from years to months the time it takes to name a new species, Kelly
said.</TE>
<TE>   Another idea: bar codes could replace the handwritten specimen labels
most taxonomists still use.</TE>
<TE>   But Cohen, one of 40 scientists advising the All Species Foundation,
doesn't want technology to hinder good taxonomy.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, he doesn't want the three-dimensional software to
replace the physical specimens that the taxonomists routinely exchange
before conclusively identifying a new species. Nothing, he said, can
replace touching and observing the actual specimen.</TE>
<TE>   Even All Species supporters question the goal of identifying every
living thing within 25 years--a job the foundation estimates will cost $3
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Taxonomists have identified about 1.8 million species, including most
mammals and birds. What's left are millions of fish, insects, fungi and
microbes.</TE>
<TE>   "This might work perfectly fine for the higher life forms," said Carl
Woese, a microbiologist at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,
who is not connected with the foundation. "But I don't see this goal as
attainable for the microbial world."</TE>
<TE>   Taxonomists identify about 15,000 new species a year. At that pace, it
will take more than 666 years to catalog 10 million species.</TE>
<TE>   To speed the process, the foundation plans to train amateur
taxonomists while supporting professionals with grants. By 2007, the
foundation hopes up to 60,000 new species will be identified each year.</TE>
<TE>   That will help scientists better understand ecological relationships,
and perhaps save species--including humans--from harm and extinction.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing what lives on earth could also lead to better drugs extracted
someday from plants that remain undiscovered.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to describe these things in a hurry," said Evert Schlinger,
an entomologist whose $1-million donation jump-started the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   A self-described "spider-and-fly man," he manages the Schlinger
Foundation, one of taxonomy's largest supporters.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation, with an endowment of $20 million to $50
million--depending on stock-market conditions--funds four permanent
teaching and curator posts related to bug-collecting.</TE>
<TE>   Schlinger's efforts are the exception in a field mostly ignored by
public and private funding agencies. All Species hopes to change that.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make these guys heroes," said Ryan Phelan, the All Species
foundation's chief executive.</TE>

<LD>If the Black Rock reservoir ever gets built, Dick Prigmore says his

feet of dirt.</LD>

cafe-tavern-convenience store, which stands alone at the intersection of
Washington 24 and 241.</LD>
<LD>   The drought of 2001 gave new life to the dam dream, which has been
talked about off and on since the previous big drought in 1977.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal is this: For the first time since Franklin D. Roosevelt
was president, build new water storage in the arid, irrigated orchard
country of the Yakima River basin.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, it's an idea in its first baby steps," says Gary Ballew,
Benton County's sustainable development manager and the current point man
on Black Rock. "It seems like an idea that has some merit."</TE>
<TE>   In its grandest form, the off-stream dam would be one of the largest
of its kind in the world--595 feet high with a capacity to store
1.7-million acre-feet of water. An acre-foot of water is what it would
take to cover an acre of land to a depth of 1 foot.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed for the Black Rock Valley, wedged between the Hanford nuclear
reservation, the Yakima Training Center and the Yakama Nation
reservation, the reservoir would draw water from the Columbia River and
return it to a tributary, the Yakima River.</TE>
<TE>   But the price tag is staggering--as much as $1.6 billion, the same as
the cost for two proposed baseball stadiums in New York for the Yankees
and the Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Ballew smiles. "That's really cheap"--relatively speaking, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pine Hollow, another proposed, smaller reservoir project for central
Washington, is estimated to run about $3,000 per acre-foot.</TE>
<TE>   But to find the money to do it, the project would have to have the
support of just about everybody: several federal agencies, Congress, the
state, tribes, environmentalists and farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no one we don't need," Ballew said.</TE>
<TE>   The Evergreen State lives with a feast-then-famine cycle of
precipitation. Most of it comes in the late fall and winter, but the dry
months of July and August are when farmers need water the most.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is water evenly distributed across the state. Some parts of the
coast get more than 200 inches of rain annually, while parts of central
Washington's high desert get fewer than 8 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Reservoirs are a way to bank water for those not-so-rainy days.</TE>
<TE>   Benton County has taken the lead for the time being on Black Rock,
budgeting $500,000 for study and related costs. Neighboring Yakima
County, which includes the Black Rock Valley, has agreed to pitch in
$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gary Locke has promised $500,000 out of $2 million in federal
money he's dedicated to water storage, and the Benton County Farm Bureau
kicked in $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   As envisioned, Black Rock reservoir would hold water sucked out of the
Columbia, then piped into the Roza Irrigation District system in the
lower Yakima Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "We are receptive to it being explored as a reservoir site," said Joye
Redfield-Wilder, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Ecology in
Yakima.</TE>
<TE>   But, she said, there are lots of questions still to be answered: How
would it affect water rights on the Columbia River? Can water for the
reservoir be taken out of the river without affecting hydroelectric
operations or spawning fish?</TE>
<TE>   Would migrating fish be confused if water were pulled from the
Columbia River and sent back into the Yakima River? Is the geology of the
area right for such a project?</TE>
<TE>   "Those are some of the issues we felt they would need to look into,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   During last year's drought emergency, the Roza Irrigation District,
which irrigates 72,500 acres, only received 37% of the water it gets in a
normal year from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation-run Yakima Project.</TE>
<TE>   The region needs more water storage because the existing supply is
over-appropriated, said Tom Monroe, operations manager for the
Sunnyside-based district. The seven-reservoir system in the project holds
a little over a million acre-feet of water and the demand is a little
over 2.3 million acre-feet.</TE>
<TE>   Irrigation, protective regulations for diminished wild-fish runs and
population growth all are placing more demands on the Yakima River.</TE>
<TE>   "There was not enough storage built originally for the demand for
irrigation," Monroe said. "You rely totally on snowpack and runoff to
meet all your irrigation needs, and the storage can only hold less than
half the demand."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Prigmore, who's owned the Silver Dollar for almost 10
years, wonders what Black Rock talk will do to the value of his
investment, which has a sign out front that says: "This is the middle of
nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to stymie the sale of this property. Should this thing
happen, a person buying it would be looking at a limited time for
holding," Prigmore said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was in that position, I don't know if I would buy it."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>They will be remembered by many as the comeback Games. For the
athletes, for the host city, for the host nation.</LD>
<LD>   A joyful 16-year-old from Great Neck, N.Y., the beauty of her jumps
and spins matched only by her uncanny poise, makes an unfathomable
fourth-to-first leap in Olympic women's figure skating.</LD>
<LD>   An Australian short-track speedskater, the last one standing, slaloms
past fallen opponents near the finish line to bolt from last to first to
win his country's first Winter Olympic gold medal.</LD>
<TE>   An American speedskater, unsure she can compete at all with her
training ruined by an untimely bout of mononucleosis, wins a gold medal
and sets a world record.</TE>
<TE>   And with one day to go in these Winter Olympics, despite bickering
over judging and the threat of protests, organizers of these Games can
say they have nearly completed their own comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Rebounding from a bid scandal that threatened its ability to be host,
the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee has put on an immaculately
organized Winter Games, renewing hopes the Olympics will soon return to
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Four U.S. cities are vying for the 2012 Summer Games: New York, San
Francisco, Houston and Washington. Success here, U.S. Olympic Committee
President Sandra Baldwin said, "greatly improves the opportunity for the
United States to win the bid in 2012."</TE>
<TE>   Barring an incident today, these Games--played amid unprecedented
security--are already being seen in influential Olympic circles as having
redeemed the U.S. as hosts after the problem-plagued Atlanta Summer
Olympics in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge has
told colleagues that Salt Lake produced the best-ever Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge said Saturday that the Games had been "absolutely fantastic,"
adding: "Transport worked. Technology worked. Security was not too heavy.
There were warm crowds. . . . Tonight I am a happy man."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Olympic Committee is happy too, thanks to its own impressive
comeback.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. athletes hit bottom 14 years ago by fielding a team that won only
six medals during the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. But after an
all-out effort to become a winter sports superpower, the USOC is making
headway in its central mission: training and supporting athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into the final day of competition, U.S. athletes have won a
record 33 medals, including 10 gold; the U.S. team's previous high medal
count was 13, in Lillehammer, Norway, in 1994 and in Nagano, Japan, in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. resurgence can be traced to Calgary, where a special
commission headed by New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner was
appointed. Its obvious conclusion: It takes money and commitment to win
medals.</TE>
<TE>   In the last four years alone, the USOC has poured $40 million into its
"Podium Program." Among the investments: heart-rate monitors for the top
speedskaters, a sports psychologist for the women's hockey team, premiums
for athletes' health insurance and stipends.</TE>
<TE>   USOC officials were confident of a record medal count, predicting
months before the Games that the U.S. would win at least 20.</TE>
<TE>   "After 25 years of struggling to find the best way to fund our sports,
we've found a method that really works," Baldwin said.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, U.S. Winter Games medalists came from all corners
of the nation--and diverse ethnic backgrounds. There was speedskater
Jennifer Rodriguez, the daughter of Cuban refugees, twice winning bronze.
Speedskater Derek Parra and bobsledder Vonetta Flowers both became firsts
to win Winter Games gold: Parra the first Mexican American, Flowers the
first African American.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, crowds cheered wildly for American winners, launching
into the familiar roar of "U.S.A! U.S.A!" for the likes of Jim Shea Jr.,
a third-generation Olympian, who won the skeleton race Wednesday by
careening down the icy bobsled course at speeds approaching 80 mph.</TE>
<TE>   But the crowds also enthusiastically greeted athletes from all over
the world. Their appreciation showed through with loud applause for the
stunning victory in the quarterfinal round of men's hockey by underdog
Belarus over Sweden. Athletes from Iran, one of the three nations
identified by President Bush last month in his State of the Union speech
as an "axis of evil," were warmly received.</TE>
<TE>   Mitt Romney, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, said, "I
hoped we would have really good Games, but in some respects, they were
great Games in that the Games brought the Olympic spirit to the front.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the spectators cheered the athletes of the world--that was
very touching."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not everyone was as impressed with the North American
hospitality. The Cold War--another comeback?--was revived, at least in
the world of sports.</TE>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, a sports fan who was watching
closely from Moscow, called the Games "a flop." He charged that North
American athletes had a "clear" advantage at the Games and protested what
he viewed as "excessive commercialization of the Olympic movement," U.S.
media bias and the use of referees from the National Hockey League--as
opposed to Europeans--at hockey matches.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian rhetoric was sharp. Various sporting and political
officials used words such as "sick," "witch hunt" and "disgusting" to
describe refereeing at the Games, and the threat was made that Russia
might pull out of the final few events of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   It remained unclear whether the Russians were sincere in their threat
to leave, whether they were trying to influence judges in other events or
simply trying to deflect criticism of a subpar performance.</TE>
<TE>   Russia later announced it wouldn't boycott, but only after Rogge, a
Belgian elected last July to an eight-year term as IOC president,
indicated Thursday that there was no concerted campaign against Russian
interests. Still, he sent an explanatory letter to Putin.</TE>
<TE>   Russian athletes, who as recently as 1994 won 23 medals, have only 15
heading into today.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, we had controversies," Rogge said. "The Games carry so many
emotions, they're almost unavoidable. And they're part of the charm of
the Games."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the Salt Lake City Games received high marks.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Barney, director emeritus of the Center for Olympic Studies at
Canada's University of Western Ontario, said the Games have "graphically
shown how the Olympic movement, the Olympic Games, when successfully
executed, remain a celebration of achievement."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, according to Barney and other experts, these
Games also offered an affirmation of the Olympic ideal--a reminder of
how, when the spotlight does turn to the athletes, the Games still retain
the power to eclipse impressions of scandal or corruption and supersede
reports of the billions of dollars it takes from government or business
interests to stage the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the unrestrained glee of the medal winners in the men's
skeleton sledding race--America's Shea, Austria's Martin Rettl and
Switzerland's Gregor Staehli, longtime friends who embraced repeatedly
and said they were "family."</TE>
<TE>   Shea said a few minutes after the race, "Everybody puts all this
emphasis on winning gold medals and the medal count, beating other
countries. That's not what the Olympics is all about. It's about
competing and bringing the world together in a peaceful, friendly
competition."</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake Games were the first large-scale gathering of nations
since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Here to compete were about 2,500
athletes from 77 nations.</TE>
<TE>   About 72 million viewers in the United States watched the Feb. 8
opening ceremony on NBC; an incredible silence and stillness descended
that night on Rice-Eccles Stadium as the tattered flag recovered from the
World Trade Center site was carried in. According to NBC, 79 million
viewers--one-quarter of the U.S. population--tuned in to the women's
figure skating finale Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Barney said that such numbers are an indication of "the power of the
Games," particularly "in terms of turning people's minds to a much more
optimistic mode than they were when they emerged from Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The security arrangement--including F-16s routinely patrolling the
skies and armed National Guard troopers standing outside the Olympic
venues--were a combined federal, state and local effort overseen by the
U.S. Secret Service. Security was intensified after Sept. 11, buttressed
by an added $55 million in federal funding. Total security costs amounted
to $310 million, $240 million from the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no major incidents.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we planned, before and after Sept. 11, worked," said David
Tubbs, director of the Utah Olympic Public Safety Command.</TE>
<TE>   Potential problems with traffic and technology also failed to
materialize.</TE>
<TE>   Things worked so well that a daily "coordination meeting," a 5 p.m.
meeting of senior IOC and SLOC officials to hash out what was going
wrong, increasingly saw the agenda dwindling. One session lasted only 14
minutes. Then, for most of last week, the meetings were simply canceled.</TE>
<TE>   For many, the Olympic spirit in this country was best presented in Los
Angeles and now.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Perelman of Los Angeles, press chief for the 1984 L.A. Games who
served here as venue chief at Utah Olympic Park, site of the bobsled
track, said, "I came here trying to make these Games as good as possible
in our home country, to impart the thought that when we organize Games in
this country, we do it like they were done in Los Angeles and Salt Lake,
not like Atlanta."</TE>
<TE>   Carrard, the IOC's director general, observed: "Perfect success of the
Olympic Games is of course a perfect organization, perfect people,
volunteers, wonderful athletes, luck with weather and many medals for the
home team.</TE>
<TE>   "But you have to be good and be lucky for that."</TE>

<DH>Music: Industry's awards show arrives with a lack of new stars and
a bleak outlook for CDs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Grammy Awards are a valentine the music industry gives itself
every February, a confection of celebrity, commerce and art. But the 44th
annual edition of the gala arrives at Staples Center on Wednesday amid an
industry chill that goes well beyond the champagne buckets at the
after-parties.</LD>
<LD>   "It's grim, the most grim it's been since I've been around the
business," is the flat appraisal of David Geffen, perhaps the most famous
music mogul of the last three decades. "It's a very, very challenging
time."</LD>
<LD>   The challenges come from all sides, but each cuts to the bottom line.
Music sales are sagging, hundreds of layoffs have demoralized record
company staffers and superstar artists have united for a public revolt
against the industry's business practices.</LD>
<TE>   And, more troubling in the long run, consumers are embracing new
technologies that threaten to scatter the industry's musical commodities
like coins spilled on a busy street. Last year, blank CDs outsold all
music albums in the U.S. for the first time, and, as the Napster saga
showed, tens of millions of fans are willing to grab their music online
without paying. Jim Guerinot, a top rock manager, called the combined
issues "a perfect storm" that could threaten the creakiest of the
industry's corporate ships.</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, the industry is obsessed by a lack of star power.
"There's nervousness right now because we haven't seen a new crop of
stars like we've been having over the last couple of years," said Tom
Calderone, MTV senior vice president for music. "Whether it was Fred
Durst (of Limp Bizkit) or Kid Rock or Britney Spears or 'N Sync, we had
wall-to-wall stars for a while. . . . There are a lot of great songs out
right now, but we went from superstars to a group of potential
superstars."</TE>
<TE>   Why did music sales drop last year for the first time since the mass
introduction of the CD? A range of industry leaders pointed to the
cooling of the youth pop sensation, the absence of new releases by
mega-sellers such as Celine Dion and Garth Brooks and the spread of the
Internet downloading culture.</TE>
<TE>   Even the most optimistic among those interviewed, Clive Davis, who
shaped the recent successes of Carlos Santana and Alicia Keys, agreed
that the technological issues are worrisome. But Davis, who now heads J
Records, says the other problems are not so different from those that
have always cropped up in the industry's peculiar and bruising
playground.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a grim time for music. There's not a question if music is as
vital in people's lives as much as it has ever been or more so . . . .
These other things are challenges," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis will have a reminder of another of those challenges Tuesday
night, when he hosts his famous Grammy week party at the Beverly Hills
Hotel. The event's usual monopoly of star wattage will be challenged by
four local benefit concerts the same night. Those shows feature such big
names as the Eagles, Sheryl Crow and No Doubt, and their goal is to raise
money for a political battle against what they call the industry's unfair
contracts.</TE>
<TE>Artists' Campaign Seen Hurting Business</TE>
<TE>   The Recording Artists Coalition hopes to secure stronger copyright
protection and free agency status for performers. "I don't understand
these people," said Lyor Cohen, president and chief executive of
Island/Def Jam Music Group. "I think it's very selfish. They are going to
hurt art and cause a further contraction in the business."</TE>
<TE>   The timing of that campaign has darkened moods at record companies.
"Prozac, the whole industry should be on Prozac right now," said Arnold
Stiefel, longtime manager for Rod Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   The overall financial woes have a famous face as a symbol: Mariah
Carey, who was jettisoned last month from the roster of the EMI Group
after recording just one album on the label. No major music company had
ever abandoned a superstar pact so quickly, but Carey's album was a major
flop, and corporate pressures within EMI have mounted.</TE>
<TE>   The music business is not the only entertainment sector limping
through a weak economy, but, unlike Hollywood, it has not had recent
blockbusters akin to "Shrek" or "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."
The music funk may be peaking now, but it began in earnest a decade ago,
when the consolidation trend among record labels began, according to
Guerinot, who worked at the celebrated independent label A&amp;M Records.</TE>
<TE>   "When big companies swallow up other companies, they start looking at
head counts and redundancies and things like that. . . . It really
started being less fun," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Guerinot said A&amp;M tapped special artists and loyally fostered their
careers. "You don't see a lot of that today; that doesn't really exist."
But Guerinot does not count himself among the pessimists. His
artists--Offspring, Beck and No Doubt--are among the most vocal in the
artist rights push, and he is a strong proponent of embracing new
technologies.</TE>
<TE>   "For those protecting and guarding the status quo, it's probably a
very frustrating and difficult time because of this perfect storm, this
triumvirate of problems," Guerinot said. "But the best people out there
are going to turn it into great opportunity. It's not the end of the
world; it's a challenge to change."</TE>
<TE>Comparisons to Europe at Dawn of WWII</TE>
<TE>   A less optimistic view is offered by Miles A. Copeland III, the former
manager for Sting who now heads Ark-21, a world music label. He said
disaster may loom and compares the situation to Europe before World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been the year where a lot of problems have come to the point
where people are commenting on it, but we're still in 1938," Copeland
said. "Somehow we think it's all going to go away. We know 'Mein Kampf'
is there, but we're afraid to read it. We know the Germans are building
up, but we're still thinking somehow that things are going to be OK."</TE>
<TE>   Copeland says many of the top executives at the five major music
conglomerates (Vivendi Universal, AOL Time Warner, Sony, Bertelsmann and
EMI) are shaken but publicly reticent.</TE>
<TE>   "The digital revolution with the Internet and then the CD burner in
the last couple of years, you now have this license to steal," Copeland
said. "It has . . . scared the hell out of everybody, and nobody knows
how to respond. Everybody is afraid to say anything because ifthey say
what they think, it might affect the share value of these public
corporations. Can you imagine if any of these companies announced that
the record business is doomed?"</TE>
<TE>   Both Geffen and Capitol Records President Andy Slater said the
unrelenting focus on corporate and technological topics distracts from
problems even harder to address: the quality of today's music and artist
career-building.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day the biggest challenge to the record industry is
the quality of the music, which has been deteriorating," said Geffen, a
founder of DreamWorks SKG. "There is some great music--there is in every
period of time. But there was more great music prior to this period of
time. I think the era of the great songwriter and the great song seems to
be something more of the past than of the present."</TE>
<TE>Looking for Today's Bruce Springsteen</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks Records has a number of critically acclaimed songwriters,
including Elliott Smith and Rufus Wainwright, on its roster, but so far
they remain commercial afterthoughts. Geffen looks around and sees few
other companies faring much better. He asked: "Where are this
generation's Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, the
Beatles--who are they today?"</TE>
<TE>   Slater was both manager and record producer for younger artists such
as the Wallflowers, Macy Gray and Fiona Apple before taking the reins at
Capitol last year, and he has a more upbeat view of today's talent. He
worries, though, that after a decade of consolidation and bottom-line
emphasis, music companies now strip-mine young careers. If the industry
can regain the patience to foster young artists, Slater says, the other
problems will fall away.</TE>
<TE>   "There used to be a thing in the business we talked about: 'This
artist is making a great third album,' " Slater said. "It's the third
record where Bruce Springsteen is going to break, it's the third record
where Tom Petty is going to do the 'Damn the Torpedoes' or R.E.M. or
Prince is going to make that record. Can you remember the last artist we
[the industry] were patient enough to even have get to a third record? It
becomes a one-act show."</TE>
<TE>   Production and promotion costs are rising (executives say a
high-profile album now may fail to yield a profit if it cannot crack 1
million in sales, a lofty total) even as the parent corporations of the
big music conglomerates cut costs in the face of an uncertain economy.
Sales of music declined 3% in 2001, which sounds like a modest dip, but
it marked the first decrease since SoundScan introduced a credible sales
tracking system to the industry in 1991. And, in an intriguing statistic,
unit sales of prerecorded albums (762.8 million albums) trailed
considerably the sales of recordable CDs (1 billion units).</TE>
<TE>'They're All Freaked Out'</TE>
<TE>   A closer look at the music album sales of 2001 shows that the vital
sales of blockbuster releases were well off too. In 2000, seven albums
sold more than 5 million copies (and Eminem's smash "The Marshall Mathers
LP" nearly lapped that impressive total with 9 million), but in 2001 no
album managed to crack that threshold.</TE>
<TE>   All of that makes the view from the rear of the limo seem a bit bleak
on Grammy night. Some of the more iconoclastic figures in the business,
though, are thrilled to be living in interesting times. Cohen, the
colorful Israeli-born president of the Island/Def Jam group, says he's
having an "enormous amount of fun" and is sick of the gloom and doom from
his peers.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all freaked out. I'm a mama's boy, and my mother always said,
'Stop kvetching.' All these gloomy people. They should take a chill pill.
OK, so there's some problems. So? Let's break some new artists. Let's
have some fun."</TE>

<HD>Bush Plan Calls for Increase in Oil Production</HD>
<DH>Energy: Downplaying conservation, president ties greater domestic
supply to national security, the economy. Drilling in Arctic refuge is a
likely sticking point.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush mounted a renewed push Saturday for a broad national
energy policy that emphasizes production over conservation--one of his
top domestic priorities since taking office--but signs are piling up that
the president may fall short of his goal.</LD>
<LD>   As the Senate prepares to tackle the issue this week, Bush called
again for opening Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil
drilling, arguing that greater domestic production is vital to national
security and economic growth.</LD>
<LD>   "America is already using more energy than our domestic resources can
provide, and unless we act to increase our energy independence, our
reliance on foreign sources of energy will only increase," Bush said in
his weekly radio address.</LD>
<TE>   But with no energy crisis at hand and the congressional air thick with
election-year politics and laced with the Enron Corp. scandal, whether
any bill emerges remains in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure's off," said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the
National Energy Assistance Directors' Assn., which represents state
directors of the low-income home energy assistance program.</TE>
<TE>   And opening the Arctic refuge to drilling is a particularly hot issue
for many Democrats, whose party controls the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Bush called Alaska "a place of tremendous natural beauty
and important energy resources," and argued that "modern technology
allows us to bring oil to the surface cleanly and safely, while
protecting our environment and wildlife."</TE>
<TE>   "Conservation technology and renewables are important," the president
said, pointing toward other elements in his plan. "Yet they alone cannot
solve our energy problems. We must also reduce America's dependence on
foreign sources of oil by encouraging safe and clean exploration at
home."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Bush, a former oilman, seized on high energy prices
nationwide and the short supply that triggered California's energy crunch
to make the case for more domestic oil and gas exploration.</TE>
<TE>   In May, he unveiled a plan that called for expanding nuclear power,
spending $2 billion for research on "clean coal" technologies and opening
more federal lands to oil and gas exploration, including parts of the
Arctic refuge. The plan also included environmentally friendly measures
such as tax incentives for residential solar power and fuel-efficient
hybrid vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   But much has changed since last summer. California rode out its
electricity crunch and gasoline prices eased, undercutting the sense of
urgency. Although the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon renewed attention on U.S. dependence on foreign energy sources,
sales of gas-gulping sport-utility vehicles are as brisk as ever, and
polls find Americans still favor conservation over more production.</TE>
<TE>   Bush now is tying his energy initiatives to national security, but the
polls find no evidence that his popularity in leading the war against
terrorism has led to substantially increased support for his energy
policies.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the Enron factor. The now-bankrupt energy company's ties
to the White House have become fodder for critics of Bush's energy
proposals. Also, Enron's campaign contributions to members of both
parties have made many lawmakers jittery about further energy
deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron is likely to make passage of a comprehensive bill less likely,"
said David M. Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a
Washington-based advocacy group. "Many senators will find their appetite
for dealing with energy--with oil, natural gas and electricity markets
considerably calmed down--even further depressed by both the facts and
political risks associated with Enron."</TE>
<TE>   The bill that the Democratic-run Senate expects to begin debating at
midweek is far different from the Bush-backed measure approved in August
by the GOP-controlled House.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate measure tilts more toward conservation than new production,
calling for tougher fuel-economy standards for vehicles and eschewing
Bush's goal of opening the Arctic refuge to drilling. It also provides
$14.5 billion in tax credits over the next decade to promote
conservation, energy efficiency and production.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill provides for oil exploration in the Arctic refuge and
contains $33 billion in tax breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, said he is optimistic an energy bill will pass the
Senate. "We'll have some major fights about different provisions that
people want to add or delete." But, he added, "there are quite a few
areas where we're in general agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Provisions that enjoy bipartisan support include increasing federal
energy assistance to low-income households and offering tax breaks to
promote energy efficiency and the production of renewable energy sources,
such as wind and solar power.</TE>
<TE>   Unclear is whether enough lawmakers in the House and Senate can come
together to reconcile their differing versions of the legislation to send
Bush a bill he will sign.</TE>
<TE>   In the coming days, Bush and his allies plan to step up efforts to
rally public support for his energy proposals. For instance, Bush and
Vice President Dick Cheney will be joined by officials of the Teamsters
union, which helped persuade about a dozen House Democrats who usually
side with environmentalists to provide the margin needed to win House
approval for the Arctic drilling provision.</TE>
<TE>   But peeling off such Democratic support in the Senate will be no easy
task, in part because of the lack of a groundswell of public support for
Bush's energy plan.</TE>
<TE>   A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press in May, during the California energy crisis, found that the public
had a slight preference for energy conservation and regulation (49%) over
expanding energy sources (44%). A new poll has found that the gap has
widened: 54% favor conservation and regulation; 37% want to expand
exploration and build new power plants.</TE>
<TE>   Drilling in the Arctic refuge is, by far, the lightning rod that
threatens to kill the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has advocated oil and gas exploration on 1.5 million acres of the
19.6-million-acre refuge in the northeast corner of Alaska as a way to
reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, more than half of the oil used in the United States is
imported--about a fourth from the politically volatile Middle East.
During the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the U.S. imported 36% of its oil.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that 6 billion to 16 billion
barrels of oil can be recovered from beneath the Alaskan tundra, though
opponents argue that only about 3.2 billion barrels can be drawn out
economically.</TE>
<TE>   Bush contends that the drilling can be done safely, but foes warn that
it could spoil one of the nation's most precious wildernesses and
endanger Porcupine River caribou and other species.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), a potential presidential challenger to
Bush in 2004, has vowed to lead a filibuster to keep Arctic drilling out
of the bill. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) has expressed
confidence that he has the votes to sustain a filibuster.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats plan to use the procedural hurdle because they fear that an
up-or-down vote on Arctic drilling is likely to pass. A
filibuster--requiring 60 votes to break--would be difficult to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   At virtually every opportunity, Democrats are likely to highlight the
ties between the Bush administration and Enron as they argue against more
federal support for energy companies.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Myers Jaffe, senior energy advisor at Rice University's James A.
Baker III Institute for Public Policy in Houston, expressed hope that
debate on a national energy plan would not get derailed by "too much
Enronitis."</TE>
<TE>   "The Enron disaster is a lesson in corporate governance more than
energy policy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Myron Ebell, an expert on global warming issues at the Competitive
Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based conservative think tank, added:
"The fact is that Enron was working for both deregulation and
re-regulation. Along with lots of other companies, they supported many
provisions that they hoped would benefit them and opposed others that
they thought would hurt them, but were not on just one side of the
argument."</TE>
<TE>   But a comment by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) gave a preview of how the
Enron card is likely to be played: "I hope we'll be able to keep the
Enron philosophy out of the energy bill." Another contentious issue will
be the proposal to require SUVs and other vehicles to average 35 miles
per gallon by 2013. Environmentalists view this as the single most
important step Congress can take to cut U.S. dependence on foreign oil
and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas linked to global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Any significant increase in the standards faces resistance from
Democrats as well as from Republicans who represent vehicle-producing
states. The auto industry has contended that tougher standards could make
SUVs less safe, put U.S. auto makers at a disadvantage and limit consumer
choice.</TE>
<TE>   Passenger cars currently must meet a "corporate average fuel economy,"
or CAFE, standard of 27.5 mpg. Minivans, SUVs and pickups are permitted
to meet an average of 20.7 mpg. Car makers are allowed to average the
standard across their fleets, so smaller cars can offset the gas
guzzlers.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill also would require that an additional 10% of the
nation's electricity come from renewable sources by 2020. And it would
provide as much as $10 billion in federal loan guarantees for
construction of a pipeline to carry Alaskan natural gas to the Lower 48
states, a provision designed to appease labor unions that support Arctic
drilling.</TE>

<HD>Write-In Foes Target Judge Facing Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The judge is under house arrest and has an electronic bracelet
strapped to his ankle. He can't go out for a quart of milk without court
approval, let alone hit the campaign trail.</LD>
<LD>   Talk radio hosts crusading against his reelection have gone so far as
to broadcast from in front of his home in Turtle Rock, an exclusive
neighborhood in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   As a candidate, Orange County Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline has
some baggage: Authorities have charged him with child molestation and
downloading kiddie porn from the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   Kline's reelection bid is one of the more peculiar spectacles ever
seen in the usually staid realm of California judicial campaigns. Perhaps
the most surprising element is this: He stands an excellent chance of
winning.</TE>
<TE>   After all, he's the only candidate on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The judge surrendered to federal authorities on Nov. 9 on charges that
he had downloaded photographs of children engaged in sex acts. Until
then, Kline had enjoyed an impeccable reputation and seemed certain to
win easy reelection on March 5. Just two days before his arrest, the
filing deadline for judicial candidates passed. As expected, no one filed
to run against Kline.</TE>
<TE>   The sight of a jurist accused of shameful acts coasting, however
uncomfortably, to likely reelection has produced varying degrees of
anguish, embarrassment and denial in Orange County's legal community.
Those feelings were sharpened on Jan. 10, when prosecutors filed new
charges against Kline, alleging that he molested a boy 25 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Since the allegations became public, a set of challengers has emerged
to contest Kline's reelection. They are urging voters to write in their
names.</TE>
<TE>   To win a new six-year term on the bench, Kline, 61, must collect a
majority of the votes cast. That is considered likely, given that he is
the only candidate listed. If he gets less than half the total vote, he
would face a runoff in November with whoever finishes second.</TE>
<TE>   "I give Kline a very good chance . . . better than 50-50," said Mark
Petracca, chair of the political science department at UC Irvine. "If
you're an incumbent, you're hard to beat, whether you're under indictment
or not."</TE>
<TE>   Kline's troubles began last summer, when Julie Posey, head of a
Colorado-based Internet watchdog group, forwarded to local detectives a
tip that Kline was downloading kiddie porn from Internet sites. The tip
came from an anonymous computer hacker who electronically broke into the
judge's computer and copied its contents.</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents and local police searched computers in Kline's Irvine
home and in his chambers in the Orange County courthouse. They unearthed
more than 100 pornographic images from Web sites with names such as
"boynudist" and "boypedia," according to court records. Authorities say
they also found a computer diary in which the judge detailed his sexual
attraction to children.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, local prosecutors added their own charges, alleging that
Kline sexually abused a young neighbor at least four times between 1976
and 1978. Kline was a private attorney at the time. The victim came
forward after hearing of the judge's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Through his lawyer, Kline has denied the allegations against him. He
is scheduled to stand trial on the pornography charges beginning June 4.
No trial date has been set for the molestation case.</TE>
<TE>   Even after the first charges were filed, 21 of Kline's colleagues on
the bench signed his nominating papers for reelection at a bustling
"signing party" in the courthouse lunchroom in Santa Ana. Kline's lawyer,
Paul S. Meyer, collected additional signatures from private attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Several judges have since tried to distance themselves from Kline.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Kline's name appeared in bold capital letters on the top
of his nomination papers, the judges said they overlooked it while
signing on behalf of about 30 colleagues running for new terms.</TE>
<TE>   One judge compared it to the time-honored office ritual of signing a
card for a colleague.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people would sign the birthday card . . . without
recognizing your name," said Judge Robert D. Monarch. "They would wish
you a happy birthday."</TE>
<TE>   When state prosecutors added the child-molestation charges, support
for Kline appeared to fall off sharply and the number of write-in
challengers grew. There are now 11.</TE>
<TE>   At debates and public appearances, the challengers have expressed few
quibbles with one another but have had no hesitation about taking aim at
Kline. One candidate, former county prosecutor Gay Sandoval, wheels
around placards proclaiming of herself: "She Prosecuted Child Molesters."</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that Osama bin Laden isn't the one on the ballot,
but Kline isn't too far behind," said another write-in candidate, John
Adams, a Dana Point attorney.</TE>
<TE>   With less than three weeks until the election, the write-in candidates
are waging enthusiastic, if lightly funded, campaigns. Most have launched
Web sites. One is cranking out recorded phone messages. Another has
ordered 30,000 pencils bearing his name to be handed out to voters on
election day.</TE>
<TE>   Political experts figure it costs roughly $350,000 to wage a write-in
race of this kind. So far, Sandoval leads the write-in field in campaign
contributions, according to county spending reports. As of mid-January,
she had raised $4,125, most of it borrowed from her husband.</TE>
<TE>   The write-in candidates have been receiving help from John Kobylt and
Ken Shiampou, the popular talk show duo on KFI-AM radio who have been
railing against Kline for weeks. Last month, the pair set up a makeshift
studio outside the judge's home, drawing a crowd of skateboarders and
mothers pushing strollers.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the "John and Ken Show" broadcast graphic excerpts from the
diary that the hacker claims he took from Kline's computer. On their Web
site, the pair warned listeners that the journal "kinda reads like the
Anne Frank diary, with less Nazis and more . . . young boys."</TE>
<TE>   In arguing that he should be confined to his home while awaiting
trial, federal prosecutors told a U.S. magistrate that the judge poses a
threat to children. They cited the diary, in which Kline allegedly wrote
of ogling boys playing baseball in Little League games.</TE>
<TE>   Magistrate Arthur Nakazato barred Kline from logging on to the
Internet or having contact with anyone who works with children.He is
allowed to leave home only to visit his attorney or a physician.</TE>
<TE>   As his rivals battle for name recognition, Kline remains at home on
paid leave, drawing his $136,244 salary.</TE>
<TE>   The judge is not raising or spending any money on his campaign. He has
no friends or colleagues stumping on his behalf. And he declines to talk
to reporters about his election chances.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't talked to him, but I can't imagine that he wants to tap
dance right now for the job," said Frank Barbaro, chairman of the
county's Democratic Party and a friend of Kline's.</TE>
<TE>   Like many Orange County attorneys, Barbaro was shocked last fall when
Kline surrendered to federal authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Kline had forged tight bonds with many lawyers during his two decades
in civil practice. Barbaro recalled his own trepidation whenever Kline
opposed him in court, not least because of the Texas native's way of
charming jurors with his Southern drawl. Immensely knowledgeable about
courtroom law, Kline nevertheless projected a down-to-earth image.</TE>
<TE>   After his appointment to the bench in 1995, Kline earned a reputation
as a stickler for courtroom decorum and for keeping unwieldy civil cases
on track. He rarely allowed long-winded lawyers to digress and was quick
to snap at witnesses he felt were evading questions.</TE>
<TE>   Today, there is little evidence that Kline ever worked in the Santa
Ana courthouse. His nameplate over his courtroom door is gone. The 541
cases on his docket have been transferred to another judge. No one who
worked alongside Kline wants to talk about him. When a reporter tracked
down his clerk, now working in another courtroom, she scurried out a back
door.</TE>
<TE>   If he wins reelection, Kline's future as a judge will rest on the
outcome of the criminal charges against him. The pornography case is
likely to hinge on the credibility of the computer hacker who tapped into
the judge's computer. Kline's attorneys have suggested that the hacker
could have doctored Kline's files and downloaded the pornography himself.</TE>
<TE>   If Kline is convicted of a felony, California law calls for the
state's Commission on Judicial Performance to suspend him without pay. An
appeals court could overturn a conviction, in which case Kline would be
reinstated with back pay. But if his appeals were rejected, he would be
removed permanently from the bench.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal charges and upcoming election have put Orange County's
close-knit legal community on the defensive. At a political dinner last
week hosted by the Newport Beach Bar Assn., audience members expressed
dismay at the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a public perception that people in the legal community aren't
good people," said attorney Randy Bertz. "When this happened, it had a
negative impression on all of us."</TE>
<TE>   The write-in candidates tiptoed around Kline's criminal case while
speaking at the Newport Beach gathering before 40 or so lawyers, most of
whom already knew about the judge's legal problems.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, there was no such restraint as candidates attended a
luncheon put on by the Newport Harbor Republican Women.</TE>
<TE>   Their hammering found a receptive audience. Heads shook with disgust
in the dining room of the Bahia Corinthian Yacht Club as the charges
against Kline were read aloud.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just got to go," said Ginny Keller, a retired real estate
broker, over a plate of herb-encrusted sea bass. "He's already forfeited
that cherished trust. . . . It's very important that he doesn't get back
in."</TE>

<HD>Davis Seeks Reversal of Power Deals</HD>
<DH>Electricity: The state will petition U.S. to overturn long-term
pacts praised by the governor last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>In an about-face, Gov. Gray Davis is expected to announce today
that he will petition the federal government to overturn dozens of
long-term electricity contracts signed by California at the height of the
power crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Once heralded by Davis as the whip that tamed a wild electricity
market, the long-term contracts lately have been attacked as too
expensive by consumer advocates and lawmakers. The contracts also have
become an issue in the governor's race, where the three main
Republicans--former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Secretary of State
Bill Jones and financier Bill Simon Jr.--have criticized Davis' handling
of the state's energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Several state sources confirmed Saturday that the state will ask the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the nation's top referee of
wholesale electricity sales, to declare the state's $43 billion worth of
power contracts unreasonably high-priced and therefore subject to
modification.</LD>
<TE>   Contemplated for months by the California Public Utilities Commission,
such a request could at least give the state leverage in its so far
unsuccessful efforts to renegotiate the contracts, say some Davis
administration officials.</TE>
<TE>   But energy company officials now in contract-renegotiation talks with
the state say they welcome the challenge at FERC. "We're very confident
on the merits that these contracts will be upheld," said Joe Ronan, vice
president of government affairs for Calpine. The San Jose-based energy
company committed to sell California more electricity than any other
company under the contracts.</TE>
<TE>   California began negotiating such deals in January 2001, after soaring
prices left private utilities too financially crippled to buy power for
their customers.</TE>
<TE>   Eight Davis administration officials, including PUC President Loretta
Lynch and Davis' chief counsel, Barry Goode, are expected to explain the
FERC petition in a press teleconference today. California's challenge
would come under a federal law that requires FERC to ensure "just and
reasonable" wholesale electricity prices.</TE>
<TE>   The state will argue that manipulation by energy companies created
illegally high electricity prices in the market California created, with
FERC's endorsement, under a 1996 deregulation plan.</TE>
<TE>   Because energy companies use spot-market prices to guide the cost of
contracts that extend months or years into the future, the long-term
contracts signed in January and February 2001 are also unreasonably
expensive and should therefore be modified by FERC, according to
California officials.</TE>
<TE>   Since summer 2000, when electricity prices first spiked, California
politicians have beseeched FERC to intervene in the state's electricity
market. Mostly they've been frustrated by FERC's response.</TE>
<TE>   FERC did not impose strict price caps until June 2001, after President
Bush appointed two new members to the panel. FERC is still weighing
California's request for $8.9 billion in refunds from power sellers. The
Davis administration argues that the state was overcharged by that amount
on electricity sales in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>FERC Order May Help State's Cause</TE>
<TE>   As ammunition in its petitions to FERC, California officials will
point to a December 2000 order in which FERC concluded that the state's
market structure and rules give power sellers the opportunity to ratchet
up prices "and can result in unjust and unreasonable rates." Though FERC
concluded there was insufficient evidence to accuse individual companies
of manipulating the market, it urged the state's utilities to sign
long-term power contracts.</TE>
<TE>   California politicians say the state's pleas for help may fare better
at FERC since the December bankruptcy of Enron. The Houston company
aggressively lobbied FERC, Congress and other agencies to promote energy
deregulation and a hands-off approach to California's electricity
troubles. Earlier this month, FERC Chairman Patrick H. Wood III promised
a congressional committee that his agency would investigate whether Enron
and other companies manipulated California's power market and
inappropriately influenced the prices of long-term power contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Asking FERC now to help California amend its contracts would be a
complete turnabout for Davis from a year ago. Last March, as he announced
the signing of the first contracts, the governor called the deals
"financially viable." S. David Freeman, chief negotiator of the
contracts, has called them reasonably priced.</TE>
<TE>   But market prices plummeted in June, making the contracts expensive in
comparison. The contracts were designed to rescue California from having
to pay spot-market prices of $300 per megawatt-hour or more. Now, the
average price of the contracts--$88 per megawatt-hour--is roughly three
times more expensive than the spot market.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say some of the 54 contracts force the state to pay companies
whether they provide power or not, obligate the state to take more
electricity than it can use, and strap consumers with
higher-than-necessary electricity costs for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   The contracts are ultimately paid for by the customers of Pacific Gas
&amp; Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.</TE>
<TE>   After resisting calls to amend the contracts for several months, the
Davis administration in October invited energy companies back to the
negotiating table. So far, no agreements on contract changes have been
announced.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, utilities in Nevada and Washington filed similar petitions
challenging long-term contracts with FERC. Those petitions are pending.</TE>

<HD>A Fellow May Squirm a Bit in a Chair Endowed by Ken Lay</HD>
<DH>Academics: Professors find that posts created by Enron or its chief
are still plush but have lost luster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keith Poole figured that he'd landed a plum job two years ago when
he won a lifetime endowed professorship in political science at the
University of Houston. The salary was high, and the research budget was
generous.</LD>
<LD>   Poole was proud to be known as the Kenneth L. Lay professor of
political science. "It was a very prestigious title to have," Poole said.
"It isn't now."</LD>
<LD>   "Now I get a lot of ribbing from friends who tell me Enron jokes and
send funny e-mails asking whether Ken Lay wants his money back."</LD>
<TE>   For a variety of professors and university administrators, life hasn't
been the same since Enron Corp. collapsed and triggered nationwide furor
over its business practices. It once was something special to be offered
a Lay chair or an Enron professorship, but now some proud academics are
squirming in their seats.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like holding the Al Capone chair," said a laughing Robert S.
Erikson, Poole's predecessor in the Lay post at University of Houston and
now a political science professor at Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, even as the jokes fly, three universities are soldiering on with
plans to fill academic positions endowed in former Enron chairman Lay's
name--and by all accounts, applicants aren't holding back.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a Nebraska economist nearing the end of his six-year Enron
professorship is considering applying for another six.</TE>
<TE>   And even if the nation's roughly 40 Arthur Andersen professors of
accounting find their titles somewhat of a liability these days, they
aren't exactly turning in their green eyeshades to protest the Andersen
firm's handling of Enron's books.</TE>
<TE>   The predicament of these academics illustrates two fundamental rules
of higher education economics. Rule No. 1: More often than they care to
mention, institutions of higher learning pocket big contributions for
endowed chairs and campus buildings from people who land in society's
doghouse.</TE>
<TE>   Rule No. 2: Don't count on the schools to refund their dog-housed
donors' cash.</TE>
<TE>   Morton Owen Schapiro, president of Williams College in Massachusetts
and an economist with expertise in university finance, said schools too
often appear to take their cue from an old joke in fund-raising circles:
"The only thing wrong with tainted money is that there 'taint' enough of
it."</TE>
<TE>   Robber barons and other reviled tycoons have a long history of
bankrolling some of the nation's finest universities. Leland Stanford,
who built a railroad empire with exploited Chinese laborers, put up big
bucks to found Stanford University. Steel kingpin Andrew Carnegie, whose
company crushed union backers in the bloody Homestead strike, launched
Carnegie Mellon University.</TE>
<TE>   Professors typically argue that intellectual freedom is the real
issue. They say that so long as big benefactors don't meddle with their
academic work, the name that comes with the money normally doesn't
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't always carry the title of your chair as part of your
uniform," said Murray L. Weidenbaum, an economist who was the Ken Lay,
Vinson &amp; Elkins visiting scholar at Rice University in Houston for five
months early last year.</TE>
<TE>   Weidenbaum says he doesn't put much stock in titles. Then again, he's
got a few to spare: He was the first chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisors in the Reagan administration, an assistant secretary of the
Treasury in the Nixon administration and today is the Mallinckrodt
Distinguished University professor at Washington University (named after
a respected business figure in St. Louis).</TE>
<TE>   "Often, I just refer to myself as someone who teaches economics," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it is named, a well-endowed chair can be hard to resist. At
the University of Missouri-Columbia, the open Kenneth Lay chair in
international economics offers a salary of up to $180,000 for the
nine-month academic year, plus money for research assistants and for
travel to conferences.</TE>
<TE>   "People would take a little ribbing for that kind of money," said
Kenneth R. Troske, a labor economist who is heading the search committee.
He said there's been no scarcity of applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the university, which Lay attended as an undergraduate,
say they are hopeful they will find a first-rate international economist
to help upgrade their economics department. After all, said Michael
Podgursky, who heads the department, no crime has been proven in the
Enron affair.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very grateful to Ken Lay for giving us $1.2 million. Period,"
Podgursky added. "Within our faculty, there hasn't been a murmur of,
'Let's give the money back.' "</TE>
<TE>   Student reaction has been similarly blase, said Patrick Terpstra,
editor in chief of the Maneater, the official student newspaper. "The
reaction has been pretty much nothing. Students aren't really following
the Enron scandal as much as I think the general public is."</TE>
<TE>   Terpstra, though, is personally peeved. If the decision were his to
make, he "would get Ken Lay's name out of there. I think a lot of people
are associating this with somebody who contributed to the demise of
20,000 people's stock portfolios and livelihoods. The greatest analogy
I've heard is that it's a guy who, when the Titanic sunk, he got on a
life raft . . . and let everyone else drown."</TE>
<TE>   At Rice University, administrators have had to call off plans to fill
two Enron chairs in the management school because of the company's
descent into bankruptcy reorganization. But officials said they still
have a pledge from the Lay Family Foundation to complete the financing
for a Lay chair in economics and a related research center, the Ken Lay
Center for the Study of Markets in Transition.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was the Adolf Hitler chair, that would be a different thing,"
said Bob Stein, dean of the school of social sciences at Rice University
and a member of the search committee.</TE>
<TE>   He added that "whatever the source of money, I think the institution
that accepts it is trying to do something beneficial with it. I've not
had any candidates say 'I don't want to be the Ken Lay chair.' "</TE>
<TE>   At the University of Houston--where Lay obtained his economics
doctorate--officials still hope to add a Lay professor in economics, in
addition to the existing Lay political science post filled by Poole.</TE>
<TE>   University faculty who already have Enron-related titles--from the
dozens of Arthur Andersen teachers to the couple of Enron and Lay
professors--have shown no interest in giving up their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Wohar, for instance, will continue as the Enron professor of
economics at the University of Nebraska at Omaha until next year. After
that, he may apply for a new six-year appointment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm as outraged as anyone about the dealings at Enron. But I have no
bad feelings about the previous years that I've had the chair," he said.
"The money was given to the university in good faith, and I'm not
embarrassed about it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, to give himself a break from the constant jibes, Wohar deleted
the Enron title from his e-mail signature. "I was getting everything from
ribbing to questions about my relationship with Enron from as far away as
Australia," he said. "I don't have time for all of that."</TE>
<TE>   Insofar as town-gown diplomacy goes, the Lay, Enron or Andersen
positions might not even be the most difficult to defend. Consider
Harvard's law and design schools, which have a combined endowment of $2
million from the family of Osama bin Laden, who is one of at least 50
siblings. The Bin Laden money finances short-term fellowships for
visiting scholars.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard officials emphasize, however, that the family has long
dissociated itself from Osama, and there is no evidence that it has been
linked to any terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas I. White, director of the Center for Ethics and Business at
Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, said universities would be
well-advised to take a tougher stand toward donations with potentially
tainted ties.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true we live in a society where people are presumed innocent
until proven guilty, but we aren't talking about a court of law here,"
said White, who holds the Hilton chair at Loyola Marymount. "We're
talking about what message does a university send to the public and to
its students about its values."</TE>
<TE>   White said he's given the issue a lot of thought lately. He's on the
verge of launching a campaign to secure an endowment in the range of $5
million to $10 million for his ethics center.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, when the whole Enron thing broke, I thought, 'Well, I'm sure
glad I'm not the Enron Center for Ethics and Business,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the University of Houston's Poole said he isn't doing anything
to distance himself from the Lay name.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to change my title or my stationery. I'm not going to
take it off my Web site. Why should I?" he said. "I didn't have anything
to do with it [Enron's collapse]. After all, Ken Lay's family and friends
paid for it. The checks have cleared. I'm not going to kick the guy when
he's down."</TE>

<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Shivering in the dark outside his uncle's mud house, Nazak punched
a number into a $1,500 telephone, angled the phone's antenna south toward
a communications satellite over the Indian Ocean, and pressed "OK."</LD>
<LD>   "Salaam aleikum," rumbled a voice on the other end. "Peace be with
you."</LD>
<LD>   "Salaam aleikum," the skinny, fine-featured 22-year-old replied in the
Afghan style. "I have some coordinates."</LD>
<TE>   "Go ahead," the voice said.</TE>
<TE>   Nazak gave readings from a global positioning system that indicated
the exact locations of several buildings housing Taliban fighters,
munitions and armor on the west end of Kandahar. He detailed the
approximate dimensions of the barracks and storage sheds and of the open
spaces between them. He drew a verbal picture of the surrounding
neighborhood of mud-and-straw huts.</TE>
<TE>   The men said good night and hung up. It was Oct. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-eight hours later, U.S. bombs rained down, leveling much of the
compound on the first night of the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Four years of dangerous work was finally paying off for Nazak, one in
a network of spies who were keeping tabs on the Taliban and Al Qaeda
forces, waiting for a chance to oust them. But his success would add to
his peril, triggering Taliban manhunts for the enemies within.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the military campaign in Afghanistan has been hidden from the
outside world. U.S. briefings on operations remain bare bones. The war
largely has been conducted by warplanes thousands of feet in the air and
U.S. special operations forces working unseen on mountaintops and in
caves.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly three months after the collapse of the Taliban, however,
details are beginning to emerge. And the tale of how the Taliban forces
were driven from their stronghold turns out to be a spy story as well as
a war story.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon acknowledged soon after its air campaign began that it
was using detailed information from the Afghan opposition to spot Taliban
and Al Qaeda targets. Defense officials say the Afghans were supplied
with satellite telephones and other sophisticated equipment, and
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld has said their help was crucial
to the success of the U.S. bombing campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But until now, the spotters' story has not been told. Nowhere in
Afghanistan was a more natural venue for spies than Kandahar, the seat of
Taliban power and probably the most difficult of all Afghan cities for an
outsider to penetrate.</TE>
<TE>   The spies were at work well before the United States attacked. Nazak
and others took mental notes and drew maps on scraps of paper, hiding
them in walls or wrapping them in oilcloths and burying them in
hayfields.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for their day to come, they provided details of key military
installations in this dusty city of dead-end alleys, open sewers and war
scars. They tracked the movements of Osama bin Laden and Taliban leader
Mullah Mohammed Omar.</TE>
<TE>   They worked in a cell-type intelligence structure, so even today most
operatives know virtually nothing about others who were performing
similar tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Each spy was directed by a single person. And most could only guess
what that person was doing with the information.</TE>
<TE>   Nazak was under the tutelage of his uncle Abdullah Khyal, who was so
trusted by the Taliban that he commanded a regiment. Khyal and other
higher-level spies were delivering the information in person to Afghan
tribal chiefs living as expatriates in Pakistan. Those leaders included
now-interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai and beefy, tempestuous Gul Agha
Shirzai, the powerful pre-Taliban governor of Kandahar province who has
since regained his post.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,
the tribal leaders began passing much of the information on to the U.S.
military, according to many sources here.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave the Americans everything they wanted," said one source close
to Karzai, who continues to take calls from operatives in several
provinces and spoke on condition of anonymity. "Our people were telling
us what needed to be bombed, and certainly we told the Americans."</TE>
<TE>An Uncle Took Nazak Under His Wing</TE>
<TE>   By the time of the first U.S. strikes, Nazak already was a bitter
enemy of the Taliban, and a seasoned operative.</TE>
<TE>   Like many Afghans, he has only one name. Nazak is a nickname; his real
name is Hamdullah, but he never uses it. The young man learned political
history at home, from his best friend and uncle, Khyal, 33. Sitting on
red and purple cushions in the low-slung collection of mud huts shared by
25 members of his extended family, Khyal taught that the Taliban forces
were pretenders to a throne rightfully held by Mohammad Zaher Shah, whose
1973 ouster in a military coup started Afghanistan on its long downward
spiral.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Taliban had largely halted the rapacious abuses of
warlords, the regime had quickly become fanatical, wrongly invoking the
Koran to ban music, shaving, kite-flying, even cheering at a soccer
match, Khyal told Nazak. Women were forced to cover themselves with the
burka, and the Taliban beat them if the garment flapped open.</TE>
<TE>   Serious beyond his years, Nazak quickly came to agree with his uncle.
"We were so upset with what was going on in our country," he said. "It
was so shameful, so embarrassing. I wanted to die if I could help save my
country."</TE>
<TE>   One day, the Taliban would be overthrown, Khyal promised. And he and
Nazak would help.</TE>
<TE>   Nazak was 18--and the Taliban had been in power two years--when he
began roaming Kandahar with a purpose.</TE>
<TE>   In his wanderings he saw Taliban leaders gathering at night at Zabar
Bridge, south of the city. Sometimes he used a borrowed Yamaha 125
motorcycle; other times he drove the family's aging yellow-and-white
Toyota Corolla. He had to return home by the 9 p.m. curfew.</TE>
<TE>   In front of Mullah Omar's estate, he noted, stood an evenly spaced
man-made forest of desert pines that could make vehicles virtually
useless in any attack on the reclusive leader. Kandahar's main prison was
separated into three sections: one for those who violated Taliban
religious edicts, one for common criminals and the last for political
prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Nazak donned the black turban of the Taliban on his outings, and he
grew the fullest beard he could--though it was notably sparse. The
combination of the turban and his wispy black beard actually seemed to
improve his disguise. He looked young and naive--the perfect true
believer.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes Khyal, wearing his own secretly despised beard and turban,
joined Nazak on his spy missions. When Khyal was along, the two could go
almost anywhere: inside Taliban munitions compounds, into a trench system
near the airport.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, Khyal had sought to gain the trust of the Taliban
despite his family's known support of the former king. And he had
succeeded. The Taliban rewarded him with his own military command of
several dozen troops. When Khyal strode into a Taliban training camp to
spy, the soldiers saluted him.</TE>
<TE>   When Khyal was not working with Nazak, he was sometimes scouting camps
and barracks with a 25-year-old farmer named Aimal or a soft-spoken
28-year-old named Faiz Mohammed, who defused land mines for a living.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to go see military regiments . . . to count the soldiers and
see where they slept," said Mohammed. "We got the [coordinates] for the
Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, and many
other places. Usually we went on motorcycles. Sometimes [Abdullah] Khyal
rode on the back of mine; sometimes he rode his black Honda 70."</TE>
<TE>   Nazak, back in a tiny room at his home, drew maps from memory and
wrote out lists. And every so often, his uncle tucked some of those
papers into his baggy shalwar kameez pants and shirt and made the
full-day drive to Quetta, Pakistan, to deliver intelligence to Shirzai,
then the most powerful of the Pushtun tribal leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Quetta, a frontier town that has long been a haven for spies,
plotters, smugglers, arms dealers and vacationing warlords, was also a
dangerous place. Khyal's comings and goings were almost certainly noted.
But virtually every Kandahar resident has family living either in a
refugee camp across the border or in Quetta, and travel between the two
cities was allowed.</TE>
<TE>Well-Connected Karzai Also Had Operatives</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Karzai, who had fewer soldiers but more political
connections than Shirzai, was receiving reports of his own in Quetta.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them were funneled through the long-bearded Abdul Ali, who
before the Taliban seized power managed the Kandahar radio station, and
now does so again.</TE>
<TE>   It was early evening in Kandahar on Sept. 11 when the first hijacked
plane, American Airlines Flight 11, crashed into the north tower of New
York's World Trade Center. Kandahar radio continued to broadcast its
usual lineup of Koranic verses and religious lectures as the other planes
crashed.</TE>
<TE>   Like many Afghans, Nazak and Khyal learned of the attacks by listening
to the British Broadcasting Corp.'s Pashto-language news service on an
outlawed shortwave radio.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden was almost immediately identified as the prime suspect.
Their time had come, Nazak and Khyal realized. There would be a war
against the Taliban. And they would help.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later, Khyal dispatched his nephew to Quetta for an
emergency meeting with Shirzai, who had spent seven years in Pakistan
waiting to return to the Kandahar governor's mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Nazak expected to receive guns or grenades. Instead, Shirzai
disappeared into another room and returned with an Iridium satellite
phone, a device the size of a large walkie-talkie. He showed Nazak how to
use the phone and gave him a number beginning with 873, the code for
another telephone using the Indian Ocean satellite.</TE>
<TE>   Shirzai also gave him a black hand-held Global Positioning System
device and a miniature camcorder. The devices were purchased in Dubai,
people close to Shirzai say, with money from wealthy Afghan expatriates.</TE>
<TE>   Using a small screwdriver, Nazak removed the radio from the dashboard
of his Toyota. He slid the phone, the GPS unit and the video camera
through the opening and screwed the radio back into place. The next day,
he slipped back into Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Outside his house, in a neighborhood of low-slung mud huts on the
south side of the city, Nazak went to work. First, he cut a two-inch hole
in the grille of the car and mounted the camcorder behind it. He wrapped
the GPS unit in a shawl and buried it in a field. He took the phone to
another uncle's house in nearby Gurgan, a rural area where no neighbors
could see a man making a call.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several weeks, Nazak patrolled constantly, mostly alone.
He would lift the hood of the car, switch on the camera, close the hood
and go for a well-planned drive. He recorded increased traffic going into
and out of Omar's compound, Al Qaeda fighters patrolling the airport, and
trucks leaving an ammunition depot and heading up the road toward Kabul,
the capital.</TE>
<TE>   He took the tapes home and reviewed them. And every day or two, at a
prearranged time, he or Khyal would stand outside the house in Gurgan,
dial the satellite phone number and report their findings, always to
Shirzai himself, Nazak says.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he and his uncle sent a courier to deliver two videotapes
to Shirzai. The courier, a female friend, crossed the border with the
tapes hidden beneath her sky-blue burka.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Abdul Ali, the radio station manager, had been gathering
intelligence from as many as 50 operatives, he says, and delivering it to
Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   During a trip to Quetta about three weeks after the terrorist attacks,
Ali obtained a satellite phone from Karzai. Ali understood that the phone
was provided by the U.S. military. A female relative smuggled it into
Afghanistan beneath her burka.</TE>
<TE>   In Kandahar, Ali set up his phone in what he considered the safest
place: in plain sight. He put it on a desk in the shop of a money-changer
who used a similar phone to stay updated on the currency market.</TE>
<TE>   When he dialed another 873 number, it was often Karzai's brother,
Ahmed, who answered. Now a member of the Kandahar shura, or governing
council, Ahmed Karzai says he took many calls from spotters, not only in
Kandahar but also in surrounding provinces.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 7, shortly after nightfall, Kandahar felt the first shock
waves of the new war. Bombs and cruise missiles destroyed the airport's
radar facility and control tower, part of Omar's estate and Taliban
national headquarters. Targets in Kabul, the northern city of
Mazar-i-Sharif and the eastern town of Jalalabad also were hit.</TE>
<TE>   Because it remains unclear precisely how many people were spying and
how the United States weighed their information against its own
intelligence, it is impossible to know exactly what information was used
to hit any single target.</TE>
<TE>   But spies say they called in the coordinates for most of the targets
around Kandahar before the war began. Nazak had given coordinates for
Zabar Bridge, which was hit in the first days; the main prison, which was
also hit; and about 10 other targets, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their lack of direct contact with the Americans, the spotters
quickly shifted their mission. After each strike, they fanned out to
survey the damage, returning with reports of hits and misses that the
cell leaders immediately phoned in.</TE>
<TE>   Khyal and Faiz Mohammed had given the coordinates for the widely
despised Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice,
which enforced the Taliban's draconian rules.</TE>
<TE>   A few days into the air war, three bombs hit Kandahar about 2:30 p.m.
The first destroyed an electrical substation 100 yards north of the
ministry, the second struck and damaged part of the ministry and the
third fell on a home 100 yards south of the ministry, killing eight
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Khyal and Mohammed surveyed the damage, took further GPS readings and
surmised that the bombs missed because their original directions had
somehow been turned 90 degrees. In the early evening, Khyal phoned
Shirzai, Mohammed says, delivering details of the miss and emphasizing
that the building was aligned east to west rather than north to south.
About 11 p.m., three more bombs leveled the ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Most targets were bombed or re-bombed within 24 hours after spotters
phoned in, several operatives say. Ali says that about 80% of the several
dozen targets he called in were eventually struck.</TE>
<TE>   Residents recall two major instances in which bombs missed their
target and killed civilians: the attack on the home near the ministry,
and another in a village northeast of Kandahar in which more than two
dozen people are believed to have died.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, however, the spies were stunned by the accuracy of the
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "We promised the Americans, 'We will help you if you only hit the
government and Taliban buildings. If you hit civilians, we won't help
you,' " Ali said. Most of the strikes were "bang, on target. Nobody could
imagine it could be so good."</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 9, the Northern Alliance captured Mazar-i-Sharif. Less than a
week later, the Taliban abandoned Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai, aided by the U.S., gathered a few hundred fighters and moved
south toward Kandahar. On Nov. 15, Shirzai, also with the help of
Americans, crossed into Afghanistan from Pakistan with about 1,000
fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few weeks, according to commanders from both armies,
each received dozens of calls from operatives in Kandahar and other
southern cities, who provided notification when a Taliban regiment
departed to confront them or rearranged its defenses.</TE>
<TE>   "Our guys were informing us every hour, at times," said Khalid
Pushtoon, one of Shirzai's commanders and now a top aide. "Our guys would
call and say, 'A hundred more troops are coming.' We were always ready
for them."</TE>
<TE>   If the Taliban forces had been receiving the same quality of
intelligence, they could have attacked and probably devastated their
adversaries, anti-Taliban commanders acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban hierarchy in Kandahar had limited knowledge of its enemies
without but realized quickly that it was also fighting enemies within.
Omar began interrupting radio broadcasts of Koran recitations to threaten
anyone working for anti-Taliban forces and to encourage Kandahar
residents to report anyone with a satellite phone.</TE>
<TE>   Around Nov. 14, Shirzai phoned Khyal--rather than the other way
around--just before the appointed hour, Nazak says. Shirzai briskly told
Khyal that he should gather his family and leave immediately for
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, we will see you soon, God willing," Khyal said. "Don't worry."</TE>
<TE>   "See you soon, God willing," Shirzai replied. "Be careful."</TE>
<TE>   Without telling any relatives, Nazak and Khyal packed all the family's
documents, currency, jewelry and other valuables into a ragged leather
briefcase. The next morning, Khyal sent Nazak to pick up the Toyota from
a relative's house. Khyal then went out, perhaps to pass on instructions
or warnings to other operatives.</TE>
<TE>   As he walked along Shikar Pur Darwaza street, dodging rickshaws and
mule carts, a pickup truck roared up and slammed on its brakes. Several
Taliban policemen leaped from the back, aiming their rifles at Khyal and
declaring him under arrest for spying.</TE>
<TE>   When Nazak returned with the car and walked through the wooden gate
into the courtyard of his home, police were waiting for him too.</TE>
<TE>   They already had gone through the briefcase. Among the valuables he
and Khyal had packed were papers containing handwritten GPS coordinates,
sketches of Taliban buildings and the phone number with the telltale 873
prefix indicating a satellite phone.</TE>
<TE>   The beatings began almost as soon as they got to the jail.</TE>
<TE>   Working two at a time with truncheons or cables, Nazak says, police
beat the bottoms of his feet until the skin was gone. They ordered him to
confess to treason and to reveal where the satellite phone was. When he
refused, they poured salt on his feet.</TE>
<TE>   The next night, guards moved to his back; the night after, to his
head, using the cable to avoid crushing his skull.</TE>
<TE>   From his lightless cell, Nazak listened to the bombing and tried to
guess what was being hit--the ammunition depot on the eastern edge of the
city, the airport eight miles past that, the barracks for Taliban
Regiment No. 2. Beatings usually followed bombings, with the proximity of
the explosions dictating the severity of the blows.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me, 'You and your uncle are spies for America,' " Nazak
said. " 'You are bringing this bombing.' "</TE>
<TE>   "We are Taliban," Nazak would say.</TE>
<TE>   Around Dec. 1, after more than two weeks of daily beatings, Khyal, a
husband and father of three, died of the torture. He never talked.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban hung his body in Martyrs' Square in Kandahar, leaving it
dangling for three days to teach the citizenry a lesson. Part of the
time, his body was wrapped in a banner that read: "Abdullah, son of
Habibullah, inhabitant of Salehan, who had a satellite telephone and was
giving information to the Americans, and was killing Muslims through the
Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Nazak's beatings continued. He knew nothing about the death of his
uncle. He was growing weak, but so was the Taliban. He could tell.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the spies fled the city after learning of Khyal's death.
Ali took his satellite phone and headed north, linking up with Karzai. So
did another member of his cell, named Hamdullah.</TE>
<TE>   Faiz Mohammed and Aimal, who worked for Khyal, made their way east and
joined the troops of their tribal leader, Shirzai.</TE>
<TE>   The number of phone calls then dropped precipitously, both camps say.
But the spies had already done their job. The Taliban was collapsing.</TE>
<TE>   "They kept saying, 'We won't leave you alive when we go,' " Nazak
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban forces fled Dec. 7 without carrying out their threat,
after a fierce battle between Shirzai's troops and mostly Al Qaeda
fighters at the Kandahar airport.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, soldiers and family members carried Nazak from his
cell. He asked about his uncle. They told him that Abdullah Khyal was all
right, that he should sleep. The next day the family took Nazak to his
uncle's grave.</TE>
<TE>   "He never told them a thing," Nazak said proudly. "The satellite phone
was still at my uncle's house. We buried the GPS in the dirt. The video
camera was still underneath the hood of our car. My uncle didn't tell
them anything."</TE>
<TE>   Nazak still walks gingerly, his feet perhaps permanently damaged. His
eyesight, which deteriorated badly from the beatings, has largely
returned, though his hearing has not.</TE>
<TE>   The break in his aquiline nose is still visible. He seems to forget
the names of friends.</TE>
<TE>   Shirzai rewarded Nazak with the command of 15 soldiers. Most are
several years his senior. He takes them to the family home and shows them
pictures of his uncle: the ones before the Taliban, when Khyal sported
only a mustache; the ones with him in the middle of a flock of doves in
Herat; the one, snapped by a cousin and printed in Pakistan, of a crowd
watching Khyal's body hanging in the square and twisting in the dusty
wind.</TE>
<TE>   "The Taliban are gone," Nazak said. "My uncle is very happy."</TE>

<HD>Colombia Raises Government Profile in Former Rebel Zone</HD>
<DH>Latin America: President Andres Pastrana leads a campaign to win
over residents, who still fear a military backlash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>As this frontier town slept Saturday morning, Pvt. Daladio Torres
and 300 comrades slipped into the main square at dawn, the first soldiers
to enter the former rebel capital in three years.</LD>
<LD>   Torres strode through the silence to a rebel flag flying at the
square's edge, tore it down and threw it in the nearest waste container.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a disrespect to Colombia," he said. "This flag belongs in the
trash."</LD>
<TE>   With that, the Colombian army retook the largest city in the
Switzerland-sized zone that the government ceded to the leftist
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, three years ago for
peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   As the takeover of the zone continued as smoothly as it had begun
three days ago, there were neither casualties nor confrontations between
the guerrillas and the army, military officials said. Most military
analysts believe that the guerrillas have retreated into the nearby
jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Police and military officials said they had yet to enter all of the
five towns in the zone, explaining that they were proceeding cautiously
in a region the rebels have dominated for decades. Army patrols found a
bus booby-trapped with explosives on one road, and they have discovered
several minefields.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, the Colombian air force denied responsibility for the
deaths of three people allegedly struck last week by a stray bomb. An air
force official who declined to be named said that the three, including a
2-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl, were at a cocaine processing lab
when the bomb hit near a remote village about a five-hour drive north of
Bogota, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   In an emotional day for a country long divided over the decision to
cede territory in the search for peace, Colombian President Andres
Pastrana led a delegation of government officials, police and soldiers
that arrived here to reestablish the government's presence. Four U.S.
Embassy officers, including the military attache, also accompanied him.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here. We are with you," said Pastrana, who was mobbed by
crowds as he toured the town square. "We are going to continue working
with you. We are going to continue working for peace in Colombia."</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana, who has staked his presidency on the success of the peace
process, noted that negotiations had begun badly when rebel leader Manuel
Marulanda failed to show up for opening ceremonies. The image of Pastrana
sitting by an empty chair became a symbol of the fruitless talks.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana said he continues to believe that talks are the only way to
bring an end to the country's 38-year-old conflict. Nonetheless, he also
said he is pushing for permission to use U.S.-donated helicopters and
other equipment that are restricted to anti-drug efforts to directly
combat the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian conflict pits the military and right-wing paramilitary
groups against the FARC and a smaller leftist army, the National
Liberation Army, or ELN. Washington has gradually become more involved as
it seeks to stem the flow to the U.S. of Colombian cocaine, a source of
revenue for both the paramilitary groups and the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana said that the rebels must "leave behind terrorism and leave
behind narco-trafficking" before he will reenter negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "The solution continues to be a negotiated one," said the president,
who abruptly called off talks last week after the FARC hijacked a plane
and kidnapped a senator. "We have to look for it."</TE>
<TE>   The FARC issued a statement in which it said it would negotiate with a
"future government" more interested in the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   The official presence here Saturday marked the newest phase of the
government's strategy, an all-out hearts-and-minds campaign to win over
the estimated 100,000 people who live in the zone.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana promised that the government will invest in new roads and
infrastructure throughout the long-ignored zone, a mostly unpopulated
region of rolling hills that lead into the plains of eastern Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30 soldiers from psychological operations and public
relations arrived with the other troops. They handed out Colombian flags,
bandannas and small notebooks that listed residents' human rights under
international conventions.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers were instructed to wave hello and chat with locals. They
erected black-and-white banners in the main square and outside the town.
"Trust your army!" one read. "We won't fail you."</TE>
<TE>   This campaign promises to be difficult. Most residents were anxious
about their fate at the hands of a military that in the past has
frequently been linked to the paramilitary groups, which commit most of
the massacres in Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little worrisome for us," said Oscar Rujillo, 35, a butcher
who was slashing sides of beef as the soldiers passed. "You don't know
what's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the complicated task of mending a region that has
existed as the private fiefdom of leftist guerrillas who ruled through
fear and showed little interest in improving the lives of locals.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrillas frequently seized cars at gunpoint, giving them to militia
members. During "judicial" hearings, they favored sympathizers, leaving
residents who remained neutral without appeal. Many people disappeared
without a trace. Others were found dead.</TE>
<TE>   "There is going to be a settling of accounts," said one man, who did
not want to give his name. "That's the danger."</TE>
<TE>   Yet another question hanging in the air this weekend is when
authorities will begin attacking the zone's coca fields. The area has
been exempt from a controversial aerial fumigation program backed by the
U.S., and the number of acres under cultivation has jumped from 20,000 to
50,000, according to Gen. Ernesto Gilibert, head of the national police.</TE>
<TE>   He said that spraying would begin soon.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the problems ahead, the mood here for most of Saturday was one
of triumph.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Leonardo Acosta couldn't help expressing his joy when another
major called him via radio telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen," he said. "Now San Vicente is part of the country again."</TE>

<HD>Bush's Asia Tour 'a Victory of Low Expectations'</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: President didn't set out to make breakthroughs. His most
tangible achievement may be arranging a visit by China's vice president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>He came and he saw, but President Bush didn't conquer much new turf
on his six-day swing through Asia.</LD>
<LD>   Reflecting a different strategy from the style of the Clinton White
House, however, the Bush administration didn't set out to produce
breakthroughs, new agreements or dramatic "deliverables" during summits
in China, South Korea and Japan, according to a senior administration
official.</LD>
<LD>   Prospects for any major development on the three-nation tour were also
limited by the fact that two of the leaders Bush visited were lame ducks
and the third might have problems holding on to power. Chinese President
Jiang Zemin is set to step down next year. South Korea is holding
elections in December to replace its president, Kim Dae Jung, who can't
run again. And in Japan, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's popularity
has plummeted recently.</LD>
<TE>   So, although the scorecard looks decidedly mixed, the White House
considers last week's tour to have been a success. Before leaving here
Friday after a sightseeing stop at the Great Wall, Bush declared the trip
"fantastic, beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   In reality, it was more like "a victory of low expectations,"
concluded Bates Gill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In Beijing, the president didn't get an agreement on limiting the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction--his top priority with China
and a central tenet of his foreign policy worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush did expand and deepen a key relationship, most notably by
establishing contact with the next generation of political leadership in
China and with the country's youth. The most tangible of his achievements
might prove to be arranging a visit to the U.S. by Hu Jintao, China's
vice president and the heir apparent to Jiang.</TE>
<TE>   "The visit was about relationship-building above everything else and
investing in the young dot-Communists," said Min Xin Pei, a senior fellow
at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   So, although the administration's top goal remains elusive, there was
some balance in the outcome of the China stop.</TE>
<TE>   In Seoul, the onetime momentum behind Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kim's
"sunshine policy," an effort to reach out to North Korea and eventually
reunify the Korean peninsula, appears to have thoroughly dissipated, in
part because of Bush's tough talk on North Korea. Since his State of the
Union address, Bush has repeatedly called the regime in Pyongyang, the
North's capital, one of three in an "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   Bush did express his willingness to engage in dialogue with the North.
But whereas the Clinton administration was negotiating a deal under which
the North would end its production and distribution of ballistic
missiles, Bush added the issue of North Korean troop withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   "The president showed that muscular rhetoric, speaking in morally
clear tones, is not incompatible with reaching out to the North Korean
regime," the senior administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction in both halves of the divided peninsula didn't bode well
for any imminent development, however.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea lashed out at Bush in a Foreign Ministry statement Friday
that dismissed him as a "politically backward child." The official Korean
Central News Agency on Saturday described the presidential visit as "a
war junket to finally examine the preparations for a war on the spot."
And it called Bush's comments about the North "the gangster-like logic of
a typical rogue and a kingpin of terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The press in the South, for its part, painted a gloomy picture. Some
in South Korea actually saw the visit as a setback.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush may have no preconditions for dialogue with North Korea, but he
doesn't sound like a man trying seriously to lure an adversary to the
negotiating table," said the editor of the English-language Joong Ang
Ilbo in a stinging column.</TE>
<TE>   "That's it. Rest in peace, sunshine policy. Kim Dae Jung is finally a
sure-enough lame duck," the newspaper column went on. The party leading
the polls has been deeply critical of Kim's policy.</TE>
<TE>   So the Korean leg of the tour, as anticipated, produced the least.</TE>
<TE>   In Tokyo, finally, the president's polite public support of Koizumi's
reform efforts was at least initially perceived as inadequate to turn
around a deeply troubled economy--or prevent deeper problems.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials insisted that a much firmer message was delivered--and
accepted--in private: to spur greater movement on stalled reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the nature of the relationship, we were able to speak
clearly, but we chose to do that in private. It doesn't help our
interests to deliberately weaken or undercut those who will have to
institute those reforms," the senior administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   The sensitivity of the Japanese market to American input was reflected
in a brief wave of panic that sent the yen into decline when Bush
mistakenly said he had discussed "devaluation," rather than "deflation,"
with Koizumi. The currency popped back up as soon as the White House
issued a clarification.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush put too much emphasis on security and not on the economy, which
is the real issue. The falling stock market, the bond market and the bad
loan issue should have been addressed years ago. That's the really urgent
matter," said Atsuo Mihara, an independent economic analyst.</TE>
<TE>   "Before President Bush came, the Japanese market really expected that
he would put pressure on Japan to look at the economic problems
seriously. Now we'll have to wait for a crisis."</TE>
<TE>   So the effect of the Japan stop is still to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   The administration said the imminent leadership turnovers in at least
two of his destinations didn't affect talks.</TE>
<TE>   En route home, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said: "It's just the
way it is in this world. People turn over, and you have to deal with the
leaders that are there."</TE>

<HD>Sweden Seeks to Bolster Gay Couples' Right to Adopt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>STOCKHOLM
</DL>
<LD>Swedes have long been social trailblazers in defining gay rights
and blended-family values, but even in this liberal bastion the law still
needs to catch up with common practice.</LD>
<LD>   Lawmakers are now debating a bill that would give gay and lesbian
couples the right to adopt children both in Sweden and abroad, and it is
expected to easily win approval in June when parliament votes on the
measure.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters hail the legislation not only for aiming to rectify
discrimination against same-sex couples, but also for the clarity it
should bring to murky legalities surrounding children already growing up
with gay parents.</LD>
<TE>   "Such households exist in our society, and in increasing numbers, so
we have to recognize that," says Marianne Carlstrom, a lawmaker from
Prime Minister Goran Persson's Social Democratic Labor Party, which is
sponsoring the bill. "We can't address the needs of these children with
gay parents unless we have a legal framework that includes the adoption
issue."</TE>
<TE>   Under current law, a single parent of either sex can qualify for
adoption if he or she passes an extensive state-administered battery of
tests probing financial status, emotional stability and social
environment. A friend or relative of the opposite sex of the adoptive
parent must also commit to providing a gender model for the child.</TE>
<TE>   But partners in registered same-sex relationships or marriages are
ineligible to adopt, although the law is powerless to prevent a gay
person who is single from adopting and bringing up the child with his or
her partner. In-vitro fertilization also is restricted to
heterosexuals--another inconsistency that parliament is expected to
address simultaneously with the adoption law revisions.</TE>
<TE>   The current legal gaps hamstring courts increasingly being called on
to decide custody and support issues when gay couples with children
separate through divorce or death. Legal rights favor the biological
mother, but even those are ill-defined if the child was produced by
unauthorized in-vitro fertilization.</TE>
<TE>   Just last month, a court in the southern city of Orebro ruled that a
35-year-old man who had donated sperm for a lesbian couple's three
children is financially responsible for the offspring now that the
partners have separated.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the consequences of having obsolete laws. This case is
being appealed, but it's difficult to see how the court could rule any
other way under the existing laws defining parental rights and
responsibilities," says Robert Karlsson Svard, information chief for the
Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights.</TE>
<TE>   Swedish family law still tends to define children and parental rights
in the context of a traditional nuclear family, Svard says. With half of
Swedish children born out of wedlock and more than a third of marriages
ending in divorce, the legally enshrined model no longer applies to the
majority of families, he notes.</TE>
<TE>   The interest group with 6,500 members was consulted in the bill's
drafting and is satisfied with the changes it will bring, Svard says,
adding that it will give Sweden the most liberal adoption framework in
Europe. Gay adoption already is legal in the Netherlands but only
applicable to children born in that country, which, like Sweden, has a
dearth of children available for adoption because of liberal abortion and
welfare laws.</TE>
<TE>   Gay marriage has been legally recognized in Sweden since 1995,
encouraging more openness about sexual orientation, Svard says. But
neither the federation nor the government maintains statistics on the
numbers of gay couples who have married.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden's legislation already has won endorsement by all political
parties represented in parliament with the exception of the Christian
Democrats and the right-of-center Moderates, Carlstrom says. That support
should ensure a solid majority during a vote set for June 5 and its
passage into law in 2003, she says. Nonetheless, a passionate debate is
expected.</TE>
<TE>   "There is opposition, even in my own party, but it is based more on
emotion than facts. There's not much research on same-sex couples as
parents, but we have every reason to believe they are as stable and
nurturing as heterosexual parents," Carlstrom says.</TE>
<TE>   Svard argues that the bar is probably set even higher for gay couples
to qualify for adoption.</TE>
<TE>   "There are more rigid demands on these parents, in the same way that a
woman in a male-dominated workplace often has to work twice as hard to be
successful," he says.</TE>

<HD>Zimbabwe Shrugs Off Sanctions</HD>
<DH>Africa: A top official says the government will not bow to U.S.
pressure over upcoming election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>GWANDA, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>A top official of President Robert Mugabe on Saturday scoffed at
new U.S. sanctions, while an official said the government should take
over businesses owned by whites and people of Indian origin.</LD>
<LD>   Mugabe also lambasted former colonial power Britain, which spearheaded
the imposition of similar European Union sanctions against him and his
aides.</LD>
<LD>   The 78-year-old Mugabe hopes to extend his 22-year rule by beating
opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai in the March 9-10 election.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Washington issued an order barring Mugabe and senior aides
and their families from entering the U.S. The ban was issued to protest
an election campaign "marred by political violence and intimidation,"
U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The EU has imposed a visa ban and asset freeze on 20 Zimbabwean
officials and withdrawn its election observer mission, saying its members
would not be able to do their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Ruling party official Didymus Mutasa shrugged off the U.S. move. "We
are not surprised at [these] sanctions. The aim is to put us under
pressure and to give an advantage to the opposition," he said. "But the
sanctions will not work, and they will not soften our resolve to defend
Zimbabwe's national sovereignty."</TE>
<TE>   Elliot Manyika, a government minister, said that if Mugabe was
reelected, the administration would move to expropriate businesses not
owned by blacks. He said companies run by non-blacks were hoarding
essential commodities.</TE>

party officials said. But he has thus far rejected support from the
Fretilin party, the political arm of the guerrilla movement that fought
Indonesian rule and which holds 55 of the 88 seats in the constituent

<HD>Rebel Leader's Death Revives Angola's Peace Hopes</HD>
<DH>Africa: Jonas Savimbi's demise could weaken the guerrillas fighting
the government. But some analysts fear the group may split into factions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>The death of Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, who helped drag
out one of Africa's longest-running civil wars, has rekindled hopes for
peace in a country ravaged by decades of conflict, analysts said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   But they warned against celebrating until there are concrete
assurances that Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, known by the Portuguese acronym UNITA, is ready to lay down its
arms. Hopes for lasting stability in the southwestern African nation have
been repeatedly raised and dashed.</LD>
<LD>   The Angolan government said Friday that Savimbi had died in a clash
with army troops in the country's southeastern province of Moxico. On
Saturday, Portuguese state television showed pictures of what it said was
the corpse of the 67-year-old rebel, and its correspondent reported that
Savimbi had been hit by 15 bullets.</LD>
<TE>   A few hours later, UNITA spokesman Rui Oliveira confirmed that the
body was Savimbi's.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign news agencies in the Angolan capital, Luanda, reported that
news of Savimbi's death was greeted with jubilant celebrations there.</TE>
<TE>Nation May Be In for Radical Transformation</TE>
<TE>   The demise of the veteran guerrilla leader, who was equally loved for
his intellect and charm and despised for his calculated brutality, could
herald a radical political, economic and social transformation in Angola.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any downsides [to Savimbi's death]," said John Stremlau,
head of the department of international relations at the University of
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. "I hesitate to say this . . . but it can
only be a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Angola has known little but conflict since it gained independence from
Portugal in 1975. That was when Savimbi, who saw himself as the champion
of the country's disenfranchised black majority, took up arms against
government troops affiliated with the Popular Movement for the Liberation
of Angola, or MPLA. That group was led by Agostinho Neto, who was
succeeded by a then little-known Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Savimbi's
longtime rival and Angola's current president.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, each of several shaky peace deals that brought a respite
from the fighting ultimately unraveled.</TE>
<TE>   At least 500,000 people have been killed in the conflict--some
estimates put the figure at 1 million--while about 4 million Angolans,
roughly one-third of the population, have been displaced. An estimated
100,000 people have had limbs amputated after land-mine injuries.
Angola's huge wealth from oil and diamond reserves has been of little
benefit to ordinary people. More than 75% live in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Several UNITA generals were also reported killed in Friday's battle.
But the whereabouts of Savimbi's two most senior aides, party Vice
President Antonio Dembo and Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba, were unknown
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said it was unlikely that UNITA would disband immediately,
but the death of its leader dealt a serious blow to the battle-hardened
guerrilla force.</TE>
<TE>   "UNITA was Savimbi, and it has definitely been deteriorating for quite
a while," said Judith Matloff, an American journalist and author of a
book on the Angolan conflict.</TE>
<TE>   However, regional political observers warned that UNITA's troops,
which were once estimated to number about 60,000, remain a force to be
reckoned with and could still wreak havoc in southern Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "Like Savimbi, UNITA has been declared dead a number of times as
well," said Jakkie Cilliers, executive director of the Institute for
Security Studies, a think tank based in Pretoria, South Africa. "Because
UNITA operates in the bush, the general tendency is to underestimate it.
These guys have been in the bush for a long time. They know nothing but
war."</TE>
<TE>   However, decades of conflict have made ordinary Angolans weary, and
few seem likely to show support for a rebel group still bent on fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "Undoubtedly the war is over," said a former U.S. official who knew
Savimbi. "UNITA was Savimbi, and Savimbi was UNITA. But the principles
for which Savimbi originally fought will live on for generations. The
struggle will continue in the political arena for years to come. There
may be some who choose to labor on in the bush, but they will find no
support."</TE>
<TE>   A simple lack of funds might force UNITA to give up fighting in the
absence of its leader.</TE>
<TE>   The group's income from diamond sales has reportedly declined
significantly, especially next to the government's from oil.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts estimate UNITA's profits from diamonds at about $300
million a year, compared with the regime's $3-billion annual intake from
offshore oil revenues.</TE>
<TE>   United Nations weapons sanctions against UNITA also have weakened its
position.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no friend of UNITA anywhere," said Stremlau, the
international relations specialist. "You cannot run a revolution, even
with a few blood diamonds, without friends, especially when you're up
against a government as rich as the government of Angola."</TE>
<TE>   It is not yet clear whether anyone from UNITA's ranks could replace
Savimbi, who had ruled the group ruthlessly since he founded it in 1966
to battle the Portuguese colonial administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Savimbi was a particularly brutal person, who over the years had
killed many of his lieutenants," said Cilliers, the Angola specialist.
"So there is no successor waiting in the wings."</TE>
<TE>Crisis of Leadership Possible Within UNITA</TE>
<TE>   Cilliers said Savimbi's death would probably create a crisis of
leadership within UNITA.</TE>
<TE>   "The leadership struggle is the important thing to watch for now," he
said. "The danger is UNITA could faction and split."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, contention could arise among various groups of UNITA
supporters loyal to different leaders. The MPLA could end up trying to
negotiate with splinter groups, as opposed to one united force.</TE>
<TE>   "But there is one mitigating factor," Cilliers said. "UNITA is at the
end of the day a single Ovimbundu force. It has a single ethnic base.
That may continue to provide coherence."</TE>
<TE>   The Ovimbundu people make up about 40% of Angola's population.</TE>
<TE>   Still, expectations that the war might now end have been bolstered by
the fact that the conflict had become so personalized between Savimbi and
Dos Santos. With Savimbi apparently no more, it will be up to the
president to try to cement a cessation of hostilities, some Africa
watchers said.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, defenses that Dos Santos has used in the past to justify
stalling the progress of democracy in Angola will be less credible with
Savimbi out of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also expressed hope that the death of Savimbi might help
usher in peace throughout southern Africa, where many countries
neighboring Angola have been directly or indirectly drawn into its war.</TE>
<TE>   Namibia was formally drawn in at the end of 1999, when it allowed Dos
Santos' army to launch attacks on UNITA from Namibian soil. Savimbi's
forces retaliated by slaying scores of Namibian civilians. And Zambia has
been forced to play host to thousands of Angolan refugees who have fled
their country, placing an added burden on Zambia's infrastructure and
sometimes incurring the wrath of the warring Angolan parties.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Angolan government troops and rebels have become
embroiled in internal conflicts in Congo and the adjacent Republic of
Congo.</TE>
<TE>   Savimbi's death could change the dynamics of many regional power
struggles for the better, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a time for peace," said Stremlau, the university professor.
"Let's see if we can turn this opportunity into a wider asset in the
southern African region."</TE>

<HD>Colorful Slovak Leader Sees Red Over Media Criticism</HD>
<DH>Europe: President Schuster's lack of respect for a free press is
harmful to the nation's fledgling democracy, his detractors say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BRATISLAVA, Slovakia
</DL>
<LD>Markiza Television made a big splash in December with a report that
Slovak President Rudolf Schuster was briefly kidnapped last summer during
a family vacation in Brazil by Indians demanding ransom.</LD>
<LD>   "We were held captive," Schuster told a reporter for the private
Slovak network. "We did not know why and for what. While this was
happening, the Indian who had invited us and the chief who had imprisoned
us started up a quarrel, and I thought they would even begin to fight
each other."</LD>
<LD>   His captors, armed with spears and bows and arrows, were demanding a
Mercedes-Benz and some cows, added the president, who before going to
Brazil had told reporters that he wanted to see big snakes and exotic
animals.</LD>
<TE>   Although Markiza Television played Schuster's statements as serious
news, leading Slovak newspaper Pravda reported that the incident was
simply "a spectacle for tourists." Schuster has said nothing since to
clarify his adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Although many politicians in Eastern Europe are, like Schuster, former
Communists, few have his flamboyant touch.</TE>
<TE>   Proving that a onetime apparatchik doesn't have to be colorless has
served Schuster well politically. But critics charge that beneath his
outgoing personality are old attitudes harmful to this fledgling
democracy--in particular, a lack of respect for a free press.</TE>
<TE>   Schuster's flair goes back at least to his days as mayor of the
eastern Slovak city of Kosice in the mid-1990s, where he organized dance
festivals in the streets and the collective baking of a record-size cake.
He also drew attention by decorating the outside of his house with
Christmas lights, common enough in the U.S. but unusual in Slovakia.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say Schuster showed his true colors last year when he
pressed criminal libel charges against Ales Kratky, a commentator for the
Novy Cas daily.</TE>
<TE>   Kratky had ridiculed Schuster's annual state of the nation speech as
self-centered. He called it a "state of the soul" address from "a
puffed-up egomaniac who last experienced real life during his early
childhood and who now smiles at thunderstorms under the illusion he is
being photographed."</TE>
<TE>   Schuster's effort to see Kratky imprisoned for up to two years under a
law forbidding vilification of the government or its leaders triggered a
parliamentary effort to repeal the Communist-era statute that fell a vote
short. But last month, the Constitutional Court suspended the law on the
grounds that it "could threaten freedom of expression."</TE>
<TE>   "Slovak politicians, whether in the government or in the opposition,
are not prepared for criticism," an unrepentant Kratky said in an
interview after the ruling. "They want to have more than standard
protection."</TE>
<TE>   One of the Slovak president's few powers is to nominate the prime
minister, a post that generally goes to the head of the party finishing
first in parliamentary elections. But the president has some freedom of
choice, and polls suggest that the current ruling coalition and the two
major opposition parties may all fall short of a majority in September
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Schuster's rise followed a very different path from his more famous
counterpart, Vaclav Havel, who leaped from being an anti-Communist
dissident playwright to the presidency of Czechoslovakia and then of the
Czech Republic. Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia
in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   A technical university graduate, Schuster built his career as a
Communist Party official at a huge steel mill in Kosice. He served as
Kosice's mayor from 1983 to 1986. After the 1989 collapse of communism in
Czechoslovakia, Havel appointed him ambassador to Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Schuster helped attract significant Canadian investment to
Czechoslovakia. But a 1991 law banned former Communist officials from
holding public office, and Havel was forced to recall him in 1992. After
the country's breakup, the law did not apply in Slovakia and Schuster
returned to the political arena.</TE>
<TE>   He was elected mayor of Kosice in 1994 and reelected in 1998. By that
time he was a popular figure on the national scene, partly because his
city's downtown core had undergone extensive restoration.</TE>
<TE>   After Schuster became president, however, it became widely known that
the city had borrowed heavily to finance the upgrade. Today, opinions
vary sharply over whether Schuster benefited the city--which faces debts
of $38 million--or only himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I assess the work of Mayor Schuster from 1994 to 1999 very
positively," said Zdenko Trebula, Kosice's current mayor. "If you came to
our city before 1994, you would have seen that it was in rather poor
condition, and he really improved it. The city gained a completely
different image."</TE>
<TE>   Trebula added that "the debt is manageable."</TE>
<TE>   Jan Suli, the head of Kosice's Old Town district, was far more
critical.</TE>
<TE>   "When he started to work in the city, everybody was jubilant that
finally something was moving forward," Suli said. "Then he left in 1999
for the presidency, Kosice woke up, and we had to pay for it. . . . I
think that Mr. Schuster did it consciously. He wanted to be president,
and he used it as an electoral campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Younger Slovaks are more likely than their elders to see Schuster as a
relic of communism.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need a new president, a fresh man who wouldn't have the
past that our current president has," said Gabriel Ganz, 31, a disco club
owner in Kosice.</TE>
<TE>   Schuster doesn't greatly dispute the idea that it's just about time
for former Communists to retire.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a young generation who are better prepared than I am, who
weren't involved in the old regime and will look ahead," he recently told
the Prague Post. "I think this time is very close."</TE>
<TE>   But Schuster still has plenty of fans. Robert Fico, a populist
politician and a candidate to be the next prime minister, praised
Schuster as "a very experienced man" who "knows the practical life."</TE>
<TE>   "He understands Slovakia," Fico said.</TE>

<HD>The Last Days of Bamian's Buddhas</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Villagers detail how the Taliban forced them to risk
their lives in destroying the ancient statues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAMIAN, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>It took decades to build the magnificent stone Buddhas of Bamian.
It took the Taliban nearly a month to obliterate them.</LD>
<LD>   The destruction required an extraordinary effort, so complex that
foreign explosives experts had to be brought in and local residents were
forced to dangle on ropes over a cliff face to chip out holes for
explosives. According to witnesses and participants, the Taliban
struggled with ropes and pulleys, rockets, iron rods, jackhammers,
artillery and tanks before a series of massive explosions finally toppled
the statues.</LD>
<LD>   "Every day these Talibs tried to destroy the Buddhas, and every day
the Buddhas remained standing no matter how hard the Taliban tried," said
Ahmad Hussein, 55, a Bamian native who said he watched the statues slowly
disintegrate over a 26-day period last February and March.</LD>
<TE>   The broad outlines of the destruction have been reported. But the
ethnic Hazara villagers who witnessed the siege or were pressed into
service have provided new details of how the Buddhas, which had survived
for more than 1,600 years, withstood repeated Taliban assaults before
succumbing.</TE>
<TE>   After point-blank artillery and tank fire gouged holes in the statues
but left them essentially intact, the Taliban planted a row of explosives
at the feet of the taller Buddha, the 175-foot statue known as Solsol,
which means "year after year." The 20 timed explosions merely blew off
part of the statue's feet, residents said, but they destroyed the
adobe-and-wood Fatha mosque at the base of the sandstone cliff from which
the Buddha was hewn.</TE>
<TE>   Realizing that more expertise was needed, the Taliban summoned two
Pakistani and two Arab explosives experts who residents say were provided
by Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. It was then that Hazaras, the
Shiite Muslim residents of the region who were killed and persecuted
under the Taliban's Sunni Muslim rule, were forced to suspend themselves
from the cliffs to carve out cavities for explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Ali Agha, a wiry man of 28, said he worked for a Taliban group that
called itself Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet.
Reaching a niche behind the Buddha's head by climbing steps cut into the
rock face, the Hazaras were lowered on ropes held by 12 men each.</TE>
<TE>   Dangling off the sheer cliff face, supported by thin ropes that frayed
as they wore against the sandstone, the Hazaras chipped away with tire
irons, chisels and sharpened steel rods, Agha said.</TE>
<TE>   "We got dizzy from the height, and they pulled us up and beat us with
their gun butts," Agha said. "If we didn't work fast enough, they threw
stones at us and called us Hazara bastards."</TE>
<TE>   The Hazaras had been kidnapped by Taliban forces that had burned and
ransacked their villages, the residents said. They had been digging
foxholes for the Taliban when they were dragooned into demolishing the
statues. "We worked all day, and they didn't even give us lunch," Agha
complained.</TE>
<TE>   Agha managed to gouge out a hole in the smaller Buddha's left shoulder
after eight hours, he said. A Pakistani explosives expert who was lowered
on an elaborate pulley system rigged with safety harnesses planted
explosives in the cavity.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban also forced the men to haul a jackhammer to the top of the
smaller Buddha to pound out holes for explosives, residents said.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, the witnesses said, a senior Taliban official was
ferried in by helicopter every few days to supervise the demolition and
demand that local Taliban leaders find more efficient ways to destroy the
Buddhas.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know his name, but he was a dog," said one Hazara elder, Said
Mohammed, 47, who lives in one of the caves in the Buddha cliffs.</TE>
<TE>   Other villagers said the official was the Taliban defense minister,
Mullah Obaidulla. They said he was one of several important Taliban
members who appeared from time to time to witness the destruction and
deliver progress reports to senior Taliban leaders in Kandahar and Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban began by attempting to obliterate traces of breasts on the
smaller, 120-foot Buddha known as Shahmama, or "king mother." The
original breasts had worn away but a slight bulge remained, residents
said.</TE>
<TE>   The destruction was ordered in February 2001 by Taliban leader Mullah
Mohammed Omar, who called the Buddhas "idolatrous," "false idols" and
"gods of the infidels," the latter a reference to the Hazaras. Under its
extreme interpretation of the Koran, the Taliban outlawed the depiction
of any living thing.</TE>
<TE>   Today, an inscription from the Koran, spray-painted by Taliban members
beside the larger Buddha's alcove, reads: "The just replaces the unjust."</TE>
<TE>   The statues, built between the 3rd and 5th centuries, represented a
classic fusion of Buddhist and Grecian art. They were erected before the
Hazaras converted in the 9th century from Buddhism to Shiite Islam.
Located along the Silk Road, on which camel caravans plodded between
China and Rome, the Buddhas survived attacks by Genghis Khan and others.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban was so thorough that it destroyed smaller statues and
frescoes in the niches behind the Buddhas. Several residents said the
Taliban removed some frescoes and small statues before the demolition
began and trucked them to Pakistan to sell. Karim Khalili, the Hazara
warlord in Bamian province, along with Western aid officials here, said
they had heard such claims but could not verify them.</TE>
<TE>   Day after day, residents said, the valley was smothered in smoke and
dust, first from artillery and tank fire, then from the explosives. They
said the blasts toppled the walls of adobe homes on the dirt track below
the cliffs and shattered windows in a bazaar a mile away.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't happen all at once," said Hussein, the Bamian native. "It
was little by little, day by day. They tried 50 artillery rounds, 100
tank rounds, and they only made small holes. Then there were explosions,
so many every day."</TE>
<TE>   After failing to topple the larger Buddha by attacking the legs, the
Taliban began taking the statue down from the top. Residents said the
explosions took off the head and shoulders, but metal support rods set
into the torso in the 1930s slowed the demolition.</TE>
<TE>   For the final, massive explosions, the Taliban forced Hazaras from
their homes in the valley. Those who resisted were imprisoned or killed,
residents said. Many fled to a plateau across the valley, near what is
now a U.S. Special Forces compound.</TE>
<TE>   They watched the Buddha's torso crumple, and then his flowing robes
and finally his sturdy legs and feet.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, they said, the Taliban members celebrated and taunted the
Hazaras. "They told us: 'We have killed your gods,' " said Mohammed, the
Hazara elder.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban regime was not the first to deface the site. Muslims of
the first millennium, seeking to kill the souls of idols, gouged out the
faces of small Buddhas painted inside the niches.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban photographed and videotaped the destruction of the
statues. It distributed a celebratory calendar showing tank and rocket
fire exploding into the Buddhas. The calendar, which boasts that 137,500
pounds of explosives were used, is titled: "The greatest historical sight
the destruction of the statues of Bamian."</TE>
<TE>   Today, shrapnel and spent rocket casings are scattered amid the dusty
debris below the alcoves.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible to climb the narrow stone steps to the niches carved
above the smaller Buddha's head. Sections of frescoes somehow survived,
with traces of pastel blue, sienna and yellow ochre. The view is
breathtaking: crimson and gold cliffs across the valley and the majestic
gray Hindu Kush mountains beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Within the alcove of the larger Buddha, steel rods still protrude from
the cliff face. Huge chunks of the statue lay at the base of the cliff.
They were covered with fiberglass protective sheeting in December by a
team of archeologists sponsored by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. agency has convened a panel of experts to consider an Afghan
government request to rebuild or replace the Buddhas. Among the
possibilities are replicating the statutes on the same site or building
similar Buddhas nearby, said Peter Maxwell, a U.N. official in Bamian.</TE>
<TE>   The Hazaras say they did not worship the Buddhas, or consider them
gods. But they were priceless symbols of the Hazara people, who regret
that they could not save the statues.</TE>
<TE>   "We loved our Buddhas very much," Hussein said.</TE>
<TE>   Khalili, the warlord who led Hazara fighters back into Bamian last
fall, cannot avoid seeing the yawning Buddha alcoves from the front gate
of his military headquarters in the valley a mile away. It is a painful
thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it hurts," Khalili said. "These statues were a great source
of pride for the Hazara people."</TE>
<TE>   As the warlord spoke, his voice softened and he lowered his eyes at
the mention of the great Buddhas. Behind him, the sun rose and cast sharp
shadows across the empty alcoves, timeless and eternal.</TE>

<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Pakistan has warned U.S. and other foreign diplomatic missions and
businesses to boost their security, fearing that the slaying of Wall
Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl may signal a wider plan to thwart
President Pervez Musharraf's drive against extremism.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistani officials vowed to redouble efforts to arrest key suspects
still at large. Those efforts include "maximum cooperation" with the FBI,
which has been allowed to interview suspects already in custody, a
Foreign Ministry official said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "We cannot rule out attacks on U.S. interests in Pakistan after what
has happened with Mr. Pearl. The way the kidnappers executed him shows
they have made up their mind that they do not care about their own
future," an Interior Ministry official said.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators have begun searching for an Arab national believed to be
involved in the Pearl case and said they were reassessing whether the
reporter's kidnapping and killing were linked to Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, we had totally discounted the Al Qaeda factor in
the case," said a Pakistani source involved in the investigation. "But
now we are certainly chasing leads that may take us to Al Qaeda's doors."</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, 38, the Journal's South Asia bureau chief, disappeared Jan. 23
in Karachi while researching a story about Islamic radicals in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl had been cut in the chest and was probably already dead when
Islamic extremists sliced his throat in front of a camera, according to
an analysis of the videotape by U.S. law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   The 3 1/2-minute digital videotape delivered to authorities in Karachi
included several different scenes that had been spliced together,
according to the analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a Pakistani official said that the day before the videotape
was received, three top Pakistani police officers received calls on
Pearl's mobile phone warning them to stop pursuing suspects in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "They told the investigators how many children each one of them has,
when they go to school, which mode of transport they use for going to
school and returning back home and where their families go shopping," the
official said.</TE>

<LD>An escaped Texas murderer was arrested at a Raleigh motel almost a

<LD>   John William Roland III, 33, was arrested after police negotiated with
him at the motel for an hour, police Lt. Tom Earnhardt said.</LD>
<LD>   During the negotiations, Roland made threats on himself and toward
police, but he eventually gave up peacefully, Earnhardt said.</LD>
<TE>   Roland was tracked to the Red Roof Inn through a stolen credit card,
said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Todd.</TE>

<HD>Outrage Over Bodies Bridges Racial Divide</HD>
<DH>Georgia: The gruesome discovery at Tri-State Crematory has angered
whites and blacks alike in rural Walker County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO</AU>
<AU>EDITH STANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIME STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NOBLE, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>The schools may be desegregated and the 24-hour Wal-Mart open to
all, but when it comes to the great equalizer--death--the races here go
their separate ways. White bodies to white-run funeral homes, black
bodies to theirs.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a cultural difference," said Ron Cain, an undertaker's assistant
at a funeral home that caters to whites. "There's a difference in the way
we worship and the way we sing. So I guess it carries over into the
funeral business."</LD>
<LD>   But since the first hint of trouble at the Marsh place this month, the
blacks and whites of rural Walker County, Ga., have shared a common
outrage. Nobody can believe that a member of the family--prominent local
blacks embraced by the white establishment--allegedly desecrated hundreds
of human remains by piling them in pits and vaults like bags of trash.</LD>
<TE>   The gruesome find at the Marshes' Tri-State Crematory, where
authorities say they've recovered more than 300 bodies sent there for
incineration, is an affront that goes deeper than Dixie, deeper than the
legacy of segregation that lingers in this county of 61,000, where the
races hew to separate churches and undertakers.</TE>
<TE>   It violates one of the South's most cherished traditions: respect,
even reverence, for the dead.</TE>
<TE>   "We're brought up and raised to take care of our dead," Sheriff Steve
Wilson said. "We treat them with all the respect and dignity that they
pass along to us while we're living. And to see something like this, just
a disregard for that upbringing that we've all been accustomed to, is why
people are so outraged."</TE>
<TE>   The anger is greater than anything Wilson has seen in 35 years of law
enforcement. And it was so palpable last week that one judge issued a gag
order to try to dampen media coverage while another delayed a decision to
release on bond Tommy Ray-Brent Marsh, Tri-State's operator. Marsh, 28,
who has been charged with 16 counts and counting of felony theft, was the
target of a death threat two hours before his Friday arraignment.</TE>
<TE>   There is lots of threatening talk in places like the Huddle House
coffee shop, a gossip mill where most of the customers are white and
almost every table is a smoking table. "If he [Marsh] don't leave town,
something's going to happen," waitress Linda Brown warned.</TE>
<TE>   The bitterness is shared by relatives of the black victims.</TE>
<TE>   "It was blacks too," said La Tonia Harris, 40. The body of her
boyfriend's brother was sent to Tri-State. "This is highly upsetting,
what he done to those people."</TE>
<TE>   In Walker County, about 85 miles northwest of Atlanta, there is plenty
of allegiance to the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Just south of the Chickamauga National Battlefield, a sprawling
memorial to Civil War casualties, the rolling hills are punctuated with
car shops, metal buildings, hangdog houses and cemeteries sporting large
headstones and plentiful bouquets.</TE>
<TE>   There is no movie theater within 25 miles. But there are four funeral
homes, one with a marquee off U.S. 27, the main drag. Its message last
week: Homer Wilson, 2 p.m. Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Whites stay close to home. Blacks send their deceased to funeral
directors in Chattanooga, Tenn., or Dalton, Ga., a half-hour away.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the funeral homes--black and white--have used one
crematorium: Tri-State.</TE>
<TE>   Cremation isn't popular in this notch on the Bible Belt. The
Wallis-Wilbanks Funeral Home, which hasn't handled a black body in at
least 40 years, has had requests for only 42 cremations out of the 800
services it has performed since 1996, owners say.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it's just not the Christian thing to do. I've heard that
remark," said Barbara S. Wilbanks, at the mortuary in downtown La
Fayette, the county seat.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't bother the Marsh family much. When Ray Marsh, now 75,
built the 988-square-foot crematory in 1982 for $90,000, it was an
outgrowth of his work digging graves and selling underground vaults for
coffins. His wife, Clara, 69, became the crematory's chief financial
officer, state documents show. Despite the South's slow acceptance of
cremation, they built the business while earning a good name in a county
where blacks are only 4% of the population.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole family is very respected," said state Rep. Mike Snow
(D-Chickamauga). "They lived with a vast majority of white people, and
they got the respect of . . . folks who didn't feel a lot of comfort with
blacks."</TE>
<TE>   A teacher for 37 years, Clara Marsh left her mark on generations of
Walker County students while attaining various posts and honors. She has
been county Democratic Party chairwoman and coordinator of the sheriff's
anti-drug program. She is active with the Georgia Assn. of Educators and
was Walker County's 1995 citizen of the year.</TE>
<TE>   County Commissioner Bebe Heiskell, who has served on committees with
Marsh, said she is "very, very outspoken as a Christian and offers
prayers for people." Others say she has a humorless, strict manner.</TE>
<TE>   "Some students did really get angry with her," said Sharon Shropshire,
51, who was in Marsh's high school home room and now clerks at Pit Stop
Food Store. Yet Willie Womble, a 59-year-old Baptist minister, credited
his former teacher's lectures on personal responsibility for keeping him
on the straight and narrow. "If it hadn't been for her, I might have
dropped out," Womble said.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Marsh, who friends say exuded a sincerity and gentleness, ran for
county coroner in 1992, losing by 584 out of 7,700 votes cast. "This
fellow right here is probably the only African American in my county that
ever came close to winning an election," said Snow, adding that Marsh was
among the few blacks who ate regularly at the Huddle House.</TE>
<TE>   As it happened, Marsh turned to Snow in 1992 for political help. Marsh
wanted relief from new state standards requiring him to get a funeral
director's license to run his crematory. Snow responded with a
last-minute amendment giving Marsh an 18-month reprieve.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Tri-State faced scrutiny again. This time, Walker County
Coroner Bill McGill, Marsh's election opponent, complained to the Georgia
State Board of Funeral Service that Tri-State was cremating bodies
without a license.</TE>
<TE>   Records show Marsh fended off the board's intervention by pointing out
that its own regulations defined a crematory as a business open to the
public. Since Tri-State was a subcontractor to funeral operators, Marsh
argued, it fell outside the board's purview. The state dropped the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   That loophole, which lawmakers are now scrambling to close, allowed
Tri-State to continue operating without oversight even as the Marshes
handed the business over to their son, one of their five children.</TE>
<TE>   A star athlete and happy-go-lucky student, Tommy Ray-Brent Marsh was
the kind of guy everybody liked, said Veronica Lively. "He was always
goofing off," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still he had a serious side. In his senior year of high school, he was
captain of the football and track teams, earned an academic letter and an
award for his German language skills, and had perfect attendance. He went
to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, where he played linebacker
for two years. He studied business from 1991 to 1996, records show, but
never earned a degree, although he returned for a semester in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Ray-Brent Marsh rose in Walker County civic affairs as well. He
took his ailing father's spot on the county's Department of Family and
Children's Service board. He was appointed to the county Board of
Equalization. About a month ago, he and his wife had a baby girl.</TE>
<TE>   "He's well mannered, well educated, very well dressed and very
articulate," said Mike Worthington, who rents the roadside Smokey's BBQ
on U.S. 27 from the Marshes.</TE>
<TE>   He also impressed his customers on his rounds, delivering ashes.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought them to me and put them right here on the table. A little
black box," said Wilbanks, pointing to her desk. "He was just one of the
nicest people."</TE>
<TE>   The family's position in the community perhaps has made the pain all
the more deep.</TE>
<TE>   "We're devastated, in total shock," said Lively, whose grandmother was
found at the crematorium, still in her green funeral dress. "We're
devastated that a human being could do this to another human being's body
. . . . "It's not a God-fearing human that did this. It had to be a
monster."</TE>
<TE>   Said Patricia Shropshire, 49, who now wonders if the ashes she spread
on the St. John's River in Florida were really her father's: "People are

<HD>Moral Compass Guides New Law School</HD>
<DH>Education: Graduates will be expected to make a difference. Critics
wonder whether they'll be too nice to succeed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS
</DL>
<LD>They have just founded a law school, but the deans and professors
at the University of St. Thomas insist that the last thing this country
needs is more lawyers.</LD>
<LD>   Or rather, the last thing this country needs is more sleazy,
win-at-all-costs lawyers. More tough-talking,
grind-out-200-billable-hours-a-week lawyers. More lawyers who work, as
Associate Dean Patrick Schiltz put it, "toward no end other than getting
rich and determining whether one huge insurance company will have to
write out a check to another huge insurance company."</LD>
<LD>   The University of St. Thomas School of Law is aiming to produce a
different kind of lawyer. A lawyer who will make not just money but a
difference.</LD>
<TE>   "It's about what kind of society we want. . . . We can choose whether
we want to live in a slime pit," said the Rev. D. Reginald Witt, one of
the first law professors hired by the school.</TE>
<TE>   Added Schiltz: "There will always be a segment of people buying legal
services who will want the meanest [attorney] they can find. If our
students are attractive to them, we will have failed."</TE>
<TE>   All law schools teach ethics. But St. Thomas is one of the few to
claim moral instruction as its very reason for being.</TE>
<TE>   That position has drawn fire from some critics as arrogant,
impractical or redundant. Skeptics worry that a relentless focus on
morality may produce lawyers who are too nice for the no-holds-barred
advocacy our legal system requires. Others resent the implication that
law schools mostly turn out the self-absorbed and underhanded.</TE>
<TE>   St. Thomas' mission, they point out, is hardly unique: Most of the two
dozen other law schools affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church claim a
similar focus on personal ethics and social justice, although without all
the posturing. So do some secular schools and some affiliated with other
religions.</TE>
<TE>   "I resist the notion that it's a novel idea," said Ed Butterfoss, dean
of Hamline University in Minneapolis, which has a tradition of turning
out advocates for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   But St. Thomas administrators insist their program will stand out
because of its curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   It is one of the few law schools in the nation to mandate community
service--at least 50 hours by graduation. The school also is committed to
creating public service jobs for several graduates each year in areas
such as helping indigent immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Another signature program requires students to meet with practicing
attorneys several times each semester. These mentors send the students to
watch real legal battles--a trial, a mediation, a deposition--and then
engage them in discussions about ethics in the fray.</TE>
<TE>   Other schools sponsor optional seminars on moral issues in addition to
their mandatory classes on ethics. At St. Thomas, professors boast that
such discussions will be integrated into every class, so every student
will get a full dose. Polls show that less than 20% of Americans think
lawyers have high ethical standards. St. Thomas aims to overcome that
distaste.</TE>
<TE>   The school is run by the University of St. Thomas, one of the oldest
and largest private colleges in Minnesota. St. Thomas had a law program
in the 1920s but shut it down during the Great Depression. Ever since,
the administration has been eager to try again. In the late 1990s, it
began fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the law school has raised more than $75 million, including a
major donation from Richard Schulze, the founder of Best Buy Corp. Its
endowment is already triple the median for U.S. law schools--plus it has
$32 million on hand to construct a campus. It just hired as its dean
Thomas Mengler, who helped make the University of Illinois law school one
of the top 25 in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The 115 students who enrolled in September range from recent college
graduates to 45-year-olds launching third careers. Most are Catholic.
About half are on full scholarships, with annual tuition set at $21,200.</TE>
<TE>   All know what St. Thomas expects from them: "They want us to go out
and make the community better," said Nicole Zwieg, 22.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people who have run-ins with lawyers have miserable experiences.
I want them to leave a consultation feeling good," added 30-year-old
Saran Jenkins, who quit a teaching job to try law.</TE>
<TE>   Now in their second semester, the students are working through a
curriculum that uses the same backbreaking case books as other law
schools--but throws in as supplements excerpts from a Hindu spiritual
text or a speech by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is not to dictate that every Catholic lawyer must work to
abolish the death penalty or end abortion. Rather, the goal is to have
students think about the law through the prism of their consciences.
Professors hope the exercise will inspire students to use their legal
skills as a tool for social change, to try to close the gap between what
is legal and what is just.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, a recent class on contracts veered from an appellate court
decision into a spirited discussion of what's "fair"--and how society has
wrestled with equity. A case study on how a divorcing couple should
divide their property prompted the professor to quote a papal encyclical
on the value of a mother's unpaid "toil."</TE>
<TE>   And in a lesson on building relationships with clients, assistant
professor Celia Rumann challenged the students to respond to knotty
scenarios: A client who wanted a will drawn up because she was planning
to commit suicide. Another who refused to disclose that he had dumped
potential toxins on a parcel he was putting up for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "The law may not impose a particular obligation on you, but as lawyers
you have an opportunity to go above and beyond what is required" by
standards of professional conduct, Rumann said. "You have to decide what
to do in your own moral and ethical framework."</TE>
<TE>   Legal ethicists agree that challenging students to think about such
issues is critical. But some express doubts about St. Thomas' approach.</TE>
<TE>   New York attorney Louis Craco, a leader in the field of legal ethics,
sees a danger in programs that put such an emphasis on personal morality.
Attorneys must remember, he said, that they have an ethical obligation to
represent their client, not some abstract notion of justice. Hard-nosed
advocacy is not inherently debasing, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "The American legal system operates on the assumption that there will
be able advocates who can take the positions of a client and advance them
with energy," Craco said. "I'm concerned about any tendency to sell that
virtue short."</TE>
<TE>   He worries too that students urged to see the law as a tool of their
conscience might be "fooled into thinking there are [simple] answers to
all these really complex questions."</TE>
<TE>   Take a case of industrial pollution. The "right thing to do" in a
moral sense might be to push for a complete cleanup. But environmental
law recognizes a balance between the cost and the benefit of such
work--and it's the attorney's job to strike the balance in his client's
interest.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics also wonder how much St. Thomas will be able to mold
students' values in three years of pressure-cooker law classes.</TE>
<TE>   "We can educate students about the ethical rules of the profession, we
can encourage them to give their clients moral counseling, we can urge
them to do pro bono work--I do all of those things. But I'm not
confident, frankly, about how much impact I'm having," said Monroe
Freedman, who teaches legal ethics at Hofstra University in Hempstead,
N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Schiltz is confident St. Thomas can overcome those hurdles. But he
admits to doubts of his own. He fears the school may not keep its focus
as it gets bigger and faces more pressure from students and staff to
break into the ranks of top law schools.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an experiment," Schiltz said. "I have no idea if it's going
to work."</TE>

<HD>GOP Split Over Uncoupling of Jobless Aid</HD>
<DH>Economy: Benefits will soon run out for those laid off after Sept.
11, adding pressure to drop the link to tax cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As Congress returns from a weeklong recess Monday, Republicans face
renewed pressure to resolve a politically sensitive issue that has
divided their ranks: legislation to extend unemployment benefits for
millions of people who use up their regular benefits.</LD>
<LD>   The long-stalled bill has taken on new urgency because, in the coming
weeks, people who lost their jobs because of the economic effect of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and
remain unemployed will begin to exhaust their 26 weeks of benefits.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans and the Bush administration for months have advocated
passing a benefit extension--but only as part of an economic stimulus
package that includes tax cuts that Democrats oppose.</LD>
<TE>   Now, with the broader stimulus measure stalemated, Republicans are
contemplating whether to strip out the contentious tax cuts and simply
pass a 13-week extension of unemployment benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Such a move enjoys broad bipartisan support--similar extensions have
been routinely approved during past recessions--and many Republicans fear
that thwarting the measure could hurt their party politically.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republicans, including Minority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi, joined with Democrats earlier this month in approving the
benefit extension. That action blindsided House Republicans, who that
very day were passing another bill linking the unemployment benefits to
tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the difference between a House Republican who wants to fight
for Americans and a Senate Republican who doesn't," snapped House
Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) after learning of Lott's alliance
with the Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is just one example of contention among congressional
Republicans over a range of issues, even as President Bush enjoys
sky-high public approval ratings and the party as a whole seems well
positioned for November's congressional elections.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, congressional Republicans have split over campaign
finance reform legislation, with a renegade group of lawmakers working
with Democrats to put the bill on the cusp of clearing Congress. The
campaign finance issue also has created tensions between the White House
and House GOP leaders, who were frustrated by Bush's refusal to help them
block the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Coming fiscal debates also may roil the GOP, with conservatives
insisting the party back a resolution to eliminate the deficit, while
other Republicans question the wisdom of trying to balance the federal
budget at a time of war and recession.</TE>
<TE>   The question of how to handle legislation to help the unemployed is as
much about tactics as it is about substance. But the stakes are high
because many lawmakers believe that their reelection prospects this fall
will hinge on the economy and how they manage it.</TE>
<TE>   A key factor in how Congress responds in the coming weeks will be what
kind of feedback they get from constituents. Some jobless people who have
run out of benefits are clamoring for action.</TE>
<TE>   "I get frustrated when politicians play with the people who need this
by attaching their own agenda, when they should be addressing the
immediate needs of the unemployed," said Jack Sunkes of Sylmar, who lost
his job in publishing last year and has exhausted his regular
unemployment benefits. "I believe if some measure isn't taken soon to
help the unemployed, the voters will be looking for other candidates that
will listen."</TE>
<TE>   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research
group, estimates that 2 million unemployed workers will exhaust their
benefits in the first half of this year alone--an average of 80,000 a
week. The center's data show that, in California, about 153,000 exhausted
their regular benefits from Sept. 11 to Dec. 31. The center estimates
that an additional 303,000 Californians will run out of benefits before
July.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have argued that the answer is not just providing more aid
to people out of work but for Congress to pass tax cuts and other
measures that would spur business to create jobs. "People don't want a
welfare check; they want their job back," said House Speaker J. Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.).</TE>
<TE>   But efforts to pass the broader stimulus bill backed by Bush collapsed
in the Senate early this month. At that point, Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.), with the support of Lott and other Republicans, whisked
through the Senate a bill that would do nothing but allow 13 more weeks
of unemployment benefits for anyone whose benefits ran out after Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   GOP strategists initially indicated that the House would pass that
bill and send it to Bush. But House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield) derailed that strategy. He pushed for
the House to pass the broader economic stimulus bill--for the third time
since October, but with no greater hope that the Senate would go along.</TE>
<TE>   Even within the House, GOP leaders were divided on the wisdom of that
course. Hastert supported Thomas' desire to again pass a broader bill.
But other GOP leaders argued for passing the aid to the unemployed and
postponing further debate about tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas), who said
Republicans already had made the political point repeatedly that Daschle
was to blame for stalling anti-recession tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt it was in our best interest to just pass unemployment
benefits," a House GOP leadership aide said. "The point has been made, so
why give Daschle . . . another opportunity to claim the high ground?"</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said last week that the
administration still believed it would be "useful for the Congress to
enact an economic stimulus bill." But he signaled that the White House
was willing to accept a narrower measure: expanding unemployment
benefits, plus a measure to speed up business write-offs of equipment and
other capital investments, a tax break that enjoys broad bipartisan
support.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Republican Senate aide said the political pressure inevitably
will lead to an extension of unemployment benefits in the coming weeks,
even if it has to be as part of some other legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The benefits extension "will pass," Lott spokesman Ron Bonjean said.
"It will go through."</TE>

<HD>Familiar Faces on NYC Payroll</HD>
<DH>Politics: Several aides and relatives of Rudolph Giuliani have kept
their jobs under new Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Several relatives and friends of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
have held on to well-paying City Hall jobs despite a change in
administration and deep budget cuts.</LD>
<LD>   The former Giuliani aides generally have stayed on the city's payroll
without attracting much public attention. This week Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg appointed Giuliani cousin Raymond Casey as president of
Off-Track Betting Corp., which operates city betting parlors.</LD>
<LD>   During Giuliani's tenure, Casey was appointed to several city posts,
including chairman and executive director of the Trade Waste Commission,
executive director of the Gambling Control Commission and inspector
general of the Department of Sanitation.</LD>
<TE>   Casey, who had said he did not want to rely on his Giuliani connection
to get a job, earned $162,800 at the Trade Waste Commission. His salary
at OTB has not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Casey declined to comment, but the mayor said Casey's Giuliani ties
had nothing to do with the hiring. The Casey family, related to Giuliani
by marriage, has two other members on the Bloomberg payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Casey's brother, Jeffrey, works in the Office of the Mayor, where he
earns $79,560. During Giuliani's tenure, he worked in the Department of
Buildings.</TE>
<TE>   And Raymond L. Casey, the Casey brothers' father, makes $98,000 a year
as an executive in the city's labor relations office. He was appointed to
that post by Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   They have stayed on the payroll despite the city's $4.8-billion budget
deficit and orders from Bloomberg to cut staff at the Office of the Mayor
and other agencies by 20%. Last week, the mayor's office cut 127 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The other Caseys did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for Bloomberg and Giuliani did not return calls seeking
comment, but last year Giuliani defended his appointments.</TE>
<TE>   "My administration has probably done more to straighten out the
management of this city than any administration in 40 to 50 years--and
that is because I select people that are very well qualified," Giuliani
said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say there is not necessarily political pressure being placed
on the new administration to keep Giuliani relatives on the payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a long time for a political transition to take place," said
Columbia University political science professor Steven Cohen. "You may
get a job because of your connections. But keeping a job, especially when
your patron is gone, is more difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Not all of Giuliani's kin and friends kept their government jobs.
Catherine Giuliani, another cousin of the former mayor, resigned as chief
of staff at the city's Economic Development Corp.</TE>

<DL>PLAINVIEW, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>One man died and at least 10 people were injured after rival
motorcycle gangs armed with daggers, baseball bats and a machine gun
clashed at an indoor motorcycle and tattoo expo called the Hellraiser
Ball, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   About 60 people were in custody Saturday night, and the number could
grow, said Nassau County Chief of Detectives Herbert Faust.</LD>
<LD>   Faust said four people were shot, one fatally, when the fight erupted
about 4:15 p.m. at the Vanderbilt, a concert and catering hall.</LD>
<TE>   Faust said the fight broke out between members of the Hells Angels
motorcycle club, whose Long Island chapter sponsored the event, and the
Pagans.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 100 Pagans showed up at the event, which drew about 1,000
people, many of them Hells Angels, Faust said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a long-standing feud between the two motorcycle gangs,"
he said. "At some point, there was a major conflict. We have gunshots, we
have people stabbed, a major fight."</TE>
<TE>   Several people who fled were apprehended nearby, Nassau County Police
Commissioner William Willett said.</TE>
<TE>   Police also recovered daggers, baseball bats and an Uzi machine gun,
Faust said.</TE>
<TE>   The expo had been under surveillance by police but was not expected to
be violent, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One man died in surgery and two others were being treated for
unspecified injuries at North Shore University Hospital in Plainview,
hospital spokeswoman Betty Olt said.</TE>
<TE>   Police were still looking for suspects.</TE>

<HD>Ga. Powder Test Result: No Anthrax</HD>
<DH>Scare: The bag found at an Army building is cleared. The substance
is still unknown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>White powder in a bag found at the U.S. Army Reserve Command
headquarters building at Ft. McPherson was not anthrax, an Army spokesman
said.</LD>
<LD>   Field tests shortly after the bag was found Friday afternoon had
indicated anthrax, but more conclusive tests Saturday proved anthrax was
not present, Col. Guy Shields said at a news conference.</LD>
<LD>   Shields said the CDC wasn't able to detect what the substance was
because the sample was too small.</LD>
<TE>   Initial field tests "have a lot of false positives," CDC spokesman
Lisa Swenarski said.</TE>
<TE>   The five civilian employees who found the package and two firefighters
who responded were showered down because of possible contamination, and
the building was locked down with about 200 people inside for about five
hours Friday. None of the people involved was given medication for
anthrax, Col. Guy Shields said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't immediately clear where the package was found. Shields would
only say that the civilians who found it about 4 p.m. were not mail room
employees.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 people work in the building. Joe Handley, a spokesman for
the Army Reserve Command, said most of the military personnel have been
inoculated with the anthrax vaccine, but not the civilians.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents were investigating.</TE>
<TE>   The Reserve Command oversees all Army Reserve units in the contiguous
United States except for psychological operations and civil affairs
units. As part of normal security for the building, everyone has an
identification badge and anyone who does not work there must be escorted,
Shields said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a secure building," he said. "We're taking a look at that."</TE>
<TE>   Five people died after anthrax-laced letters were mailed to
journalists, politicians and government offices in Florida, New York and
Washington last fall. Since then, the military has tightened its mail
screening procedures nationwide. The last victim was a Connecticut
retiree who died Nov. 21.</TE>

<HD>Provo Isn't Friendly by Accident, Gosh Darn It</HD>
<DH>Utah: The cheerful residents of this mainly Mormon city take jokes
about its squeaky-clean image in stride.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PROVO, Utah
</DL>
<LD>Maybe it's time to quit poking fun at Provo.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, everyone's friendly here. Really, really friendly. Even the
folks in Salt Lake City call Provo "Happy Valley." But why hold it
against Provo that people say "aw heck"? What's wrong with raising your
kids in a place that's as squeaky clean as a Disney production?</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, we've heard all the jokes, and actually they're pretty funny,"
says Mary Gordon, who manages a women's clothing shop. "We ask for it
because we are peculiar. We even poke fun at ourselves. It's good to be
different."</LD>
<TE>   Provo, an Olympic venue for preliminary rounds in men's and women's
hockey, is 90% Mormon. It doesn't stray far from the teachings of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' founder, Joseph Smith, who
believed that in every person is the capacity to be like God. People here
don't scowl, curse or smoke. They ooze good neighborliness. It's all in
the Book of Mormon, which visitors will find in the bedside table of
their hotel rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Provo, settled in 1849 by Mormon farmers, is arguably the most
conservative city in the most Republican county in the nation's most
Republican state. In all of Utah County, not a single Democrat holds
elected office. And in all the United States, only one city, Fargo, N.D.,
is safer than Provo in terms of violent crime, according to last year's
FBI statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "These are good people, people with an inner compass that drives them
to do the right thing," Mayor Lewis Billings said. "It's not because
we've got a cop out there watching them; it's because they want to do
what's right."</TE>
<TE>   Last year Billings was instrumental in getting the minor league
baseball team in Helena, Mont., to relocate to Provo. Luckily, its major
league affiliation changed in the transfer, and the Brewers became the
Angels. The club came with the understanding it could not play home games
on Sundays or sell beer at Miller Field--restrictions that would be
financially difficult for a professional team in virtually any other
city.</TE>
<TE>   The dominant influence over Utah's third-largest city (population
110,000) is Brigham Young University, whose 30,000 students are included
in the census and help make Provo the nation's youngest city with a
population of 100,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   Its clean-cut enrollment comes from 50 states and 110 countries and
includes a small percentage of non-Mormons.</TE>
<TE>   Most undergraduates have spent up to two years on a Mormon mission.
More than 43% of the American students have lived abroad and 70% are
fluent in a second language. The university suspended classes for the
duration of the Olympics so 500 students could volunteer as interpreters
for the Games in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   To many Gentiles--as Mormons refer to all non-Mormons, including
Jews--BYU seems unreal because of the three-paragraph honor code students
sign when applying: to abstain from smoking, drugs, drinking and
premarital sex; to lead chaste and virtuous lives; to use clean language;
and to uphold the doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, which owns BYU. In a recent poll, 74% of alumni said the code was
an important factor in their decision to attend BYU.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a difficult adjustment because most of us had made the
decision to lead that kind of life before we applied," said history major
Julie Harris, who spent 18 months as a missionary in Venezuela. "The code
reflects who we were in the first place. It's empowering, not
restricting."</TE>
<TE>   "Actually it's an easier challenge than most of us had adjusting to
high school, where we faced being the only one who didn't do this and
that," said Mike Smart, a 1997 BYU graduate. "The code made us free for
the first time in years to be ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Provo traces its roots to Brigham Young, who led the first Mormon
pioneers to the Salt Lake Valley. Young later sent settlers south to
Provo, now just a 40-minute drive from Salt Lake City, to seek new
farmland.</TE>
<TE>   Young wanted his people to be farmers, not miners. The miners'
lifestyle was raucous, unstable and disruptive to families. Provo was
laid out in quarter-mile grids, with a substantial farmer's home on each
corner and the land he worked outside the town boundary. Streets were
wide enough for a wagon hauled by eight oxen to make a U-turn. Everyone
was expected to be as industrious as the first settlers, who planted five
acres of potatoes the day they arrived in Salt Lake after a grueling
111-day journey from Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Provo's streets are still wide, with Freedom Avenue hardly more than a
stone's throw from the foothills of the snow-capped Wasatch Front. The
freshwater Lake Utah lies on the city's front doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   It is a stunning scene and may help answer a question raised by an
Olympic visitor from Brazil the other day: "What is it that makes these
people so cheerful and nice? They keep saying 'thank you' and 'good
morning' and using words like 'wonderful.' "</TE>

<LD>FERC access--A story in Saturday's Business section should have
said that officials of Enron Corp. and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission attended meetings that also included Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson and California Gov. Gray Davis twice in January 2001, not in
January 2000.</LD>

<LD>If the first month of 2002 is an indication, this will be a very good
year for Ventura County home sellers, but not for first-time buyers,
who increasingly are left behind in a housing price boom that shows
no sign of slowing.</LD>
<LD>   County home sales and prices increased more last month than in any
January since 1989, compared with the same month a year before. Sales
were up 29%, and prices were $26,000 higher, according to DataQuick
Information Systems.</LD>
<LD>   "The year certainly started with a bang," said analyst John
Karevoll of DataQuick, which tracks completed sales statewide. "In
Ventura County, the housing market is strong, but not alarmingly so.
We've not crossed the threshold where things get frenzied like they
did in the Bay Area."</LD>
<TE>   Ventura County owners sold 1,115 houses and condominiums last
month, up from 867 for January 2001 and nearly three times more than
in the same month a decade ago, when the county was entering an
eight-year slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   The county's median home price--the point at which half the homes
sell for more and half for less--reached $284,000 in January compared
with $258,000 a year before.</TE>
<TE>   Both the sales and price numbers are down sharply from December,
which is traditionally a much stronger month than January, Karevoll
said.</TE>
<TE>   Prices historically drop in January, he said, because more
high-priced, newly built homes are sold in November and December as
developers try to clear inventories. It usually takes until March or
April for the prices to catch back up to the December figure.</TE>
<TE>   The same thing is true for all of Southern California, where the
median price declined $11,000 from December to January, Karevoll
said. That included a $24,000 drop in Orange County and a $13,000
decline in San Diego County. In Los Angeles County, where much less
of the market consists of new homes, prices edged upward.</TE>
<TE>   Economist Mark Schniepp said the bullish year-to-year numbers
bolster projections that the county and region are in for solid
growth this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew home sales would continue to be strong, but we had no
idea they would start the year like this," said Schniepp, director of
California Economic Forecast in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County market remains strong, he said, because of a
severe housing shortage, low interest rates, a stable labor market
and a balanced local economy that has generally resisted the economic
downturn.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody realizes that we're pretty much at the bottom
on interest rates," Schniepp said. "The savvy buyer knows that with a
recovery looming, interest rates will go up. And people are putting
money into housing instead of the stock market."</TE>
<TE>   The continued strength of the housing market buoys the greater
economy, he said, because home purchases fuel a host of industries.
"Housing is very good for the economy," Schniepp said. "People pay
movers, and then they remodel. There's a huge trickle down.</TE>
<TE>   "But this is a double-edged sword," he added. "It gets sellers
equity for their next purchase, but housing is already so
unaffordable that for it to continue to rise just exacerbates a
serious problem in Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   There may well come a point, he said, when businesses will stop
moving here because their workers cannot afford homes.</TE>
<TE>   Recent employment figures indicate that may already be happening.</TE>
<TE>   Jobs in Ventura County dropped in December and January, the first
declines since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   DataQuick's sales totals for January reflect purchases completed
from agreements reached in the previous 30 to 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks owners sold the most homes last month, 229, while
Oxnard owners sold 220; 201 were sold in Simi Valley, 144 in Ventura
and 98 in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   The 25 houses sold in Westlake and Lake Sherwood in the Thousand
Oaks area increased most in price--about $100,000, or 25%, in a year.</TE>
