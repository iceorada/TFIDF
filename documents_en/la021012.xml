<HD>A Sad Day for Eggheads: Death of Arts &amp; Letters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIA KELLER</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until last Monday, the average professor's morning might go something
like this: Rise, dress, drink coffee, sit down at the computer and
call up aldaily.com.</LD>
<LD>   Arts &amp; Letters Daily was a must-read for about 60,000 academics
each day. The Weblog--or blog, as the genre now is known--listed
witty summaries of each day's top stories in the world of ideas,
gleaned from newspapers, magazines and scholarly journals published
around the world.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, however, when eager-fingered eggheads typed in the URL,
the page that popped up contained not a compendium of smart, funny
summaries and links to online enlightenment, but a cruelly curt
epitaph that read, in part:</LD>
<TE>   "The magazine Lingua Franca and its parent company University
Partners LLC filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.... We understand
the assets of University Business, including this Web site, are to be
auctioned in New York City on Oct. 24...."</TE>
<TE>   Thus with a few lines of legalese came the death of a blog beloved
by highbrows and by anyone, really, who appreciates incisive articles
on a variety of cutting-edge topics from Freud to French fries, from
evolution to Elvis.</TE>
<TE>   Denis Dutton, the man who created the site in 1998 and who, until
this week, still toiled over it each morning, said his brainchild was
caught up in the legal woes of Lingua Franca, a magazine about
academic affairs that ceased publication last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Lingua Franca purchased A&amp;L Daily three years ago. When the
magazine declared bankruptcy last fall, it was only a matter of time
until the blog, too, was put up for sale, said Dutton, a philosophy
professor at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New
Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see A&amp;L Daily survive and thrive. We'll see what
happens," added Dutton, who said he and his co-editor, Tran Huu Dung,
may purchase the site themselves when it goes on the auction block.</TE>
<TE>   It is all a bit murky, Dutton conceded. For one thing, the site
never made a profit--although early on, he hoped it might do just
that--and he and Dung were working for free. That, one would think,
might limit interest by potential purchasers.</TE>
<TE>   Lingua Franca's founder, Jeffrey Kittay, recently announced he
might try to resurrect the magazine and publish it under the guidance
of the New York Review of Books. But that plan, too, may not pan out.
"It's looking too difficult for me to do," Kittay said Tuesday.
"We'll see."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Dutton and Dung, an economics professor at Wright
State University in Dayton, Ohio, hope idea-hungry academics will
turn to other, more specialized sites to which they contribute,
including Philosophy and Literature (philosophyandliterature.com),
the online version of a scholarly journal Dutton founded; SciTech
Daily Review (scitechdaily.com); Business Daily Review
(businessdailyreview.com); Human Nature Review
(huma-nature.comnibbs); and Arts Journal (arts journal.com).</TE>
<TE>   No one knows what will happen after Oct. 24. Should the site not
return, however, academics surely will miss its irreverent, irascible
summaries of scholarly articles, along with its distinctive masthead:
A quotation from the Stoic Seneca (4 BC to AD 65).</TE>
<TE>   "Veritas Odit Moras" (Truth hates delay) is the line, proving that
Seneca was ahead of his time. He knew, even way back then, that the
Internet would be a rapid-fire delivery system for subversive--and
indispensable--ideas.</TE>

<HD>Artistic Director Is Ready for His Next Big Act</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Like an underdog prizefighter who has scrapped to the top on
chutzpah, street smarts and skill, Gordon Edelstein just may be what
New Haven's Long Wharf Theatre needs in an artistic director.</LD>
<LD>   After a less-than-championship season following the resignation of
Doug Hughes, Edelstein is bringing new energy, credibility and hope
to the 38-year-old theater as it faces a seismic shift in leadership,
a half-million-dollar debt and in-flux plans for a new complex.</LD>
<LD>   Insiders are giving Edelstein good odds, considering how well he
knows the players, having been associate artistic director under
longtime leader Arvin Brown in the early 1990s and runner-up five
years ago when the job went to Hughes.</LD>
<TE>   A big bear of a man (teddy to some, grizzly to others), Edelstein,
47, is a difficult man to cubbyhole, considering his tastes run from
a Philip Glass opera to Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple," both of which
he produced in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "One newspaper said that I was giving our audiences artistic
whiplash," Edelstein said. "Honestly, I love them both. So call me
crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Misha Berson, theater writer for the Seattle Times, calls
Edelstein "a mensch.... He's gregarious, warm and enthusiastic."</TE>
<TE>   Edelstein grew up on the south shore of Long Island. After public
school, he went to Grinnell College in Iowa, where he double-majored
in history and religious studies.</TE>
<TE>   After college, Edelstein still didn't know what he wanted to do,
so he spent a year traveling around Europe.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned to New York in the late 1970s, he did odd jobs
and started producing his own work off-off-Broadway. He eventually
became an apprentice at the American Place.</TE>
<TE>   His first real break came when he was hired as associate director
of the Berkshire Theatre Festival, running the second stage, from the
mid- to late-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Then things looked even brighter. In 1990, he was hired by Long
Wharf, one of the early and enduring stages in the regional theater
movement, as associate artistic director under Brown and was charged
with bringing in new work. Then the economy downsized, and so did
Edelstein's position.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Edelstein received a tempting offer from A Contemporary
Theatre in Seattle. It meant a five-year shuttle among three time
zones. But Seattle was his big chance to prove himself.</TE>
<TE>   ACT had just moved into a magnificent old building, with multiple
performance spaces and a lot of debt. "They were looking for an
artistic director to raise money, but you can't raise money without
an idea."</TE>
<TE>   And Edelstein had plenty of ideas. Primarily, he wanted to model
the theater after the Public Theater in New York and himself after
theater impresario Joe Papp.</TE>
<TE>   "He was my hero," Edelstein says.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense, I was living out my childhood fantasy. I used to go
to the Public Theater all the time as a kid, and his work meant a
tremendous deal to me: the vitality, the passion, a theater with a
sense of its own value. I wanted to create the kind of three-ring
circus of activity like Joe did. I wasn't sure we could succeed,
because downtown Seattle hadn't fully turned over [economically], and
I wasn't sure the city, which had so much theater already, could
support it. And I wasn't sure I was right. You're never sure. I just
wasn't sure I was good enough to make it happen. After all, I had
never done it before."</TE>
<TE>   But he did, putting on many memorable and eclectic productions
with "a showman's instincts," Berson said.  When he returned to New
Haven this year with a three-year contract, it was as a different
man, and to a different theater. The institution was wounded from the
year following Hughes' resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Edelstein has a clear idea of what Long Wharf is and is not. "Long
Wharf is here to produce classics or forgotten classics or near
classics and to generate exciting new work."</TE>

<HD>Comedy Quotient: 'Chicken' Feed</HD>

<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's astounding what can happen when the media get wind of a
titillating tidbit of gossip on an awfully slow news day.</LD>
<LD>   Various versions abound, but this particular story appears to have
started a few years ago at Yale University, where a small group of
bored students used to gather semi-regularly to eat greasy chicken,
drink cheap beer and watch dirty movies. But this being the Ivy
League, an effort to attach some greater significance to these coed
sessions soon surfaced, and thus the Porn 'n Chicken club was born.</LD>
<LD>   Word spread surreptitiously, the "meetings" got larger, and the
underground attention fed the group's randy ambitions. It was the
P&amp;C's decision to cast Yale students in its own porn movie that
brought the media running, and Time magazine, the New York Times and
a host of other august news institutions breathlessly weighed in on
what was transpiring at our then new president's alma mater.</LD>
<TE>   The porn movie was never made, but unfortunately, another film
was: the crass Comedy Channel version of the Yale tale, "Porn 'n
Chicken" (Sunday at 10 p.m.).</TE>
<TE>   This flat, leering effort is the cable outfit's first foray into
original movies, and one can only hope for better things the second
time around. As P&amp;C principals Polly and Quentin, Angela Goethals
(the WB sitcom "Do Over") and Alex Burns ("National Lampoon's Van
Wilder") manage to stand out, but the acting is generally charmless,
and the romantic and political subplots are more tiresome than
involving. The meager scattering of halfway decent lines ("Word of
our deeds is spreading like chlamydia") rattle around like a handful
of marbles in a trash can.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson may be that while truth is often stranger than fiction,
it's not necessarily any funnier.</TE>

<HD>Women Rule the London Stage This Fall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT WOLF</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>From Glenn Close and Elaine Stritch to Maggie Smith and Judi Dench,
it is suddenly ladies' night on the London stage.</LD>
<LD>   The new fall season brought the London stage debut of Glenn Close,
who opened Tuesday at the Royal National's Lyttelton Theatre in "A
Streetcar Named Desire." Stritch opened Wednesday at the Old Vic in
her hit solo show.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Smith and Dench are paired in "The Breath of Life." It
is their first play together since 1959. David Hare's two-character
drama, directed by Howard Davies, opens Tuesday at the Theater Royal,
Haymarket.</LD>
<TE>   Tennessee Williams' "Streetcar," at the Lyttelton Theatre, casts
Close, 55, as Blanche DuBois, a character who, as written, is a
quarter-century younger.</TE>
<TE>   But director Trevor Nunn defended the casting of Close, whom Nunn
guided toward a Tony Award in 1995 in the musical "Sunset Boulevard."</TE>
<TE>   Close, said Nunn, "is in my view a great actress, on both screen
and stage, and in common with other great actresses, she is ageless."
The public presumably agrees: The entire eight-week run sold out well
before the first preview.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel in competition with anybody," Close said about the
role, which has been performed on stage by Jessica Tandy, Rosemary
Harris and Jessica Lange, among many others, and Vivien Leigh on
screen.</TE>
<TE>   Broadway veteran Stritch has no one to compete with except herself
in "Elaine Stritch at Liberty." But in London, where Stritch isn't
known to the general public, there were some raised eyebrows at the
decision to charge close to $80 a ticket--a hefty price for the West
End.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Brenda Blethyn, 56, the veteran actress who graduated
to film stardom in recent years with her Academy Award-nominated
performances in "Secrets and Lies" and "Little Voice," is back on
stage for the first time in six years, playing the title role in
"Mrs. Warren's Profession." "I was getting withdrawal symptoms," she
said of her theater absence. The revival of George Bernard Shaw's
play opened Thursday at the Strand Theater.</TE>

<HD>Eminem Keeps 106 in Power</HD>
<DH>Radio* Rapper's hit CD also boosts other outlets in the
Arbitron ratings. Spanish-language radio exec decries polling method
for his stations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hip-hop outlet Power 106 retained its top spot in the ratings and
increased its percentage of the Southland audience, while
Spanish-language station KSCA-FM plunged from second to eighth during
the summer, according to figures released Friday by the Arbitron
ratings service.</LD>
<LD>   A combination of promotions, charity events and good music helped
create a successful summer for KPWR-FM (105.9), said Jimmy Steal,
Power 106's program director. The latter included songs from "The
Eminem Show," the rapper's eponymous album, which has sold 6 million
copies and remained near the top of the charts all year.</LD>
<LD>   "Those songs seem to do exceptionally well for us and for several
other stations as well," Steal said, adding that records from
Ashanti, Westside Connection and Xzibit have also made for a strong
summer playlist.</LD>
<TE>   He said Eminem's upcoming movie, "8 Mile," will also focus
attention on hip-hop music, which can only help the station.</TE>
<TE>   KPWR increased its share of listeners 12 and older in Los Angeles
and Orange counties from 4.9% to 5.1%, holding off another station
with Eminem on its playlist, alternative rocker KROQ-FM (106.7),
which jumped from third to second in the quarterly standings and
garnered 4.9% of the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Close behind was Top 40 outlet KIIS-FM (102.7), which rose from
sixth to third and took 4.6% of listeners for the summer ratings
period, which spanned June 27 to Sept. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, KSCA (101.9) dropped from a 4.7% share of the audience
to 3.2%, tying it with oldies station KRTH-FM (101.1).</TE>
<TE>   The drop at KSCA is merely an aberration, said Ken Christensen,
L.A.-area vice president and general manager for Hispanic
Broadcasting Corp., which owns KSCA and several other
Spanish-language stations in the market. He noted that all other
Spanish stations except one also declined, a phenomenon he suspects
arose from an abnormally low number of Spanish speakers being
included in the survey this time around.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly a concern it was that big of a change,"
Christensen said, but he said no other factors changed at his
stations that could account for the shift--promotions, format
changes, etc.--so he believes the numbers will rebound in the next
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the station's decline, KSCA's powerhouse morning man,
Renan Almendarez Coello, known as "El Cucuy," held on with the top
morning show in the market.</TE>
<TE>   But his share of the audience dropped as well, from 7.9% to 6%,
while talk station KFI-AM (640) jumped from fourth to second in the
morning, with Bill Handel's audience share increasing from 4.5% to
5.5%.</TE>
<TE>   KFI's surge was just part of the movement among morning shows, in
which no English-language programs held their places from the spring
ratings period. Kevin &amp; Bean on KROQ rose to third place from fifth,
while comedian Steve Harvey on KKBT-FM (100.3) dropped from second to
fourth and KPWR's Big Boy fell from third to fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that shift, KPWR's Steal said he "couldn't be more proud
of the staff for the year we've had," referring not only to the
ratings success, but also to the two prestigious Marconi Awards that
the National Assn. of Broadcasters recently gave Power 106 and Big
Boy.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the vagaries of Arbitron's survey system, such as those
Christensen noted, and because of factors beyond their control, such
as promotions or format changes at other stations, Steal said that
programmers should never get too high or too low about their numbers
for any one ratings period. Even with Power 106's impressive showing,
he cautioned against irrational exuberance.</TE>
<TE>   "Ratings are like the stock market," Steal said. "It goes up and
down over the course of the year, but when you get that year-end
statement, you hope you're on the plus side."</TE>

<HD>Socially Minded Mana Spreads the Word</HD>
<DH>Musically, the Mexican quartet may seem fairly mundane, but
their message strikes a chord.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a cultural phenomenon, Mana really does seem sent from heaven.</LD>
<LD>   The wildly popular Mexican quartet, which opened a four-night run
at the Universal Amphitheatre on Thursday, looks and acts like a rock
band, all long hair, leather, electric guitars and tattoos. But its
intentions are entirely wholesome.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of expressing generational angst, they dedicate songs to
departed fathers and grandfathers. Instead of glorifying a dissolute
life of drugs and sex, they use their stardom to promote social
justice, world peace, environmental protection and safe sex.</LD>
<TE>   Thousands of young fans seemed swept away Thursday by the band's
hippie-era call for community and commitment. They earnestly sang
their hearts out on faithfully memorized songs, including half a
dozen from Mana's recently released "Revolucion de Amor."</TE>
<TE>   The sea of bright, inspired faces during this modern-day love-in
was enough to soften any cynic's soul. OK, so it's not too subtle.
And the message may sound retro, especially with the Beatles' "All
You Need Is Love" playing at the end of the two-hour-plus concert,
following the crowd's deafening demands for two encores.</TE>
<TE>   But Mana is the only contemporary Mexican band that can sell
social values along with millions of records. You have to welcome
their success at a time when so much pop culture is self-centered,
materialistic, crude or just plain empty.</TE>
<TE>   Musically, however, Mana is much more mundane. Singer-guitarist
Fher Olvera, drummer Alex Gonzalez, lead guitarist Sergio Vallin and
bassist Juan Calleros were supplemented by veteran keyboardist Juan
Carlos Toribio and an additional guitarist. But the only one who
truly shone instrumentally was Gonzalez, a pint-sized but powerhouse
and precision percussionist nicknamed "El Animal," a crowd favorite
with his stick-twirling, jumping-jack antics.</TE>
<TE>   The group's instrumental shortcomings were nowhere more noticeable
than on its finale performance of "Corazon Espinado," the
Grammy-winning hit from Santana's monster 1999 album, "Supernatural."
Santana's genius is certainly hard to replace, and Vallin's guitar
solo simply paled.</TE>
<TE>   Except for El Animal, the members of Mana were relatively subdued
on stage. They exhibited surprisingly little spontaneity, with most
songs performed perfunctorily. The unimaginative video effects, far
too amateurish for a group of this magnitude, added to the static
feel because the images rarely moved in time with the music.</TE>
<TE>   People obviously don't look to Mana for virtuosity and complexity.
They respond to its simple message couched in a soft melange of
rock-tropical-reggae rhythms, its tender love songs, its appealing
vocals and its strong streak of Mexican nationalism.</TE>
<TE>   Singer-guitarist Olvera, the group's central figure, deftly
wielded Mana's power to proselytize.</TE>
<TE>   Which makes one worry about the group's high-profile sponsorship
of a U.S. beer company. Isn't liquor the scourge of the Latino
community, contributing to the domestic violence that the group
condemns in its music?</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, Mana's new song "Justicia, Tierra, y Libertad" loses its
lofty ring when you add a commercial twist: Justice, Land, Liberty
and Coors Light.</TE>
<TE>   Mana, today and Sunday at Universal Amphitheatre, 100 Universal
City Plaza, Universal City, 8:15 p.m. Sold out. (818) 622-4440.</TE>

<HD>Creativity Compensates in a Truncated 'Calle 54'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Calle 54: The Concert," at Royce Hall Thursday night, turned out to
be the Reader's Digest version of the highly praised Latin jazz film
by director Fernando Trueba. The initially announced lineup of
performers from the picture--Eliane Elias, Bebo Valdes, Chano
Dominguez, Dave Valentin, Dave Samuels, Jerry Gonzalez and Giovanni
Hidalgo--was a relatively modest representation from a production
that also featured, among others, Gato Barbieri, Chucho Valdes,
Paquito Rivera and the now-departed Tito Puente and Chico O'Farrill.
And, when Bebo Valdes encountered travel restrictions that prevented
a trip from Cuba, the list was reduced even further.</LD>
<LD>   However, two of the acts on the bill--Elias and
Dominguez--provided enough creative fireworks to more than compensate
for any missing participants.</LD>
<LD>   Less can be said for the opening segment. Despite stalwart efforts
from trumpeter Diego Urcola, vibist Samuels and percussionist
Hidalgo--including a particularly spectacular solo effort from the
latter--too much of the set was dominated by the showboating of
flutist Valentin's physical and musical antics. A good player when he
focuses on the music, he seemed more concerned, in this outing, with
dominating the stage.</LD>
<TE>   Elias took the opposite stance. Seated at the piano with her back
to the audience, she offered new, imaginatively jazz-driven
renderings of the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim. She focused on her
world-class jazz improvising but neglected to include vocals that
play a major role in her latest recording. Gonzalez, joining the
Elias trio for a single number, offered an effective, Miles
Davis-styled reading of the standard "Tenderly."</TE>
<TE>   The most unexpected highlight, however, was the extraordinary
flamenco jazz of Dominguez. Mixing his Bill Evans- and Bud
Powell-influenced piano work with the melismatic flamenco vocals of
Blas Cordoba and the rhythmic flamenco dancing of Tomas Moreno, he
has a convincing musical hybrid--convincing on both an emotional and
a creative level. Moving from a tango and a buleria to an alegria and
a rumba (in which the six-piece ensemble was joined by Gonzalez, now
playing percussion), Dominguez found fascinating connections between
flamenco and jazz--the similar ways each employs the superimposition
of 4/4 and 6/4 rhythms, the blues-like melodies, and the similarity
of the improvisational intensity.</TE>
<TE>   And when the Dominguez ensemble was greeted by a standing ovation,
it seemed apparent that his music has the potential to add
intriguing--and much needed--new sounds and rhythms to the
contemporary jazz scene.</TE>

<HD>Accompanying His Own Party</HD>
<DH>Movies* Silent-film organist Bob Mitchell will be in his
usual seat for a 90th-birthday gala tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Mitchell seems a little embarrassed by all the fuss over his 90th
birthday celebration this evening at the Downtown Palace Theatre.
Mitchell, who began playing the organ for silent movies back on
Christmas Day 1924, will be accompanying the 1925 Buster Keaton
classic "Seven Chances" on the Hammond organ at his birthday party.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's foolish," he says rather sheepishly, the reason
being that his friends and fans will have to pay $15 to $18 to
attend. Mitchell, who plays every weekend at the Silent Movie Theatre
in the Fairfax District, recalls that for his 88th birthday party,
that theater's owner, Charlie Lustman, "generously turned over the
theater. All my friends came and they didn't charge them anything.
But at any rate, I hope it works out well."</LD>
<LD>   On a recent Monday afternoon, Mitchell is playing a 1927 Steinway
in the lounge area of the Silent Movie--the only such theater in
America. The music wafts through the building as Mitchell plays the
Oscar-winning tune "Swinging on a Star" from the 1944 film "Going My
Way." His Bob Mitchell Boys Choir appeared in the Bing Crosby drama.</LD>
<TE>   "Actually I was in the Navy" when the film was made, says
Mitchell, who looks dapper in a dark suit and has Paul Newman-blue
eyes and a shock of white hair. "I was already drafted when 'Going My
Way' was made. My associate directed the music in the movie and they
used my arrangements. I came back on leave and had my picture taken
with Crosby and the boys."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell began his choir in 1934; it continued for the next 65
years. In the early days, it sang at Catholic Masses broadcast
locally on the radio. The radio gig led to numerous film appearances.</TE>
<TE>   "My first picture was 'The Girl From Paris' with Lily Pons. Jack
Oakie was the comedian. One of the assistant directors heard our
broadcast and heard the boys," he said. "We learned when we first
started those primitive microphones were just awful. They couldn't
take those high sopranos, so we had to teach the boys to sing in a
whisper, and we got a very beautiful blend, so that was great for
recording."</TE>
<TE>   Over the decades, the choir's numbers dwindled from 34 to one.
"What happened is that conditions are so different," Mitchell says.
"It's a different world. Our recruiting fell. As the boys dropped out
of the choir, we didn't replenish them. In the days of our heyday,
the boys made so much money in the movies." Then tastes changed with
the sexual revolution, "and they don't use boys choirs and family
type of things. Also, it used to be that the public schools, they
didn't have a very good reputation here in California. We had
teachers. We had school from 8:30 to 12:30. It was a wonderful
opportunity and we had a big waiting list.</TE>
<TE>   "I got down to one boy. The first was in 1934," he recalled. "I
played at his funeral. I trained 600 boys. At least 50 of them are
dead."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell began playing at the Silent Movie in the early '90s.
After the proprietor was murdered in the theater in 1997, he returned
when the doors reopened in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I started to hear about him before I opened the doors," says
Lustman, who is producing Mitchell's birthday bash. "Then I called
him and he was more than happy to return."</TE>
<TE>   Lustman says his biggest worry is that Mitchell will die during a
performance. "He is playing the pedals with his feet and the
keyboards with his hands at the same time," Lustman says. "This man
is playing for two hours. It's like a workout."</TE>
<TE>   About a year ago, he thought his nightmare had come true. "Bob's
known for his style of playing--he pauses for dramatic effect and
then comes back in. I was in the projectionist booth, and there was a
pause and he didn't come back on. All of a sudden, my heart started
pounding. The audience didn't' notice anything."</TE>
<TE>   But Mitchell's caregiver, one of his former choirboys, noticed
Mitchell was slumped over the keyboard. "He jumped in and grabbed
Bob, who kind of came to .... He said, 'I'm OK. I'm just really
tired.' " His caregiver took over on the keyboard and continued the
screening.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out that Mitchell had begun new medication that made him
groggy and he had fallen asleep during the performance. "Bob couldn't
play anymore," Lustman says. "We thought it was the end. I think it
was two months that he stopped playing. He was extremely depressed
that he couldn't come here and play."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the caregiver called to let him know that Mitchell was
doing better. But Lustman had his doubts and said, " 'As harsh as it
sounds, I have to audition him before I book him for a Saturday
night.' So he came in and played better than he had ever played
before. He blew us away and we booked him back into the theater."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell improvises the score for each movie. "It will never be
the same twice," he says. "It's the ability to improvise that allows
a person to be able to play silent pictures. I play the first part of
the show on the piano and then play the organ for the feature. I
never play anything that has been published since after the picture
was released."</TE>
<TE>   During the performance, Mitchell plays in the dark. "He doesn't
need to see the keyboard," Lustman says. "He refuses to play with
light. He can see the picture better without some light on him. It is
just a better view of the screen."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Lustman has seen Mitchell get excited as a
youngster when he plays. "He gets to go back in time when he
remembers his friends and family and the stars he worked with."</TE>
<TE>   The birthday celebration will feature actor Bill Pullman as host,
the dance group the Rhythm Rollers and musical guests Janet Klein &amp;
Her Parlor Boys. Lustman and Pullman will then do a tribute to
Mitchell drawing from a "This Is Your Life" radio broadcast that
honored Mitchell in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   Listening to the broadcast was a revelation to Lustman, who didn't
know Mitchell poured most of the money he earned back into the choir.</TE>
<TE>   "He literally was the sponsor for these children," Lustman says.
"He would take poor kids, he would clothe them and house them and
teach them how to sing. It's amazing. He had done that for decades
for these children."</TE>
<TE>   From Lustman's perspective, Mitchell's life has come full circle.
"He got his first big break playing for silent pictures in 1924, and
he is finishing out his career playing for silent pictures," the
theater owner says. "The organ and the silent pictures are what he
thrived on as a young boy and how he finishes out his life."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Bob Mitchell's 90th Birthday Celebration takes place tonight
at 8 at the Downtown Palace Theatre, 630 S. Broadway, L.A. Tickets
are $15 if purchased between noon and 5 p.m. today at the Silent
Movie Theatre, 611 N. Fairfax Ave., L.A., or $18 after 7 p.m at the
Palace box office. Information: (323) 655-2510 or on the Web at

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was refreshing to read Allan deSouza's Counterpunch about Leni
Riefenstahl's fascistic photography ("Does Riefenstahl Make a Fascist
Statement?," Oct. 7). It's rare that anyone points out that this
particular empress is naked.</LD>
<LD>   For years, she has claimed that she was merely an artist during
the '30s, not a Nazi. In a post-1945 world, it is easy enough to
understand her lies, but difficult to understand why so many people
have felt compelled to lie on her behalf. It seems as though every
time people write about her, Riefenstahl's close ties to Hitler are
either denied categorically or, worse yet, justified by her towering
talent as a filmmaker.</LD>
<LD>   Well, having been a movie critic during my own checkered past, I
am one of the few masochists who has actually sat through both of her
alleged masterpieces, "Olympia" and "Triumph of the Will." While both
films are commonly referred to as documentaries, they are actually
long, boring, heavy-handed Nazi propaganda films. If they're
documentaries, "Mein Kampf" is history.</LD>

<LD>Why would we expect small towns to be portrayed any more accurately
in cinema than, say, murderers or attorneys, or big-city life ("Small
Towns Needn't Be This Dreary," by Mimi Avins, Oct. 5)?</LD>
<LD>   A small town is usually just another character in a film, and like
most, is not only misunderstood but regurgitated from other films or
television. Only rarely does someone get it right.</LD>
<LD>   As a product of a small town (pop. 725; at least that's what the
sign says), I can always tell which filmmakers are from one, have
gotten to really know one, or even gotten a flat tire in one.</LD>

most of Hollywood, thinks that small towns and small-town folk are
the ones lost.</TE>

<LD>Leni Riefenstahl, whose longevity has resulted in her becoming the
world's oldest living punching bag, is no more promoting fascism with
her sensual photographs of the Nuba tribe than when she was
glorifying Jesse Owens' amazing performance in the 1936 Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   She has recorded history with an artistic eye (or art with an
historic eye!) longer than most people have been alive. It may be
fair to critique ... but not to judge.</LD>
<LD>   Those who automatically classify her as "Nazi filmmaker" and
"Aryan supremacist" should look a little closer at her body of work.
Owens and the Japanese marathon medalist in "Olympia" are
cinematically deified. Her alleged prejudice against Gypsies while
filming "Tiefland" can be countered with the fact that she was
portraying a Gypsy character!</LD>
<TE>   Riefenstahl has seemed to resign herself to the fact that her
detractors are at least equal in number to her admirers. If she has
ever displayed any real bias, it has been toward the athletic male
form. And who can blame a gal for that?</TE>

<LD>Although it is hard to explain taste, Mimi Avins' attack on "The Good
Girl" seems particularly misplaced. Both my wife and I feel "The Good
Girl" was one of the finest American movies of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Although the setting was in a Texas suburban area, the character's
home and work could have been anywhere in the suburban sprawl of
America. The screenplay accurately reflected the human condition of
trying to cope with life with escapist fantasies, whether through
searching for romance, the use of drugs or addiction to television.</LD>

<LD>Don Heckman is right, objecting to over-amplified music ("Holland
Band Overcomes Sound Woes," Oct. 5). The problem exists not just at
Royce Hall but at many non-rock venues. I have often observed the
problem.</LD>
<LD>   Regrettably, most of the so-called sound engineers are techies
rather than music lovers. They revel in complex mixing panels,
powerful amplifiers and industrial-strength speakers while gunning
the sound out to the listeners at levels just below feedback.</LD>
<LD>   My basic rule is that orchestras were invented before microphones.
During the big-band era of the 1930s and 1940s, large halls were
often served by only one microphone, used by the announcer and the
vocalist. In recent years, I have produced band concerts in halls of
500 seats and larger with just the one microphone, and that was
turned off until a singer or announcer stepped forward. The sound was
wonderful.</LD>

<HD>'Gleason' Just Skims the Star's Surface</HD>
<DH>Brad Garrett embodies the '50s TV comedian in a movie that
offers little insight into his troubles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chicken flaps, the diphthongal vowels, the wide-eyed takes--all
of Jackie Gleason's trademarks can be seen in Brad Garrett's
portrayal of the comedian in CBS' Sunday-night movie "Gleason."</LD>
<LD>   That performance may be reason enough to tune in at 9 p.m., but
the rest of the movie is as disastrously ill-conceived as one of
Ralph Kramden's get-rich-quick schemes on "The Honeymooners."</LD>
<LD>   As biography, the project is a bust. Its only insight into Gleason
is the cliche that great comedy often comes from the heart of
darkness.</LD>
<TE>   In flashbacks from the height of Gleason's accomplishment with
"The Jackie Gleason Show" and "The Honeymooners" in the mid-1950s,
the movie looks back down a rocky road. Bitter disappointment between
Gleason's parents (a frazzled Paula Jean Hixson and a dissolute Jack
Langedijk) is followed by a repeat of the cycle in Gleason's marriage
to Genevieve Halford (Gretchen Egolf).</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly unable to maintain control over his personal life,
Garrett's Gleason obsessively takes charge of his work, bullying his
writers, lecturing his co-stars and generally biting the hands that
feed him--especially that of his guardian-angel manager, George
"Bullets" Durgom (Saul Rubinek).</TE>
<TE>   Under Howard Deutch's direction, the movie--reported to be a
reworking of the script credited to Rick Podell and Michael
Preminger--trudges through the early years, picking up pace only when
it is well into its second hour. As one might expect, re-creations of
"Honeymooners" scenes (opposite Kristen Dalton as Audrey Meadows and
Michael Chieffo as Art Carney) are the show's highlight. But there
are surprisingly few of them, presented mostly in a rush in the
program's final moments.</TE>
<TE>   Garrett, though, is amazing. A recent Emmy winner as a supporting
actor on "Everybody Loves Raymond," he bears a striking resemblance
to Gleason even without the facial prosthetics and body padding that
he wears here. In addition to evoking Gleason's voice and manner, he
suggests the rough-edged charm and vulnerability that lurked so
compellingly beneath the real Gleason's surface.</TE>
<TE>   "Gleason" can be seen Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS. The network has
rated it TV-PG-D (may not be suitable for young children, with an
advisory for suggestive dialogue).</TE>

<LD>   Prince Charles: Don't Forget Older Viewers</LD>
<LD>   The setting was London, but many an American probably could relate
when Prince Charles urged television executives this week to stop
aiming so many of their programs at teenagers.</LD>
<TE>   "As viewers, people don't remain as teenagers for the rest of
their lives. We are getting older, and it's sometimes difficult to
remember that," said Charles, the 53-year-old son of Queen Elizabeth
II. "What we wanted to watch when we were young is not necessarily
what we want to watch when we are past 50."</TE>
<TE>   Addressing TV executives at a St. James' Palace reception to mark
the Royal Television Society's 75th anniversary, the prince said: "So
my tiny, little plea in this 75th year, and before you embark on the
next 75 years, is ... there still be programs that recognize that a
large proportion of the population is old.... Please don't forget the
older, perhaps more discerning viewer."</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   More of Union Square's Playhouses Will Close</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco theater owner Chuck Eisler--who operates the
240-seat Mason Street Theatre and the adjacent 80-seat Union Square
Playhouse in the city's tourist-heavy Union Square district--plans to
close both theaters at the end of the year. Eisler blames the
closures on both the local economy and the lack of available
commercial theater product coming out of New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Even before 9/11, the dot-com bubble burst, the rah-rah days of
lots of people with tons of money had certainly changed," Eisler
said. After Sept. 11, he says, the drop-off in tourism decreased the
potential theater audience still more, and fewer touring shows have
been available for booking into the theaters.</TE>
<TE>   The planned closures come close on the heels of the announcement
of the demise of another theater in the district--this summer,
Theater on the Square producer Jonathan Reinis revealed plans to
vacate the 788-seat house when his lease expires Dec. 31. The final
show on Reinis' watch, "Puppetry of the Penis," opens this month.</TE>

<TE>   J.M.W. Turner's Heirs Air Museum Dispute</TE>
<TE>   Descendants of J.M.W. Turner are threatening to take back hundreds
of his paintings at England's Tate and National Gallery, saying the
works are not being displayed in accordance with the terms of his
will.</TE>
<TE>   As reported in the London Evening Standard, the relatives are
angry because the galleries are not complying with a specification in
Turner's 1848 will that the paintings be hung in their own room.</TE>
<TE>   Gallery officials downplayed the controversy. At the Tate Britain,
which houses most of Turner's 300 paintings and 20,000 sketches,
director Stephen Deuchar said, "Turner is more visible than ever
before at Tate Britain and Tate recently launched online access to
the entire bequest."</TE>

<TE>   Michael Jackson to Host Air Force Families</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jackson has invited more than 200 military personnel from
Vandenberg Air Force Base to bring their families to a party today at
his Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County.</TE>
<TE>   An Air Force spokesman said the invitation was issued as a gesture
of the entertainer's appreciation to base members who have served
overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the Bush
administration-led military campaign in Afghanistan.</TE>

<TE>   Whitney Houston Is Sued by Father's Firm</TE>
<TE>   Whitney Houston is being sued for $100 million by her father's
entertainment company for breach of contract.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, filed in New Jersey Superior Court in
Newark on Sept. 12, the singer was in financial straits and facing
marijuana possession charges in Hawaii until her father's company
stepped in.</TE>
<TE>   Newark-based John Houston Entertainment LLC, run by John Houston
and business partner Kevin Skinner, helped get the marijuana charges
dropped and hired lawyers to negotiate a $100-million contract with
Arista Records, Skinner said.</TE>
<TE>   When John Houston Entertainment asked to be paid for its services,
the company was denied, the lawsuit claims.</TE>
<TE>   Whitney Houston's L.A.-based spokeswoman said the singer's
81-year-old father told her he has nothing to do with the suit, but
Skinner and his attorney claim John Houston stands by it. Calls to
John Houston's home were not answered Friday.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   CBS' "CSI" achieved a record rating for itself on Thursday,
averaging 30.7 million viewers for the hour. With that performance,
the third-year crime drama moved ahead of NBC's "Friends" to rank as
television's most-watched series so far this season....Rock group
Creed has rescheduled eight concerts in the Western U.S., including
the Los Angeles stop that was postponed earlier this week, because
singer Scott Stapp has acute laryngitis. The new L.A. date will be
Oct. 20 at Staples Center.... Prince Charles conferred a knighthood
on Peter Blake, the painter best known for designing the cover of the
Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" album.</TE>

<HD>Sister Wendy Adds Spice, Passion to Tour</HD>
<DH>On her visit to the Norton Simon, the nun examines its

move her the most.</DH>

<TE>   Sister Wendy will always attract condescending smiles from those
who can't get used to the notion of a nun as an art museum guide,
much less take her seriously. But here she is again, delivering her
personal gospel of art history as she glides through the Norton Simon
Museum in Pasadena. Commissioned by the Norton Simon Art Foundation
and produced by Spire Films, the tour is packed with passion, opinion
and visual delight. "I chose some of the works that move me most,"
she says upon entering the galleries of early Italian and Renaissance
paintings. The "Branchini Madonna," a gilded altarpiece by Sienese
artist Giovanni di Paolo, is "perhaps my favorite work in the
museum," she says, but she would rather grapple with Raphael's
"Madonna and Child With Book." "We like gritty, nitty, mud, blood,
all the ordinariness of life, and he's so perfect," she says of
Raphael. But there's more to this "miracle of a painting" than
beauty. Zeroing in on the hefty baby, she offers a pearl of Sister
Wendy-esque insight: "Don't think fat little bloke. Think young sumo
wrestler." The infant is destined to be "an all-powerful God," and
he's "pure muscle." Moving on to the Impressionist galleries, she
speculates that Norton Simon bought more than 100 works by Edgar
Degas because he was attracted by the artist's "certainty" and
"strange detachment" from his subjects. "It seems to me that there
was never a less romantic artist than Degas," she concludes. But it
isn't easy to define Simon's artistic taste. The man who bought Degas
in bulk also chose Vincent van Gogh's "Mulberry Tree," a vibrant
painting that "explodes onto the canvas," and Antoine Watteau's
"Reclining Nude," in which a young woman with luminously pallid skin
portrays "the defenselessness of being naked," she says. The breadth
and depth of Simon's collection becomes even more apparent when she
goes downstairs to the galleries of South Asian art. Walking through
the temple-like space and perusing sculptures from a broad sweep of
geography, she stops at a 13th century gilt bronze statue of the god
Indra, made in Nepal. As the camera closes in, nothing escapes Sister
Wendy's gaze. A subtly incised "third eye" in the figure's forehead
signifies that he "violated a married woman," she says. That brief
morality tale is balanced by a view of marital bliss in "Vishnu and
Lakshmi With Avatars," an 11th century Hindu bronze. The divine
couple is surrounded by symbols of Vishnu's avatars, or incarnations,
but as Sister Wendy points out, he has one arm around his wife and is
fondling her breast. Such observations add spice to the rapturous
tour, but they are also part of the message. Religious or not, art is
about life in all of its manifestations. As Sister Wendy wafts
through the museum and presents whimsically eccentric interpretations
of this or that piece, she conveys an important idea: There's much to
be seen and learned and loved by those who take time to get to know
works of art.  "Sister Wendy at the Norton Simon Museum" will air
Sunday at 10 p.m. on KCET.</TE>

<LD>Some people sing because they want to; other people sing because they
have to. Indie-pop wunderkind Conor Oberst falls into the latter
group. Performing with his musical collective Bright Eyes on Thursday
at the Henry Fonda Theatre, the Omaha singer-guitarist offered songs
that were reassuring salves for his troubled young mind, plagued
chiefly by a desire for true love but also by personal history,
current events and artistic integrity.</LD>
<LD>   On this first of two scheduled consecutive nights, Oberst, 22, and
his 13-piece band drew their 90-minute set mostly from Bright Eyes'
recent album, "Lifted, or the Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to
the Ground." A prolific songwriter, Oberst already has six previous
Bright Eyes releases on rising-star indie label Saddle Creek Records,
as well as a collection by his more rock-oriented band Desaparecidos.</LD>
<LD>   Played by three percussionists plus musicians on guitars, pedal
steel, strings, keyboards, brass, woodwinds, vibraphone and more, the
complex, intriguing but sometimes overly lugubrious tunes from
"Lifted" came to, by turns, vibrant, desperate, joyous and soulful
life. It was orchestral pop with a rambling, shambling feel, blending
dusty country waltzes, '60s folkie idealism and post-punk
eccentricity into a simple, elegant tapestry of emotional need and
release.</LD>
<TE>   Comparisons to Bob Dylan are perhaps inevitable, but you don't get
the sense that Dylan needs anything other than himself. Oberst, on
the other hand, can be sarcastic and despairing, but he celebrates
his love for singing and for his friends because they keep his
self-inflicted demons at bay.</TE>
<TE>   He told coherent stories with a wordy, unstructured poetry that
was quite emotionally literal. Yet the sincerity generally stopped
short of being painful. His wavering voice veered from near-whispered
sentiments to explosive, ragged bursts of feeling, but it never
sounded like affectation. Indeed, such sweeping songs as "Method
Acting" gathered and broke as organically as mini-storms.</TE>
<TE>   The subtle instrumentation was dramatically offset by close-set,
propulsive, at times almost militant drumbeats that gave such numbers
as "False Advertising" a thunderously urgent counterpoint.
Alternately sardonic and sincere, the song expressed Oberst's Kurt
Cobain-esque desire to never let the spotlight obscure his motivation
for making music: to save himself and perhaps others.</TE>
<TE>   Although such songs as "Lover I Don't Have to Love" and "You Will.
You? Will. You? Will. You? Will" obsessed over personal romantic
foibles, Oberst also displayed an awareness of--and, naturally,
concern about--the larger world.</TE>
<TE>   He has said in interviews that events of Sept. 11, 2001,
profoundly affected him, and some lyrics reflected anger and
frustration with such out-of-his-control things as war and mass-media
messages. He even pulled a momentary cheer from the hungrily
attentive audience by inserting a passing reference to defending oil
wells into the questioning "Don't Know When but a Day Is Gonna Come."</TE>
<TE>   The most impressive thing about Oberst was that in an era when
it's all been done before, he had the guts to express himself without
being overly self-conscious or nonchalant.</TE>
<TE>   He was unique and yet universal, a young man acknowledging how the
world works while wishing things were different, buoyed in the
confusing sea of adulthood by the kind of intense love for one's
friends that only youth feels. And he unabashedly offered his views
despite knowing just how many tortured musical souls before him have
tried to make sense of it all.</TE>

<HD>'O Brother' Soundtrack Still Driving Bluegrass</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM PATTERSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>As its annual convention and awards show approaches, the bluegrass
music industry continues to enjoy newfound popularity created by the
Grammy-winning "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack.</LD>
<LD>   However, the recording contains few true bluegrass tunes.</LD>
<LD>   "To me, the 'O Brother' soundtrack is not bluegrass," said singer
Rhonda Vincent, the International Bluegrass Music Assn.'s reigning
best entertainer.</LD>
<TE>   "But as long as people love the music, who cares what it's
called?"</TE>
<TE>   The "O Brother" phenomenon--the recording remains on the charts
after two years and more than 6 million sales--will provide
discussion fodder for the 20,000 bluegrass artists, talent bookers
and record executives gathering next week at the Galt House hotel in
Louisville, Ky., for a trade show and music festival.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Hays, the organization's president, says that although "O
Brother" has been a strong catalyst for bluegrass music, a wide
variety of acts--from traditional artists such as Ricky Skaggs and
Del McCoury to contemporary ones such as Nickel Creek and Alison
Krauss--have secured the fan base.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1997, there were about 800 stations playing bluegrass for 2
1/2 hours a week," Hays said. "This year, it's up to six hours at 900
stations."</TE>
<TE>   Attendance is up at the more than 500 bluegrass festivals held
across the country each year, and instrument manufacturers report
backlogged orders for banjos, mandolins and guitars.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent, though only tangentially involved in "O Brother" with a
few appearances on the "Down From the Mountain" tour, partly traces
her recent popularity to it.</TE>
<TE>   "I have an album that came out a year ago June, and it's almost at
50,000 in sales and still selling well," she said. "That's unreal for
a bluegrass artist, and has to be a part of all that."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>That the Beach Boys' 1966 album "Pet Sounds" has become a cultural
icon is, by itself, an amusing idea. That it can stand with the
literature of Gertrude Stein is an even more amusing idea. That
Stein's landmark, if mostly unread, epic novel, "The Making of
Americans" might be intoned in Swedish, French Canadian and Japanese
accents, to the accompaniment of sounds from "Pet Sounds," however,
approaches the multiculturally outlandish. And the concept of mixing
and matching high and low, along with East and West, gets even
further out when you add a touch of Japanese folk music and an
overarching German sensibility.</LD>
<LD>   But Heiner Goebbels' quirky "Hashirigaki," given its West Coast
premiere at the Freud Playhouse on Thursday, is a surprising,
musically happy and visually ravishing marriage of, if not opposites,
at least cultural differences.</LD>
<LD>   This latest entry in UCLA's ambitious International Theatre
Festival manages to elevate Beach Boy Brian Wilson's low art a notch
and, with a wink and nudge, to trivialize Stein's high art about the
same small degree. Along the way, it finds much immediate pleasure in
the middle.</LD>
<TE>   The wink and nudge are the key, and are things Goebbels, a
composer and theater artist, does often, although he usually yanks
things more aggressively out of context. Few of his shows have been
seen in America, where he is best known on the fringes of avant-garde
classical music and progressive jazz.</TE>
<TE>   As a composer, he always has something up his sleeve; in his
intriguing "Suite for Sampler and Orchestra," from his show (and ECM
CD) "Surrogate Cities," his earnest aural urban soundscape combines
cantorial chant, hip-hop and Bach.</TE>
<TE>   Hashirigaki is a term from kabuki that means "running,"
"outlining," "writing fluidly," and the fluid 80-minute "Hashirigaki"
has the quality of an avant-garde running gag. It features Swedish,
French Canadian and Japanese actresses of three sizes (tall, average,
short) who come and go, determined but without purpose, amid striking
decor and garbed in smart, wacky costumes. When they stop moving,
they recite liquid, repetitive Stein texts or sing along with
rippling, sinuous Beach Boys instrumental tracks. Between the aural
and the visual, the show keeps moving.</TE>
<TE>   There are the ghosts of two Wilsons: Brian and Robert Wilson, the
latter the American theater artist who comes closest to Stein's
deadpan aesthetic, with its unspoken emotion, its revelatory
isolation of the commonplace. Goebbels' pace is faster than Robert
Wilson's, his stage images a bit less jolting, but still Klaus
Grunberg's set and vivid design, which include a luminous cyclorama,
are clearly influenced by Wilsonian brilliance. So are Florence von
Gerkan's merrily high-concept costumes, be they noisy, crinkly
jumpsuits or stylized hoop skirts.</TE>
<TE>   What Goebbels lifted from the other Wilson were session tracks
from "Pet Sounds," the version released a few years ago on an
excessive CD set that included instrumental backgrounds isolated from
the vocals.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the three actresses, bopping to the Beach Boys, replace the
distinctively flat sound of Gertrude Stein with cute, and
occasionally cutesy, nuances. But for a Steinian, it was a distinct
joy to hear an audience laugh in delight along with this wonderfully
inventive language.</TE>
<TE>   The women's accents added loopy interest, and the feats of memory,
especially from the tall Swede, Charlotte Engelkes, and the mid-sized
French Canadian, Marie Goyette, proved astounding.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is the Japanese connection. The third actress,
Yumiko Tanaka, an accomplished koto and shamisen player, is a
familiar figure in avant-garde Japanese music who every so often
shows up in American settings as well. For the first part of the
show, her Japanese folk-music insertions were interesting, no more or
less relevant than anything else.</TE>
<TE>   But if "Hashirigaki" has a progress, it is a surfing toward
apotheosis in the songs "God Only Knows," "Caroline No" and "Don't
Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)." The last is the cheery
conclusion, the three actresses singing and playing along to the
instrumental track, with Engelkes managing (not well but still
managing) a theremin accompaniment, and Tanaka adding a lovely line
on the bowed shamisen, while the sky behind darkens to an enveloping
deep blue. It's a Beach Boys moment unlike any other, inspirational
and beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   "Hashirigaki" repeats tonight at 8 and Sunday at 7 p.m., $15-$40,
Freud Playhouse, UCLA, (310) 825-2101.</TE>

not 1969. Also, economics prize winner Daniel Kahneman earned his

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis--A story in Section A on Thursday on Gov. Gray Davis'
military service during the Vietnam War erroneously identified a
location in that country as Long Ben. It should have said Long Binh.
The story also misstated the year of Davis' victory over Republican
Dan Lungren as 1988. It was 1998.</LD>

<LD>Airline tickets--An article in the Travel section on Sept. 29 said
that several airlines no longer allow travelers to apply unused,
nonrefundable tickets to new flights for up to one year. It should
have added that these tickets generally can be used after the booked
flight has departed as long as travelers cancel the reservation in
advance and rebook for a later date (subject to fees and
restrictions).</LD>

<HD>GE Meets Earnings Growth Forecast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. on Friday said third-quarter earnings rose 25%
as NBC television and the sale of its Internet commerce unit helped
offset sluggish plastics demand and weakness in its key aerospace and
power markets.</LD>
<LD>   GE executives said they expect solid growth next year but plan
aggressive cost cutting throughout the company. They said GE power
systems, whose business has slowed after a long boom cycle, faces
"dramatic restructuring."</LD>
<LD>   The maker of light bulbs, jet engines and appliances said it
earned $4.1 billion, or 41 cents a share, compared with $3.28
billion, or 33 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 11% to $32.6
billion.</LD>
<TE>   GE met Wall Street's third-quarter expectations, and the company
backed its earnings target of $1.65 per share for the year. That's up
20% from the $1.37 per share it earned in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman Jeffrey Immelt provided the first glimpse of GE's 2003
outlook. And Wall Street was glad to have it, as his remarks helped
propel a broad-based stock rally.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in a very tough environment, our short-cycle businesses will
experience good growth" in 2003, he said.</TE>
<TE>   GE recorded a one-time gain of $317 million from the sale of its
GXS Internet commerce business.</TE>
<TE>   Top-rated television shows at NBC, which capitalized on strong ad
pricing, boosted profits at that unit by 59%.</TE>
<TE>   But GE plastics saw growth stall in the third quarter,
contributing to a 19% profit decline at the unit.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, profit at GE's aircraft engine unit fell because key
commercial airline customers continue to struggle.</TE>
<TE>   GE shares rose $1.61, or 7.1%, to $24.21 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>State's Job Losses Offset Good News on Dip in Unemployment</HD>
<DH>Economy: Nearly 16,000 positions are lost in September,
reflecting a weak labor market, while the jobless rate declines to
6.3%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's unemployment rate dipped to 6.3% in September, but that
positive news was undercut by a drop in payroll employment that
economists said reflects the weak labor market.</LD>
<LD>   The unemployment rate, which is based on a survey of households,
fell from a revised 6.4% in August, the state Employment Development
Department reported Friday. A separate, larger survey of employers
showed a decline of 15,800 payroll jobs in California. That was the
biggest monthly decline this year, though economists said seasonal
factors related to education jobs probably played a role. The
manufacturing sector continued its slide in September, while retail
employment barely budged.</LD>
<LD>   What's clear, labor market analysts said, is that although the
economy continues to expand, it is growing too slowly to create much
employment. California has 53,500 fewer nonfarm payroll jobs than it
did in September 2001, while the nation is down nearly 1 million jobs
over the same period.</LD>
<TE>   "We're just looking at a very flat labor market right now," said
UCLA economist Tom Lieser. "Employers are reluctant to commit to new
hiring without firmer prospects for improved sales and
profitability.... So far, it's a jobless recovery."</TE>
<TE>   In September, the U.S. unemployment rate was 5.6%. That's down
slightly from 5.7% in August but up from 5% in September 2001. A year
ago, California's unemployment rate stood at 5.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the state's industry sectors saw employment gains in
September: services, which grew by a net 5,500 jobs; construction,
which added 1,800; and financial services, which posted a gain of
1,600 positions.</TE>
<TE>   The retail sector, which employs 2.6 million Californians, added
just 700 jobs in September.</TE>
<TE>   Temporary help agencies, considered a bellwether of future hiring,
added 4,500 jobs last month. Analysts have been keeping a close eye
on that sector because temps tend to be the first workers fired
during an economic downturn and among the first to be rehired during
a recovery. Compared with September 2001, the personnel supply sector
still is down 12,500 jobs. But it is slowly creeping back in 2002, up
5,400 jobs since the first of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good sign," said Howard Roth, chief economist for the
state Department of Finance. "It's the first step to hiring people"
for full-time positions.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, a separate analysis of California's travel and
tourism-related industries shows those sectors are bouncing back from
the shock of last year's terrorist attacks. Although hotels and
airlines still have fewer jobs than they did a year ago, the worst
losses appear to be over, said Michael Bernick, director of the EDD.
Meanwhile, bars, restaurants and amusement parks have all added jobs
over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the [travel and tourism] jobs we lost after Sept. 11
have come back," Bernick said.</TE>
<TE>   September's job gains were more than offset by declines in other
sectors, however, including a loss of 16,000 government jobs, most of
them at public schools. Education jobs are notoriously difficult to
adjust for the summer exodus and fall return of teachers.</TE>
<TE>   In August, for example, the state gained a revised 14,800 jobs,
led by gains in education. That kind of volatility makes analysts
cautious about reading too much into a single month's data.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing continued its losing streak in September. The sector
lost 3,500 jobs last month, its 19th decline in the last 20 months.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California continued to lead the state in job creation,
adding 46,700 positions in September. Over the last year, the region
has added a net 17,400 jobs contrasted with a loss of 78,100 in the
Bay Area, according to EDD data.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County's jobless rate fell to 6.4% in September, down
from 6.6% in August. Other Southern California counties showed
similar declines. Orange County's rate dipped to 4%, from 4.1% the
previous month. Ventura's September jobless rate fell to 5.7%, from
5.8%. San Bernardino's rate declined to 5.4%, from 5.6% in August.
Riverside dipped to 6.5%, from 6.6% the previous month. San Diego's
jobless rate eased to 4.1% in September, from 4.2% the previous
month.</TE>
<TE>   Among California counties, San Luis Obispo posted the lowest
September unemployment rate at 3.2%, while Imperial County logged the
highest at 22.1%.</TE>

<HD>Red-Hot Cooling-Off Period</HD>
<DH>Ports: Terminal operators are working around the clock to
clear the docks of a mountain of cargo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Jeffrey Burgin, the West Coast port lockout was the perfect
storm.</LD>
<LD>   It swept in two weeks ago and halted work at the four cargo
facilities run by Burgin for Pasha Stevedoring &amp; Terminals. Stranded
on Pasha's docks in the Port of Los Angeles were newsprint, hundreds
of containers packed with consumer goods and 100,000 tons of steel
bound for Fontana.</LD>
<LD>   Their towering cranes and forklifts idle, about all Pasha
employees could do for the 10-day port closure was catch up on e-mail
and clear their backlogs of paperwork.</LD>
<TE>   Not anymore. It's been 16-hour days for Burgin since the
management lockout of the ports ended Wednesday under a federal court
order.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, two rail locomotives were hauling away about a dozen
flat cars loaded with thick rolls of steel plate. The train screeched
and banged as it slowly pulled away from the Pasha terminal in
Wilmington.</TE>
<TE>   One unloaded vessel had departed, but six ships remained offshore
ready to deliver overdue cargo.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to wear several different hats down here," said Burgin,
a senior vice president for Pasha. "Today I am wearing a hat of
gratification for getting a vessel out. It's good to see movement and
action down here."</TE>
<TE>   Pasha, whose parent company is headquartered in the San Francisco
Bay Area, is one of almost 50 terminal operations in the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   With 137 acres in Los Angeles harbor, Pasha is small compared with
shipping giants such as APL and Maersk Sealand, which own cargo
vessels and terminals around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Since the lockout ended, Burgin has started his day shortly after
6 a.m., an hour or two earlier than normal.</TE>
<TE>   He talks to harbor officials and terminal operators to get an idea
how work is proceeding around the port.</TE>
<TE>   He also contacts customers, corporate headquarters and the Pacific
Maritime Assn., the industry trade group, for its take on the pace of
cargo operations.</TE>
<TE>   After 10:30 a.m., he helps to assess the terminal's need for
dockworkers and reviews financial statements and monthly cargo
volumes. In the afternoon, the routine repeats itself.</TE>
<TE>   If cargo is arriving, Burgin also oversees plans to unload
vessels.</TE>
<TE>   In the early evening, he says, he heads home to Huntington Beach,
his ear glued to his cell phone for work-related calls.</TE>
<TE>   But the pressure doesn't let up until about 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I can catch up on my e-mails and say hello to my family,"
said the 45-year-old Burgin, who has two daughters.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the departure of the unloaded cargo ship hardly dents
the backlog of work for Pasha.</TE>
<TE>   Six overdue vessels are stuck behind dozens of other vessels that
arrived before them during the lockout. No harbor pilots are
available to bring them in.</TE>
<TE>   Aboard are more than 300,000 tons of steel that could overwhelm
Pasha's terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Burgin and his staff are pushing trucking companies to pick up
their freight ASAP.</TE>
<TE>   Burgin says those efforts are succeeding, but other terminal
operators may not be so lucky.</TE>
<TE>   Although the ports are working around the clock, some customers
are taking cargo only during weekday business hours.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the veteran terminal manager is optimistic that his company
will be busy for the rest of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a Christmas after all," he said.</TE>

<HD>Retail Sales and Confidence Fall</HD>
<DH>Economy: Auto demand drops. Consumers retreat from spending
as stock losses mount.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. consumers stopped buying new cars at such a furious pace last
month, causing overall retail sales to fall by the largest fraction
in nearly a year, the Commerce Department reported Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Economic optimists sought to put the best face on the sales
decline, saying that such key determinants as income and interest
rates favor a continuation of the national spending spree.</LD>
<LD>   But most analysts said the drop may signal that consumers, who
have kept the economy afloat with spending, are finally retreating in
the face of steep stock losses, an uncertain job market and growing
fears about war and terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   "For the economy, the war is already here," said John E. Silvia,
chief economist with Wachovia Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The latest retail sales figures show consumers will buy only when
enticed by "the most generous of price incentives," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department said U.S. retail sales dropped 1.2% to
$302.46 billion in September, the steepest decline since November in
the aftermath of last year's terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding cars, retail sales rose 0.1% in September, after a 0.3%
gain in August, according to the department. But analysts said that
the increase was small and that the sales weakness during the month
extended well beyond the auto showroom to discounters, department
stores and furniture outlets.</TE>
<TE>   Auto sales sank 4.8% in September after rising wildly over the
summer. Analysts traced most of the decline to a decision by some
carmakers to end no-interest financing. On Thursday, General Motors
Corp. announced more come-ons: Besides no-interest financing, the
firm said buyers can purchase a car for no money down and no payment
for 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   Retail sales are an important bellwether because consumption
accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists have
lavished increasing attention on them because the consumer has been
one of the few bright spots.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers defied the odds and kept on buying in the two years
since the stock market began cratering. But there are growing signs
they are losing their will.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for the
first two weeks of October fell from 86.1 to 80.4, its lowest level
since September 1993. The index numbers suggest that people have
doubts about the immediate situation and conditions six months from
now.</TE>
<TE>   The index of current conditions fell from 95.8 to 92.8, and the
index of future expectations tumbled from 79.9 to 72.2. Analysts
believe the economy grew at a spirited 3.5% to 4% annual pace in the
third quarter because of strong consumer spending in July and August.
But most analysts predict that growth will slow to a 2.5% rate in the
current quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In another report Friday, the government said wholesale prices
barely rose in September, adding to evidence that inflation is absent
from the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department's producer price index inched up 0.1% last
month after an unchanged reading in August.</TE>
<TE>   The closely watched "core" PPI, which strips out volatile food and
energy costs, also rose 0.1% in September after a 0.1% drop. The
latest readings matched forecasts, and could slow more if consumers
cut back spending further.</TE>
<TE>   Reuters was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Lender to Refund Up to $484 Million in Settlement</HD>
<DH>Financing: Household International, accused of predatory
practices, would repay customers in more than 35 states, including
California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking to end charges of pervasive predatory lending, the parent
company of Household Finance and Beneficial Finance said Friday that
it will refund up to $484 million to customers--$87 million of it to
Californians--in a tentative settlement with state regulators.</LD>
<LD>   Household International Inc. also agreed to cap home-loan fees at
5%, disclose loan terms more fully, let borrowers pay off loans
without penalties after two years instead of three and hire "secret
shoppers" to police itself.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators from 19 states and the District of Columbia had accused
the Household units of pressuring borrowers into refinancing home
loans while the lender concealed heavy fees, high interest rates and
exorbitant prepayment penalties. Consumers often were trapped in
costly loans because of these practices, the states alleged.</LD>
<TE>   "Our compliance procedures and policies were not as good as we
thought," Household Chairman William F. Aldinger III said. "We could
have litigated, but the headline risk and the reputation risk would
have been worse."</TE>
<TE>   He said the Prospect Heights, Ill., company now hopes to be
regarded as a leader in best practices by lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the settlement was announced, however, the California
Department of Corporations questioned whether Household is fully
complying with a settlement of an earlier lawsuit accusing it of
overcharging customers on small loans.</TE>
<TE>   Household agreed in January to pay $8.9 million in penalties and
refund $3 million to California consumers. But Corporations
Commissioner Demetrios Boutris said Friday that regulators "are not
satisfied" the refunds have been made in full, suggesting he might
pursue another enforcement action.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's settlement does not mean that [California] gives up any
rights to ensure the refunds are paid," Boutris said.</TE>
<TE>   Household spokeswoman Megan Hayden said the company will honor its
pledge to refund the overcharges, which she said were inadvertent.</TE>
<TE>   The Household deal has a downside for the estimated 300,000
customers who may get refunds: To be paid, they must opt out of
private class-action lawsuits brought by consumer groups such as AARP
and the Assn. of Community Organizations for Reform Now, also known
as ACORN. Aldinger said he believes that those suits now can be
settled quickly and at little additional cost.</TE>
<TE>   ACORN spokeswoman Lisa Donner said her group is "very glad the
state attorneys general acted, and we see this as a very important
step. But it would take more work for Household to become a leader in
best practices."</TE>
<TE>   Donner noted that Citigroup had capped its loan fees at 3%.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in several states, including Oklahoma, Washington and
New York, took lead roles in pressuring Household into a settlement,
government officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The $484 million will be divided proportionately to each state's
share of Household real estate loans. California Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer said more than 35 states have agreed to the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Each state will determine how to distribute its funds from
Household. In California, the company agreed to deposit money in a
restitution fund to be distributed by the state Justice Department to
borrowers who can prove they were overcharged on home equity and
similar loans.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement announced Friday, which must be approved by the
individual states, is the largest settlement in a series of cases
involving allegations of hidden fees, high-pressure sales of costly
credit insurance and other abuses at lenders such as Household that
specialize in customers with poor or limited credit histories.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, New York's Citigroup Inc. agreed to pay $240 million
to end a Federal Trade Commission case involving a subprime lending
unit, while Irvine-based First Alliance Corp. finalized a $75-million
settlement with the FTC.</TE>
<TE>   Household executives said the fine will result in a $330-million
after-tax charge in the third quarter, and the policy changes will
slice $45 million from 2003 earnings, $90 million in 2004, and $135
million in 2005. The company reported a profit of $1.9 billion last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Household shares Friday rose $1.90 to $28.20 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>United Online to Buy BlueLight Service</HD>
<DH>Internet: $8.4-million bid for Kmart's online access
business and its 165,000 subscribers is seen as a bargain price.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENDA McCARTHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Low-cost Internet service provider United Online Inc. won the bidding
Friday for Kmart Corp.'s BlueLight.com Internet access business,
solidifying its hold on the market for cut-rate connections to the
Net.</LD>
<LD>   The $8.4-million bid amounts to a blue-light special for Westlake
Village-based United Online, operator of the NetZero and Juno brands,
one analyst said.</LD>
<LD>   "The deal seems like an intelligent move for United Online because
it represents a cheap way to grab 165,000 subscribers," said Fred
Moran, an analyst with Jefferies &amp; Co. in New York.</LD>
<TE>   The price, revealed in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Chicago, which is overseeing Kmart's Chapter 11 filing, works out to
about $50 per subscriber. That's far less than the going rate of
about $100 to $200 per ISP subscriber, Moran said.</TE>
<TE>   The key to United Online's growth is to retain customers and
capture new subscribers without overspending on marketing, and such a
reasonably priced purchase is the best way to feed earnings, he said.
Moran does not own shares in United Online, and his company does not
do business with it.</TE>
<TE>   United Online has about 3.1 million subscribers to its free
service and an additional 1.7 million customers who pay $9.95 a month
for an upgraded service. That's about half the price of offerings
from larger rivals AOL Timer Warner Inc.'s America Online and
Microsoft Corp.'s MSN.</TE>
<TE>   BlueLight.com subscribers, who pay $8.95 a month, would maintain
their e-mail addresses. They would boost the number of United
Online's paying customers by 10%.</TE>
<TE>   The sale is subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, which is
expected to consider the matter by the end of the month, Kmart said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of United Online rose 72 cents to $10.97 in Nasdaq trading
Friday. Kmart's shares rose 7 cents to 47 cents on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>K2 Says Its Chief Executive Resigned</HD>
<DH>Jobs: Richard Rodstein is replaced by the sports equipment
maker's chairman, Richard Heckmann, founder of U.S. Filter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sports equipment maker K2 Inc. said Friday that Chief Executive
Richard M. Rodstein resigned and is being replaced by Chairman
Richard J. Heckmann.</LD>
<LD>   Heckmann, 58, was founder and chief executive of U.S. Filter, the
nation's largest water-treatment company before it was acquired by
Vivendi for $6.2 billion in 1999. He joined K2's board that same year
and became chairman in April 2000.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview Friday afternoon, Heckmann compared the
opportunities at Los Angeles-based K2 to his experience with U.S.
Filter, which he founded in Palm Desert in 1990. U.S. Filter grew
rapidly by acquiring more than 200 water-related companies, including
Culligan Water Technologies.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to have an opportunity like we did in the 1990s with
U.S. Filter to really grow solid businesses," he said.</TE>
<TE>   K2 is well-known in the sports-equipment industry, with a stable
of brands that includes K2 and Ride snowboards, K2 skis, Shakespeare
fishing equipment and Stearns life jackets and other inflatable
devices. But in 2001, the company posted its first loss in at least
14 years of $7.7 million on an 11% decline in sales to $595 million.</TE>
<TE>   The $2.1-billion snow sports industry has been struggling. Last
winter, sales were down 4.8%, said John Stouffer, editor of
TransWorld Snowboarding Business magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Heckmann said K2 has considerable growth potential, which could be
realized by building the brands, beefing up management and perhaps
adding products or divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great collection of brands that over the last five years
hasn't grown at all," Heckmann said. "I'd like us to be more focused
on growth in the areas where it's very strong, which are the fishing
and all the outdoor recreational sports."</TE>
<TE>   After U.S. Filter was sold, Heckman spent a couple of years
golfing but ultimately missed the "fun of building companies," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to elaborate on Rodstein's departure except to say the
resignation "was a mutual agreement" between Rodstein, 47, and the
board.</TE>
<TE>   Rodstein, who will become a consultant to K2, could not be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Rodstein joined the company in 1983 and has held various executive
positions, including president and CEO, since 1996. Rodstein was
president and chief operating officer from 1990 to 1995.</TE>
<TE>   K2 also said that J. Wayne Merck, executive vice president, has
assumed the chief operating officer post.</TE>
<TE>   K2's stock closed Friday at $6.71, up 31 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange trading. The announcement was made after the market closed.</TE>

<HD>Wall Street Finally Posts an Up Week</HD>
<DH>Markets: The Dow gains 316 points for the day as investors
take heart in modestly positive signs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the stock market, happy days are here again. Two of them, anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks soared Friday for the second straight day, lifting major
indexes to their first weekly gains after six weeks of losses, as
investors focused on modestly positive signs for corporate profits
and shrugged off the latest lackluster economic news. The Dow Jones
industrials jumped 316 points, building on Thursday's 247-point
surge.</LD>
<LD>   But skeptics were quick to question whether the two-day burst of
buying marked a turning point in the 31-month-old bear market.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a show-me rally," said Philip Dow, equity strategist at
brokerage RBC Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis. "It may not be a two-day
wonder, but let's see what happens next week when earnings season
starts in earnest and companies offer their outlooks for the fourth
quarter and next year."</TE>
<TE>   As buyers snapped up stocks Friday, many abandoned government
bonds, which have served as a haven for investors spooked by war
fears and turmoil on Wall Street. The yield on the benchmark 10-year
Treasury note climbed to 3.80% from Thursday's close of 3.66%, its
biggest one-day jump since mid-August.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks lost steam late in the day but were rebounding at the
close. The Dow finished higher by 316.34 points, or 4.2%, to close at
7,850.29. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 31.40 points, or
3.9%, to 835.32, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 47.10
points, or 4.1%, to 1,210.46.</TE>
<TE>   Volume was heavy, with winners swamping losers by nearly 4 to 1 on
the New York Stock Exchange and by more than 2 to 1 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 both gained 4.3% while the
Nasdaq composite leaped 6.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Investors appeared unfazed Friday by more negative news about
retail sales, as well as a report that the University of Michigan's
U.S. consumer confidence index this month fell to a nine-year low.
They focused instead on a mixed earnings report from General Electric
and an analyst upgrade of IBM, the latter boosting tech stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, six weeks of losses left stocks primed for
at least a short-term bounce, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The market was getting dramatically oversold," said Jack Caffrey,
equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. In
Wednesday's trading on the NYSE, 604 stocks reached 52-week lows, he
noted, compared with 17 new highs--a sign that investors were
indiscriminately dumping holdings from their portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   Caffrey said investors were braced for Friday's soft economic
data, even though the numbers were worse than expected. Retail leader
Wal-Mart Stores had signaled that sales were sluggish, and consumer
sentiment surveys are often swayed by recent stock market activity,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers admit to being scared, but they continue to spend,"
Caffrey said.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart, which gained $2.19 to $53.83, and other retailers
rallied along with the broad market.</TE>
<TE>   So-called short covering added fuel to the two-day rally, analysts
said. Short sellers--who borrow stock and sell it, hoping prices will
fall so they can buy it back later and pocket the difference--often
scramble during rallies to close out their bets and limit their
losses. The number of shorted shares outstanding is near record
highs.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's earnings reports offered a measure of relief to
investors, as GE matched estimates and its stock rose $1.61 to
$24.21.</TE>
<TE>   But RBC Dain Rauscher's Dow argued that GE Chief Executive Jeffrey
Immelt "wasn't painting rainbows and bluebirds" in his outlook.</TE>
<TE>   When earnings season heats up next week, with a third of the
companies in the S&amp;P 500 reporting their results, analysts say
bellwethers such as Microsoft, Intel, Nokia, Motorola and EMC will be
closely watched. If CEOs continue to offer glum or murky guidance,
investors might unload stocks and quickly snuff the rally, Dow said.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of war with Iraq also could rein in shares, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   The market has staged several big one- and two-day rallies this
year, only to fall to new lows. Most recently, after gaining 4% on
Oct. 1, the S&amp;P 500 fell five of the next six sessions and landed at
a new 5 1/2-year low this week.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Tech stocks got a big boost after Lehman Bros. analyst Daniel
Niles upgraded IBM, saying information technology spending finally
may be poised to take a turn for the better. IBM climbed $6.34 to
$63.92. Among other tech names, Microsoft rose $2.49 to $48.87, Intel
rallied $1.04 to $15.22, Texas Instruments advanced $1.91 to $16.11,
and Yahoo gained $1.09 to $13.36.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks helped pace the day's gains, snapping back in
part because the sector had been among the "most oversold" recently,
Dow said. American Express gained $1.57 to $30.87, Citigroup rose
$1.83 to $30.40 and J.P. Morgan Chase added $1.24 to $17.19.</TE>
<TE>   * European markets followed the U.S. lead, with key indexes
zooming 7.2% in Germany, 5.2% in France and 4.7% in Britain.</TE>

backed-up West Coast ports, some shipping lines want to charge
customers a controversial "congestion" fee of up to $1,000 per
container.</LD>
<LD>   But the industry is divided over whether to raise rates,
particularly because it was the representatives of the Pacific-based
shipping lines and terminal operators that closed the ports for 10
days before they were reopened under a federal court order Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement, a group of European-based
shipping lines, announced this week that it was filing papers with
the Federal Maritime Commission to charge customers a congestion
surcharge of as much as $1,000 per 40-foot container. Under federal
law, carriers must file notice of rate increases 30 days before they
are imposed.</LD>
<TE>   That rate increase would affect only West Coast cargo headed for
Europe, a small portion of the traffic. Maersk Sealand, the biggest
member of the seven-member Trans-Atlantic group, said it would not
charge the congestion fee.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think this is the way to come across to customers that
have already felt a service impact and a financial impact," Maersk
spokesman Tom Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   The Transpacific Stabilization Agreement, which represents 14
leading Pacific carriers, is assessing its costs but has not decided
whether it will impose a similar fee, said Niels Erich, a spokesman
for the Oakland-based group.</TE>
<TE>   Shipping companies say they lost millions of dollars during the
lockout of union workers from the 29 West Coast ports. The labor
dispute left more than 200 ships stranded along the coast and tens of
thousands of containers jammed in the terminal yards, a backlog that
could take months to clear.</TE>
<TE>   The ports opened Wednesday night after a federal judge granted
President Bush's request for a temporary injunction under the
Taft-Hartley Act, launching an 80-day cooling-off period for both
sides.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and
terminal operators, ordered the lockout Sept. 29 in response to what
it said were slowdowns by the International Longshore and Warehouse
Union.</TE>
<TE>   PMA spokesman Steve Sugerman accused the union of not dispatching
to the terminals enough workers with the skills needed to handle the
complex cargo-handling equipment. "We are still seeing a sluggish
situation," he said. "We are trying to work with the union to get the
productivity numbers up."</TE>
<TE>   ILWU spokesman Steve Stallone said the PMA wasn't taking into
account the tremendous congestion on the docks caused by the buildup
of containers and a lack of truck chassis and rail cars to haul the
goods away. "It is just a nightmare out there," he said. "All these
containers are coming off the ships and there is nowhere for them to
go."</TE>
<TE>   At Pier 400 in Los Angeles, the largest shipping terminal in the
world, two outside truckers collided Friday with union-operated
vehicles because of a lack of visibility around the massive rows of
containers, Stallone said.</TE>

<HD>USC's B-School Closes In on UCLA's in Rankings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Richard Rodner, associate dean of the UCLA Anderson School, sat
down at his desk early Friday morning, it was hard not to cringe at
the report before him. It was BusinessWeek magazine's new rankings of
America's business schools, and UCLA--for many years in or very close
to the top 10--had fallen to a lowly No. 16.</LD>
<LD>   "We're frankly stunned," Rodner would say later in the day.</LD>
<LD>   Across town, Randolph Westerfield, dean of rival USC's Marshall
School of Business, was all smiles. During lunch, people were patting
him on the back. At his office, dozens of congratulatory e-mails were
pouring in from alumni and trustees, who only a few years ago were
ruing that their school didn't even make BusinessWeek's top 30. But
now, USC stood at UCLA's heels--at No. 17.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm feeling pretty good," Westerfield said, in obvious
understatement.</TE>
<TE>   For deans at business schools around the country, this week has
been as tense as finals week is for students, as they awaited the
release of BusinessWeek's biennial B-school rankings. Other
publications, including the Wall Street Journal, U.S. News &amp; World
Report and most recently the Economist, also put out rankings of MBA
programs.</TE>
<TE>   But many in academia and business say none carries as much weight
as BusinessWeek's, which has been in existence since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Coming in at No. 1 was Northwestern University's Kellogg School of
Management, with cross-town rival the University of Chicago, right
behind it. Rounding out the top five were Harvard, Stanford and the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.</TE>
<TE>   The rankings do matter--in recruiting students and to
employers--and are taken seriously, as the folks at UCLA will attest.
Anderson's dean, Bruce Willison, was unavailable Friday because he
was traveling in the Midwest to meet with corporate
recruiters--something that Rodner says they will have to do more of
in the wake of BusinessWeek's report.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's fall, from No. 12 two years ago, came because it got
low marks from recruiters. Rodner took comfort in the fact that
Anderson scored high on the two other categories that make up the
overall rankings: a survey from graduates and the so-called
intellectual capital of the school.</TE>
<TE>   And don't forget the Economist's MBA rankings, Rodner added. In
that poll, released Friday, UCLA came in at No. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, murmurings from Anderson alums could be heard from as far
away as New York. Tom Williams, who got his degree in 1995 and works
for investment banking firm Bear Stearns Cos., remembers distinctly
that Anderson ranked No. 9 when he was at the Westwood campus.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little suspect of why we could be slipping," he said,
asking like the finance major that he was, "Have they changed the
input variables as to what they're grading?" (BusinessWeek said its
criteria are the same.)</TE>
<TE>   Williams would not even talk about USC's Marshall School, which
for decades was seen as not being in the same league. In fact,
Marshall first made the cut in BusinessWeek's list in 1998, at No.
25. But mirroring the much-improved reputation and caliber of the
university's overall program in recent years, the Marshall School
vaulted seven notches on the list this year.</TE>
<TE>   One big reason: high marks from people such as Ray Orquiola,
recruiting manager for corporate banking at Wells Fargo &amp; Co., who
says Marshall provides great service to employers.</TE>
<TE>   "They provide us with the right campus intelligence on students.
They'll tell us the latest rage, who the best students are and how to
get connected to them," he said. "When we do campus interviews, it's
completely seamless. They even give us free lunch."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Rollo, Marshall class of 1970 and a trustee of the school,
could not help but take pleasure at USC's ascent and UCLA's drop.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm incredibly proud of what our school has done," he said,
adding with a laugh, "I would feel better if they were No. 17 and we
were No. 16."</TE>

<HD>Madster Lawyers Can't Withdraw, Judge Says</HD>

<LD>A federal judge has ordered lawyers for Madster, an online
file-sharing service formerly known as Aimster, to keep representing
their client at least until a preliminary injunction is in place
against the service.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Marvin E. Aspen ruled that record labels and
music publishers were likely to win their copyright infringement
lawsuit and granted a preliminary injunction against Madster on Sept.
4. Since then, the two sides have been arguing over its terms. The
labels and publishers submitted a proposed injunction Sept. 11 that
would require Madster to block users from downloading copyrighted
songs--a requirement that could cripple Madster by driving away its
users. Shortly after, the two law firms representing Madster sought
to withdraw from the case.</LD>
<LD>   Aspen denied their request and gave the lawyers until Oct. 16 to
respond to the labels' proposal.</LD>

<LD>   Lucent Technologies Inc. said it would report a
wider-than-expected quarterly loss, cut 10,000 more jobs and take $4
billion in charges, prompting fears that the struggling
telecommunications equipment maker could run out of cash before it
turns itself around.</LD>
<TE>   Lucent now expects a loss of as much as 65 cents a share in its
just-ended fiscal fourth quarter. On Sept. 13, it forecast a loss of
45 cents.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts were more concerned about Lucent's dwindling cash
pile, which it said would fall to $2 billion by the end of fiscal
2003 from $4.4 billion at the end of June 2002. The company expects
revenue to decline 20% next year.</TE>

<LD>   Longs Drug Stores Corp. said net income this fiscal quarter would
rise less than expected and may drop next quarter because of slowing
sales.</LD>
<TE>   Income in its third quarter ending Oct. 31 will be 7 cents to 11
cents a share, compared with 7 cents in the year-earlier period,
Longs said. The Walnut Creek, Calif.-based company had forecast a
profit of as much as 16 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Shoppers bought fewer over-the-counter drugs, greeting cards and
cosmetics last month, leading Longs to reduce its fourth-quarter
forecast to 51 cents to 56 cents, compared with last year's 57 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Longs fell $1.44, or 6.4%, to $20.95 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>   The U.S. Copyright Office refused to suspend the requirement that
over-the-air radio stations pay royalties to labels and artists for
the songs they broadcast over the Internet. As a consequence,
stations that simulcast on the Web will have to pay four years' worth
of back royalties Oct. 20.</LD>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Broadcasters and seven major radio chains
have challenged the royalties requirement in court, and they sought
the suspension because their appeal still is pending. But the
Copyright Office ruled that the broadcasters were unlikely to win
their appeal or suffer irreparable harm if they paid the royalties,
which amount to $92 per listener per year for all-music stations.</TE>
<TE>   The House of Representatives passed a bill Monday to cut the
royalties owed by small companies that broadcast music on the Net,
but none of the seven chains is likely to qualify for that relief.
The bill is pending in the Senate.</TE>

<HD>Regulators Question SBC's Layoff Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State regulators Friday challenged SBC Communications Inc.'s plan to
cut 3,000 jobs in California and called for an investigation into the
layoffs to make sure they don't hurt customer service at its SBC
Pacific Bell unit, the state's largest phone company.</LD>
<LD>   Two commissioners on the state's Public Utilities Commission said
their ears pricked up when an SBC PacBell spokeswoman said the
company's work force reduction would degrade service for its more
than 10 million customers. On Sept. 27, San Antonio-based SBC
announced plans to cut 11,000 workers from its payroll, including
about 6% of the jobs in California.</LD>
<LD>   The regulators also said the layoffs are unjustified given SBC
PacBell's profits.</LD>
<TE>   "We are quite concerned about that," PUC Commissioner Carl Wood
said. "We feel that the information available at this point shows
that SBC Pacific Bell is financially strong, and as a result no
layoffs are in fact warranted."</TE>
<TE>   Wood said he and PUC President Loretta Lynch would ask the
commission to approve an investigation of the matter at its Oct. 24
meeting. The commission cannot prevent SBC from carrying out its
planned layoffs, but it can levy millions of dollars in fines if it
determines that those layoffs degrade customer service.</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell spokesman John Britton questioned the need for any
commission action. He called the commissioners' characterization of
the layoff's effects "an extreme exaggeration."</TE>
<TE>   "We expect no impact on customer service at this time from the
recently announced position reductions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioners' action stems from a comment made by Lora Watts,
SBC PacBell's president of external affairs.</TE>
<TE>   When the layoffs were announced last month, she complained to
reporters that onerous regulations were hurting the company's
business. Then she added: "We will try to maintain our customer
service levels, but we face some difficult decisions that could
someday have an impact on our service."</TE>
<TE>   For the last several months, SBC has been a vocal critic of state
regulations that set wholesale rates for its services. SBC says the
rates, which vary by state, are too low.</TE>
<TE>   The wholesale rates represent the prices rival carriers must pay
to incumbent phone companies such as SBC PacBell to use copper lines
and certain other pieces of their network and provide competitive
offerings to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   In California, those rates originally were set so high that few
companies stepped forward to compete with SBC PacBell, which still
controls more than 90% of home phone lines in its region. The PUC
substantially lowered those rates in May, but a permanent pricing
structure still is under review.</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell had operating income in California totaling $3.5
billion in 2001, up from $2.9 billion the year before, according to
audited financial statements produced for the commission by SBC
PacBell. The PUC said the company has earned profits well above the
level considered a "healthy return" by previous commissions.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not seen any evidence in California that regulation is
causing SBC PacBell financial hardship," Commissioners Wood and Lynch
wrote in a letter they sent Friday to SBC Chairman Edward E. Whitacre
Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The letter also reminded Whitacre that SBC PacBell remains a
regulated utility and is required to provide high-quality service to
its customers. "That obligation is not excused if SBC Pacific Bell
does not meet a desired earnings target," the commissioners said.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioners warned that the agency would not hesitate "to
seek appropriate remedies" from the company, including fines, if the
mandated service levels are not maintained.</TE>
<TE>   Wood and others said they are worried that SBC may be cutting back
at the California phone company because of troubles in some of its
other regions. SBC serves customers in 13 states from Michigan to
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "SBC PacBell is clearly earning a healthy profit in California,"
said Regina Costa, telecommunications director at the Utility Reform
Network, a San Francisco-based consumer group. "This is the first
time this state has really had to tackle the problem that you have
with a multi-state telephone company, which can play states off each
other."</TE>

<HD>Advanced Tissue Woes a Blow to Industry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The business of regenerative medicine was dealt another blow this
week with the collapse of Advanced Tissue Sciences Inc. of San Diego,
a pioneering firm that sold a replacement skin for burn victims and
diabetics.</LD>
<LD>   The firm's bankruptcy filing Thursday came two weeks after rival
Organogenesis Inc. of Boston sought bankruptcy protection from its
creditors. Analysts said the back-to-back business failures serve as
a reality check in an industry that promises to use living cells to
build replacement bladders, livers and other organs.</LD>
<LD>   The bioengineered-skin products, though a scientific achievement,
were a hard sell in the current cost-conscious environment. An
eight-week regimen of Advanced Tissue's Dermagraft replacement skin
costs $4,000. Sold for the stubborn leg and foot sores of advanced
diabetes, it competed against the standard treatment of antiseptics
and bandages.</LD>
<TE>   Company spokesman Abe Wischnia said Friday that no major health
insurance company has yet agreed to pay for the product, which
received Food and Drug Administration approval last October. As a
result, sales of the product will fall short of its modest sales goal
of $3 million to $4 million for 2002, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The products show that it is technically feasible to make
organs," said Fariba Ghodsian, a biotechnology analyst with Roth
Capital Partners in Los Angeles. "How the market responds depends on
cost and other factors."</TE>
<TE>   A sour investment environment for biotechnology companies in
general also contributed to Advanced Tissue's woes. It planned to
sell 10 million shares to raise additional capital, but the terms it
received from underwriters were not acceptable, Wischnia said.</TE>
<TE>   After the company's rival, Organogenesis, closed its doors last
month, the financial markets dried up for Advanced Tissue, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other segments of the regenerative-medicine business have been
affected by the cooler investment climate. Geron Corp., a Menlo Park
company that works with embryonic stem cells, reduced its research
operations this year to conserve cash.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced Tissue, which went public in 1988, used cells from the
foreskins of circumcised newborns to make its skin products. Grown on
mesh frames, the skin substitute was sold in the form of thumb-sized
patches and could be frozen and stored for up to six months.</TE>
<TE>   By the company's estimate, the market for Dermagraft was
substantial. From 750,000 to 1 million diabetics suffer from chronic
leg and foot sores that, if unchecked, can lead to amputation. Among
the firm's investors are the Wisconsin State Investment Board, which
owns 19.7% of the company. Its marketing partner, British medical
device firm Smith &amp; Nephew, owns 7.1% of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Smith &amp; Nephew is seeking Bankruptcy Court permission to buy
Advanced Tissue's skin-replacement business for $12 million--$10
million in cash and $2 million in assumption of debt. It provided
Advanced Tissue with $5 million in financing to keep the company
going until the court could review its offer.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Dermagraft, Advanced Tissue markets a separate
skin-replacement product for patients with second-degree burns that
has been sold since 1997 but is not yet successful.</TE>
<TE>   The skin-replacement products were Advanced Tissue's first
products but not its most ambitious attempts to use
tissue-engineering technology. The company, with $20 million in
backing from Medtronic Inc., another medical-device firm, was
developing a "heart patch" to spur growth of new tissue and blood
vessels in patients with heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced Tissue was in the early phase of a collaboration with the
University of Washington on engineering a replacement heart, a
years-long project that would first involve working in animals.</TE>
<TE>   The company's outside directors are reviewing Advanced Tissue's
business and will decide whether the firm should continue or close
down, Wischnia said.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced Tissue lost $16.3 million for the first six months of
this year on revenue of $10 million. Its shares closed Friday down 69
cents, or 90%, to 8 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Smokeless-Tobacco Suit Settled</HD>
<DH>Courts: UST breaks ranks with cigarette makers, which have
never settled an individual claim.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Smokeless-tobacco giant UST Inc. has settled a lawsuit by a former
customer who contracted tongue cancer, in what appears to be the
first case of a tobacco firm agreeing to pay an individual for
injuries allegedly caused by its products.</LD>
<LD>   UST, of Greenwich, Conn., confirmed Friday that it had reached an
unspecified "resolution" with Florida resident Michael L. McMullin,
29, whose lawsuit was set for trial in Jacksonville on Oct. 21.</LD>
<LD>   Cigarette manufacturers have never settled a case with an
individual smoker, knowing that it would invite thousands of new
claims.</LD>
<TE>   But analysts said UST did not face as great a risk in breaking
ranks with the cigarette makers. They said the firm's litigation
exposure is much less because there are many more smokers than
smokeless users and because the incidence of lung cancer, heart
disease and other smoking-related ailments is greater than the risk
of oral cancer from smokeless-tobacco use.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts said it could encourage additional lawsuits
against UST. Bonnie Herzog, tobacco analyst for Salomon Smith Barney,
called it a "settlement in disguise."</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with analysts Friday, UST executives said
they did not expect their decision to touch off a wave of filings.
"If we believed there was a substantial pool of plaintiffs out there,
then I think we might have come to a different decision," said UST
Chairman and Chief Executive Vincent A. Gierer Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the company was squeamish about using the "S" word
("settlement") to explain what had transpired. In their remarks to
analysts and in a news release, company executives avoided the term
"settlement," using words such as "outcome" and "resolution" instead.
They would not reveal the amount or confirm that McMullin got a dime.</TE>
<TE>   "This outcome provides for payment of attorneys' fees and other
expenses," said Richard H. Verheij, general counsel and executive
vice president of UST.</TE>
<TE>   Norwood S. "Woody" Wilner, attorney for McMullin, said he was
barred by a confidentiality agreement from outlining the terms. But
Wilner noted that under Florida law, lawyers get a maximum of 40% of
any settlement or verdict, indicating that McMullin will get a
payment.</TE>
<TE>   According to evidence in the case, McMullin first tried snuff in
1990, when a teammate on his high school baseball team offered him a
dip of UST's Copenhagen brand. Later, he became a regular user of
Copenhagen and Skoal, another UST brand.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1998, he was diagnosed with cancer of the tongue and
underwent radiation treatments and surgery to remove a portion of it.
According to Wilner, he since has been cancer-free.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, cigarette manufacturers have faced more than 1,000
individual claims, along with massive lawsuits by state attorneys
general and class actions on behalf of smokers and health insurance
funds.</TE>
<TE>   But since the early 1950s, only about 50 claims have been filed
against smokeless-tobacco companies, UST executives said. They said a
few claims are pending against them in West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   The last trial of a smokeless case was in 1986, when a federal
court jury in Oklahoma City found UST not liable for the death of
19-year-old Sean Marsee.</TE>
<TE>   Marsee, a track athlete who began dipping snuff at age 12,
contracted cancer of the tongue that spread to his lymph nodes and
jaw. He died in 1984.</TE>

<HD>Campuses Awash in Junk Foods</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At the high school where I teach, the day begins with the sound of
semi trucks offloading tons of junk food for the daily consumption of
our students. Miles away in Sacramento, academic standards are forged
and pounded into the curriculum of our underperforming schools. It
occurs to many of us who work in the trenches that those pictures
ought to be linked.</LD>
<LD>   Some districts (most recently Los Angeles Unified) have banned
soda machines from their campuses. It's a good start. No question
that our students are getting fatter and more lethargic. Young teens
are wolfing down mass quantities of junk food--not just before and
after school but between classes, at lunch and at "nutrition break."
Common sense and nutritional standards have given way to the laws of
supply and demand.</LD>
<LD>   Obesity has become our nation's No. 1 health problem. Yet our
schools, rather than working to combat that trend, have become a
major contributor to it.</LD>
<TE>   My district, like so many others, has negotiated long-term
contracts with the soda and chips and candy companies. We get money
for our choral program, for athletic equipment and for art supplies
while companies like Coke and Pepsi and Frito-Lay get to put their
machines in virtually every corner of our campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Lunch, for a good number of our students, now consists of two bags
of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, a Coke and a Snickers bar.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago there were five of these machines at our school.
Now we have more than 20. Every month or so another one is delivered,
always after hours.</TE>
<TE>   Despite recent findings of clogged arteries and high cholesterol
levels in 15-year-olds and despite studies linking the early onset of
diabetes, heart disease and osteoporosis with teen diets that consist
mainly of sugar, salt and fat, the deals are struck. The money is too
good to pass up. The vendors seek a new generation of customers and
have no interest in the harm their products do to young people.
School districts are desperate to fund programs. As long as they get
the computers and the (extra large) band uniforms, the junk food
companies get to continue mining the youthful mother lode. Everyone
wins!</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who have a front-row seat see it differently. We deal
daily with lethargy and diminished attention spans and conjure a
correlation between a morning and afternoon regimen of chips and Coke
and gum and candy and doughnuts and a lack of mental exertion.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, a landmark report called "A Nation at Risk" addressed the
mediocrity that had crept into education. "We have, in effect, been
committing an act of unthinking, unilateral educational disarmament,"
it asserted, adding that if a foreign country had done this, it would
have been interpreted as an act of war.</TE>
<TE>   This time the enemy is corporate greed and its allies in
financially strapped school districts, as well as an indifferent
public and unwatchful parents. Given the scope of this invasion and
the fact that children are specifically targeted, strong leadership
in high places is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Will our physically fit president be persuaded to move against the
soda-chips-candy axis? Or will he be true to his belief in everyone's
unfettered right to make a buck? Will any of these profit-driven
vendors--corporate giants all--be willing to lead an exodus from our
nation's schools, realizing that the business of America is seeing to
its future generations as well as its current economy?</TE>

<HD>A Civics Lesson That Stands the Test of Time</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Convincing young soon-to-be-voters that civic involvement is
important was tough during the Vietnam era, and it's still a problem.
In the 2000 election, some votes didn't count and the new president
failed to receive a popular majority, which encouraged apathy and
cynicism. A low turnout is predicted in California on Nov. 5, with
the two major-party candidates for governor generating no sparks.
Counteracting a negative mind-set is not easy.</LD>
<LD>   In 1969, my senior students received some civic first aid that
still resonates. I had written to several legislators asking for
words of wisdom about civic involvement for my apathetic seniors, who
had been bombarded with Vietnam, the draft and the Martin Luther King
Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy assassinations. A three-page letter from
Sen. Alan Cranston helped turn the classroom tide toward concern and
fragile optimism. Some of the words of the late senator are offered
here in hopes they might encourage today's students, who face the
possibility of war.</LD>
<LD>   Oct. 14, 1969</LD>
<TE>   Dear Mrs. Pendleton:</TE>
<TE>   I share your concern about apathy in our young people and
understand the underlying causes. Just this week, President Nixon
said "under no circumstances" will he be affected by the Oct. 15 War
Moratorium. I'm sure your students wonder how a movement including
hundreds of thousands of people can fail to have any bearing on the
president's decisions.</TE>
<TE>   We should not give up, but fight all the harder to bring about
change. It appears to be more than a coincidence that since the
recent surge of public favor toward the moratorium, the president has
retired [Selective Service Director] Gen. [Lewis B.] Hershey,
announced the possibility of further troop withdrawals, and felt the
necessity to explain our position in Vietnam on nationwide TV. Public
opinion can and does have an effect on government officials.</TE>
<TE>   The current wave of demonstrations has an effect on the policies
of a number of officials. So too do letters from constituents. I
encourage students to write to me, and to all their representatives,
whenever they have an opinion they think an official should be made
aware of. Although letters are not as dramatic a form of protest as
demonstrations, they can have a profound effect.</TE>
<TE>   My own office is an example. We receive a minimum of 500 letters a
day and these are answered within two weeks. On important issues of
the day: Vietnam, Santa Barbara oil spill, tax reform, the draft, I
maintain a mail analysis.</TE>
<TE>   This enables me to see how my constituents are thinking. These
views are always considered when I make important decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Most officials go into major issues with a predetermined position.
But seldom does a person have such strong convictions that cannot be
swayed in the face of rising common sense and opinion.</TE>
<TE>   If your students feel a particular official is not representing
their views, they should deluge that person with as many letters and
petitions as they can turn out. Eventually, the senator, governor or
whatever is going to realize there are certain stands that must be
taken if the elected official is to truly represent his constituents.</TE>
<TE>   I hope I have alleviated some qualms your students have about
participating in the government of this country. There is obviously
much that needs to be done to make this country live up to the ideals
which the founding fathers set down in the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution. If your students feel that this is
true, then let them bring pressure upon their officials to convince
them too.</TE>
<TE>   Sincerely,</TE>
<TE>   Alan Cranston, U.S. Senate</TE>

<HD>Afghans' Long Road Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One year after the United States forced the Taliban from power in
Afghanistan, reconstruction of the shattered nation is proceeding
slowly. U.S. military civil affairs units have done good work to
build schools, dig wells and clear canals full of rubble. So
President Bush was right to say on Friday that the nation has
"entered a new era of hope." But major projects like building
highways to connect the main cities remain stalled, and the central
government is having trouble outmaneuvering warlords and extending
its writ to all corners of the land. So that hope is fragile.</LD>
<LD>   We agree with aid workers' complaints that too much money is going
to firms for the design of massive projects such as dams and power
plants. More, they say, should be spent on actual construction of
roads, houses and schools. And foreign donors should channel much of
that money through the central government of President Hamid Karzai
rather than through nongovernmental organizations. Afghans need to
see Karzai's government employing people to make the bricks, build
the scaffolding and mix the cement for new structures.</LD>
<TE>   Now warlords are paying their followers more than the government
can afford. That has bolstered fiefdoms ruled by many of the same men
who battled among themselves for years and caused such chaos that
Afghans at first applauded the Taliban for ending the violence and
imposing order. The more entrenched the warlords become, the less
Karzai's government can impose its will, the greater the chances that
civil war will again break out.</TE>
<TE>   The warlords' influence could be diminished if countries stationed
their international peacekeeping troops in cities other than Kabul,
the capital. Foreign soldiers could shield villagers from extortion
by tribal thugs and reassure them they will be safe when they clear
their land and plant crops. The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee has urged the Bush administration to push allied nations to
send peacekeepers to such cities as Kandahar and Herat.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan also needs money to rebuild its institutions. It has
established commissions to deal with human rights, a new constitution
and the judiciary--necessities for the long-term stability of a
nation torn apart by the Soviet invasion of 1979 and subsequent
warfare.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say about 65% of the nearly $2 billion that foreign
donor nations promised to Afghanistan for this year has been spent or
is in the pipeline to be spent on future projects. Washington should
push countries that have lagged in fulfilling their pledges to come
up with the other 35%. After the moujahedeen defeated the Soviets,
most nations forgot about Afghanistan. The Taliban and Al Qaeda did
not. The world should not forget the country again.</TE>

<LD>Poor besotted Pluto--the planet, not Mickey's dog.</LD>
<LD>   In case you haven't paid close attention to the distant reaches of
our corner of space, after 72 years of distinction as the outermost
planet in our solar system, that lumbering hunk of ice and rock that
hasn't completed one single solar orbit since the American Revolution
may not be a planet anymore. Not that such a decision down here would
alter the minus-400-degree temperature out there. But a growing
number of experts are facing the reality of advancing technology and
the new discoveries it delivers. They're tentatively suggesting to
Pluto's ardent supporters that just maybe, perhaps, Pluto with a
1,413-mile diameter is really just a large object.</LD>
<LD>   What?! you say. When you memorized the planets in school, there
were nine starting with Mercury and ending with Pluto, the
second-funniest planetary name. What's changed? And who on Earth
presumes to appoint themselves Official Namers of Heavenly Bodies
That Have Been Around Even Longer Than Bob Hope?</LD>
<TE>   They're not making new planets and moons. We're finding them. And
the debate about re-categorizing something nearly 4 billion miles
away (that's 32 million trips between L.A. and San Diego) is a
revealing measure of changes close to home. When Clyde Tombaugh's eye
became the first to look upon Pluto in 1930, from Arizona, the world
was still pretty darned excited about a little airplane from St.
Louis flying all the way across the Atlantic Ocean. Today, humans
orbit Earth, dispatch off-road robots to roam other worlds and peer
through computerized telescopes at places and things once only
hypothesized.</TE>
<TE>   They find that good old Pluto is barely two-thirds the size of
Earth's moon. It's mainly frozen methane, more of a comet, to be
blunt. And anyway, Pluto's not alone way out there--at least 600
other large objects, maybe even 60,000, orbit in the same
neighborhood. This week scientists announced finding another beyond
Pluto. Named Quaoar, it takes 288 Earth years to circle the sun once.
Now, that's a trip. Quaoar (KWA-wahr) is named for a god, like
Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto (a.k.a. Hades) and
Uranus, Saturn's dad. Tradition dictates using gods' names; with
mounting discoveries, they'll need a lot of them.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, astronomers pick these sacred-space monikers to show
off their intelligence, and then a special International Astronomical
Union committee approves them. "We have a lot of fun with this
stuff," admits Brian Marsden, a union director whose mother did not
name him for anyone in particular but always said she'd have called
him Daphne had he been a she.</TE>

<LD>American political consultants are obsessed with controlling their
candidates' messages. In an era of calculated, focus-group-inspired
political discourse, these smooth political operators believe that
the fewer issues a politician is known to care about, the fewer
interest groups will be upset.</LD>
<LD>   Project Vote Smart, a national nonprofit, nonpartisan
organization, is trying to cut the doubletalk. The group got its
start during the 1992 elections, with founding board members that
included Newt Gingrich, George McGovern and Michael Dukakis. The
group sends out surveys to tens of thousands of national and state
candidates, asking them to go on the record on a range of issues both
controversial and forgotten, from abortion to affirmative action,
from online voting to bus subsidies.</LD>
<LD>   All that information, including recent responses from candidates
in California's gubernatorial, congressional, state Assembly and
Senate races in November, is posted on the organization's
unsophisticated but jam-packed Web site, www.vote-smart.org. Use the
hyphen. Click on the "candidates" button, then scroll down to the
third starred paragraph and click on California. For help, call (888)
VOTE-SMART (868-3762).</LD>
<TE>   An online political information bank was of limited use in
reaching voters even two years ago. But as of April, more than 165
million Americans were wired, up from about 124 million in February
2000, according to Nielsen Net Ratings. Users' level of
cyber-sophistication is higher.</TE>
<TE>   Vote Smart's online database finally has the potential to
inexpensively reach a majority of voters awash in misleading
political advertising. The group's Web site provides issue briefs,
voting records and concrete policy positions for even the most
low-profile state Assembly races, promoting issue-oriented campaigns
and a better-informed electorate.</TE>
<TE>   Voters can find out what their congressional candidates think
about school vouchers and the estate tax, even if those turn out not
to be big campaign issues. They will be better able to gauge who is
influenced by which fat campaign checks when a questionnaire comes
back with the AFL-CIO's party line in the free-trade section, or
positions on gun control copied from the National Rifle Assn.
handbook.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps as important as the candidates' responses, though, is who
completes the surveys. Gov. Gray Davis didn't, and his GOP
challenger, Bill Simon Jr., did, for instance. Favored incumbents
often figure the less said the better.</TE>
<TE>   Check out the Web site to see which candidates in your district
have the guts to provide the public with a record of policy positions
to live up to and which bend to the political consultants who
unapologetically control their campaign message.</TE>

<LD>I want to thank The Times for running the six-part series on Enrique
(Sept. 29-Oct. 7). I have eagerly looked forward to each installment
and appreciate the great writing by Sonia Nazario and the excellent
photography by Don Bartletti. I was moved and touched by the
harrowing experiences of Enrique and so many others who seek to find
a better life. I expected other readers to be equally moved. The
harsh letters to the editor have shocked me. What a contrast to the
poor people in Veracruz who barely have enough to survive but still
have the compassion to run out to the migrants and offer them food
and warm clothing. These people understand that Enrique and the other
immigrants are human beings, regardless of their legal status.</LD>

<TE>   I write to commend The Times for the extraordinary series
"Enrique's Journey." This poignant story reveals the yearning of
Enrique to find his mother, Lourdes, in El Norte and portrays the
incredible risks and dangers he undertakes to be reunited with her.</TE>
<TE>   But the series also highlights the desperate struggles and perils
that thousands of poor people endure to find basic economic survival.
It is tragic that woefully inadequate economic development in poorer
countries such as Mexico and in Central America force so many
Lourdeses and Enriques to leave their homeland in search of decent
work. Until these countries are able to develop decent
infrastructures, living-wage jobs and a host of educational and
health-care opportunities, the poorest will place their lives at risk
by finding their way to El Norte.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years I have met many thousands of Lourdeses and Enriques
here in Southern California, and I have the highest regard for their
dedication, hard work and contributions to our overall economic
success. They labor in our agricultural fields, they clean the hotel
and motel rooms, they work in most restaurants and catering firms
here, they sew our clothes, they look after children, they serve as
our gardeners and they undertake many low-paying jobs so that the
rest of us can have a decent standard of living--all the while paying
their share of taxes. They deserve our gratitude, not our scorn.</TE>
<TE>   These hard-working families work two and three minimum-wage jobs
to make ends meet, and they do so without complaint. I am proud of
them, their commitment to family values and their determination to
make our community a place of opportunity for all.</TE>

<TE>   As an immigrant myself I feel I have some right to respond to your
unabashed support for the violation of this nation's right to
maintain our borders. My family and I left our country 40 years ago,
fleeing political repression and a newly installed communist
government. It still took my parents almost a year to get the legal
paperwork so that we could leave and make a new life here in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   I fully support legal immigration, as it is an American tradition,
not this rushing of our borders by anyone who decides he or she wants
to live here. Your series is a blatant attempt to tug at the
heartstrings of your readers with touching, politically correct
articles condoning the violation of our laws. As our public hospitals
and schools continue to be overrun with people who are here
illegally, it may someday soon dawn on us all as taxpayers that we
have had enough!</TE>

<TE>   I read the letters on Enrique (Oct. 7) and I am upset. It seems as
if the readers who condemn illegal immigrants are always looking for
scapegoats for their economic problems. It seems as if all these
readers are quick to blame illegal immigrants for all the problems of
poverty, clean drinking water, electricity, etc. Come on!</TE>
<TE>   How do illegal immigrants affect your drinking water and
electricity bills? I am sure those same readers are quick to be
hypocrites and would use or have used the services of illegal
immigrants in the past. Either using a nanny or paying a couple of
dollars to have them paint, mow or clean up yards.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone deserves a chance at freedom and the good things that
come with it. We are here to make a living, not to make your water
and electric bills higher. I should know, I was an illegal immigrant
myself at one point and can relate to Enrique's story.</TE>

<TE>   The INS has recently informed me that it will take about 2 1/2
years for me to bring my wife to this country. Could part of the
reason for the length of this process be the amount of time they must
squander on dealing with illegal aliens? Why has The Times found it
necessary to publish a how-to guide (complete with colorful maps,
helpful hints on avoiding police and detailed descriptions of
landmarks) for criminals? Thanks a lot, L.A. Times.</TE>

<TE>   The amount of time, effort and space that you spent on presenting
Enrique's travels was impressive. It would be nice if you could
expend the same resources to provide an in-depth article on the
effects of illegal aliens on California's housing, schools, health
care, crime, economy, taxes, etc. That would really be impressive and
a lot more germane to most Californians.</TE>

<HD>How to Reorganize City Government</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was comforting to read Joel Fox's Oct. 3 commentary, "Secession: A
Tale of New Cities," and to realize that L.A. secession proponents
understand that upward regional consolidation is just as important to
achieving better, more responsive and accountable government
representation as is the current one-sided effort to delegate local
authority downward to neighborhood, borough and smaller-city
councils. Today, we are most disenfranchised at the multi-county,
regional and individual neighborhood levels.</LD>
<LD>   Fox acknowledges the view that archaic county governments should
combine under a comprehensive regional government that is capable of
providing necessary regionwide services and of dealing with issues
that are too big for any one city or county. He foresees a future
regional government ballot initiative. Indeed, further
fractionalization at the city level would benefit from the existence
of a unifying regional government with an elected parliament or
assembly. To many, L.A. is more than a city; it is also an idea,
perhaps an ideal. And, to the world, our whole region will always be
L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Robert M. Beard</LD>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I believe that Fox has greatly oversimplified the current
situation. His premise about "reorganizing government to make it more
responsive to citizens' needs" implies that there is a government in
place to be reorganized. Not so in the current situation. From what I
have read, the new city government would be made up primarily of
people who have had no previous experience at city government and
would require on-the-job learning. Given the seemingly constant
disarray in which the Valley secessionist movement seems to find
itself, I see no reason to believe that the new city government would
be any different.</TE>
<TE>   There are those who might say that it cannot get any worse. I
wouldn't want to bet on it.</TE>

<TE>   An otherwise interesting and well-written story on Proposition
13's parallels with secession, "Secessionists Taking Their Cues From
Past" (Oct. 4) is marred by the statement that businesses supported
Proposition 13 with contributions "because many were big property
owners with money at stake."</TE>
<TE>   The corporate business community overwhelmingly opposed
Proposition 13 and bankrolled the campaign against it. Business
leaders feared that if average property owners received tax relief,
the Legislature would target them to make up the difference.</TE>

<LD>Re "Cheers Greet Ahmanson Critics at Rally," Oct. 6: Why don't
opponents of the Ahmanson Ranch project address the real and pressing
need for housing? My rent expense is one-third of my income, I am
unable to come up with enough of a down payment to buy a house and I
am only one of thousands in that position. I look around me and I see
these beautiful mountains and these pristine areas and I appreciate
them, but where is the balance?</LD>
<LD>   I don't believe Westlake Village, Agoura Hills or Thousand Oaks
would ever have been built had the developers been responsible for
traffic, but they are symbols of communities that leave plenty of
open space and still serve the housing needs of the people.</LD>
<LD>   Prices are artificially high, and while we claim to be concerned
for the needs of recent immigrant arrivals, we make it impossible for
them to rent affordable, decent housing and impossible to share the
American dream.</LD>
<TE>   I am suspicious of the true motivation of the celebrities who
voice their uninformed opinions against this project. It would seem
that their liberal leanings should be re-examined for the hypocrisy
that this view really is.</TE>

<LD>Re "Young Brains Shaped by Abuse," Opinion, Oct. 6: Deborah Blum's
analysis of the lingering impact of child abuse, as illustrated by
the horrendous behavior of Martha Toogood's mother on Sept. 13,
affirmed my belief that some of the damage inflicted on children
simply cannot be undone. In this case, I have no reason to believe
that Madelyne Toogood will not continue to victimize her child. When
the woman made her appearances on every media outlet that would give
her a forum, she submitted that she had made "a mistake" and wasn't a
monster.</LD>
<LD>   No, dear Mrs. T--a mistake is when you write the wrong date on a
check. Unless and until you understand that what you did was wrong,
harmful and inexcusable and requires professional intervention, your
little girl doesn't have a chance to grow up without the emotional
scars that will last a lifetime.</LD>
<LD>   As Blum points out, she will love you because you're the only
mother she has, but that love will be undeserved as long as you call
your abusive behavior "a mistake."</LD>
<TE>   Barbara H. Bergen</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Blum is right that Martha Toogood was being shockingly abused by
her mother and probably needed to be placed in foster care. However,
her wish is naive that Martha has now been given "a break from home"
and can now have "a chance for some silly, happy moments." Any child,
abused or not, is traumatized by being wrenched away from all that
she knows. As psychologist Harry Harlow's research shows, children
long to be with their parents, even when their parents are abusive.
Many foster parents are loving and kind. Yet the additional havoc
such placement wreaks in the psyche of a child cannot be ignored.</TE>

<LD>The conclusions of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority study
reported in "Study Helps Carpool Lanes Get Go-Ahead" (Oct. 7) do not
justify wasting more money on carpool lanes.</LD>
<LD>   The study concluded that the special lanes cut travel time for
most carpoolers. This is an extremely weak conclusion; carpool lanes
cause more congestion and increase the average commute time for all
freeway users. Increased accidents and more smog should be expected
from greater congestion.</LD>
<LD>   The study concluded that ride-sharing was encouraged by the
carpool lanes. This is obvious, but Robert W. Poole of the Reason
Public Policy Institute points out in "Time to Rethink Carpool Lanes"
that, based on the latest census figures, carpooling is a flop.
Quoting from Poole's paper: "Despite the expenditure of billions of
dollars adding carpool lanes to congested freeways, carpooling
declined from 13.4% of work trips in 1990 to 11.2% in 2000."</LD>
<TE>   The MTA study concludes that the carpool lanes help reduce smog.
This is a vague and ambiguous statement. The study said that carpool
lanes are supported by a vast majority of the public. To find out if
carpool lanes are supported by a majority, we should have an election
to vote on an initiative to convert all carpool lanes to general
purpose lanes.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Traffic Jams Prompt Amber Alert Shut-off in L.A.," Oct. 5: I
too suffer through the slowdowns on the 405 caused by Amber alerts.
There is a simple solution: Move the electronic signs from areas that
would otherwise have relatively free-flowing traffic, like the
northbound climb up the Sepulveda Pass, and place them in areas where
the traffic routinely backs up, like right before the Sunset
Boulevard overpass.</TE>

<TE>   I have often wondered why nobody has suggested broadening the
interchanges ("More Freeway Lanes, Transit Spending Urged," Oct. 2).
Please note the old saying that you can't squeeze a square peg into a
round hole. It seems pretty obvious that the congestion problems on
most freeways are not that there are not enough lanes but that the
transitional points into the subsequent freeways do not contain
enough lanes to handle and sustain the volume of traffic.</TE>
<TE>   I loathe driving the 134 by the 405 or 101/170--east or west--and
the 405 by the 10--north or south at any time, even during off-peak
hours--wondering how long it will take to get through the
interchanges with the congestion that starts one to three miles
before one gets to them. Instead of adding more lanes and ripping out
homes, creating havoc in the communities, broaden the interchanges to
allow smoother transitions. Currently we have a funnel effect from
broad to narrow. Nobody seems to listen: "It's the interchanges,
stupid!"</TE>

<LD>Leo Braudy ("A Sense of Place," Opinion, Oct. 6) rightly suggests we
should get to know the dispersed histories and eccentricities of the
sites of our expansive city. But he also perpetuates the myth that "a
tour of the monuments" gives the visitor an understanding of older
cities. Maybe. But if I had an extra hour next time in Rome I would
bicycle or take the subway to the Garbatella neighborhood most tours
to the pyramid and San Paolo fuori le Mura never show you and mingle
with people for whom those monuments are only a backdrop and who
rarely go into the historic center.</LD>
<LD>   Asking "what do they know of L.A.?" Braudy suggests visitors to
the Getty, the new cathedral and the Disney Hall are somehow frozen
out of local history. In time all monuments, even new ones, take on
artistic or historical meaning. Who is to say that the Getty is not
already the most vibrant urban space in Los Angeles, a place to take
foreign guests to observe local ways?</LD>
<LD>   The sprawl identified with L.A. as compared with New York only
pertains to a view of New York City from Manhattan or Brooklyn. Ask
anyone who commutes from Far Rockaway to Orchard Beach, or who takes
a car and then the ferry from Staten Island to a set of subway rides
and a bus across the George Washington Bridge to a job in New Jersey
and he or she will tell you New York is spread out.</LD>
<TE>   Having returned to L.A. two years ago after a year in "the city"
and then three years in the bucolic village of Nyack, N.Y., commuting
into the Bronx, I can assure Braudy that the New York I loved as a
young man 20 years ago when my life was circumscribed by the
then-distant Morningside Heights and Greenwich Village is no longer
the mythic haunt of the "stroller of the boulevards" and that L.A. is
not "resolutely enigmatic." There is history here and distance there.</TE>

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was gratified to see that Braudy included Simon Rodia's Watts
Towers in L.A.'s "scattering of riches." Watts Towers is a treasure
that deserves more attention and appreciation than it gets. People
come from all over the world to see Watts Towers, it being included
on many foreign tourists' must-see lists, and yet most of the people
of L.A. haven't taken the time to visit. Is it that some people are
afraid to travel to that part of town? I encourage Angelenos to take
the time to see this magnificent testament to one man's vision and
ability to make a difference.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Why is Steve Lopez so angry with Bill Bratton? Ever since Bratton's
appointment to chief of the L.A. Police Department, Lopez has written
scathing reviews of his persona. "Bratton Has More Than First and
Last Words on the LAPD" (Oct. 6) criticized him for speaking quickly.
Lopez may be a clever writer, mimicking Bratton's fast talk in his
column by omitting commas, but his criticisms of Bratton seem petty.</LD>
<LD>   If Bratton can help decrease the crime rate in L.A. as quickly as
he did in New York City, then I say who cares if he talks fast and
hobnobs with the Hollywood elite?</LD>
<LD>   Melody Lin</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I keep reading that the new LAPD chief has an enormous ego and is
a world-class publicity hound. I have followed his career over the
years, and I believe that this is unfair criticism of Chief Patton,
er, Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Murtaugh</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. is probably the most difficult city to police in the
industrialized world. If Bratton is to succeed, he must be able to
hire and retain top cops. He can't do this by offering a starting
salary of as little as $44,537 a year. Police salaries must be raised
dramatically. The nominal cost to property owners would be more than
offset by graffiti abatement alone. Everyone benefits from safer
streets, especially business owners.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to move beyond ancient grievances and do something
tangible to make L.A. a better city.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Broz</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's not a question of Bratton succeeding, it's a question of the
LAPD and Los Angeles succeeding. He's one person and will try to
introduce some strategies that worked in New York City. The city must
give him a chance and, more important, the men and women of the LAPD
must be open-minded to his ideas. If the strategies and policies are
successful, the LAPD and residents will be the beneficiaries.</TE>

<HD>How Many Will Die in War?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "How Many Sons and Daughters Will Die?" Commentary, Oct. 6:
Arianna Huffington is so right on target. I wonder how people would
answer the question of how many American body bags they are willing
to accept for the removal of Saddam Hussein. How many sons, husbands,
fathers are they willing to sacrifice to remove Hussein? How many
dead, innocent Iraqi civilians are an acceptable amount to get rid of
Hussein? When people are polled, they should be asked about numbers,
not just about whether should we go and get him.</LD>
<LD>   How many middle-class, comfortable Americans are ready to
sacrifice their lives to take on Hussein? Or are they just willing to
send our troops as sacrificial lambs to their slaughter?</LD>
<LD>   Benny Wasserman</LD>
<TE>   La Palma</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once again Huffington comes right to the point and hits the nail
on the head. Before the American people decide whether or not to
support a war on Iraq, we should be given a realistic estimate of how
many American lives might be lost. This should include not only
casualties among the military but also the estimated number of U.S.
civilians who might die if a desperate Hussein, defeated, captured,
with nothing to lose, issues an order to his allies and supporters to
let loose with every lethal weapon available.</TE>
<TE>   So far I have seen no such figures. We should face the possibility
of the worst scenario imaginable before we make such a momentous
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Louise D. Lillard</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It sounds as though Huffington makes more of a case for an
invasion of Iraq. Let's review her commentary: Hussein is willing to
use biological weapons if the U.S. invades Iraq, the casualty count
could be high and the administration has not advised the citizenry of
this. Hussein also refuses to let U.N. weapon inspectors adequately
check for biological and nuclear weaponry, he's lobbed Scud missiles
into Israel and set fire to vast oil fields while we defended Kuwait,
and he has used poison gas to kill his own people.</TE>
<TE>   So, Huffington makes a point that it's important to gauge
consequences, and I agree, but there are costs to safety and freedom.
If Hussein is so dangerous, what is the world supposed to
do--nothing? Unfortunately, her inability to take a stand on someone
who is so obviously dangerous to the safety of the free world makes
me thankful that we have an administration that will take that stand.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Belluomini</TE>
<TE>   Hawthorne</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Huffington wonders why reporters have not questioned Bush about
how many American soldiers might come back in body bags from his war
on Iraq. This is another reason why our president finds plenty of
time for fund-raising appearances in front of cheering fans but
avoids open press conferences where he might be confronted with tough
questions from skeptical reporters.</TE>
<TE>   June Maguire</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Re Huffington's column: It took Mark Twain but seven words as he
paraphrased Benjamin Disraeli, saying, "There are lies, damn lies and
statistics." And I do believe that was right after he said, "Reader,
suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress.
But I repeat myself."</TE>

<HD>Ben Eastman, 91; Olympic Medalist Held 6 World Records for
Running</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ben Eastman, who once held world records in six middle distance
running events and won a silver medal at the 1932 Olympics, has died.
He was 91.</LD>
<LD>   Eastman died of pneumonia Sunday at his home in Hotchkiss, Colo.,
family members said.</LD>
<LD>   Eastman's speed earned him the nickname "Blazin' Ben." While at
Stanford University in the early 1930s, he set world records for the
440-yard, 400-meter, 800-yard, 800-meter, 500-yard and 600-yard runs.
His record of 46.4 seconds in the 440 went unbroken for more than 40
years.</LD>
<TE>   Sportswriters credited him as the man who changed the quarter-mile
and half-mile from distance races to sprints.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his success, Eastman finished second in the 400 meters at
the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles to fellow American William Carr, who
had a world-record time of 46.2 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Eastman was born in San Francisco and grew up in nearby
Burlingame. He and his brother, prone to colds as children, were kept
out of physical education classes by their parents.</TE>
<TE>   But the two sneaked into gym classes, which were requirements for
joining the high school track team. They then persuaded their parents
to allow them to continue running. The family doctor consented, and
Eastman's track career began.</TE>
<TE>   After the Olympics, Eastman graduated from Stanford with a degree
in economics. He worked for a diesel engine company in San Francisco,
Seattle and New York. In the late 1950s, Eastman and his family moved
from California to Colorado to grow fruit, using a kit from the Sears
catalog to set up his orchard. He was a success in the fruit business
and was later appointed to the Colorado Agriculture Commission,
serving for 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   Eastman is survived by his wife, three sons, seven grandchildren
and four great-grandchildren.</TE>

<CX>   Track record -- An obituary in the Oct. 12 California section on
Olympic medalist Ben Eastman incorrectly stated that his record of
46.4 seconds in the 440-yard run, set in the early 1930s, went
unbroken for more than 40 years. It was broken in 1947.</CX>

<LD>Keith Uncapher, who founded USC's Information Sciences Institute,
died Thursday of a heart attack. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Uncapher conducted or supervised pioneering work on a number of
issues central to the development of the Internet, both at the Rand
Corp. in Santa Monica and at the USC institute, which he began in
1972 with a staff of three.</LD>
<LD>   At Rand, Uncapher worked on "packet-switching," a system for
breaking down digital messages into parts and reassembling them at
their destination. Later, at USC, institute researchers worked on the
development of the Internet's system for domain names, the hierarchy
of locations that includes .com, .net and .org.</LD>
<TE>   "Keith Uncapher was a brilliant pioneer whose work advanced, not
only USC and its School of Engineering, but the whole field of
computers," said USC President Steven Sample.</TE>
<TE>   Uncapher led the institute in Marina del Rey for 14 years as it
emerged as a significant contributor to many of the Internet's
building blocks, much of it with funding from the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Uncapher co-founded the nonprofit Corporation for
National Research Initiatives, based in Reston, Va.</TE>
<TE>   A Denver native, Uncapher earned a bachelor's degree in electrical
engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and served four years in the
U.S. Navy in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   He was chairman of computer science advisory boards at Stanford
University and Carnegie Mellon University, and was elected to the
National Academy of Engineering in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   His awards include the U.S. Air Force's Decoration for Exceptional
Civilian Service.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Doris, and two sons, William and
Jeffrey.</TE>

<HD>Mary Maxine Reed, 93; Won Landmark Ruling Against Gender
Bias</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mary Maxine Reed, who won a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case in 1971
that voided any law that establishes an arbitrary preference for men
over women, died of undisclosed causes Sept. 26 near Boise, Idaho.
She was believed to be 93.</LD>
<LD>   The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that an Idaho law that
automatically gave Reed's former husband preference over her as
administrator of their dead son's estate, solely because he was a
man, violated the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection
under the law.</LD>
<LD>   The court called the Idaho law "the very kind of arbitrary
legislative choice forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause."</LD>
<TE>   The Nebraska-born Reed married her husband, Cecil, in 1931. After
they were divorced in 1958, Reed earned a living ironing, baking and
taking care of disabled people in her home in Boise.</TE>
<TE>   Their 16-year-old son, Richard, shot himself in 1967. When Reed
applied to administer their son's small estate, she learned that,
according to Idaho law, when two people are equally qualified to be
administrators, preference must be given to a man. Angered that
"women could be stepped on like that," Reed went to court.</TE>

<HD>Bernard Ridder Jr., 85; Led Newspaper Merger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bernard H. Ridder Jr., the former publisher of the St. Paul Pioneer
Press who helped create Knight Ridder, the nation's second-largest
newspaper group, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Ridder, known as "Bernie," who died Thursday of complications from
a stroke in San Mateo, Calif., was a key architect of the merger of
the Knight and Ridder newspaper groups. The merged entity now
operates 32 daily papers with a combined circulation of nearly 4
million.</LD>
<LD>   A sports enthusiast, Ridder also helped to establish the Vikings
professional football team in Minnesota.</LD>
<TE>   Bernard Ridder was born and grew up in New York City, where the
family newspaper business started more than 125 years ago. He
attended Princeton University.</TE>
<TE>   After Navy service in World War II, Ridder became an advertising
director of the Duluth Herald and the Duluth News Tribune (which
merged in 1982) and was named publisher in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   He was then named publisher in 1958 of the St. Paul Pioneer Press
and the St. Paul Dispatch (which merged in 1985).</TE>
<TE>   He held publisher positions in both cities until 1971 and was
president and chief executive of Ridder Publications when it merged
with the Knight group in 1974. He sat on the board of the new firm
and was chairman of the board from 1979 to 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Ridder was a member of several golf clubs and once served on the
executive committee of the U.S. Golf Assn.</TE>
<TE>   His enthusiasm for sports got Ridder Newspapers involved as one of
five owners of the Minnesota Vikings in 1961. The partners bought the
NFL franchise for $600,000, with Ridder Newspapers owning about a
third of the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Ridder served as chairman of the team's board from 1961 to 1977,
when the newspaper group's interest in the team was sold.</TE>
<TE>   Ridder is survived by his wife, Jane; sons P. Anthony "Tony"
Ridder, chairman and chief executive of San Jose-based Knight Ridder,
and Peter Ridder, publisher of Knight Ridder's Charlotte Observer in
North Carolina; daughters Laura Evans of Grosse Pointe, Mich., and
Robin Lee and Jill Delano Ridder of Northern California; nine
grandchildren; and 19 great-grandchildren. He is also survived by a
brother, Daniel, of Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Leak May Mean Jail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who leaked documents that led the Los Angeles Police Department
to reform the way it disciplines officers prone to domestic violence
should not be sent to jail for his actions, his lawyers urged a
federal appeals court Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Sending Robert Mullally, 58, to prison for 60 days for violating a
judge's protective order would be a miscarriage of justice because he
acted to protect women and children for no personal gain, his
attorney, James Weinstein, told a panel of judges from the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals.</LD>
<LD>   In 1997, Mullally gave a television reporter copies of LAPD
documents that showed the department had failed to discipline
officers who beat and in some cases raped their wives and
girlfriends. He had access to the documents because he was an expert
witness hired by a lawyer who had sued the LAPD. The documents were
covered by a court order that prohibited making them public.</LD>
<TE>   Mullally could become the first person ever sent to jail in the
United States for violating a protective order in a civil lawsuit,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   His appeal comes at a time of increasing controversy over the use
of judicial orders sealing court files containing data on the dangers
of cigarettes and automobile tires, and information on child sex
abuse committed by priests.</TE>
<TE>   Mullally had been hired by an attorney representing the family of
Melba Ramos, who was murdered by her estranged husband, LAPD Officer
Victor Ramos. Ramos killed her boyfriend and then himself.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleged that the LAPD had engaged in a pattern and
practice of civil rights violations by ignoring complaints of
domestic violence by its officers.</TE>
<TE>   Before trial, the LAPD agreed to turn over to Gregory A. Yates,
the Ramos family lawyer, papers documenting incidents of domestic
violence by officers and how the department had responded. No
officers were identified.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Magistrate Carolyn Turchin signed a protective order,
drawn up by lawyers in the case, ordering that none of the documents
be made public before trial, or after, without the judge's approval.
The LAPD agreed to settle the federal wrongful-death case for $2.2
million.</TE>
<TE>   Mullally, who had reviewed the personnel records of 79 officers
involved in domestic abuse, was disappointed that there would not be
an airing of the records at a trial.</TE>
<TE>   The files showed that more than 70 police officers had been
accused of beating or raping their wives and girlfriends. The records
showed none had been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Mullally turned the material over to Harvey Levin, a reporter with
KCBS-TV Channel 2, whose report led to a major investigation by
Katherine Mader, the Police Department's inspector general.</TE>
<TE>   Mader's July 1997 report found that officers accused of domestic
violence usually received little discipline and were rarely
prosecuted. Mader found that one officer was reprimanded for raping
his girlfriend and another received a 10-day suspension after
breaking his wife's nose.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the LAPD formed a special unit to deal with domestic
violence perpetrated by its officers, and within seven months half a
dozen had been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   But then-Police Chief Bernard C. Parks complained to the
California Bar Assn. about the release of the documents. Eventually,
U.S. District Judge William D. Keller ordered the U.S. attorney's
office to investigate how the documents became public.</TE>
<TE>   Mullally admitted in interviews that he had been the source and
was later convicted of criminal contempt of court by Keller.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office recommended probation, saying that a
jail term would be "extreme."</TE>
<TE>   But Keller, who was appointed to the federal bench by President
Reagan and had been the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles during the
administration of President Nixon, said mere probation would be a
"toothless tiger."</TE>
<TE>   In March 2001, he sentenced Mullally to 60 days but stayed the
sentence pending appeal. Moreover, Keller said that but for
mitigating circumstance, he would have sentenced Mullally to the
maximum term of six months.</TE>
<TE>   The sentence was condemned by the Feminist Majority Foundation and
the National Center for Women and Policing. The groups pointed out
that Mullally would be punished more severely than most of the
officers whose conduct he had helped disclose.</TE>
<TE>   "Mullally acted to protect women and children because officials
charged with their protection had abdicated that duty and had
themselves become the threat," the groups argued.</TE>
<TE>   At Friday's oral argument, Mullally's attorneys, Weinstein and
co-counsel James B. LeBow, argued that the order was ambiguous, that
it violated the 1st Amendment and federal rules of civil procedure,
and that a 60-day sentence was "plainly unreasonable."</TE>
<TE>   At least two of the 9th Circuit judges--M. Margaret McKeown and
Pamela A. Rymer--indicated they were troubled by the prospect of lack
of consequences for violators of court orders.</TE>
<TE>   If Mullally suffered no consequence, McKeown said, the court would
be saying, in effect, that an individual could violate a protective
order if he decided it was in the public interest.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not the kind of rule we can adopt," McKeown said.</TE>
<TE>   When Weinstein said that not even the government could cite a case
in which someone had been sent to jail for violating a protective
order, Rymer responded: "If there's contempt, the statute gives the
judge discretion" to impose a jail term.</TE>
<TE>   McKeown said she felt the protective order had been "pretty poorly
drafted" and that that might have an impact on what the punishment
should be.</TE>

<HD>Pastor of Megachurch Making Equally Big Splash With Book</HD>
<DH>Media: In Lake Forest, Rick Warren started "The
Purpose-Driven Life" as a sermon series. The launch is a kind of
virtual Sunday school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Warren, a superstar pastor in the megachurch movement, will kick
off one of the most ambitious book promotions in Christian publishing
history today by beaming via satellite a sermon based on his book to
an estimated 500,000 people in 1,500 churches worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign for the book, "The Purpose-Driven Life," is called
"40 Days of Purpose" and is meant to be a 21st century form of Sunday
school for Christian adults who are fuzzy on the fundamentals of
living a God-centered life. And it's only the latest entrepreneurial
move by Warren, head of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, Warren has earned international recognition by
training more than 250,000 pastors from 125 countries, launching the
pastors.com Web site for those in ministry, and signing up 60,000
pastors for a free e-mail newsletter called Rick Warren's Ministry
Toolbox.</LD>
<TE>   Advance sales for the book, an outgrowth of a sermon series Warren
has given at Saddleback for three years, topped more than 500,000
copies before the book hit retailers Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The book's publisher, Zondervan, said the figure is the second
highest in company history, after Billy Graham's autobiography "Just
As I Am," which was co-published with Harper Collins in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The early flood of sales stems from Warren's popularity among
evangelical Christians and a carefully planned and expensive book
launch designed to get the faithful reading a chapter daily for the
next 40 days.</TE>
<TE>   Pastors across the nation--and at 52 churches in Los Angeles and
Orange counties--will gear their next six Sunday messages to the
book's material, with sermon outlines provided by Warren.</TE>
<TE>   They'll have access through the Internet to videos of Warren's
services built around "The Purpose-Driven Life" theme at Saddleback,
which started two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   A national marketing campaign takes in all forms of media, secular
and Christian. And a CD, "Songs for a Purpose-Driven Life," features
recordings by popular Christian artists.</TE>
<TE>   "The [promotion] budget for 'The Purpose-Driven Life' is two to
three times more than any book we'll publish this year," said Greg
Stielstra, associate marketing director for trade books. He declined
to provide figures.</TE>
<TE>   Warren said his book answers three of life's most basic riddles.
The question of existence: "Why am I alive?" The question of
significance: "Does my life matter?" And the question of intention:
"What is my purpose?"</TE>
<TE>   Scott L. Thumma, who studies the megachurch movement at the
Hartford Institute for Religious Research in Connecticut, said Warren
has created an evangelical teaching program dealing with the basic
tenets of faith for those drawn to "seeker-friendly" churches.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a contemporary rendering of confirmation and catechism
classes," Thumma said. "But it's slick, user-friendly and
media-savvy.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never been a curriculum that the whole entire adult
congregation was going to go through at the same time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Warren has made books more affordable to churches by waiving his
royalties for those sales. The pastor bought 25,000 books for his
church, which started in 1980 with two families and now averages
crowds of 16,000 for weekend services. And book industry experts say
that by concentrating on pre-release sales, Warren sacrificed, at
least initially, a spot on best-seller lists because only retail
sales are counted.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect that Rick Warren is less intent on selling the books
than he is on this commitment that people need to do this remedial
study or deepening of the faith," Thumma said.</TE>
<TE>   The new book is the follow-up to Warren's seminal book, "The
Purpose-Driven Church," a pastor's blueprint for a spiritually
healthy church, which has sold 1 million copies and been translated
into 20 languages. It was also listed in "100 Christian Books that
Changed the 20th Century," by William and Randy Petersen.</TE>
<TE>   But Warren says "The Purpose-Driven Life," written for a much
wider audience of nonbelievers, new-believers and the spiritually
mature, is his most important work.</TE>
<TE>   "I often wept as I wrote this book because I believe so deeply in
the life-changing truth of it," said Warren, a 48-year-old husband
with three children and a beagle. "If I had been smarter, I would
have written 'The Purpose-Driven Life' first."</TE>
<TE>   Warren said evidence already shows the positive effects of the
book's materials. The first test program was rolled out in 1999 at
Saddleback Church. He said there were dramatic increases in baptisms,
church membership, daily Bible reading and small-group study. A
broader pilot program "quietly tested" last year at 50 churches
produced similar results.</TE>
<TE>   "These churches were of all sizes, shapes, denominations, ethnic
background and locations," Warren said. "And they were blown away by
the new life and focus that the program brought to their
congregations."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the "40 Days of Purpose" campaign, attendance at
Saddleback in the last three weeks has increased 3,000 for weekend
services.</TE>
<TE>   "What I am most excited about is the 25,000 we have meeting in
homes in 2,400 small groups" to study the material in depth, Warren
said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Flippin, the senior pastor of 300-member Blue Ridge
Christian Fellowship in Galax, Va., has spent $3,500 on copies of
Warren's book and $15,000 more to market the "40 Days of Purpose"
campaign. He took out five billboards near the church, had novelty
key chains made and placed ads in local papers.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that strongly that will change their lives," Flippin
said. "Just to be part of this is exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Like others going through the program, Flippin's congregants will
memorize a weekly Bible verse, meet in small groups and spend 15
minutes daily on devotional readings.</TE>
<TE>   The next campaign is set for spring. Already, more than 500 U.S.
churches and 300 churches in England are on the waiting list, Warren
said.</TE>

<HD>Bratton Confirmed as LAPD Chief</HD>
<DH>Police: Council members overwhelmingly express confidence
in the former New York police commissioner. He will be sworn in Oct.
28.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William J. Bratton, a former Boston street cop who went on to become
one of the best known law enforcement executives in the country, was
confirmed Friday as the 54th chief of the Los Angeles Police
Department.</LD>
<LD>   With only one voting against Mayor James K. Hahn's nominee, the
City Council overwhelmingly expressed confidence in Bratton's promise
to reform the LAPD and make Los Angeles the safest big city in
America.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton will be sworn in as chief in a public ceremony Oct. 28.</LD>
<TE>   Council members, including some who previously lobbied Hahn to
select an LAPD insider for the job, said they had been impressed by
Bratton's take-charge attitude. During their two-hour hearing that
produced a 14-1 vote, council members repeatedly praised him for his
knowledge of policing and his vision for the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "This department will be my last police department that I will
have the opportunity to work with and lead," Bratton, 55, told the
council. "I would like to see it as the capstone of my career that I
participate in what it once was and certainly will be again: the most
professional, successful and caring--and I emphasize caring--police
department in this country. All of this is achievable."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn selected Bratton after interviewing the Police Commission's
top three choices for the job. Also up for the position were Oxnard
Police Chief Art Lopez and former Philadelphia Police Commissioner
John Timoney, who was second in command under Bratton at the New York
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great day for the city of Los Angeles, a great day for our
neighborhoods," said Hahn, adding that he was gratified by the
"overwhelming" council support.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of work to do," Hahn said. "We do have to rein in
crime in this city--especially violent crime and gang-related crime.
We have to work on improving morale of the Police Department,
improving recruitment and slowing down our attrition. We have to
finish the job of reform. We have to make sure we have a real
partnership between the community and the Police Department."</TE>
<TE>   Although Latino members of the council initially expressed
disappointment that Hahn had not picked Lopez, they all voted in
favor of Bratton's appointment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The council also approved Bratton's salary of $239,039 annually,
with an additional $9,000 for moving expenses and a $2,900-a-month
housing allowance, for six months. He is being appointed to a
five-year term.</TE>
<TE>   "In no way am I going to impede your confirmation," Councilman
Nick Pacheco told Bratton. "But my support is reserved. I need to see
results."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said he decided to support Bratton
after discussing the matter with some of his key advisors, including
attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and former Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "They both gave him high marks," Ridley-Thomas said. "They said
[Bratton] is someone who will be a good choice for the city of Los
Angeles. I felt encouraged by their input. I have to hope that he
does well, but I want to immediately say that he cannot do it alone."</TE>
<TE>   Others said they believed that Bratton--an eloquent public speaker
with the savvy of a polished chief executive--is perfect for the job.</TE>
<TE>   "His autobiography is entitled 'Turnaround,' and I hope that when
he leaves Los Angeles in several years, he'll be able to write a book
called 'Turnaround, Part Two,' " said Councilman Jack Weiss, a former
federal prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   Council President Alex Padilla added: "I know that today we are
writing a new chapter in Los Angeles' history, and the history of the
Los Angeles Police Department."</TE>
<TE>   During the lengthy council questioning, Bratton vowed to tackle
the city's gang problem and other serious crimes by decentralizing
the LAPD and giving more authority and accountability to the
department's 18 division commanders.</TE>
<TE>   After the vote, Bratton said at a news conference that many
high-level commanders and deputy chiefs soon would be leaving the
department, allowing him to move officers from within the LAPD to
higher positions.</TE>
<TE>   "The bulk of the talent that will move this organization forward
are within the LAPD," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Cmdr. Jim McDonnell, one of 13 semifinalists for the
chief's position, would play a key role in the transition, setting up
interviews for higher positions and helping restructure the
deployment of various department resources.</TE>
<TE>   Several times during his presentation to the council, Bratton
received applause from the audience, which included police union
members, Los Angeles Urban League director John Mack and community
activist Sweet Alice Harris.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm persuaded that Mr. Bratton possesses the outstanding
leadership qualities that will be necessary to transform the Los
Angeles Police Department into an institution that is going to serve
all the citizens," Mack said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton needed only eight of the 15 council members to gain
approval. Councilman Nate Holden, the lone dissenter, was expected to
vote against Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   At several points during the council session, Holden accused
Bratton of allowing the NYPD to engage in racial profiling as a means
of lowering crime.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot in good conscience approve Mr. Bratton for this position
without a thorough questioning of his past performance," Holden said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who was warned before the meeting about Holden's
legendary tirades, bluntly told the councilman that he had been
misinformed on the former NYPD commissioner's record. "Let me make
myself very clear on this issue: Racial profiling is morally and
legally wrong," Bratton said. "It will not be tolerated, it will not
be practiced while I'm chief of the Los Angeles Police Department."</TE>
<TE>   To ensure that, he vowed to speed up implementation of the
federally mandated consent decree, which outlines reforms related to
racial profiling and other potential abuses of police power.</TE>
<TE>   The city agreed to the decree last year to stave off a suit by the
U.S. Justice Department, which said that the LAPD for years had
engaged in civil rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton was a member of the team monitoring the department's
compliance with the consent decree, which is how he became interested
in the LAPD position.</TE>
<TE>   The job opened up in April after the Police Commission voted to
deny Parks a second five-year term. Former Deputy Chief Martin
Pomeroy has been serving as temporary head of the department. He is
set to step down, once Bratton is sworn in.</TE>

<HD>Dust to Ashes: Soil Falls Victim to Forest Fire</HD>
<DH>Research: San Gabriel Mountains blaze destroys a unique
collection that scientists had only begun to explore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the casualties of the Williams fire that swept through the
Angeles National Forest was a small, pyramid-shaped shed that might
be easy to ignore on the list of 62 homes and 14 outbuildings
destroyed.</LD>
<LD>   But the underground shed housed strange yet precious cargo: Nearly
1,000 jars filled with dirt collected 67 years ago, a living archive
of sorts that in recent years had been a gold mine for soil
scientists.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists were surprised to learn that a thin layer of clay
particles within soil, called an argillic horizon, takes decades,
rather than centuries, to form. With the jars, they had been able to
study how pollution affects soil composition. Lead and zinc released
into the air, they realized, quickly make their way into the ground.</LD>
<TE>   But when the fire raced through the forest, the collection was
lost.</TE>
<TE>   The jars of soil were the byproduct of another sort of scientific
experiment, one that concluded long ago. In 1935, scientists working
within the San Dimas Experimental Forest, a portion of the larger
Angeles National Forest set aside to conduct scientific research,
were interested in learning how they might manipulate forest
vegetation to yield more water for the people who lived nearby. So
they built a series of lysimeters--complicated, overgrown
planters--in a vast clearing of the experimental forest to measure
how plants took in and processed water.</TE>
<TE>   The project, built with the help of the Civilian Conservation
Corps, was so elaborate and labor-intensive that it probably never
would be duplicated today. Thirty-two lysimeters, most of them 11
feet wide, 21 feet long and 6 feet deep, were planted with five kinds
of native vegetation: scrub oak, Coulter pine, buckwheat and the
evergreen shrubs chamise and ceanothus.</TE>
<TE>   An underground concrete bunker housed a system of water tanks to
measure rainfall, runoff and the amount of water that percolated in
the lysimeters' soil. When the work crews dug the giant pits for the
lysimeters, soil samples were taken every two inches down and placed
in jars with labels indicating the lysimeter numbers and the layers
from which they had been taken.</TE>
<TE>   As time went on, the scientists realized that the lysimeters, in
layman's terms, were a bit of a bust, because they did not
sufficiently reproduce the natural environment of the forest. After a
fire burned through the planters in 1960, the scientists abandoned
the project.</TE>
<TE>   But they left the jars, stored in boxes inside the pyramid-shaped
building with concrete walls and asbestos roofing that became their
permanent home.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that was the safest building in the forest," said
Robert Graham, a professor at UC Riverside who has been studying the
lysimeter soil since 1986, when he was told about the jars. Graham's
research focused on comparing the soil in the jars with equivalent
layers still in the lysimeters. In a Times interview in April, he
said he had tested only a fraction of the jars housed in the shed.</TE>
<TE>   This week, he was mourning the loss of those archived samples.</TE>
<TE>   Almost the entire San Dimas Experimental Forest burned last month
in the 30,094-acre Williams fire.</TE>
<TE>   And although firefighters did their best to defend the buildings
within the experimental forest, somehow, Graham said, the shed's
roof, which was made of wood, must have caught fire. "It burned from
the inside and collapsed."</TE>
<TE>   Graham said that, because of the asbestos tiles, the shed is now
considered a hazardous-waste site. But he has been allowed to peer
into it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing visible that's usable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the airtight jars that had once served as mini-time
capsules either broke under the weight of the collapsed roof or
melted in the fire. The paper labels, identifying where in the
lysimeters the soil had been collected, were charred as well,
rendering useless the few jars that are left intact.</TE>
<TE>   Still, all is not lost for the scientists. Just as the discovery
of those jars represented an unexpected opportunity, the fire, oddly
enough, presents its own prospects for scientific inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists will be able to study how vegetation regrows after such
a catastrophic fire, to measure changes in the soil chemistry and to
track how the alkaline ash above ground affects the biology of the
soil below. And as they do, they will build upon a body of knowledge
gleaned from a set of very dirty jars.</TE>

<HD>Finishing a Quest for the Perfect Wave</HD>
<DH>A writer finally gives in to the lure of Jeffrey's Bay,
South Africa, renowned for the quality of its breakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JEFFREY'S BAY, South Africa</DL>
<LD>The Brazilians are complaining of the cold. The lone Hawaiian is
shivering in her wetsuit. Other surfers from America, Australia,
Germany, Japan, South Korea and Russia are growing excited. The
weather has turned nasty--a sure sign of bigger waves to come.</LD>
<LD>   The visiting surfers do their best to shake off the windchill and
the rain as they sit on their boards, bobbing among the swells.</LD>
<LD>   The wind is blowing hard but straight offshore, sculpting the
waves to perfection. There's an added benefit to the surfers in the
water. The wind drives the rain horizontally into the back of their
heads. That way it does not obscure their vision as they gaze out
from the southern tip of the African continent for the next set of
waves on the horizon.</LD>
<TE>   "Endless summer, ha!" said Andrew Deegenaars, a beefy Australian
surfer from Sydney. "That's a laugh."</TE>
<TE>   The inside joke about the weather here comes from the title of two
movies that made this coast famous. Virtually everyone here was lured
by Bruce Brown's 1966 classic surf flick "The Endless Summer" or the
remake 28 years later "The Endless Summer II."</TE>
<TE>   In both surf travelogues, the lighthearted Santa Barbara filmmaker
tracks a pair of Californians as they prowl the globe in search of
the perfect wave. Both films end here. Not for the weather, but for
the waves.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Mayer, 52, of Carpinteria said the first "Endless Summer" left
a lasting impression on him as a teenager. He remembered his dad
dropping him off at the theater to see the movie. When he emerged, he
announced to his astonished father that he too was going to devote
his life to the pursuit of perfect waves.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you did it," his father said recently after Mayer's return
from another surf safari.</TE>
<TE>   "Did what?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Devoted your life to chasing perfect waves."</TE>
<TE>   Mayer recounted this story from a bench overlooking "Supertubes,"
a point break where the waves peel right in perfect cylindrical
barrels along a volcanic rock reef. It is, as best as Mayer can
count, his 10th trip to Jeffrey's Bay. As a Delta flight attendant,
he has flown standby, board under his arm, to premier surf spots all
over the world.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the dream places everyone always wants to go,"
Mayer said.</TE>
<TE>   That has certainly been true for me. I have longed to visit the
South African coast since I first watched Robert August and Mike
Hynson scramble down a large sand dune to discover the perfect wave
at the conclusion of "The Endless Summer." To this day, those waves
at Cape St. Francis are called "Bruce's Beauties," after the
filmmaker who presented them to the world.</TE>
<TE>   My desire was stoked again by the 1994 sequel, when Robert
"Wingnut" Weaver and Pat O'Connell surfed the waves in Jeffrey's Bay
with former world champion Shaun Tomson, a native South African. In
that movie they surfed Supertubes, which was considered too fast to
surf on the clunky boards of the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Still, South Africa seemed hopelessly remote and out of reach
because of the distance and the expensive air fare. It takes nearly
24 hours of flying (typically on three flights) to get here from
California.</TE>
<TE>   Tomson encouraged me to give it a try when I ran across him in
Ventura. Although he immigrated to Santa Barbara, where he owns a
surf wear company, he continues to promote Jeffrey's Bay as his
favorite surfing destination.</TE>
<TE>   "Ken," he said, "As a regular foot, you owe it to yourself to surf
it at least once."</TE>
<TE>   Those words dogged me for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the world's great waves peel left. As a result, "regular
foot" surfers, who stand on the board with their left foot forward
and right foot back, surf with their backs to those left-breaking
waves.</TE>
<TE>   Blindsided, they have a hard time seeing the waves bearing down on
them unless they crane their necks over their shoulder. "Goofy foot"
surfers, left foot back, confront the problem in the other direction.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey's Bay waves peel right, a rare treat for regular foot
surfers.</TE>
<TE>   For any surf spot to work well, the key ingredient is a big swell.
Jeffrey's Bay breaks most consistently from June through August.
Those are the winter months in the Southern Hemisphere when fierce
storms off Antarctica send massive southern swells marching up the
Atlantic and Indian oceans toward the Cape of Good Hope.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I arrived in early September, spring was in the air
and the famous surf break was, well, flat. The weather was too good.
Or so I was told by nearly everyone in this tiny, one-robot town. A
"robot" is the South African word for traffic light.</TE>
<TE>   Then the clouds rolled in. It turned cold and rainy. Soon the
waves started stacking up on the horizon. For two days, surfers
braved the elements to launch themselves off 6- to 8-foot waves,
racing down the line for nearly a quarter-mile or more.</TE>
<TE>   The waves here are known for their speed, for holding their
perfect shape as they increase in size, for the length of the ride.
Some locals complained that the place barely showed its potential
during those two days.</TE>
<TE>   But it hardly mattered to the international crew of visitors. It
was as good or even better than it ever gets back home in California,
Israel, Ireland, Brazil or Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Yoon, 26, a self-described "surf bum and championship
dishwasher," could not bring himself to leave. He'd been here for
months as part of his two-year odyssey of surfing and "washing dishes
all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   Jordi Oliver, a 21-year-old Spaniard from Barcelona with
bleached-blond hair, had been here a month. He too was living a
childhood fantasy. "I'm a regular foot and I've always wanted to surf
the best right [break] in the world. And here I am."</TE>

<HD>Law Schools Bow to Pentagon on Recruiters</HD>
<DH>Finances: USC is among campuses that will admit the
military under threat of losing federal funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Law schools at USC and several other universities are being forced to
give military recruiters greater access to their students or risk the
loss to their campuses of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal
funds.</LD>
<LD>   The law schools are among the final holdouts in a long struggle
between the military and many of the nation's universities over the
Defense Department's "don't ask, don't tell" rules about gays, which
conflict with nondiscrimination policies at many schools.</LD>
<LD>   In recent weeks, warned explicitly that their universities'
federal research funds could be cut off, the law schools at USC,
Harvard, Yale and other institutions have reluctantly bowed to the
Pentagon's demands.</LD>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, we no longer have a choice," said Rob Saltzman,
associate dean of the USC law school, where military recruiters last
week took part in the school's official interview program for the
first time in more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Among the handful of students who interviewed was Tina Mun, 25,
who met Army and Air Force recruiters in a room posted with warnings
from the law school that the military does not comply with its hiring
standards.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy did not bother her, said Mun, a second-year law
student. "From what I've heard, [the military] is a great opportunity
to be able to serve your country and get a lot of hands-on experience
as a lawyer," she said.</TE>
<TE>   David Booher, who leads a group of gay students at the law school,
said USC had done all it could to resist. "We realize this isn't
something they wanted to do," Booher said.</TE>
<TE>   Had the law school not complied, USC officials said, the
university would have risked losing almost $300 million, or about 21%
of its operating budget. The money, from an array of federal
agencies, supports research into such disparate areas as education,
diabetes and cancer prevention.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty good hammer," said Carol Mauch, the university's
associate general counsel. "It would be very difficult to lose [the
funds] without risking a severe adverse effect on the entire
university."</TE>
<TE>   At Harvard, where $328 million was at stake before the university
retreated on the issue in late August, assistant law professor
Heather Gerken described the Pentagon pressure in starker terms:
"It's essentially blackmail," she said. "It's a horrible position
that we've been placed in."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Carr, the Defense Department's principal director for
military personnel policy, said the department is simply acting to
bring remaining schools into line with federal law.</TE>
<TE>   "This is federal law and that's the choice the nation has made,"
said Carr, who explained that the military services need to hire
about 300 lawyers a year.</TE>
<TE>   Yale said last week that it, too, would lift its ban on military
recruiters to safeguard its federal funding. But the school also
announced that it would seek ways to challenge the law through
administrative appeals and possible legal action, apparently becoming
the first university to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Law school and university officials said their policies were not
anti-military and were not intended to keep anyone who wanted to
interview with recruiters from doing so.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that we are against the military but that we see this as
a way to indicate our disagreement with a policy that deprives the
military of perfectly capable citizens," said Kinvin Wroth, dean of
Vermont Law School, an independent school that has maintained its ban
on recruiters.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, USC and other schools offered compromises. Military
recruiters were allowed to make contact with interested students
directly or to meet them in unofficial settings, but were denied
access to on-campus campus programs or official interview activities.</TE>
<TE>   Universities cited the conflict with the military's policy of
denying employment to anyone who is openly gay or bisexual. Under the
"don't ask, don't tell" policy adopted in 1993 by the Clinton
administration, recruiters are forbidden to ask prospective enlistees
about sexual orientation, and gays and lesbians already in the
military are prohibited from disclosing it.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, Congress strengthened the Pentagon's hand by
passing laws that linked certain categories of federal funding for
law schools to the degree of access military recruiters were given to
students. Congress later amended the law to exempt student aid money
but left other funds at risk. And in 2000, the military issued new
regulations stating that if any part of a university denied access to
recruiters, federal funding for the entire university could be
forfeited.</TE>
<TE>   The number of law schools that bar the military from their
interview programs has dropped since, education officials say, with
fewer than two dozen holdouts today, mainly at private universities
or free-standing law schools. Most public schools, including the
University of California, dropped their opposition years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Several university officials and faculty members speculated that
the Pentagon has been emboldened to pursue stricter enforcement
because of strong support from Congress and others for the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that has changed is 9/11 and anything that might
be construed as disrespectful toward the military is much more
difficult in this atmosphere," Gerken of Harvard said.</TE>
<TE>   Carr of the Defense Department acknowledged that the military had
redoubled its efforts to ensure compliance but said that was not
directly linked to last year's events. He said he believed it had
more to do with personnel changes among recruiters and growing
awareness that a number of schools were continuing to bar recruiters.</TE>
<TE>   But some law school faculty members and students said they
believed the military's stricter policy and the resulting controversy
could scare away potential recruits. Only four USC law students
interviewed with the recruiters this year, and school administrators
said some may have stayed away because they feared protests, which
never materialized.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Bozarth, a second-year USC law student, said location may
have been a factor too. He met with an Army recruiter last week at a
USC-owned hotel just off campus, where other university-sanctioned
employers also set up shop. Last year, under the now-abandoned
compromise, he met with the same recruiter at the on-campus ROTC
office-- a more convenient location than the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The military "had a good deal going before and had good access to
the students," said Bozarth, 24. "Sometimes, raising a stink doesn't
get you what you want."</TE>

<HD>Deputy's Past Is a Present Problem</HD>
<DH>Courts: U.S. drops a gun case, fearing officer's '96
misconduct might hurt his credibility on the stand. He gets desk
duty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 6-year-old evidence-planting and brutality case that led the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department to discipline four deputies has
resurfaced in federal court, raising the question: If a sworn officer
lies once, should authorities ever trust him again?</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors this summer freed a man accused of illegal gun
possession after deciding that they could not use Deputy Patrick
Golden as a witness in the case because of his past misconduct. As a
result, the district attorney's office told the Sheriff's Department
that Golden should always work with another deputy as a witness,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's officials have since transferred Golden to a desk job
while bosses decide his future assignment, Assistant Sheriff Larry
Waldie said.</LD>
<TE>   The dismissal of the federal gun charges because of Golden's
disciplinary record has prompted an examination by the Office of
Independent Review, an agency created at Sheriff Lee Baca's request
to investigate discipline in the department.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an essential requirement for a law enforcement officer to
be a witness," said Michael Gennaco, a former federal prosecutor who
now heads the review office. "When a law enforcement official has
significant credibility problems, it makes that impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Questions about Golden's credibility stem from a 1996 arrest. He
and two other deputies were recommended for termination because of
their conduct, according to court records. A fourth deputy who was at
the scene alleged that one colleague planted rock cocaine on a
handcuffed suspect who was then driven to a mall garage and beaten
unconscious by Golden and fellow Deputy Terry Burgin.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials later allowed the three deputies to stay with
the department, suspending them for 15 days and ordering them off
patrol for two years, internal records and interviews show. One quit.
Golden and Burgin were found to have used excessive force and
eventually returned to regular duties.</TE>
<TE>   This year, a federal public defender representing a man whom
Golden arrested on gun charges discovered Golden's past. That led the
U.S. attorney's office to drop charges in August, even though
authorities did not think Golden acted inappropriately in the gun
case.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office said it will decide whether to use
Golden as a witness on a case-by-case basis.</TE>
<TE>   According to a district attorney's database, Golden has been
subpoenaed as a witness against 462 defendants since about 1995.
Attorneys say it is unclear from the records whether any cases
previous to the August case were dismissed because of the deputy's
disciplinary history.</TE>
<TE>   Veracity Pivotal</TE>
<TE>   Criminal cases usually pivot on the veracity of officers who can
testify about illegal activity they have seen. Defense attorneys
question why the district attorney's office and Sheriff's Department
would continue to use the testimony of deputies they had previously
found to lack credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "The D.A.'s policy here assists in keeping people employed who
really should not be in law enforcement," said Assistant Public
Defender Randall Reich. "It gives the Sheriff's Department no
incentive to weed these people out."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Sheriff Waldie said the department can settle complaints
against its employees for several reasons. "We fire people, and the
Civil Service Commission reinstates them," he said. "We follow the
evidence; we do what we can. We are constrained by the law."</TE>
<TE>   Golden said he has been directed by sheriff's officials not to
comment. Efforts to reach the other deputies were unsuccessful.
Attorney Richard Shinee, who represented the three deputies in the
1996 case, said none of them was ever disciplined for planting
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Deputy Golden has done an excellent job since his return to work
and has never been the subject of any other complaints," Shinee said.</TE>
<TE>   Case Resurfaces</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 case resurfaced in August, when federal prosecutors
dropped charges against Mark Stephen Bellows, 20.</TE>
<TE>   According to court papers, Golden and his partner were patrolling
a Compton apartment complex troubled by gangs May 6 this year when
they saw Bellows flee.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies chased him and reported recovering a .38-caliber
Smith &amp; Wesson revolver they said Bellows tossed onto the roof of a
neighboring building. As a convicted felon, Bellows faced federal
prosecution for carrying a firearm.</TE>
<TE>   Bellows pleaded not guilty. His deputy federal public defender,
Ronald O. Kaye, checked into the background of the arresting
deputies.</TE>
<TE>   What he found was enough to persuade federal prosecutors to
dismiss charges against Bellows on Aug. 15, even though they had "no
suspicion," according to a federal source, that Golden had acted
inappropriately in the gun case.</TE>
<TE>   "After reviewing the information [in Golden's personnel file],"
wrote Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas P. O'Brien, "it is my belief that
the indictment should be dismissed in the interests of justice."</TE>
<TE>   The concerns stemmed from Golden's confidential disciplinary
records in the drug case of Kendrick Loot, who is now on death row
for unrelated murders, according to attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, deputies spotted Loot and another man apparently
conducting a drug deal at 149th Street and Hawthorne Boulevard in
Lawndale, according to the Sheriff's Department account.</TE>
<TE>   Loot fled and was chased by deputies. One caught up with him in an
alley, and in the ensuing tussle, Loot grabbed the deputy's
flashlight and beat the officer, according to department reports.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy James Ramey and his trainee Charles Hulsey were in one of
the patrol cars that arrived at the scene. Golden and Burgin were in
another patrol car. All four were working out of the Lennox sheriff's
station.</TE>
<TE>   In his interview with sheriff's internal investigators, Hulsey
said deputies crowded around Loot, whacking him with their
flashlights, and then discussed what charges he would face.</TE>
<TE>   Ramey planted the drugs on Loot, Hulsey told investigators, then
Golden and Burgin put him in their patrol car to take him to jail.
After driving 28 blocks, they pulled into the garage at the Hawthorne
Mall.</TE>
<TE>   Golden and Burgin told investigators they stopped because they
realized they had not fully frisked Loot. Ramey and Hulsey followed
them into the garage.</TE>
<TE>   Hulsey said Loot, who was handcuffed, was ordered out of the car.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time that person would make an attempt to stand up and get
out of the car, Deputy Golden would hit him as hard as he could,"
Hulsey told investigators.</TE>
<TE>   After Loot got out of the car, Golden and Burgin beat him until he
was unconscious, Hulsey said in his interview with investigators and
in a lawsuit he later filed. Loot also complained to internal
investigators that he had been beaten.</TE>
<TE>   After Loot was arrested, he was charged separately with triple
homicide for his role driving the getaway car in a series of
armored-car holdups. He was eventually found guilty and sentenced to
death in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   After an internal administrative investigation, sheriff's
officials concluded that Golden and Burgin had used excessive force
on Loot and that Ramey had planted evidence, according to department
records.</TE>
<TE>   "As a result of the subject's misconduct, the credibility of the
station was severely damaged," investigators wrote in a letter to one
of the deputies, "thus causing a direct and negative impact on the
prosecution of criminal cases within our jurisdiction."</TE>
<TE>   Then-Undersheriff Jerry Harper recommended in late 1998 that the
three deputies be terminated.</TE>
<TE>   County procedure allows accused deputies to argue their case and
appeal disciplinary recommendations before they are made final. The
deputies did so, and in January 1999, officials agreed to let them
remain with the department. Baca, who had been in office one month,
signed letters to the deputies informing them that they would be
suspended for 25 days--10 days of which were held in abeyance--and
transferred to non-patrol assignments for two years, according to
internal records.</TE>
<TE>   Golden and Burgin were found to have used excessive force and
failed to report it, according to internal records. The department
rescinded its finding that Ramey had tampered with evidence, and
instead found him to have failed to report excessive force by others.</TE>
<TE>   Ramey resigned from the department in February 2000. Attorney
Shinee would not say where his client went. Burgin works as a
detective assigned to the department's Compton office and has not
been the subject of further complaints, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Hulsey, the deputy who told investigators about the incident, was
also found to have failed to report the excessive force in a timely
manner and received a 30-day suspension, according to internal
documents. He later left the department and filed a $17-million
whistle-blower lawsuit, which was settled this year for $100,000. The
department admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into Golden's behavior in the Loot case had
repercussions for another drug case handled by the Lennox sheriff's
station, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   More Doubts Arise</TE>
<TE>   It sparked a review that led prosecutors in 1998 to doubt the
credibility of two other deputies and drop criminal charges against
two alleged drug dealers.</TE>
<TE>   On the night of June 12, 1997, Golden was chasing a drug suspect,
Gary O'Bannon, down a South Bay street, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in a nearby alleyway known for drug dealing, Deputies
Laughn Barth and Alfred Alvarez reported seeing two men engaged in a
drug transaction, court records show. The deputies arrested the two
men, who said O'Bannon had dropped the drugs and they simply found
them.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, as prosecutors were preparing for trial, they were
told that Golden was under internal investigation, according to court
papers. As a result, the suspects--who accused deputies of falsifying
their arrest report--were given polygraph exams, which they passed.
O'Bannon told prosecutors the drugs were his.</TE>
<TE>   Charges were dropped against the two suspects "because of doubts
about the credibility" of Barth and Alvarez, according to a court
declaration signed by the then-head deputy of the Torrance branch of
the district attorney's office, Sandra Buttitta. Golden was not
accused of any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they declined to file perjury charges against the
deputies because of conflicting stories, the "long criminal
histories" of the suspects and the fact that polygraphs are not
admissible in criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said investigators were also hampered by their inability
to find a sheriff's deputy who would corroborate the suspects'
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "Even with the irregularities in the arrest," prosecutors wrote in
their rejection report, there was insufficient evidence to file
perjury or false-report charges. According to court records, the U.S.
attorney's office also investigated the case and declined to press
charges.</TE>
<TE>   A sheriff's administrative probe found that the deputies had
committed infractions in evidence- handling procedures, and they were
each given three-day suspensions.</TE>
<TE>   The two suspects sued the county for $17 million in 1998. In court
filings, attorneys for Alvarez and Barth maintained that they did
witness the drug transaction. The lawsuit was settled for $78,000 in
late 2000 with no admission of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Barth has since left the department for another police agency,
sheriff's officials say. Alvarez works at the West Hollywood station
and has apparently had no complaints filed against him recently,
sheriff's officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Golden's attorney, Shinee, whose firm represented Barth and
Alvarez, said prosecutors declined to file perjury charges because
"it was impossible to determine what happened that night."</TE>

<HD>2 Men Fatally Shot in Oxnard</HD>
<DH>Violence: Authorities investigate whether the separate
slayings are tied to recent gang attacks. The shootings occurred less
than a mile apart.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J WOLCOTT and SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Separate shootings in Oxnard this week claimed the lives of a former
Navy reservist and a fast-food worker, and detectives on Friday were
investigating possible links to gang attacks that have gripped the
city in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The shootings of 23-year-old Juan Ramirez Jr. and 25-year-old
Steven Anthony Lemos occurred less than a mile apart Thursday night
in north Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   They are the ninth and 10th homicides in the city this year.</LD>
<TE>   "These were not random acts. There's more to it than that, and we
are trying to figure it out," said Police Sgt. Bernie Schmalhofer.</TE>
<TE>   Neither victim is a gang member, but authorities believe Ramirez
may have had gang ties in his hometown of Bakersfield and that Lemos
could have been mistaken for a gang associate.</TE>
<TE>   No links have been established between the two cases.</TE>
<TE>   As is common with street violence, details were sketchy because
few witnesses were willing to talk to police.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives know that Ramirez, the ex-reservist, was standing in a
Circle K parking lot in the 1900 block of North Ventura Road when he
was shot several times shortly before 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   He staggered inside the store and yelled to cashiers to call 911
before collapsing. He died a short time later at St. John's Regional
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   The fatal wound was caused by a .25-caliber bullet to the chest,
according to Mike Feiler, a deputy coroner's investigator.</TE>
<TE>   Although still unconfirmed late Friday, Schmalhofer said
detectives were looking into whether Ramirez argued with another man
in the store parking lot before being shot.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have no description of the shooter.</TE>
<TE>   About three hours later in a neighborhood a few blocks away,
Lemos, a burger chain employee, was shot in an alcove outside his
apartment in the 1900 block of North H Street.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors at the Del Ciervo Apartments said they heard someone
pounding on Lemos' front door about 11 p.m. and then heard three
gunshots and then a woman, possibly his girlfriend, screaming
hysterically.</TE>
<TE>   Lemos died during surgery at a local hospital. He had been shot
several times.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of death was a 9-millimeter gunshot wound to the
abdomen, said Mitch Breese, senior deputy medical examiner.</TE>
<TE>   While there is no evidence connecting the two cases, authorities
are trying to determine whether the killings are in any way related
to the city's ongoing gang warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Since early August, detectives have responded to at least nine
shootings and stabbings, of which at least five have been confirmed
as gang-related acts.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Thursday night's cases, the only other fatal
shooting was that of Emilio Fernandez.</TE>
<TE>   The 28-year-old Oxnard resident was gunned down Aug. 29 in an
alley behind an apartment complex in the 5200 block of South J
Street.</TE>
<TE>   Little information was released about the victims in the most
recent shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Ramirez had moved to the area from Bakersfield to
work as a Navy reservist and was living with several roommates in
Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   His parents live in Bakersfield and were making arrangements to
bury him there.</TE>
<TE>   A Navy spokeswoman confirmed that Ramirez had been a reservist but
said he was discharged last year.</TE>
<TE>   His only brush with the law appears to be a speeding ticket in May
for which he paid a $203 fine.</TE>
<TE>   At Lemos' home, neighbors were reluctant to comment, most saying
they knew little about the victim.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said his parents live locally and were arranging a
service through an Oxnard funeral home.</TE>
<TE>   The apartment complex, painted green and beige and landscaped with
large trees, is usually a quiet place, neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   Lemos and his girlfriend and her young child usually kept to
themselves they said.</TE>

<HD>Man Gets Life in Prison for Killing His Parents</HD>
<DH>Courts: Richard Mingus beat the Mission Viejo couple to
death in 2001.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 35-year-old man who beat his parents to death inside their Mission
Viejo home was sentenced Friday to life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Mingus was arrested in La Jolla on Feb. 23, 2001, a day
after Orange County sheriff's deputies found his parents dead inside
their Matias Drive home. Police said Mingus had beaten them with a
blunt instrument and took their car.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the nearby Mount of Olives Lutheran Church alerted
police after failing to see Ray Mingus, 69, and his wife, Pauline,
74, for several days. The retired couple often helped parishioners by
caring for their children.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities later found the Minguses' car in the parking lot of
Scripps Clinic and Green Hospital in La Jolla and Mingus sleeping in
a chair in the hospital's lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said the parents had asked their son to move out several
years ago. Mingus had moved to San Diego for a while but moved back
in with his parents not long before the slayings, several neighbors
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mingus was a divorced father of one whose job history ranged from
cafeteria work to roofing, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   He also had trouble with the law, including robbery, extortion and
grand theft convictions and a drug citation. After pleading guilty in
July 1992 to holding his mother hostage and forcing his father to
write him a $400 check, Mingus was sentenced to 259 days in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had considered seeking the death penalty against
Mingus in his parents' slayings. He pleaded guilty in exchange for
the life sentence handed down by Judge Francisco Briseno.</TE>

<HD>Motorcyclist Killed in Police Pursuit</HD>
<DH>Fatality: The Simi Valley father of three is clocked at 90
mph on a city street. He is thrown 100 feet after colliding with a
truck. Chase policy is again being questioned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 34-year-old Simi Valley man riding his motorcycle at 90 mph on a
city street was killed Thursday night when he collided with a pickup
truck during a police pursuit.</LD>
<LD>   James Vargas, a husband and father, died when his Suzuki 750 hit a
Dodge Ram carrying two women on Fitzgerald Road in Simi Valley. The
women were not injured.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began when Simi Valley Police Officer Vernon Trujillo
tried to pull Vargas over about 8 p.m. after clocking his speed at 90
mph on 1st Street near Stonebrook Street, Lt. Rex Jones said.</LD>
<TE>   Vargas slowed down for a red light at Bennett Street, but when the
signal turned green, he raced down 1st and made a high-speed right
turn onto Fitzgerald Road, Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Trujillo followed, without turning on his red lights or siren, but
never got closer than 100 yards, said Capt. Tony Harper. Trujillo
activated his red lights and siren after turning onto Fitzgerald, but
Vargas had already come upon the pickup, Harper said.</TE>
<TE>   Driving east in the 1100 block of Fitzgerald, Vargas tried to pass
the Dodge Ram on the left. But the truck driver was trying to make a
left turn into a driveway at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas slammed into the driver's side of the pickup with such
force that his motorcycle spun out of control and crashed into the
wall of a house, authorities said. Vargas was thrown about 100 feet.
He died from the impact.</TE>
<TE>   Harper said Trujillo was chasing Vargas for "a matter of seconds"
before the accident. Department policy allows pursuits until they
become unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   "When it's not safe, then we need to terminate it," Harper said.</TE>
<TE>   Although a Police Department news release called Vargas "the
fleeing motorcyclist," a close friend of his said Vargas wouldn't
have ignored a police officer if he had seen him.</TE>
<TE>   "He never would have run," said Giles Sankey, who attended Royal
High School in Simi Valley with Vargas. "It's out of character for
him. I've known him for years; he's very sensible and stable."</TE>
<TE>   An investigation of the accident is underway, authorities said,
adding that Trujillo remains on active duty.</TE>
<TE>   In March, an 18-year-old student from Oxnard was killed when the
car in which was riding was broadsided by a California Highway Patrol
cruiser in pursuit of a speeding motorist.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Mohorko, a Hueneme High School senior and preachers'
daughter, was driving home from a school dance with her boyfriend
when the collision occurred on Oxnard Boulevard. The speeding
motorist was never caught.</TE>
<TE>   Mohorko's family has filed a legal claim against the CHP, the
county and the city. Such a claim is a required precursor before
filing a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's accident again raised the issue of how police should
conduct pursuits in urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a huge law enforcement supporter, but there is no
accountability outside the police department for police chases when
they're pursuing someone for traffic infractions," said attorney Mark
Hiepler, who represented an 18-year-old woman severely injured in a
1999 Simi Valley chase.</TE>
<TE>   "Statistics show that the number of people they're putting in
jeopardy while they're chasing someone for a traffic violation
doesn't balance out," Hiepler said. "It's not worth it."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas, who worked as a pressman for a printing company in
Camarillo, was married to Kamma Vargas. The couple have three
children.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a really close relationship with all his kids," Sankey
said. "They're just devastated."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives and friends gathered at a private home in Simi Valley on
Friday to grieve.</TE>
<TE>   "He would do anything for his friends," said Sankey, who went on a
fishing trip with Vargas off the Channel Islands about a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show Vargas paid a $165 fine in March for speeding
in Simi Valley. Driving his motorcycle fast was a weakness of the
church-going man who lived for his friends and family, according to
Sankey.</TE>
<TE>   "People with sports bikes do dumb things; that's why they buy
them," Sankey said. "He never should have gone that fast. It was a
poor decision on James' part."</TE>
<TE>   Sankey said he talked to Vargas' brother-in-law, who said it was
Vargas' habit "to gun it down Fitzgerald" when driving home on his
bike.</TE>

<HD>Property Owners May Face Charges in Scam</HD>
<DH>Fraud: They allegedly bribed county planner to sidestep
review process. Ex-official is held on $1.8-million bail.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Property owners who may have paid a Los Angeles County planner for
bogus documents could face criminal charges for their parts in a land
fraud case that has cost the county more than $2 million in unpaid
fees, officials with the district attorney's office said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The former planner, Emmet Taylor, was arrested Wednesday and
charged with 97 counts of forgery and falsification of public
records. County officials allege that Taylor processed more than 450
illegal land division certificates between 1995 and 2000, allowing
applicants to skip the public review process and avoid paying
thousands in county planning fees.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the landowners now holding the phony documents took no
part in the fraud, as they bought the properties after the
certificates were issued, said Paul McCarthy, the land divisions
chief of the county's Regional Planning Department. Because they were
unaware that the documents were phony, they will not have to go
through the expensive public planning process.</LD>
<TE>   But those suspected of knowing better will have to resubmit their
plans, McCarthy said. And the district attorney's Public Integrity
Division is considering going after them as well, Deputy Dist. Atty.
Richard Ceballos said.</TE>
<TE>   "Real estate agents, developers--there are a lot of places this
could go," said Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the district
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, 64, who faces up to 70 years in prison, is expected to be
arraigned Tuesday. He is being held on $1.8-million bail, but because
prosecutors believe he may have pocketed nearly $500,000 from the
scam, they filed a motion requesting proof that any bail money he
puts up was legally obtained.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor's attorney, Richard Shinee, could not be reached for
comment Friday. But Robison and McCarthy gave the following details
of the scheme:</TE>
<TE>   Word apparently spread among landowners that Taylor could speed up
the county's bureaucratic process. The owners would call Taylor at
his county office or his home-based real estate consulting business,
then mail their documents to him. Most of the applications were for
lots where developments of 12 or fewer homes were planned, and most
were in such rural areas as the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys.</TE>
<TE>   For a fee, Taylor would allegedly prepare fraudulent certificates
of compliance for the landowners. These documents are valuable
because they allow construction to begin without public hearings or
an environmental review. To be eligible, the land must have
development rights that predate more recent growth restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, Taylor forged grant deeds to show that the
properties were eligible for the certificates, Robison said.</TE>
<TE>   The plan saved big money for many landowners. In addition to
Taylor's consulting fee--$1,500 per certificate--they paid about $760
for the certificates themselves, McCarthy said. Going through the
standard public hearing process usually costs $9,000 to $12,000 in
application fees.</TE>
<TE>   But officials grew suspicious after they discovered a certificate
that had been erroneously filed by Taylor--and after four checks were
sent to the county planning office that were written out to Taylor
personally, McCarthy said.</TE>
<TE>   They conducted an audit, which found that much of Taylor's
necessary documentation was missing, McCarthy said. Taylor was fired
in late 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor had told his supervisors that he was conducting real estate
consulting work from his home, McCarthy said. But planning officials
didn't think the business constituted a conflict of interest because
Taylor claimed he was only appraising property, McCarthy said.</TE>
<TE>   Construction has not yet begun on most of the properties involved.
But county planning officials said they are still trying to sort
through the mess.</TE>
<TE>   The Planning Department now bans the processing of compliance
certificate applications sent through the mail and has started to
review every one of the more than 1,200 certificates Taylor issued
since 1990. Although Taylor began working in the department in 1980,
the problems did not start until the 1990s, McCarthy said.</TE>
<TE>   As an added precaution, the Planning Department has ordered the
county's Building and Safety Department to halt the issuance of
building permits on any property with a certificate of compliance
dated between 1990 and 2000 until its validity can be proved. For
hundreds of potential builders, that has meant added bureaucratic
delays lasting from a few hours to several weeks, McCarthy said.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy suspects that some landowners who dealt with Taylor knew
that the process was illegal. The real losers, he said, were those
neighbors who lost the chance to comment on developments before they
were built.</TE>
<TE>   "When somebody uses this underhanded approach," he said, "they're
denying their neighbors their rights to know what's going on."</TE>

<HD>Ruling Extends Tenants' Subsidies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has issued a preliminary
injunction preventing the owners of six buildings in Los Angeles from
removing their property from a federally subsidized housing program.</LD>
<LD>   The judgment is a victory for tenants, housing advocates and Mayor
James K. Hahn, who had argued that the owners violated state law by
failing to properly notify several public entities and tenants of
their intent to leave the program.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement, Hahn hailed the ruling and vowed to "continue to
fight to ensure that affordable housing tenants' rights are
protected."</LD>
<TE>   The ruling, issued Monday, affects six apartment buildings
scattered in South Los Angeles, some in the USC area, known as L.A.
Pro VI. Tenants of 127 units, who faced the possibility of higher
rent or displacement, can remain in place for at least 12 months,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's going to give us 12 months to work with owners and other
interested parties to keep these buildings affordable for the working
families and seniors who live there, " said Sarah Dusseault,
assistant deputy mayor for economic development.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Chaplan, an attorney representing the owners of four of the
buildings, has appealed the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "In this issue the statute simply didn't apply to our client,"
Chaplan said.</TE>
<TE>   His client, he said, "intends to continue being a quality
low-income housing provider," and is open to discussion with the
city.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the city's argument is a 2-year-old state law
concerning the federal housing program commonly known as Section 8.
Under the program, the federal government pays the bulk of a
low-income tenant's rent.</TE>
<TE>   The law requires owners who wish to leave the program to notify
tenants 12 months in advance. Several public entities must also be
notified, including the California Housing and Community Development
Department and the local mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The notice allows public officials to search for ways to keep the
units affordable or find solutions for the tenants who stand to face
higher rent or lose their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Housing advocates had asked the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development to reject the owners' application to leave the
program, arguing that HUD's regulations require owners to comply with
state and local laws.</TE>
<TE>   But local HUD officials took the opposite view. They said the
federal agency had no obligation to enforce state law and approved
the owners' application to leave the program.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with HUD's decision, and the impending end of the owner's
contract with HUD, the city took the rare step of seeking an
injunction.</TE>
<TE>   In the ruling issued Monday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge
Reginald A. Dunn said the owners' "alleged violation of state law
will irreparably harm the city of Los Angeles and James K. Hahn by
preventing the affected low-income tenants from obtaining proper
notice and an opportunity to properly protect themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Atty. Jennifer Gregg, who with Richard Bobb
represented the city in the case, said the ruling means the owners
must enter into a new contract with HUD.</TE>
<TE>   "If HUD is willing to renew the contract for an additional period,
the owners are required to accept that renewal," Gregg said. "HUD has
indicated it is willing to renew the contract if funding is
available."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Gross of the Coalition for Economic Survival said the impact
of the ruling extends beyond the six buildings involved.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this sends a tremendous message to owners who are looking
to opt out or prepay that if they intend to do this, they have to
comply with the laws or else the city of L.A. will take actions to
ensure that they do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dusseault added: "I think it sends a message to the federal
government as well as to the owners."</TE>
<TE>   Last month the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles filed a lawsuit
accusing the owners of failing to comply with the federal and state
noticing requirements. Attorneys for the owners have not yet answered
the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "For now the tenants are protected," said Legal Aid staff attorney
Christian Abasto. "We're not going to file any motions, as long as
the owner applies to renew the Section 8 contract and as long as HUD
approves it."</TE>

<HD>Educator Pleads Guilty in Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Court: Former Thousand Oaks High coach faces up to three
years in custody for his involvement with two female students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Thousand Oaks High School wrestling coach pleaded guilty
Friday to having sex with two female students when he worked at the
school.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey S. Magruder, 25, pleaded guilty to one count of statutory
rape involving a female student and one count of sexual battery
involving another female student.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors will not pursue two misdemeanor child molestation
charges, though the charges will be considered during Magruder's
sentencing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Tamara Bogosian said.</LD>
<TE>   Magruder faces up to three years in jail and a fine of up to
$10,000 when he is sentenced Nov. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Magruder, dressed in a black suit, quietly entered his pleas
during his hearing. His attorney, Phillip Remington Dunn, said
Magruder decided to change his plea because he wanted to spare his
family from having to go through a trial. "He did what he thinks is
best for everyone concerned," Dunn said. "He's taken responsibility
for this. And he's had a substantial change in his outlook."</TE>
<TE>   Magruder quit his coaching job at Thousand Oaks High nearly three
years ago. He then worked as a wrestling and football coach for two
years at Newbury Park High School before resigning after the charges
were brought against him in March, according to Jody Dunlap,
assistant superintendent for personnel services for the Conejo Valley
Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Magruder had faced four charges involving four teenage girls at
Thousand Oaks High. Dunn said there were no allegations of force
involved in any of the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Magruder's case is one of three involving Ventura County teachers
or coaches accused of engaging in sex with students.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Paul Fonseca, 23, pleaded guilty in July to having sex with
a 14-year-old Moorpark High School student. Fonseca, a former
volunteer wrestling coach at the school, admitted to three felonies,
including statutory rape and oral copulation. He faces four years in
prison when he is sentenced Oct. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo High School science teacher Chad Wenzlick Pridgen, 31,
faces 39 felony and misdemeanor counts alleging various sex acts with
11 teenage boys. He has pleaded not guilty and is free on $500,000
bail. He is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 21.</TE>

<HD>Will Voters Back Bonds Again?</HD>
<DH>Schools: Seven requests on March ballot passed, but the
economy has slumped since. Now four districts seek a total of $804.5
million.</DH>

<LD>Tustin High's junior varsity football team suits up in a locker room
where wires protrude from lights. Plaster has collapsed into piles of
dust and the red painted floor is so mottled, a district official
said the place resembles a slaughterhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Students at Orange Coast College study at picnic tables in the
shadow of a vacant, weed-encircled library, its books transplanted to
24 trailers in the parking lot after it was ruled seismically unfit
three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Aging facilities and burgeoning enrollments have prompted Tustin
Unified, Coast Community College District and two other Orange County
school districts to put a combined $804.5 million in school
facilities bonds on the November ballot.</LD>
<TE>   Centralia, an elementary school district with nine campuses in
Anaheim, Buena Park and La Palma, and Rancho Santiago Community
College District are the other districts seeking money through
increased property taxes. Depending on the district, the bond
measures would add about $17 to $40 per $100,000 of assessed value to
a homeowner's annual tax bill.</TE>
<TE>   The upcoming election is the third since California voters lowered
the threshold for passage of bonds from a two-thirds majority to 55%.</TE>
<TE>   Before then, slightly more than half of school bond measures won
approval statewide. But in the last two elections, voters passed 95
of the state's 108 school and community college district measures.</TE>
<TE>   About half of those passed with less than a two-thirds
majority.Officials at all four Orange County districts hope the March
primary results foretell success Nov. 5. At that time, Orange County
voters passed all seven school bond measures before them. But with no
relief in sight for the economy, some worry voters will reject any
new tax, however small.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Farrell, interim president of Orange Coast College,
acknowledged that Coast Community College District may have waited
too long to put a measure on the ballot. "You never want to be on the
back end of a wave," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, more than 100 districts are trying to raise $10 billion
in bonds on the November ballot, according to the Coalition for
Adequate School Housing, a nonprofit research and advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   The local measures work in tandem with Proposition 47, a
$13-billion statewide school bond, education officials say. If the
state bond measure passes but local matching funds do not, districts
would have to pay for projects through general fund money or
donations.</TE>
<TE>   "Passing the local bond is a way to bring our tax dollars that go
to Sacramento back to our community and back to our schools," said
Kristin Gallagher, campaign co-chairwoman for Tustin Unified's bond
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin is seeking $80 million for maintenance and infrastructure
improvements at the district's 20 oldest schools, including a
makeover of the Tustin High locker room.</TE>
<TE>   At Hillview High, the lack of air conditioning has led one teacher
to cool her classroom by perching a fan on a block of ice.</TE>
<TE>   At Foothill High, 2,300 students share three bathrooms. The gym
floor cannot withstand being sanded one more time and 27 portable
classrooms circle the campus.</TE>
<TE>   "They're well-maintained for older schools, but they were all
built when the most advanced thing we were using in the classroom was
a film-strip projector," district Supt. Peter Gorman said.</TE>
<TE>   Centralia officials compare their facilities to 1960s trucks with
new paint jobs: They look fine on the outside but need a tuneup to
keep running.</TE>
<TE>   The district's $17.5-million bond measure would fund major
renovations at schools like Knott Elementary in Buena Park, where the
computer lab has no Internet access and trees have clogged sewer
lines, causing frequent backups.</TE>
<TE>   "The money we have will barely allow us to maintain current
conditions," Assistant Supt. Marc Forgy said. "And some of the things
have gotten so bad we can't fix them any longer. We have to replace
them."</TE>
<TE>   Across California, community college districts, too, are grappling
with a marked increase in students, an aging infrastructure and
insufficient state funds for capital improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Santiago Community College District has a $337-million
measure on the ballot to pay for nearly 30 construction and
renovation projects at Santa Ana and Santiago Canyon colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed projects at Santa Ana College include building a math and
science facility, buying adjacent land to expand, and repairing
crumbling walkways and leaky roofs.</TE>
<TE>   At Santiago Canyon, which became a separate college five years
ago, the campus hums with the sound of portable generators.</TE>
<TE>   Both the library and fitness center are housed in temporary
classrooms, and many students have at least half their classes in
them.</TE>
<TE>   Building permanent facilities will make students "finally feel
like they're at a real college," said student Rita Kallas, 20, of
Orange.</TE>
<TE>   If passed, Coast Community College District's measure would
provide $370 million to replace and upgrade facilities at Coastline,
Golden West and Orange Coast colleges.</TE>
<TE>   At Orange Coast, more than 29,000 students attend classes in
overcrowded, deteriorating buildings, some of which date to the
1940s. Others, like the 30-year-old, faded mint green planetarium are
woefully low-tech.</TE>
<TE>   Bond money also would be used to retrofit the library and repair
its cracked walls and bubbling plaster, and install a modern
air-conditioning system to replace the units that strain the
building's wooden eaves.</TE>
<TE>   Finding money for construction and renovation projects through
donations or state money takes time--a dozen years for the college's
newest addition, a performing arts center, Farrell said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we keep on going at 12 years per building, we'll be working in
tents," he said. "We've made a pretty good effort to do it without
local money, but it's just too hard."</TE>

<LD>A judge on Friday dismissed a felony vandalism charge against the son
of Britain's top judicial officer.</LD>
<LD>   But Orange County Superior Court Judge Everett Dickey left intact
the most serious allegations against Alastair Irvine, 25, who
allegedly waged a campaign of intimidation against the boyfriend of a
woman who rejected his advances.</LD>
<LD>   Dickey found enough evidence for Irvine to be tried on another
vandalism charge; allegations of stalking, burglary, criminal threat
and a misdemeanor weapon charge.</LD>
<TE>   Dickey's lawyer, who contends his client was simply venting, not
threatening anyone, said neither side is close to a plea agreement in
the case.</TE>
<TE>   Trial has been set for Oct. 21 but is expected to be postponed.</TE>

County Public Library.</LD>
<LD>   El Toro Friends of the Library said it would pick up the $120,000
tab for improving the 11,400-square-foot branch on Raymond Way. The
face-lift will add more than 2,000 square feet to the building. It
includes a new entry, new landscaping, upgraded restrooms and public
computer workstations.</LD>
<LD>   The library, which opened in 1981, has been closed since Oct. 1 to
prepare for the project. Work is expected to begin next week and be
completed early next year.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An accountant was accused Friday of creating phony personal and
corporate tax records for a now-defunct Irvine firm that bilked
investors, including several celebrities, out of an estimated $45
million.</LD>
<LD>   Stephen A. Ceparano, 62, of Northport, N.Y., was charged by
federal prosecutors in Los Angeles with conspiracy and fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The fabricated records were used by DFJ Italia Ltd. to lure
investors, including former football stars Eric Dickerson and Duval
Love and fashion model Kim Alexis, into investing in what authorities
described as a classic Ponzi scheme.</LD>
<TE>   DFJ promised high returns on investments in foreign currencies.
The company's founder, Luigi DiFonzo, who posed as an Italian
nobleman, died of a prescription drug overdose two years ago as
authorities were moving to seize his $4-million Laguna Niguel house.</TE>

<HD>Judge Halts Cleanup at Gas Station in Irvine</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge issued an injunction Friday that prohibits an
oil company from installing equipment to clean up pollutants beneath
an Irvine gas station.</LD>
<LD>   The order by Superior Court Judge Derek Hunt comes three days
after work crews, under police guard, started cleanup efforts at
Alfie's Place, a busy service station, lube shop and carwash near
Culver and Michelson drives.</LD>
<LD>   County health officials want former property owner Unocal to
remove pollutants, saying they threaten the county's drinking water
supply. But Unocal and Alfie's Place owner Joel Burnstine have been
unable to agree where cleanup equipment should be placed.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Unocal work crews started the cleanup project. Now the
project must remain on hold until the issue is resolved at trial,
scheduled to begin next month.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal is responsible for the cleanup because the pollution,
caused by leaking underground gasoline tanks, occurred while it owned
the property, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Ignore Walkout, UCI Chief Advises</HD>
<DH>Labor: Chancellor tells students to cross the picket lines
lecturers plan to set up next week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As University of California lecturers statewide get set to strike for
two days next week, UC Irvine Chancellor Ralph Cicerone is
encouraging students to cross picket lines and report to class.</LD>
<LD>   In an e-mail to students this week, Cicerone predicted that the
threatened walkout Monday and Tuesday by more than 400 contract
lecturers at the Irvine campus would not disrupt classes or other
activities.</LD>
<LD>   "You may encounter picket lines at various campus locations," he
wrote. "Please remember that your right to cross picket lines--to
attend class, go to work or conduct campus business--is fully
protected by law."</LD>
<TE>   The strike by members of the American Federation of Teachers at UC
campuses over alleged unfair labor practices comes after more than
two years of stalled contract negotiations. The lecturers, who are
required to reapply for their jobs when their individual employment
contracts expire, are seeking more job security and pay equity with
tenured faculty.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the only UC employees who are forced to reapply for our
jobs every year," said Andrew Tonkovich, a UCI composition teacher
and president of the union's Local 2226. "We teach more than half of
the undergraduate classes ... but we are not treated in a way that
[indicates] what we are doing is really important."</TE>
<TE>   UCI has no plans to staff classes where lecturers don't show up,
university spokeswoman Lori Brandt said.</TE>
<TE>   Katherine Tate, head of the political science department, e-mailed
instructors thanking them for their "important work as lecturers in
political science." She asked those who planned to strike to notify
her office so "we may notify your students that class has been
canceled."</TE>
<TE>   Tonkovich called Cicerone's e-mail to students suggesting they
cross picket lines "extremely obnoxious and intimidating." The
chancellor "might also suggest that students have the right to
respect a picket line," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What students will do Monday is anyone's guess. "My guess is that
most will show up for class, poke their heads in, and if there's no
teacher there, they'll leave," said Kenneth Pomeranz, chairman of
UCI's history department.</TE>
<TE>   Abel Pena, editor of the campus' New University newspaper, said a
random survey by the paper found that "students seem to be behind the
lecturers. They think they're right doing what they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how students would react to the strike, he said, "At UCI,
students don't get very passionate about things. I don't expect
anything to happen. ... I'm not getting that vibe."</TE>

<HD>Santa Monicans Rally 'Round 'The Big Tree'</HD>
<DH>Development: Old cedar is at the center of a preservation
effort on property where condos are to be built.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe Biola University can turn the place into a branch campus.</LD>
<LD>   That's one of the suggestions tree lovers in Santa Monica are
making in hopes of saving a 100-year-old cedar that stands in the way
of development of a valuable city lot that the religious college has
inherited.</LD>
<LD>   The huge tree--and the double lot that it shades--was bequeathed
to the La Mirada-based school by an alumna who died six months ago.
The estate's trustee wants to sell the property to condominium
developers and give the money to the college.</LD>
<TE>   But a save-the-tree campaign has sprouted, led by a Redmond,
Wash., woman who spent her childhood climbing through the thick limbs
of the 81-foot wide Cedrus deodara.</TE>
<TE>   The tree was planted by the parents of Dorothy English, who died
last March at age 90. English, who never married, left a reported $12
million in stocks and real estate. She specified that three-fourths
of it go to Biola University, which was known as the Bible Institute
of Los Angeles when she graduated in 1936 with a degree in Christian
education.</TE>
<TE>   English lived most of her life in one of the two houses beneath
the cedar tree. She rented the lot's second house--a
turn-of-the-century Craftsman-style cottage--to Greyling Gentry's
family for nearly 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Dorothy loved that tree," said Gentry, now an administrator at a
Seattle software company. "She passed up many opportunities to sell
the lot to developers for a lot of money. She wanted that tree to be
preserved."</TE>
<TE>   Although the neighborhood was filled with bungalows and fruit
trees during Gentry's childhood, most of the other single-family
homes in the vicinity of what locals call "The Big Tree" have been
demolished and replaced with apartments and condominiums.</TE>
<TE>   "I have dreaded the day of Dorothy English's death my whole life,"
Gentry said. "I knew the tree would be in danger."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry returned to Santa Monica this week to organize a six-hour
rally, scheduled to start at 11 a.m. Sunday, beneath the tree at 918
N. 5th St. She and others will circulate petitions asking the city's
Landmark Commission to designate the cedar as a landmark when the
panel meets Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The tree preservation campaign is already having an effect.</TE>
<TE>   Townhouse developer Thomas Yu, who had agreed to buy the double
lot for more than $2 million, backed out on the half containing "The
Big Tree" this month when he heard of the community sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "I recommended to my client that he didn't want to take the tree
down, whether the city passed a law saying it's historical or not,"
said Sia Khajavi, a building consultant working with Yu.</TE>
<TE>   Khajavi was prepared to scale back the proposed condominium
development on that lot from five units to three to preserve the
tree. But he said the trustee liquidating English's estate had
refused to reduce the lot's $1,050,000 asking price accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Dave Marcinkus, a Culver City paralegal who was a friend
of English, said it is his responsibility to maximize her
contribution to Biola University.</TE>
<TE>   "She liked trees. But she didn't put the preservation of this one
in her will. She could have created a trust for the tree to protect
it, but she didn't," Marcinkus said.</TE>
<TE>   Marcinkus said he plans to attend Sunday's rally. "I have visions
of the old Frankenstein movie, with people with torches chasing me
down the street," he said. "But if it could be worked out, I'd like
to save the tree."</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Biola University officials are trying to distance
themselves from the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm used to dealing with stocks and things like that, not trees,"
said Gary Araujo, manager of the school office that coordinates
bequests. "I think Biola is certainly open to all the options
regarding this situation."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of "The Big Tree" say they have plenty of ideas on ways
to preserve the 60-foot cedar, which is 12 feet around at its base.</TE>
<TE>   They say the city could buy the lot or trade development rights
for it and turn it into a pocket park. Or Biola could convert the
Craftsman cottage into a university retreat that would also serve as
a memorial to English.</TE>
<TE>   "This tree is definitely worth saving," said Patrick Gaynes, an
investment banker who lives with his wife Elizabeth and son Truman,
2, in Gentry's old cottage. "A red-tail hawk lives in the tree. We
sometimes find people sitting in its branches and meditating."</TE>
<TE>   Landmark Commissioner Nina Fresco, who inspected the tree
Thursday, said a landmark designation would keep developers from
chopping down the tree without the city's approval.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Kevin McKeown, who is Santa Monica's mayor pro
tem, said trees such as the cedar "are as much a part of our history
as events or buildings."</TE>
<TE>   "The neighborhood has rallied around this tree," he said. "They
are literally on tree watch to make certain it doesn't get cut down."</TE>

<HD>County's Jobless Rate Dips in September</HD>
<DH>Economy: The 5.7% is just under August's figure and
compares with 6.1% statewide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hiring at local restaurants, expanding government payrolls and more
people working in the real estate, finance and insurance industries
helped lower Ventura County's jobless rate to 5.7% last month.</LD>
<LD>   This was down from a revised 5.8% in August, but higher than a
5.3% jobless rate in September 2001, according to a monthly report
released Friday by the state Employment Development Department. This
compares with 6.1% unemployment in California and 5.4% for the nation
last month, without seasonal adjustments.</LD>
<LD>   "A year ago, it was the all-time lowest September [unemployment
rate] in the history of record keeping. So we're just off the record
low," said Mark Schniepp, director of the California Economic
Forecast in Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   From August to September, 2,700 jobs were created in Ventura
County, with local education making up all of the month-to-month
increase as teachers returned to the classroom. This represented a
0.9% increase, to 301,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The county ranks 29th in terms of joblessness among the state's 58
counties. San Luis Obispo had the lowest unemployment in September,
at 3.2%, and Santa Barbara County had 3.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles and Riverside counties reported a 6.5% unemployment
rate. Imperial County had the highest unemployment at 22.1%.</TE>
<TE>   When last month's jobs picture is compared with September 2001,
the greatest gains in the county were at eating and drinking
establishments, up 600 jobs; state and local government, up 500
positions; and in the 400 jobs created in finance, insurance and real
estate--industries benefiting from the area's housing and refinancing
boom.</TE>
<TE>   Schniepp said it's not surprising the jobs report reflects more
spending at area eateries and pubs.</TE>
<TE>   "Business is still quite vibrant in Ventura County," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Unemployment is low and people have money coming in. People feel
real good when they see how much equity they have in their homes."</TE>
<TE>   But the steady climb in home prices also indicates that demand is
far outstripping supply, said Schniepp, adding that such factors are
not good for continued job creation. Nearly full employment coupled
with job growth of less than 1% suggests there is weakness in the
county's labor market.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a major housing crisis that is definitely impacting the
labor market here. Employers can't hire because there is no housing
for their workers--it's either not available or not affordable."</TE>
<TE>   In another economic report released Friday, home prices were
blamed for driving young, middle-income households away from Ventura
County.</TE>
<TE>   At a business outlook conference, the first-ever analysis of the
county's work force commissioned by the Ventura County Workforce
Investment Board maintained the lack of affordable dwellings has led
to overcrowding in residences and caused more middle-income families
to move to outlying areas to buy a home.</TE>
<TE>   The assessment--prepared by economists at UC Santa Barbara, Cal
Lutheran University and Solimar Research in Ventura--said the loss of
the middle class creates a "bipolar population," with high-income
baby boomers and lower-paid young workers on either side of the
divide.</TE>
<TE>   While Ventura County remains relatively affluent, with many
high-wage jobs, the report said the other end of the pay spectrum is
starkly different. Nearly half of the jobs in the county, 48.1%, pay
less than a poverty-level salary, according to the report, while only
one-sixth of the county's jobs pay $34,000 or more, which is about
twice the poverty level.</TE>
<TE>   The conference at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and
Museum was sponsored by the Ventura County Economic Development Assn.</TE>

<HD>Cooley Letter Decries Pressure From Mayor</HD>
<DH>Politics: D.A. calls Hahn's push for filing hate-crime
charges in attacks irresponsible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley accused Mayor James K.
Hahn on Friday of pandering to a "vigilante mentality" in trying to
pressure prosecutors into filing hate-crime charges in two West
Hollywood beatings last month.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Hahn, Cooley accused the mayor of using the memory
of Matthew Shepard, a man murdered in Wyoming because he was gay, as
a political tool. The letter called Hahn's advice "professionally
troubling and inflammatory."</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, Hahn told a crowd of 300 gathered to remember Shepard
in West Hollywood that Cooley's decision not to file hate-crime
charges in the Sept. 2 attacks had sent "the wrong message." Earlier,
Hahn sent a letter to Cooley saying that the decision had
"perpetuated the harm that was caused by these attacks."</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors have stated that no anti-gay epithets were yelled in
either attack on Sept. 2. In one beating, one of the victims
identified the alleged assailants; in the other, no identification
was made. Cooley's letter condemned Hahn, a former city attorney, for
judging the case without first reviewing the evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Your suggestion that I am sending the 'wrong message' in not
filing a hate crime is irresponsible and panders to a vigilante
mentality inconsistent with due process," the letter read. "I took an
oath to uphold the law as chief prosecutor of Los Angeles County. I
am responsible to the people, not the politicians."</TE>
<TE>   Actor Trev Broudy was attacked on Cynthia Street after hugging his
friend Edward Ulett. He was hit several times with a baseball bat and
spent more than a month in the hospital before being released this
week. That same morning, Christopher Roehm was also attacked.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office charged three South-Central men
with attempted robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy
to commit robbery, but did not file hate-crime allegations. The
defendants could be sentenced to six to 19 years in prison, if
convicted. An additional hate-crime charge could add two years.</TE>
<TE>   The decision prompted West Hollywood city leaders, sheriff's
deputies and the mayor to call upon Cooley to change his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said his office has not been given any evidence that the
crimes occurred because of the victims' sexual orientation. But the
cases are still under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   A third incident occurred Sept. 22, when a man, 55, was attacked
as the suspects yelled anti-gay epithets. No charges have yet been
filed in that case.</TE>

<HD>Free Flu Shots for Seniors Offered</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a little preventive medicine, the elderly may be able to get
through this year's flu season. That's what health experts are
telling Los Angeles County's older residents, who are most likely to
come down with the flu between December and March, the peak period
for infection.</LD>
<LD>   Volunteer nurses from the American Red Cross of Greater Los
Angeles will administer free flu vaccines to people older than 60
from Oct. 21 through Nov. 26 at several sites in Los Angeles, Burbank
and the Santa Clarita Valley. The agency is providing the service in
partnership with the county health department.</LD>
<LD>   "Getting a flu shot is a simple act of prevention that can reduce
incidence and severity of the flu," said Gail Silverman, Red Cross
director of vocational health care and training and community
outreach services.</LD>
<TE>   The elderly, pregnant women in their second or third trimester and
adults with heart, kidney or respiratory disease or an otherwise
compromised immune system are encouraged to get a flu shot, Silverman
said.</TE>
<TE>   This year's vaccine protects against three strains of the
virus--A/Moscow, A/New Caledonia and B/Hong Kong--that are likely to
cause illness among U.S. residents, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Influenza is caused by viruses that infect the respiratory tract.
Symptoms typically include a high fever, headache, extreme fatigue
and head congestion.</TE>
<TE>   Although most people recover within two weeks, Silverman said the
elderly have a difficult time battling the bug. "Senior citizens are
also most vulnerable to secondary illnesses, such as pneumonia, that
can be caused by the flu."</TE>
<TE>   Health officials advise elderly residents to get flu shots this
month to give the vaccine enough time to work before flu season
begins.</TE>

<HD>Judge's Ruling Extends Tenants' Subsidies</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jurist says that apartment building owners must
remain in federal program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has issued a preliminary
injunction preventing the owners of six buildings in Los Angeles from
removing their property from a federally subsidized housing program.</LD>
<LD>   The judgment is a victory for tenants, housing advocates and Mayor
James K. Hahn, who had argued that the owners violated state law by
failing to properly notify several public entities and tenants of
their intent to leave the program.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement, Hahn hailed the ruling and vowed to "continue to
fight to ensure that affordable housing tenants' rights are
protected."</LD>
<TE>   The ruling, issued Monday, affects six apartment buildings
scattered in South Los Angeles, some in the USC area, known as L.A.
Pro VI. Tenants of 127 units, who faced the possibility of higher
rent or displacement, can remain in place for at least 12 months,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's going to give us 12 months to work with owners and other
interested parties to keep these buildings affordable for the working
families and seniors who live there, " said Sarah Dusseault,
assistant deputy mayor for economic development.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Chaplan, an attorney representing the owners of four of the
buildings, has appealed the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "In this issue the statute simply didn't apply to our client,"
Chaplan said.</TE>
<TE>   His client, he said, "intends to continue being a quality
low-income housing provider," and is open to discussion with the
city.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the city's argument is a 2-year-old state law
concerning the federal housing program commonly known as Section 8.
Under the program, the federal government pays the bulk of a
low-income tenant's rent.</TE>
<TE>   The law requires owners who wish to leave the program to notify
tenants 12 months in advance. Several public entities must also be
notified, including the California Housing and Community Development
Department and the local mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The notice allows public officials to search for ways to keep the
units affordable or find solutions for the tenants who stand to face
higher rent or lose their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Housing advocates had asked the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development to reject the owners' application to leave the
program, arguing that HUD's regulations require owners to comply with
state and local laws.</TE>
<TE>   But local HUD officials took the opposite view. They said the
federal agency had no obligation to enforce state law and approved
the owners' application to leave the program.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with HUD's decision, and the impending end of the owner's
contract with HUD, the city took the rare step of seeking an
injunction.</TE>
<TE>   In the ruling issued Monday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge
Reginald A. Dunn said the owners' "alleged violation of state law
will irreparably harm the city of Los Angeles and James K. Hahn by
preventing the affected low-income tenants from obtaining proper
notice and an opportunity to properly protect themselves...."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Atty. Jennifer Gregg, who with Richard Bobb
represented the city in the case, said the ruling means the owners
must enter into a new contract with HUD.</TE>
<TE>   "If HUD is willing to renew the contract for an additional period,
the owners are required to accept that renewal," Gregg said. "HUD has
indicated it is willing to renew the contract if funding is
available."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Gross of the Coalition for Economic Survival, a tenant
advocacy group that worked for months to resolve the dispute, said
the impact of the ruling extends beyond the six buildings involved.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this sends a tremendous message to owners who are looking
to opt out or prepay that if they intend to do this, they have to
comply with the laws or else the city of L.A. will take actions to
ensure that they do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dusseault added: "I think it sends a message to the federal
government as well as to the owners."</TE>
<TE>   Last month the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles filed a lawsuit
accusing the owners of failing to comply with the federal and state
noticing requirements. Attorneys for the owners have not yet answered
the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "For now the tenants are protected," said Legal Aid staff attorney
Christian Abasto. "We're not going to file any motions, as long as
the owner applies to renew the Section 8 contract and as long as HUD
approves it."</TE>
<TE>   Before the lawsuit was filed, the foundation had contacted HUD
with concerns about the lack of adherence to noticing laws, Abasto
said. Local HUD officials did not respond.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of Section 8 housing has been a growing concern for
housing advocates and Los Angeles officials. In 2001 and 2002, city
officials said, about 325 units have been withdrawn from the program.</TE>

<LD>Hard hats, soft language: Ann Farmer passed along an article from
Whittier College's newspaper about the restrictions on workers
renovating a library there. "Since the work is taking place on a
campus known for its Quaker roots," the newspaper said, the building
contract forbade raucous behavior, including cursing.</LD>
<LD>   The workers "followed these rules," one school official told the
newspaper. "I actually saw a rather large construction worker drop a
piece of equipment on his foot and yell, 'Oh, drat!' "</LD>
<LD>   There's always a Hollywood angle: Doug Stokes of Duarte saw an ad
that mentioned the small amount that movie extras get paid in this
era of multimillion-dollar projects (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   I could understand if it referred to teenagers: Harold Knox of
Woodland Hills came upon a warning to parents that parodied
no-parking signs (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   On the road: A Culver City reader who signed himself "W.B."
noticed a turnoff for an Austrian village whose name might be a
turn-off for some Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, he said, Rottenegg "translates to something like like
red furrow."</TE>
<TE>   And Fred Booth of Costa Mesa was one of several readers who've
sent along shots of parking signs seemingly mentioning X-rated fires.
Actually, they refer to lighted matches (see photos).</TE>
<TE>   You think you have problems: In Seal Beach, "a resident complained
of a business' front door 'dinging' whenever someone enters," said
the police log of the Los Alamitos News-Enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   The SWAT team wasn't needed here, either: A Laguna Beach resident
said a dog had been barking nonstop in the neighborhood, and when she
contacted the owners "their response was, 'He's a beagle, that's what
he does.' " But, the Laguna News-Post said, when police went to the
location the dog was quiet.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Insult of the Day: Those snooty Easterners are at it again.
In an article on the competition between JetBlue Airways and
Southwest Airlines, the New York Times referred to Southern
California as a "land of strip malls and stucco houses." Oh, drat.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: My wife and I casually remarked to a young shop clerk
that it was our 15th anniversary. He stared at her in disbelief. We
asked him why he seemed so surprised. He laughed and replied, "Oh, I
thought you said '50th anniversary.' " He couldn't believe, he said,
that my wife had been married that long. He never mentioned me, I
realized later. I'm so glad the weekend's here.</TE>

<HD>Toxic Waste Firms Cited as Environmental Lawbreakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The operators of two Vernon companies that collected and disposed of
hazardous wastes from dry-cleaning establishments and auto repair
shops have been indicted on charges of violating federal
environmental laws, the U.S. attorney's office said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Until it was shut down in January 2001, AAD Dry Cleaning Services
was one of California's largest handlers of the dry-cleaning compound
called perchloroethylene, commonly known as PERC.</LD>
<LD>   PERC, a cancer-causing chemical, is the No. 1 contaminant of
groundwater in Southern California, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Named in a 19-count indictment returned Thursday were Homayoun
Pourat, 40, of Beverly Hills, the company's president; Hormoz Pourat,
44, of Encino, company vice president; and Behzad Kahoolyzadeh, 49,
of West Los Angeles, also known as Behzad Cohen, a manager at the
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. William Carter said that AAD Dry Cleaning
Services would pick up PERC waste from various dry-cleaning
establishments in 55-gallon drums, guaranteeing proprietors that the
substances would be stored and disposed of in accordance with all
applicable hazardous waste laws.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the indictment alleged, the company stored the drums at
the Vernon facility in amounts that greatly exceeded its hazardous
waste permit and in drums that were not certified for such use.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment also charged that company executives stored some of
the drums at sites in Paramount and Chino that did not have permits
to accommodate hazardous wastes. Cleanup costs at the sites exceeded
$600,000, Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   Homayoun Pourat is a fugitive, authorities said. Hormoz Pourat is
in custody in Colorado on charges related to AAD's operation in that
state. Kahoolyzadeh was arrested Friday in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A second indictment was returned against the Pourats alone in
connection with their operation of Right Choice, a company located
next door to AAD, that arranged for the disposal of hazardous and
flammable solvents from auto repair shops and other businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment charged that Right Choice did not have a permit to
store hazardous wastes on its premises and that the Pourats tried to
conceal their activities by temporarily moving the waste materials to
other locations just before government inspectors arrived.</TE>

<HD>Afghans in a Post-Taliban 'Era of Hope,' Bush Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN and SONNI EFRON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A year after U.S. forces began the military campaign that overthrew
Afghanistan's Taliban regime, President Bush on Friday declared that
the Central Asian nation has "entered a new era of hope" and he
promised sustained American involvement in its reconstruction and
stability.</LD>
<LD>   But even as Bush delivered his upbeat report, experts warned that
the Afghan people still face political insecurity and the specter of
famine and disease. The president acknowledged such threats in
passing but emphasized the progress.</LD>
<LD>   Bush spoke just hours after winning solid congressional support to
coerce Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to get rid of any weapons of
mass destruction--or face military action.</LD>
<TE>   And the subtext of Bush's argument was unmistakable: The Iraqis
can expect better days ahead in a post-Hussein regime, just as the
lives of most Afghans have improved since the Taliban was driven from
power after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke in a White House auditorium filled with several hundred
aid workers, Afghan nationals and Afghan Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "The institutions of free debate and free press are taking hold"
in Afghanistan, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also provided updates on aid funneled to the country, noting
that the U.N. World Food Program, with U.S. support, has provided
632,500 tons of food to nearly 10 million Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States has also provided seed and fertilizer in time
for the spring planting season," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-led attack on the Taliban began Oct. 7, 2001. Almost
simultaneously, Bush began promoting various aid programs to help
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Bush reported Friday, America's children have
contributed more than $10.5 million to "America's Fund for Afghan
Children," which he created. He urged them to continue giving.</TE>
<TE>   "We also understand that Afghanistan needs long-term economic
reconstruction help," Bush said, "and we will meet this commitment as
well."</TE>
<TE>   At an international conference in Tokyo in January, the U.S. and
60 other nations pledged $4.5 billion over five years for
reconstruction projects. But the World Bank has conservatively
estimated that Afghanistan will need $10.2 billion over that period.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is also in the process of helping form a national army in
Afghanistan. "The idea is to train 18 battalions of over 10,000
soldiers and finish the task by the end of next year," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Another project calls for spending $180 million--to be jointly
funded by the U.S., Japan and Saudi Arabia--to build a highway
linking the cities of Kabul, Kandahar and Herat.</TE>
<TE>   The president's upbeat assessment came amid growing concern that
Afghanistan's dire problems will become an afterthought if the U.S.
embarks on military action and possibly an occupation of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In one sign of that concern, experts at a Council on Foreign
Relations discussion in Washington agreed that peace in Afghanistan
is fragile and chaos could reign again if international support
falters.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this fall, State Department officials warned that the slow
arrival of aid has forced the United Nations to be stingier with the
"welcome home" package that it had been handing out to returning
Afghan refugees. The program initially was funded with $271 million
to provide for a presumed 800,000 refugees, and new arrivals were
given 330 pounds of wheat to help weather their first winter.</TE>
<TE>   But instead, more than 1.7 million refugees flooded back. Strapped
agencies could give new arrivals only 110 pounds of wheat--enough to
feed a family of four for one month--and a voucher for 220 pounds
more.</TE>
<TE>   James Kunder, deputy administrator for the U.S. Agency for
International Development, or USAID, said spring planting aid has
produced an 82% increase in cereal crop production in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not prepared to say that we will have a hunger-free winter
in Afghanistan," Kunder said. But he said the overall food situation
has improved since summer.</TE>
<TE>   USAID is spending $7 million in emergency infrastructure work.
These include repairs now underway on the Salang Tunnel, through the
Hindu Kush mountains, to ensure that the vital main artery that leads
north from Kabul, the Afghan capital, stays open for winter food
shipments, Kunder said.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Lindborg, executive vice president of Mercy Corps, which has
been running relief programs in Afghanistan for 15 years, said the
U.S. aid is "an eyedropper" compared with the military campaign costs
in that nation. She lauded Bush's commitment to helping rebuild but
said the U.S. must follow up with more assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. has been generous, but the needs are enormous,
particularly with the onset of winter," said Arthur C. Helton, a
humanitarian issues specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations in
New York. "And the distraction of Iraq will tend to cause Afghanistan
to come off the radar screen."</TE>
<TE>   "It's very fair to give the administration mixed reviews," Helton
added. "On the narrow security question, a certain amount has been
accomplished. In terms of beginning to see anything like a
functioning state, all that exists is a putative government that
doesn't have a reach beyond Kabul."</TE>
<TE>   "Is it fragile? Yes," said a State Department official who
requested anonymity. But he insisted, "We realize what we have to do
in Afghanistan, and we're going to continue to do it."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Now in for the Long Haul</HD>
<DH>Iraq: War can be avoided, but not involvement in a
transformation of the regime, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Armed with broad congressional authorization to confront Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, the Bush administration is charting a
course leading to war--or to the Iraqi regime fundamentally
transforming itself in order to prevent it.</LD>
<LD>   Either way, the United States is now in it for the long haul.
Conflict can still be avoided, administration officials insisted
Friday. But that can only happen, they argue, by planning
simultaneously for a military campaign and the ouster of the Iraqi
regime--and Washington is in the thick of preparations for both.</LD>
<LD>   "The best way to avoid war is for us to be strong now, both here
in the United States and within the United Nations, in order to show
that the will of the international community must be obeyed,"
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Friday on National Public
Radio's "All Things Considered."</LD>
<TE>   The administration's pledge that war would be the last resort won
over wavering senators in the wee hours Friday morning to approve a
resolution authorizing the use of force. It's also a recurrent theme
as the administration moves the forum of debate from Congress to the
international stage at the United Nations, where the U.S. and Britain
are still struggling to convince France and Russia to adopt the same
language.</TE>
<TE>   But the reality is that virtually no one involved in planning for
war at the Pentagon or preparing for its aftermath at the State
Department and National Security Council now thinks the Iraqi leader
will completely back down.</TE>
<TE>   The focus is on the postwar "management" of Iraq, a period of
effective military occupation during a government transition. The
U.S. military, probably as part of a coalition, would be responsible
for holding Iraq together in the upheaval after a conflict until the
transfer to a new Iraqi government, the White House said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   As a model, they cite the U.S. role in Afghanistan after the
Taliban's ouster rather than the prolonged military occupation of
Germany or Japan after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   But the administration hopes any transition would include allies
as well as Iraqis. And it would unfold in phases. One likely scenario
would be brief coalition military management of Iraq handing over to
coalition civilian managers who would bring in Iraqis until a final
transfer to Iraqi rule, according to senior U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the administration's intention, along with those of our
allies and the international community, that if military force is
used in Iraq, Saddam Hussein is removed, that Iraq not fall apart,
for humanitarian reasons and for the stability of the region," White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "So the administration is working to find ways to help achieve
stability for Iraq and for the region," he said. "And we are
considering a variety of ways to do so with our international
partners, with the possibility of the United Nations, the possible
role of U.S. Civil Affairs units" to deliver services to Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   The "postliberation" role of the U.S. military also would include
accounting for and destroying any weapons of mass destruction,
reunifying Iraq, maintaining border security, providing humanitarian
assistance and helping map out reconstruction plans to ensure the
restoration of institutions and basic services, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to very quickly transfer governmental power to the Iraqi
people.... And as we are doing so, we want to make certain that there
is stability in Iraq, that people can be fed, that electricity can be
on, that heat can be provided," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the array of duties, U.S. military analysts predict a
major commitment of troops.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be prepared for a military occupation that could start
at 150,000 total international forces and could stay above 100,000
for several years," Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings Institution fellow,
said at a conference last week sponsored by the American Enterprise
Institute in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's increasingly public preparations for war and
for a post-Hussein Iraq can be seen in part as a grand diplomatic
bluff--a gamble that noisy saber-rattling will either force the
Baghdad regime to back down or inspire Iraqis to change their
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this will not require military action, but it may,"
President Bush said in a speech Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. demands will be hard to meet. Besides surrendering
any weapons of mass destruction, Hussein would have to end repressive
rule, stop support for terrorism, cut off illegal multibillion-dollar
oil smuggling, and pay war reparations and account for prisoners from
the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Bush said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "If Saddam decides to get right with the world, he can do these
things. We have to give it a chance for the sake of the international
community, to make the case responsibly that we've tried everything
short of war," a senior State Department official said Friday. "But
if he doesn't do them, all of them, then we have to do something.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing in our experience that would let us believe that
Saddam will really comply, that he won't screw this up," the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   The administration, with the congressional resolution as leverage,
will underscore that point next week as it begins a concerted
campaign to break the impasse at the U.N. on a united Iraq strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to the U.N. to look for a reason to go to war,"
Powell said on NPR. "We're going to the U.N. to look for a way of
disarming this very dangerous regime. But the only way that will work
is if there are consequences for his failure to disarm, his failure
to act."</TE>
<TE>   Powell is scheduled to meet with British Foreign Secretary Jack
Straw in Washington on Tuesday to map out strategy.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. diplomats will be dispatched overseas to rally backing among
the permanent members of the Security Council and the 10 elected
members, and Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage is
expected to give a major speech, U.S. officials said.</TE>

<HD>Musharraf's Allies, Rivals Lack Majority</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: The PML-Q and the opposition party led by Benazir
Bhutto will have to court an Islamic coalition for a mandate to
govern.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Voters have denied any political party an outright majority in this
week's election, which could leave anti-American Islamic mullahs
holding the balance of power in parliament and control of a province
that is key to the U.S.-declared war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   With most of the ballots counted Friday, the election was still a
tossup between allies of President Pervez Musharraf and the
opposition Pakistan People's Party, headed by exiled former Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto.</LD>
<LD>   But with neither side likely to have gained a mandate to govern in
Thursday's balloting, they will have to bargain for support in the
National Assembly from the United Council of Action, a coalition of
six Islamic parties.</LD>
<TE>   Official results were announced today for all but six of the
National Assembly's 342 seats. They showed that the Pakistan Muslim
League-Q, the pro-Musharraf faction that broke away from a major
party, was leading with 77 seats. Bhutto's party had won 62.</TE>
<TE>   The Islamic coalition was running third with 49 seats, while the
original PML, headed by exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,
was running a distant fourth with 16 seats.</TE>
<TE>   Independent candidates and smaller parties, along with women and
minorities who were guaranteed a certain number of seats, accounted
for the rest. However, just hours before the polls opened Thursday,
Musharraf issued an edict forcing independent candidates to join an
approved party within three days of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   The United Council of Action won a majority of seats in the
North-West Frontier Province's assembly, allowing it to form the
local government in a region bordering Afghanistan. Pakistani forces
there are hunting Al Qaeda and Taliban holdouts with the aid of U.S.
forces.</TE>
<TE>   The council is a loose coalition of hard-line mullahs and more
politically pragmatic leaders. The group even bridges the bloody
divide between minority Shiite and majority Sunni Muslims, who have
carried out terrorist attacks against each other for years.</TE>
<TE>   The clerics' new political strength could embolden opponents of
U.S. policies and military operations here and in Afghanistan to make
demands in exchange for their support of a new national government.</TE>
<TE>   Although Musharraf has promised to hand over civil authority to a
prime minister appointed by the new National Assembly, he remains
president and commander of the armed forces. As such, he is unlikely
to allow major changes in foreign and defense policy. But he could
soften his campaign against Islamic extremism within Pakistan,
complicating U.S. efforts to deny terrorists a haven here.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Islamic coalition's leaders are hawks on the
dispute with India over the divided Kashmir region and could
complicate Western efforts to ease tensions between the nuclear-armed
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's critics, such as the independent Human Rights
Commission of Pakistan and mainstream opposition parties, argue that
he has been backtracking for months on his commitment to curb
extremism, in part to curry favor with Islamic parties in the run-up
to Thursday's vote.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has succeeded in weakening the influence of Pakistan's
two main parties by banning their exiled leaders, Bhutto and Sharif,
from running. In turn, the president has built up allies in the
breakaway PML-Q.</TE>
<TE>   Musa Hitam of Malaysia, head of a team of election observers from
the British Commonwealth, gave guarded approval to this week's
balloting while also giving credence to opposition charges of
pre-poll manipulations.</TE>
<TE>   "Of particular concern have been allegations of the widespread use
of government influence and resources to favor certain parties and
candidates and, conversely, to disadvantage others," he told
reporters Friday. "This has raised doubts as to whether it can be
said that the playing field was truly level."</TE>
<TE>   Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the Islamic coalition's secretary-general
and a leader of the influential Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam party, said
the group has not decided which party it would be willing to join in
a coalition government.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to Islamabad with an open mind, and we have our own
priorities," Rehman said Friday by telephone from his hometown, Dera
Ismail Khan, about 190 miles southwest of the capital, Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   Those priorities include "molding the constitution in accordance
with the Islamic teachings, so that people should live a true Islamic
life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition campaigned on a wide range of populist promises that
include better protection for workers, more power for Pakistan's four
provinces and what it calls a peaceful Islamic revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Taliban, the Islamic regime ousted from power in
Afghanistan last fall by U.S.-led troops, the coalition has demanded
a ban on music, dancing and coeducational schools. Its supporters
prevented many women from voting in the ethnic Pushtun tribal areas
bordering Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of Pakistanis reject the coalition's interpretation
of Islam, but the mullahs apparently have touched a nerve in their
campaign against the U.S.-led war on Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters
along both sides of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Although most Pakistanis support Musharraf's decision to abandon
the Taliban and round up suspected terrorists, many resent U.S.
intelligence and military forces operating on Pakistani soil, largely
beyond public scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   The religious coalition "wants equal and balanced relations with
the West and the U.S.," Rehman said. "But the U.S. would have to
moderate its policy. The U.S. should also give up its desire to
establish its superiority in the region."</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. should realize that Pakistan is an independent country,"
he added, "and the U.S. should respect our national sovereignty,
which would help in establishing durable relations between the two
countries."</TE>
<TE>   While campaigning last month, another council leader vowed to end
Pakistan's cooperation with U.S. military operations if the Islamic
parties were voted into power.</TE>
<TE>   "The decisions of the government that are against the wishes of
the people--like giving Pakistani air bases to the United States or
allowing U.S. planes to use Pakistani airspace for attacks on
Afghanistan--we will continue to oppose," Qazi Hussain Ahmed said.
"We will withdraw this support."</TE>
<TE>   On the domestic front, the Islamic parties probably will press for
easing the strict controls on madrasas, or religious schools, that
Musharraf imposed in an effort to moderate institutions that in some
cases have served as breeding grounds for militant Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Under the regulations, an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 madrasas were
supposed to register with the government and begin teaching about 1.5
million students math, science, English and social studies on top of
the traditional rote memorization of the Koran. Clerics caught
preaching militancy and sectarian hatred in madrasas would face up to
two years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The clerics mounted fierce opposition to the new rules, which many
simply ignored. The government minister responsible for religious
affairs resigned in apparent sympathy with their cause.</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of Thursday's vote, the Musharraf regime said it was
leaving a decision on the law to the new government because weeks of
talks had failed to resolve the dispute. Religious leaders can now
claim a strong mandate to demand significant changes to the
regulations.</TE>

<HD>Inside the Mind of a Dictator</HD>
<DH>Profile: Experts say Hussein is ruthless but afraid,
cunning but error-prone. And he's eerily unpredictable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONNI EFRON and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Saddam Hussein rules by fear, but he is also ruled by his fears.</LD>
<LD>   The Iraqi president spends ever more time in the many bunkers
beneath his ornate palaces. He rarely sleeps more than one night in
the same place. He receives visitors only after they have been
thoroughly searched and had their hands disinfected in up to three
liquids. He uses food tasters, and special teams test everything the
president might touch: bed linens, toiletries, clothes, ink.</LD>
<LD>   Each day, meals are prepared for him at palaces around Iraq, so no
one can know where he will dine. He gives televised speeches from
more than a dozen identical conference rooms, so no one can know
where he is. He even employs surgically enhanced presidential
doubles, so no one can know who he is.</LD>
<TE>   "He's afraid all the time," said Ahmed Samarrai, a former
lieutenant colonel in Hussein's security force. "He likes to escape.
He likes to hide. He likes to be underground, in bunkers. He only
sleeps two or three hours ... and he is always armed."</TE>
<TE>   This portrait, painted by Iraqi defectors, weapons inspectors,
scholars, current and former U.S. intelligence officials and other
experts in the United States, Europe and Israel, makes Hussein sound
like a madman. Yet the experts place him in the ranks of sane but
ruthless dictators who have ruled by terror, political cunning and
personality cults.</TE>
<TE>   As the United States prepares to go to war with Hussein for the
second time in nearly 12 years, military and political analysts are
mining these glimpses of his personality for clues to his likely
diplomatic and military moves: Can Hussein be made to give up his
weapons of mass destruction in exchange for his survival? Would he
unleash a chemical or biological holocaust on invading U.S. troops?
If he knew that he was about to be deposed, would he attempt to
annihilate Israel or unleash a terrorist attack on America with
weapons of mass destruction?</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that experts disagree on the answers. In fact,
Hussein's mind-set is the subject of a high-stakes debate in the Bush
administration, especially after a CIA letter this week asserted that
Hussein is unlikely to use his lethal arsenal against the U.S. unless
he comes under military attack.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein, 65, is one of the most secretive, heavily guarded leaders
in the world. Despite years of study--and during his 23-year rule
Hussein has been studied as much as any leader since Josef Stalin--he
remains an enigma to the West.</TE>
<TE>   The Times based this story on a spectrum of sources--from former
U.S. security officials and Iraqi opposition leaders to Middle
Eastern writers and European academics. Some favor toppling Hussein,
while others have deep misgivings about past and present U.S. policy
toward Iraq. The diverse experts concurred on many facts about the
Iraqi ruler; they differed over to what lengths he would go to resist
attempts to disarm his regime.</TE>
<TE>   Some defectors and political observers say Hussein is the
consummate survivor who would do anything to stay in power, including
give up weapons of mass destruction. These people insist that he is
not suicidal and will back off, at least temporarily, if he can do so
without humiliation or displays of weakness that would leave him prey
to internal enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Others take the view that Hussein has a messianic complex fueled
by his survival of coups, assassination attempts and the wrath of
U.S. presidents, and may choose to go out in a blaze. He is convinced
that his divine mission is to restore the oppressed Arab world to its
former glory, some observers say, and may sacrifice his life to
secure his legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts regard Hussein as essentially a thug who sees the
world in the stark terms of the professional gunman he once was. They
predict that he will resort to massive violence to defeat the Bush
administration's efforts to bring about a "regime change" in Baghdad.
Hussein is most dangerous when he is cornered, they say. If "regime
change" means a bullet to the brain, the Iraqi president is not
likely to go quietly.</TE>
<TE>   "He would like to try to survive, but I believe he knows that if
we come back this time, we're not going to let him off the way we
did" in previous confrontations, said former CIA Director R. James
Woolsey, a hard-liner on Iraq. "I think he would like to be
remembered as someone who has wreaked maximum destruction on what
[Osama] bin Laden calls the Crusaders and the Jews. He will
definitely try to wreak maximum destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Those who have made a career of watching Hussein say he is a study
in contradictions, at once clever and prone to miscalculation. He
claims that he can look into people's eyes and know whether they will
betray him before they know it themselves. He plants provocateurs to
ensnare potential traitors. And he has a talent for dividing his
enemies, as shown by the current dispute in the United Nations over
how to deal with him.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not impulsive, only acts after judicious consideration and
can be extremely patient," said Jerrold Post, a former CIA
psychiatrist and now director of the political psychology program at
George Washington University who has studied Hussein for years.
"Indeed, he uses time as a weapon."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Hussein is dangerously isolated and apt to make catastrophic
mistakes in foreign affairs. His invasion of Kuwait in 1990 resulted
from a fundamental misreading of signals from the United States and
the West, experts say. In the subsequent battle with an overwhelming
international force, he let domestic political considerations trump
the seemingly rational course of withdrawing from Kuwait because he
judged that he could not afford the loss of face at home.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein studied law at the University of Cairo and in Baghdad, but
he has rarely traveled outside the Middle East. Although he watches
Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite news station, and even CNN, analysts
say he often gets limited and distorted information.</TE>
<TE>   "No one in his inner circle really understands the workings of the
outside world," said Remy Leveau, a former French envoy in the Middle
East and professor at the Institute for Political Studies in Paris.
"The few who might understand the world are afraid to tell him the
truth. He is the classic primitive dictator."</TE>
<TE>   Iron Rule Resembles That of Stalin</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi leader sees himself on par with Stalin--whom he
admires--as well as China's Mao Tse-tung and former Egyptian
President Gamal Abdel Nasser. According to the biography "Saddam
Hussein: The Politics of Revenge," by Said Aburish, a Kurdish leader
visited Hussein in his palace soon after the Iraqi seized power in
1979. The new president had just awakened and wore a bathrobe when he
welcomed the visitor, Mahmoud Othman.</TE>
<TE>   There was a military cot in the office, indicating that Hussein
had slept there after putting in a typical 17-hour day. Next to the
bed, Othman saw 12 pairs of expensive shoes--the indulgence of a man
who had gone barefoot as a peasant boy.</TE>
<TE>   "And the rest of the office was nothing but a small library full
of books about one man, Stalin," Othman said. "One could say he went
to bed with the Russian dictator."</TE>
<TE>   Like Stalin, Hussein has used violence to maintain his grip on
power. He has executed underlings who dared to disagree with him,
sometimes shooting the offender on the spot, according to U.S.
officials and defectors. He has also allegedly given pistols to aides
and ordered them to shoot, thus making them his accomplices.</TE>
<TE>   But death is not necessarily the punishment that those who serve
Hussein fear most. The Iraqi regime is notorious for forcing
suspected turncoats to watch videotapes of their wives being raped
and their children tortured, according to numerous defector accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody can look in his eyes," said Samarrai, who defected in
1998. "You feel he could shatter you.... One year he killed three
guards ... because they tried to steal some of his shoes."</TE>
<TE>   There are, nonetheless, a few stories of Hussein showing kindness
to people who had treated him well. In one, he saved a Jewish Iraqi
from the torture chamber, according to biographer Aburish, because
the man had tipped him generously when Hussein had sold him
cigarettes on the streets as a child.</TE>
<TE>   By most accounts, Hussein keeps his own counsel and has not
consulted aides about some of his most vital foreign policy moves.
The solitary decisions were his worst, made "when the leader felt
omnipotent and invincible, while at the same time his pride was hurt,
and he believed that he and Iraq were being wronged," wrote Amatzia
Baram of the University of Haifa, one of Israel's leading Hussein
watchers.</TE>
<TE>   "When his advisors feel that the leader's mind is made up, they
agree with him," Baram wrote. "They prefer to go down with the ship
eventually rather than be tossed overboard immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Among a handful of close advisors, Deputy Prime Minister Tarik
Aziz can speak with relative frankness, said Iyad Allawi, leader of
the Iraqi National Accord, or INA, a London-based opposition group.
But even Aziz avoids upsetting his president, Allawi said.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's isolation has increased since the 1991 Persian Gulf War,
as he has suffered betrayals from his most trusted circles: his
family, his clan and his army.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, after a shootout with Hussein's eldest son, Uday, two of
Hussein's sons-in-law defected to Jordan and spilled secrets about
Iraqi weapons programs. They were persuaded to return--and
immediately were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, Hussein has had 53 of his relatives killed, according
to Mustafa Alani, an Iraq expert at the Royal United Services
Institute for Defense, a think tank in London.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's army reportedly has been demoralized by the country's
failure to win the Iran-Iraq war and by the crushing defeat in the
Gulf War. There have been at least four coup attempts since 1990,
according to Baram. Some of those executed belonged to the Republican
Guard and the Special Republican Guard, the units that are supposed
to be the best trained and most loyal.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the Iraqi regime has threatened its own military
commanders with chemical attacks if they attempt an uprising,
according to Allawi, whose organization has frequent secret contact
with Iraqi officials.</TE>
<TE>   More paranoid than ever, Hussein moves every night with a security
force of about 3,600 guards, including antitank and antiaircraft
personnel and a field hospital, according to Iraqi defectors. He even
has three identical trucks equipped with bedrooms, former United
Nations weapons inspector Scott Ritter said.</TE>
<TE>   "For the secular-minded Saddam, security consciousness is the
equivalent of religious fervor," wrote the CIA's Regis W. Matlak in
an unclassified article.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's recent public statements indicate an awareness that his
power could be weakening, according to Abbas Al-Jabani, who was once
an architect of the regime's propaganda programs. He said Hussein has
taken to the airwaves proclaiming the Iraqi people to be partners in
his struggle to keep the Zionists and the Americans from destroying
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi leader is convinced of the moral weakness of the West,
its inability to accept mass casualties and its fundamental
inferiority to Arab civilization, experts say. Hussein seized Western
hostages as "human shields" in 1990 because he calculated that the
U.S. would be too squeamish to blow up targets to which its citizens
were strapped.</TE>
<TE>   Now some think that he is betting on the West's fear of mass
casualties from biological or chemical strikes.</TE>
<TE>   High-ranking defectors insist that Hussein believes his deadly
arsenal kept him from losing the Iran-Iraq war and enabled him to
survive the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not grateful to us for backing off in '91," said Woolsey,
the former CIA director. "He believes it was his resolution and his
possession of chemical and bacteriological weapons that did it. And
he sees these as his only real trump cards."</TE>
<TE>   That outlook makes Hussein inherently hostile to disarmament, the
stated aim of the international community in this confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   "He cannot comply fully with the kind of demilitarization that the
U.S. is looking for because his weapons of mass destruction are the
be-all and end-all of this regime--what he is all about," said Kanan
Makiya, an Iraqi defector affiliated with Harvard University who
wrote a book about Iraqi politics titled "Republic of Fear."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, if it is true that part of Iraq's chemical and
biological arsenal is stashed inside Hussein's palaces, his obsession
with his personal safety is likely to interfere with inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Iraqi officials have told foreign diplomats that Hussein
will never allow unfettered access to his palaces because he believes
that the weapons inspectors will send his coordinates to U.S. missile
launchers or even plant special devices to kill him slowly with
radioactive rays.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone who knows Iraq well thinks that Hussein will
fight to the death; they predict that he would relinquish his weapons
if he were faced with annihilation.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd quite cheerfully give up whatever weapons he has to avoid
being killed," said Nathaniel Kern, an Arabist and president of
Foreign Reports Inc., a Washington-based consulting firm. In the end,
Kern predicted, "he will let in the weapons inspectors unless he
thinks he will be killed anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's manipulation of the U.N. inspection programs shows a
talent for diplomatic bait-and-switch. He is patient, shameless about
reversing course if expedient, and uninhibited about lying, experts
say. In the last two weeks, he has helped to divide the United States
and Britain from the rest of the U.N. Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   "The man will do everything diplomatically to avoid war," said
Alani, the London academic. "He has reached the conclusion that war
is coming. He's resigned to it. But he's hoping something will happen
to divert the attention of the Americans. Possibly another 9/11, a
major terrorist attack. Or a scandal that will shake the credibility
of the Bush administration. That's why he's playing for time."</TE>
<TE>   During the Gulf War, Hussein was shocked that neighboring Arab
countries sided with the West and provided the bases from which to
attack him. He has since moved to improve his regional position.
Kuwait, Jordan and Saudi Arabia remain hostile, but tensions with
Iran and Turkey are somewhat reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein has cleverly co-opted Syria since the death of his old
Baathist rival, Hafez Assad. Assad's son and successor, Bashar, now
benefits from a deal by which Syria buys about 150,000 barrels of
Iraqi oil a day at half the world market price, Kern said. The deal
skirts U.N. sanctions by allowing the Syrians to export more of their
own oil, while Iraq gets revenues it can spend without the fetters of
the U.N. "oil-for-food" program. U.S. and Israeli officials worry
that the money has gone straight to Hussein's weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   In another gambit aimed at Muslims at home and abroad, Hussein has
burnished his Islamic credentials. Although his Baathist ideology is
socialist and secular, Hussein has built gargantuan mosques and has
put up billboards around Baghdad showing himself kneeling on a prayer
mat.</TE>
<TE>   Not only has he wrapped himself in the Islamic flag, but he also
had the words "Allahu akbar" (God is great) emblazoned across the
flag of Iraq in his own handwriting, Woolsey said.</TE>
<TE>   One of Hussein's mosques is said to house a museum that displays a
copy of the Koran--605 pages--purportedly written with 36 liters of
Hussein's blood. Whether or not the ink flowed from his own veins,
the holy book is testament to Hussein's determination to portray
himself as devout.</TE>
<TE>   Still Confident of Global Support</TE>
<TE>   The West has interpreted Hussein's moves to mean that if the U.N.
does not lift its economic embargo against Iraq, he might push the
secular nation into the Muslim fundamentalist camp.</TE>
<TE>   According to defectors, Hussein believes that the Arab street will
rise up in solidarity with him against the West. Years of playing cat
and mouse with weapons inspectors and fending off the effects of
sanctions and punitive bombing raids have won Hussein some Arab
admirers, but perhaps not as many as he believes.</TE>
<TE>   "He thinks the world will be on his side," said French analyst
Leveau. "He misreads the extent of his support."</TE>
<TE>   If words give way to war and Hussein sees that he cannot win, many
predict that he will repeat a long-standing pattern of lashing out at
other targets.</TE>
<TE>   In early 1991, as his armies were forced to retreat from Kuwait
and bombs rained down on Baghdad, Hussein ordered the Kuwaiti oil
fields set ablaze and sent oil pouring into the Persian Gulf. Some
analysts worry that this time, a cornered or defeated Hussein could
torch his own oil fields, the world's second-largest, in order to
keep them out of the hands of American occupiers.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein ordered the failed assassination attempt on former
President George Bush in 1993 and arranged the killings of his own
sons-in-law in 1996 to punish them for their defection. If thwarted
this time, the most likely targets of his wrath are believed to be
some of those who have suffered before: Iraqis and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   After the Gulf War, U.S. forces found documents showing that
missiles tipped with chemical or biological warheads had been
deployed to Iraqi field commanders with authorization to fire if
Baghdad was out of contact or destroyed, according to Judith Yaphe, a
former intelligence analyst now at National Defense University in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Debate continues about why the missiles were never fired. It is
generally thought that Hussein was deterred by a U.S. warning to
Iraq's foreign minister that any use of nonconventional weapons would
seal Iraq's destruction. But a former weapons inspector who asked not
to be named said it would be a mistake to assume that deterrence
worked in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no idea" why the weapons were never fired, the official
said. The U.S. does not know whether an order was issued and never
got through, whether the missiles failed to fire, or whether field
commanders, who had been told they would be treated as war criminals
if they used chemical weapons, might have balked.</TE>
<TE>   When he fired nearly 40 Scud missiles at Israel during the 1991
war, Hussein's goal was to draw the Israelis into the conflict and
break Arab backing of the international coalition against Iraq.
Israel refrained from responding at the urging of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, Hussein knows that the Bush administration's
policy is "regime change." This greatly increases the risk that he
would unleash biological and chemical weapons on his own people, U.S.
troops, Israel or even a Western city, some experts say. They fear
the doomsday scenario: an all-out attack on the Iraqi leader
provoking exactly the nightmare that it was intended to avert.</TE>
<TE>   "Why expect Saddam to go gently when he has nothing left to lose?"
said Richard K. Betts, director of the Institute of War and Peace at
Columbia University. "We have given Saddam all the warning time he
needs to concoct retaliation, since the Bush administration has made
a coming war the most telegraphed punch in military history."</TE>
<TE>   In the CIA letter this week, the director of the agency disclosed
its assessment that if the U.S. attacked the Iraqi leader, "Saddam
might decide that the extreme step of assisting Islamist terrorists
in conducting a [weapons of mass destruction] attack against the
United States would be his last chance to exact vengeance by taking a
large number of victims with him."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's means of delivering weapons of mass destruction are
limited, according to a recent British intelligence report that
estimated his arsenal has been reduced to no more than 20 long-range
missiles. But he could instead use a small plane or send commandos or
terrorists to disperse a lethal biological agent in a city.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Army Gen. Wesley K. Clark said military planners could not
neutralize the threat of a nonconventional attack on U.S. troops, but
there are ways to minimize the effects.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no guarantees on biological weapons. One of my worst
fears is that Saddam Hussein will use biological weapons against his
own [Shiite] population in the south in order to create a
humanitarian disaster that would impede our efforts," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   Former CIA director Woolsey's worst fear: a biological attack on
the U.S. or Israel that could be difficult to thwart or even detect
quickly. In addition to anthrax and VX, Iraq has weaponized
aflatoxin, whose main effect is to cause liver cancer in children, he
noted.</TE>
<TE>   "Infected individuals in the case of communicable diseases, or
model airplanes that can fly long distances, or Piper Cubs that can
spray like crop dusting, there are all sorts of unconventional ways
to deliver" a bacteriological weapon, Woolsey said.</TE>
<TE>   Clark said the security precautions already being taken, combined
with an alert citizenry, offer the best defense.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the United States had grown "somewhat complacent"
about Hussein's propensity for a terrorist attack, said Ellen
Laipson, a Middle East scholar and former CIA analyst. "What is a
great unknown, however, is whether Saddam has already planted any
sleepers in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Hussein's intent, skeptics doubt that he could pull off
such an ambitious and horrific plan. Alani, the London-based Iraq
scholar, called the idea of a suitcase attack with a biological
weapon on New York or Tel Aviv "fantasy." He and others argue that
Hussein's power is brittle and that his authority would fade quickly
in an all-out invasion.</TE>
<TE>   "He will do his best to inflict damage before he goes down, but I
don't think his orders will be carried out," Alani said. "Apart from
the people who are going to die with him. That is a small group. For
a major operation like a biological attack you have to have people on
the ground. One thing is to issue an order. The crucial thing is
whether your order will be obeyed."</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say that the international community will have to
demonstrate sufficient resolve to topple Hussein if doubters among
his subordinates are going to disobey orders to use weapons of mass
destruction. The U.S. government says it will warn field commanders
against any use of chemical and biological weapons, and Iraqi
opposition leaders say they are reaching out to Iraqi commanders and
diplomats with the same message.</TE>
<TE>   "He may be ready to go down to the last bullet," Laipson said,
"'but you have to hope the team around him will make a different
calculation."</TE>

<HD>Ruling Lets Arab American Sue Airline</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Airlines have a legal right to remove passengers who pose a security
threat, but that doesn't entitle them to discriminate on the basis of
race, ethnicity or national origin, a Los Angeles federal judge
declared Friday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Florence-Marie Cooper ruled that Assem Bayaa,
an American citizen of Arab descent, can pursue his civil rights
lawsuit against United Airlines.</LD>
<LD>   Bayaa, who lives in Irvine, was removed from a United flight at
Los Angeles International Airport on Dec. 23 as it was about to take
off for New York.</LD>
<TE>   When he asked why, Bayaa said, the airline's ground security chief
told him, "Because the crew doesn't feel comfortable having you on
board."</TE>
<TE>   Bayaa's ticket listed his ultimate destination as Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, where he worked as an audit manager for Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   United offered to put him on the next New York flight, but Bayaa
refused, traveling instead on another carrier.</TE>
<TE>   His lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, seeks an
injunction barring United from engaging in a "pattern and practice"
of discrimination against Arab Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The airline moved to have the suit thrown out, arguing that
complying with federal and state civil rights laws might conflict
with the duty of flight crews to determine if a passenger poses a
security threat.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no merit to this argument," Cooper said in her ruling.
"The defendant's duty does not grant them a license to discriminate."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great victory," said ACLU attorney Ben Wizner. "The
airline's extreme argument was that even if all of our allegations of
discrimination were true, federal courts were powerless to
intervene."</TE>
<TE>   United's attorneys also contended that the 1934 Warsaw Convention
limiting damage claims against international carriers barred Bayaa
from pursuing his legal action. But Cooper noted that Bayaa was not
asking for monetary damages, only an injunction.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper did grant the airline's request to dismiss the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee as a co-plaintiff in the
suit, ruling that the group could not show that its members had been
harmed by the airline's actions.</TE>
<TE>   The league contended that Arab Americans have been subjected to a
"new and disturbing pattern of discrimination" by U.S. airlines since
the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It cited 60 alleged
incidents of discrimination against Arab American airline passengers
in the past year.</TE>
<TE>   Bayaa's suit is one of four similar cases filed by the ACLU across
the nation.</TE>

<HD>Paying a Price for Freebies</HD>
<DH>Merchants' handouts and discounts for police are a
tradition that some chiefs want ended, calling them unseemly and
compromising.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting on a restaurant patio, Anaheim Police Det. Bruce Bottolfson
chomped on a chicken drumstick, violating department policy with
every bite.</LD>
<LD>   Moments earlier, the on-duty investigator had strolled into the El
Pollo Loco on Anaheim's Ball Road and ordered a two-piece chicken
meal with cole slaw. Noticing the Anaheim Police Assn. logo on
Bottolfson's navy blue T-shirt, the cashier rang up the standard 50%
police discount.</LD>
<LD>   Handouts and price breaks for police officers--a free coffee here,
half-price dry cleaning there--are time-honored and pervasive, woven
into the very fabric of relations between police and public. Now, a
band of reform-minded chiefs is trying to banish these benefits,
arguing that they corrode a cop's sense of right and wrong. To some
department brass, the discounts are the last vestiges of graft that
was once rife in American policing. They see freebies as a slippery
slope likely to lead officers into greater sin. The Los Angeles
Police Department's report on the roots of the Rampart Division
scandal faulted officers for taking free coffee and food and
recommended that the department crack down on the practice.</LD>
<TE>   To patrol officers, the rules are out of step with reality.
Refusing a store owner's generosity, they say, could destroy the very
bridges they are supposed to build in era of community policing. They
bristle at the suggestion that they can be bought for half the price
of a chicken plate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is harmless," groused Bottolfson, who saved $2.70 on his
meal at El Pollo Loco. Behind him, a black-and-white cruiser inched
along the restaurant's drive-through lane.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask a chief, 'Did you ever take a free cup of coffee from
Winchell's ?' " Bottolfson said, referring to the chain of doughnut
shops. "If they say no, they're lying to you."</TE>
<TE>   The world of police discounts has its own lexicon. Officers
"badge" their way to a price break, "flex muscle" or wear the "blue
discount suit." Restaurants that give discounts "show love," or, more
commonly, "pop."</TE>
<TE>   Temptations lie on almost every street corner, with discounts
extending well beyond food to include jewelry and motor vehicles,
even free entry to strip clubs.</TE>
<TE>   A model code of ethics developed by the International Assn. of
Chiefs of Police includes a pledge against "accepting gratuities,"
and almost every law enforcement agency in Southern California has
such a prohibition. In police academies nationwide, cadets are warned
about the ethical fallout from mooching.</TE>
<TE>   "It sends the wrong message: that somehow police officers are
entitled to something special," said Cypress Police Chief John
Hensley. "If it comes to my attention, there will be discipline meted
out."</TE>
<TE>   Since taking the helm in Cypress three years ago, Hensley has
moved aggressively to combat gratuities. Early on, he persuaded a
local Sizzler restaurant to end police discounts. Last month, he
talked the manager of a Starbucks coffee shop into halting the
practice.</TE>
<TE>   Crackdowns at other departments have become part of freebie
folklore.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley's department caused a furor several years ago when it
launched an investigation of officers who were hanging out at
doughnut shops that gave handouts. The department declined to comment
on what the probe found. San Diego police officers were once ordered
to stay out of more than a dozen eateries that had refused to stop
offering discounts.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the efforts, freebies flourish. Pick Up Stix, the Chinese
food chain, offers police a price break. In-N-Out Burger is well
known among cops for discounting meals, though the company said it
doesn't have an official policy to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The waitresses at most local Hooters restaurants offer discounts
to police patrons (50% off, a Hooters spokesman said). Fantasy Ranch,
a Long Beach strip club, waives the $7 entry fee for cops at the
door.</TE>
<TE>   "They're good customers," said Fantasy's general manager, Jerry
Westlund. "I'd probably let in PTA presidents and members of the
clergy for free if I could get enough of them."</TE>
<TE>   From strip clubs to car dealerships, businesses realize that
police officers make good customers. They come with a clean-cut image
and, if they turn up in uniform, they provide cheap security.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-four-hour mini-marts--so vulnerable to crime that beat cops
call them "stop-and-robs"--routinely offer police free coffee and
sodas to encourage frequent visits. The discounts have become
corporate policy at businesses like El Pollo Loco. At some eateries,
cash registers have special keys that automatically calculate the
break.</TE>
<TE>   Focus on Businesses</TE>
<TE>   Few chiefs have waged as vigorous a fight against gratuities as
Michael Skogh, who retired this year from the Gardena Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in small-town Minnesota, Skogh watched his parents toil
in the family ice cream parlor. The experience taught him how hard
life could be for a small-business owner. Later, as a police officer
in Orange County, Skogh had little respect for colleagues who ate for
free in neighborhood stores.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a basically dishonest person abusing their power. They have
no place in American policing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As he won promotions, Skogh tried to put a dent in the practice.
Scofflaws are almost impossible to catch in the act, he said, so he
focused on the offending businesses. As a police captain in Manhattan
Beach, Skogh went from cafe to cafe, urging owners to stop giving
free coffee to his officers. Later, as chief in Los Alamitos, he made
sure the Chamber of Commerce knew how he felt.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Skogh became chief of police in Gardena, where a
throng of shops and restaurants drew hungry cops in search of a good
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Gardena Police Sgt. Thomas Kang remembers his own first day on the
force 14 years ago. A training officer took him to a liquor store
that supplied officers with free coffee and cigarettes. "That was the
culture I was brought into," said Kang, now head of the Gardena
police union. "The fancy term was, 'If you got no pop, you got no
cop.' It was an inside joke."</TE>
<TE>   On his arrival, Skogh told leaders of the police union that he
wouldn't tolerate the practice. To his surprise, they decided to back
him. But officers became resentful when top brass were allowed to
attend community lunches without paying. Despite the complaints,
police fell into line. The city's restaurants, however, did not. Many
continue to offer police discounts, luring cops from nearby cities.</TE>
<TE>   Come lunchtime, the parking lot in front of California Fish Grill
on Artesia Boulevard is guaranteed a black-and-white cruiser or two.
Along with fresh seafood, owner Victor Topete offers a 25% pop to
police. "Everybody here in the block gives it," he said. "It's added
security. The area can have a tendency to be a bit dangerous." Local
restaurateurs say that reducing or eliminating a "pop" will drive
away police business and leave the establishments vulnerable to
crime. When Shobi Zuberi and his brother bought their Sizzler
restaurant in Gardena four years ago, the place drew officers from
Torrance, Lawndale and Los Angeles thanks to its half-price meals.</TE>
<TE>   When a HomeTown Buffet opened up nearby, Zuberi's profits dropped
and he cut his police discount to 15%. Officers stopped coming, he
said. Then, one evening Zuberi was robbed at gunpoint. He restored
the half-price discount. Officers began to trickle back, but the
damage was done.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, a lot of LAPD knew about it," Zuberi said, "but now they
don't come around."</TE>
<TE>   Effect on Patrols</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement discounts date to an earlier era in policing, when
officers were poorly paid and relied on the generosity of shopkeepers
to make ends meet. Officers who defend the custom say that though
they would not solicit freebies, they see no harm in accepting them
when offered. In the vast majority of cases, they say, no favors are
expected in return.</TE>
<TE>   But there is evidence that the freebies do influence their work.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing cops claim that discounts had no effect on patrols, two
graduate students at Indiana University in Bloomington decided to
conduct a test several years ago. The criminal justice students,
William DeLeon-Granados and William Wells, staked out 20 restaurants,
noting each time a patrol officer pulled up to eat.</TE>
<TE>   The pair concluded that restaurants offering free or discounted
food received far more visits from on-duty patrol officers than those
that did not. The journal Police Quarterly published their 1998
report under the title "Do you want extra police coverage with those
fries?"</TE>
<TE>   "Even though they don't feel like they're giving in to favoritism,
the gratuities were altering their patrol practices," said
DeLeon-Granados, who now works in Northern California as a consultant
to police departments and community groups. In Los Angeles, the
city's police manual includes a general prohibition against accepting
gratuities. But the rule is routinely ignored. The department
acknowledged as much in its report on the Rampart scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "Employees are well aware that this practice is tolerated in the
form of reduced prices for meals and free coffee," the report said.
In a section offering recommendations for deterring future misconduct
by officers, the report urged supervisors to enforce the prohibition
on petty gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Just what constitutes a gratuity, however, is unclear from the
manual, and the department sometimes sanctions discounts more
valuable than a hamburger or fries.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles police union's monthly newsletter, The Thin Blue
Line, is full of ads for cars, jewelry, even hearing aids, at special
police rates. A plastic surgery consultant offers a law enforcement
discount. So does a Tarzana parrot store (10% off birds and up to 20%
off their food).</TE>
<TE>   Galpin Ford, the huge Van Nuys car dealership, advertises "special
consideration" for police officers and their families. Galpin's owner
is Bert Boeckmann, a member of the Los Angeles Police Commission, the
five-member panel that oversees the LAPD. Boeckmann did not return
calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Galpin offer and similar discounts do not violate the policy
against gratuities, said Sgt. John Pasquariello, an LAPD spokesman.
Officers are allowed to accept discounts from companies that are
reaching out to police as a large group of valuable customers, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   They are not allowed to accept breaks when businesses expect a
better level of service in return. Even in such cases, though,
supervisors won't take action unless an officer solicits a discount.</TE>
<TE>   "Because 7-Eleven gives out a free cup of coffee," Pasquariello
said, "I don't think we're going to send out the dogs."</TE>
<TE>   William Bratton, the LAPD's incoming chief, declined to give his
views on discounts. But during a recent tour of Los Angeles, he
appeared wary of the practice.</TE>
<TE>   When the owner of a Greek restaurant in San Pedro suggested that
he could eat for free on his next visit, Bratton replied: "We'll have
to check with the Ethics Commission on that one."</TE>
<TE>   Reasons to Accept</TE>
<TE>   Though police officers welcome the chance to save a buck, they say
there are other reasons to accept the discounts. When cashiers
insist, officers say, they would rather flout policy than offend an
employee or create a scene.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim's Bottolfson said his department's strict rule against
discounts underestimates police. How, he asked, can supervisors trust
officers to make life or death decisions but not to decide when a
discount is harmless?</TE>
<TE>   "They want to make out that there's a big, slippery slope, but
there's not," he said. "It's not leading us down the road to
perdition."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bottolfson acknowledged that the practice is open to abuse.
He ridicules the handful of officers he knows who take discounted
pizzas and other meals home to their families. He rolls his eyes when
he sees colleagues ask for discounts.</TE>
<TE>   "That's like begging. It's undue pressure," Bottolfson said. "How
tough is it to say no to a uniformed cop? It's very tough."</TE>

<PH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</PH>

<HD>A Politician Governed by a Sense of Decorum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>Third in a series profiling Gov. Gray Davis.</SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO--He is the governor of the most populous state in America.
He oversees an economy so expansive that if the Golden State were an
independent country, its output would rank sixth among nations.
Outside of Washington, few if any politicians have more sway over
major policy issues ranging from HMO reform to the future design of
automobiles.</LD>
<LD>   Yet even as he presides over 35 million people, Gov. Gray Davis
stands alone. He has few political allies and even fewer friends--and
that seems to suit him fine. Comfortable with a style of leadership
that supporters and critics alike describe as aloof, Davis wants less
to be loved than to be respected. And reelected.</LD>
<LD>   "We're all who we are, and at the end of the day, people want
their governor to solve problems, get the job done and move us
forward," Davis said in an interview. "It would be wonderful if in
addition to that, he was a spellbinding orator and the most
charismatic person on the planet. Fortunately, in California, we are
not lacking for charismatic people."</LD>
<TE>   In 1998, Davis became the first Democrat to capture California's
governorship in 16 years with a sweeping victory over Republican Dan
Lungren, completing a long climb up the state's political ladder.
From assemblyman to state controller to lieutenant governor, Davis
meticulously moved up, sometimes against the odds and without the
early blessing of the Democratic establishment.</TE>
<TE>   It certainly was not personal charm that carried him to the top:
Davis is uncommonly bland. A fan of the familiar, he sports a
seemingly endless wardrobe of blue shirts and boring ties, drinks
thick tofu shakes nearly every morning, and eats turkey and broccoli
with a glass of water nearly every afternoon. His only conceit is the
game of golf, which he plays well but with great particularity,
according to those who have watched him waggle and pace before he
putts.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' sharp sense of how to appeal to the vast middle of
California's electorate--and a gift for raising gargantuan sums of
money--have distanced him from the competition. His tendency to
succeed on his own, detractors and supporters say, has molded an
insular approach to governing that has defined and limited his four
years as governor.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not a warm and fuzzy guy," said Wayne Johnson,
the president of the California Teachers Assn., which poured millions
into Davis' 1998 race but has had a dysfunctional relationship with
him since. "He can be charming at times, but he can also be very
cold. That's just the way he is."</TE>
<TE>   Though he began his tenure with a heavy-handed demand that
legislators advance his agenda in lock-step, Davis has come to assume
a more hands-off posture--too far off, according to legislators and
others who are critical of his leadership. They say his reluctance to
tackle thorny political problems, coupled with his ideological
distance from the liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who
dominate the Capitol, complicated last year's energy crisis and this
year's budget debate.</TE>
<TE>   Davis often does not step into the governor's office until nearly
noon, although he participates in a conference call with his
political team nearly every morning. Legislators and leaders of
special interest groups grumble that on the rare occasions when he
does meet with them, he is usually late and often uninformed.</TE>
<TE>   That mode has only fanned the belief in Sacramento that even the
smallest acts of governance in Davis' first term have been geared
more toward political gain than public benefit. This is a governor,
after all, who spends countless hours collecting campaign cash--how
many is not clear because he will not release his full schedule. So
far, he has raised more than $60 million since taking office, the
largest war chest of any governor in American history.</TE>
<TE>   If no action is politically advantageous, critics assert, Davis
will do nothing, even if inaction will only make a pressing matter
worse.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor is the personification of inaction, and I don't know
why," said Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks), who
faulted Davis for failing to participate in recent talks on the
state's $24-billion budget shortfall. "Davis is not interested in
policy as much as politics. My judgment is his leadership ... is
always late in coming."</TE>
<TE>   Davis sounded far from indecisive shortly after taking office in
1999. In what backers now describe as an overzealous bid to establish
control, Davis came off like a potentate when he declared during a
San Francisco Chronicle interview that the job of the Legislature was
to "implement my vision." The new governor quickly backpedaled,
espousing a more cooperative approach with the legislative branch.
But it was clear where all others stood in his idea of the state's
political universe.</TE>
<TE>   The now-infamous remark rankled sensitive egos and worsened a
relationship that was already made difficult by his ideological
differences with the more liberal Democrats in the Legislature, whom
Davis needed to fulfill his campaign promises. "I never asked him
what his vision was, but I guess he should have told us, since we're
supposed to implement it," said John Burton (D-San Francisco), the
Senate president pro tem. Burton has since become a liberal thorn in
Davis' side, repeatedly pushing legislation that forces Davis to take
sides on politically tender issues.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, Davis sought not only a tight hold on
legislators but also on his own far-flung administration. He informed
top appointees and Cabinet members, in no uncertain terms, that they
were not free agents. He never wanted to read about a Davis
administration decision they made that did not fit his worldview, he
bluntly told them, because he, not them, would be accountable.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' views were molded by his experience as chief of staff to
Gov. Jerry Brown, who allowed what Davis somewhat critically calls a
"let a thousand flowers bloom" approach among those he named to top
offices.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it sounds a little self-serving, but only one person gets
elected," Davis recently explained. "And people reasonably expect
that my appointees will reflect the philosophy I expressed in my
campaign. I would suggest that I would do a disservice to the voters
if I were to put people out there that were totally out of step with
the views I expressed to them. They would say, 'This is not the
bargain I struck with Davis when I voted for him.' "</TE>
<TE>   Like many top politicians, Davis has a reputation for demanding
perfection from his staff, and exploding angrily when they fail to
perform up to his standards. But unlike many others, Davis lacks the
bedside manner to smooth things over after the screaming stops, say
current and former members of his administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Willie Brown could yell at you, but the next hour he would be
inviting you to dinner," said one former high-ranking administration
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Gray Davis does not
have that kind of way with people."</TE>
<TE>   Davis and Democratic legislators accomplished much in the frenetic
first year of his administration--landmark legislation included a
right to sue HMOs, a ban on assault weapons, and domestic partner
status for gays and lesbians--but any hopes of a prolonged honeymoon
were quickly dashed.</TE>
<TE>   In part, that was due to circumstances beyond Davis' control.
After so many years of Republican rule, unions and other left-leaning
groups quickly grew disenchanted with the governor's centrist stands.
At the same time, the small cadre of Republicans left in the
Capitol--a generally conservative lot--were in no mood to work with
him.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' few political confidantes said he had always anticipated a
rough ride with the Legislature. But Davis said he was stunned at the
degree of animosity and arm-twisting he encountered so early in his
tenure.</TE>
<TE>   "I went home to my wife one time and I said, 'I can't believe the
pressure to act immediately on just scores of different matters,' "
Davis said. "And she listened to me for about 10 seconds and said,
'Snap out of it! You've spent your whole life trying to be governor.
Now enjoy every moment.' From then on, I just accepted it as part of
the deal."</TE>
<TE>   Far from articulating a vision for others to implement, Davis
became increasingly withdrawn from the nitty-gritty of Sacramento
politics after his first year in office. Most disturbing, he began
ducking the more difficult policy questions, according to lobbyists,
legislators and state officials. That would directly affect the two
key dramas of his tenure, the energy crisis and the budget morass.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, California's private utilities began to see wildly
escalating electricity prices, the first signs that something was
horribly wrong with the state's nascent attempt at energy
deregulation. San Diego consumers were the first to feel the heat,
and many inside and outside the Capitol worried that the problem
would pose a serious threat to the state's economy.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans called for a special session of the Legislature. But
Davis demurred. At a private summit with executives from Southern
California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Edison board member and
former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher not so subtly
challenged Davis to lead. Burton, who was there as well, threw a
dollar in Davis' direction, reminding him where the buck stopped.
According to others in attendance, Davis replied that the money
landed closer to a PG&amp;E executive.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was eventually forced to declare a state of emergency in
January 2001 as the utilities reached the brink of bankruptcy--PG&amp;E
did wind up in federal Bankruptcy Court--and he had to authorize an
emergency program to spend billions from the state coffers on
electricity to stave off mass blackouts. The Public Utilities
Commission also had to authorize a financial rescue of Edison, funded
by ratepayers.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis does not regret his reluctance to act sooner, citing
subsequent disclosures that strongly suggest Enron Corp. and other
electricity companies may have illegally manipulated the market.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you think acting soon enough means? [It means] I didn't
raise your rates 400%. That's exactly what all these utility
chieftains and energy CEOs wanted me to do," Davis said, adding: "I
knew something was wrong. People kept telling me there is Bobby Joe
this and Billy Joe that as CEOs [of energy companies], and I knew I
had better take a closer look at this one."</TE>
<TE>   About the time the energy crisis darkened corners of the
California, the stock market started to cool off, and the dot-com tax
profits that had fueled record state surpluses began to dry up.
Instead of quibbling with legislators over how best to spend the
state's new riches, as he did during his first two years, Davis was
suddenly thrust into the politically undesirable position of
proposing what to cut.</TE>
<TE>   He did not embrace his new role. Former Republican Gov. Pete
Wilson, who faced his own debilitating deficits during the early
1990s, tackled the problem with relish by familiarizing himself with
the issues and convening numerous meetings of the so-called Big Five,
the chief executive and party leaders from each house. Davis held far
fewer such sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Davis loyalists defend the governor's approach, and insist that
contrary to public perception, he is tremendously engaged in the
state's problems. Though Davis may no longer convey the image of a
micromanager, internally he continues to be a phenomenal nag, say
current and former members of his staff.</TE>
<TE>   If the governor does not attempt to master the intricacies of
every issue, he enjoys making sure his underlings do.</TE>
<TE>   "Different people in politics have different MOs," said Davis'
chief political advisor, Garry South. "I used to work for an Ohio
governor who would go home every night with seven binder books full
of Post-it notes. Gray is not like that. He learns what he knows by
asking probing questions and testing people."</TE>
<TE>   What Davis is especially wary of, perhaps because of his days
working for Brown, is having the wool pulled over his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Cabinet Secretary Susan Kennedy, the primary liaison between the
governor and his department heads, said Davis reads every single
piece of legislation that arrives on his desk, a claim supported by
several others.</TE>
<TE>   The governor said that is slightly exaggerated, but he confirmed
that he spends a lot of time reading measures, and asking his staff a
similar set of questions about every one.</TE>
<TE>   Aides roll their eyes when asked to recite the list, which
includes explaining--in layman's terms--exactly what a bill does, who
is on opposing and supporting sides, how much it costs taxpayers, and
what other states have done.</TE>
<TE>   The perception persists, however, that it is not the merits but
the money that matters to Davis. The capital teems with stories of
special interests who felt squeezed by Davis for campaign checks as
he considered issues affecting them.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most damaging complaints came this year, when Johnson,
the teachers union president, revealed that during an education
discussion inside Davis' office, the governor blurted out: "I need a
million dollars from you guys."</TE>
<TE>   "We just sat there in silence," Johnson recalled. "There was this
pregnant pause that lasted like 15 to 20 seconds, and he just went
on. I think he had been expecting us to respond."</TE>
<TE>   But aides insist that Davis, who said he does not recall that
incident, does not always side with the politically powerful.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy recalled counseling Davis to veto legislation that would
have closed a loophole to guarantee better working conditions for
sheepherders. She feared others would see a precedent.</TE>
<TE>   Davis told her there was no way he could do that, because he
had met sheepherders in a swing through the Central Valley and was moved
by their stories.</TE>
<TE>   Davis claims he has given up worrying about his public image.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first got into politics, I would obsess about these kind
of things. But the truth is that I don't even read the papers
anymore," he said. "I can't control what people think of me. I can
control what I do."</TE>
<TE>   Yet other politicians say Davis cares deeply how people view him.
Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), a gregarious man, said he
has found a more personable side to Davis because he has forced the
governor to "be a human being with me."</TE>
<TE>   During a Martin Luther King Day parade this year, as the two
politicians coursed through the streets of Los Angeles in the same
float, Wesson began to "raise the roof," a celebratory hip-hop
gesture in which a person holds his arms upward as if lifting the
sky.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was intrigued, and with some prodding from Wesson, began to
raise the roof as well--albeit stiffly. It elicited a hearty response
from the incredulous crowd, and has become a signature move for the
governor--a piece de resistance of sorts for urban appearances. It
even got him a humorous mention on "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm loosening up a little bit. I'm trying," Davis said, smiling.
But he quickly added that no one should expect too much change in a
second term.</TE>
<TE>   "The power of my ideas and the sense that I will be steadfast and
purposeful are traits that Californians have responded positively to.
They know I am not a movie star.... I have to convince people that my
argument is more compelling than the opposition's."</TE>

<HD>Six, Including Baby, Are Hurt When SUV Rolls Over on I-5</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three Fresno women and three children were injured Friday when their
sport utility vehicle rolled over on the Golden State Freeway in
Castaic, ejecting two of the women and a baby, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The ejected child was a 5-month-old boy riding unrestrained on his
mother's lap in the rear seat. He suffered a fractured skull and was
in serious but stable condition late Friday at Childrens Hospital Los
Angeles. The others were being treated for moderate injuries at area
hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   The California Highway Patrol closed all southbound freeway lanes
after the 1 p.m. accident near Lake Hughes Road, backing up traffic
through the Grapevine for several miles. All lanes were reopened
about 3 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said Tonya Jordan, 35, was driving south in a Ford
Explorer at roughly 60 mph when she drifted into the center median,
swerved and lost control of the vehicle. The SUV overturned, ejecting
front passenger Sherrie Turner, 58, and rear passenger Treasure
Scott, 24.</TE>
<TE>   Scott was holding her baby son in her arms as she was thrown from
the car, CHP Sgt. Mark Fields said.</TE>
<TE>   A 2-year-old girl who was riding in a child safety seat, and a
5-year-old boy who was not, also were injured. State law requires
that children ride in car seats until they are 6 years old or weigh
60 pounds, Fields said.</TE>
<TE>   CHP investigators had not determined if another vehicle was
involved or whether they would seek charges against Jordan or Scott
for failing to properly restrain two of the children, Fields said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses to the accident are asked to call the CHP Newhall office
at (661) 294-5540.</TE>

<HD>15 Economists Say Secession Would Aid All</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Cal State Northridge group argues breakup would
boost economies of L.A., the Valley and Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood seceded from Los Angeles,
the economy of all three cities would improve, 15 economists from Cal
State Northridge said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The economists, who include the current and past chairmen of the
university's economics department, the former dean of the business
school and the founder of the San Fernando Valley Economic Research
Center, released a statement they said was meant to debunk claims by
Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and others that secession would hurt
the economy.</LD>
<LD>   "Research on municipal government does not support the claim that
it is more expensive, on a per-person basis, to produce public
services in cities smaller than Los Angeles," the group wrote.
"Economies of scale do not justify a city as large as Los Angeles."</LD>
<TE>   The economists stopped short of formally endorsing secession. But
they made it clear that, in their view, breaking up the city would
boost the economies of the new municipalities as well as the
remainder of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Breaking up Los Angeles would not, as Mayor Hahn has said, 'slam
the brakes on the economy,' " the economists said. "This is pure
assertion, not backed by any evidence or economic reasoning."</TE>
<TE>   The group said secession could improve the quality of life as the
downsized governments became more responsive to residents. That, in
turn, would make the cities more attractive to businesses and
increase property values, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Breaking up Los Angeles would make it easier for residents to
monitor municipal government and would make public officials more
approachable," the educators said. "As a result, municipal
governments would be more inclined to take actions and spend money on
services that residents want."</TE>
<TE>   Economist Shirley Svorny, founder of the university's San Fernando
Valley Economic Research Center and a supporter of secession, said
the group wants "to counter the extreme claims such as those made by
the mayor."</TE>
<TE>   "For us as economists, it is very frustrating to hear politicians
and others make statements that are without any kind of support,"
Svorny said.</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, who is running Hahn's campaign against secession,
derided the economists' claims, saying secession brings the risk of
higher water and power prices, as well as worsened public safety
services.</TE>
<TE>   "A rational person would say as you drive up costs on water and
power, as you jeopardize your public safety, that's not going to help
an economy," Kuwata said. "But they're tenured professors. Maybe in
their world you can do these things."</TE>
<TE>   The state commission that approved the secession measures for the
Nov. 5 ballot determined that Valley and Hollywood cities would be
able to provide the same level of police and fire service as Los
Angeles. The Local Agency Formation Commission also required the
Department of Water and Power to continue serving the Valley and
Hollywood, if secession wins, at rates no higher than those charged
in the rest of Los Angeles. Anti-secessionists have questioned
LAFCO's authority to impose that condition.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Katz, chairman of the San Fernando Valley Independence
Committee, said the economists' statement confirmed LAFCO's finding
that secession would not harm the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an independent validation of what LAFCO and cityhood
proponents have said," Katz said. "Breaking up L.A. will help
economic development, not hurt it, and there are better ways to
deliver both jobs and services than the way L.A. does."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) and local
gay and lesbian activists gathered Friday to state their opposition
to secession. They said secession could undo hard-won protections for
members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community who
live in Hollywood and the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg and others spoke at an event organized by Hahn's
campaign. Held at a Hollywood union hall on National Coming Out Day,
it was billed as the kickoff of the gay and lesbian anti-secession
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, city employees and their domestic partners get the
same benefits as married couples. Los Angeles also requires companies
that do business with the city to offer employees with domestic
partners equal benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a city anti-discrimination ordinance protects people with
HIV and AIDS in housing and employment.</TE>
<TE>   If Hollywood and the Valley seceded, the new cities would not have
to retain those protections, Goldberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leader Gene La Pietra, who is running for Hollywood city
council, said he would, in fact, push for domestic partner laws
stronger than those in Los Angeles. He said he believed all the
candidates actively campaigning for Hollywood city council supported
such protections.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to make it happen," he said.</TE>

<HD>Former President Carter Wins Nobel Peace Prize</HD>
<DH>Honors: His role in the 1978 Mideast accord and ongoing
human rights work are recognized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>As his own country readied for a possible war with Iraq, former
President Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday in
recognition of his role in brokering Middle East peace while in
office and his efforts since then to defuse conflicts in some of the
world's most forsaken places.</LD>
<LD>   In awarding the prize to the 78-year-old Carter, the Norwegian
Nobel Committee cited "his decades of untiring effort to find
peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy
and human rights, and to promote economic and social development."
The committee cited Carter's frequent work as an election observer
and credited the efforts of the Carter Center, founded in 1982, to
combat disease and promote progress in the developing world.</LD>
<LD>   As president, Carter played a central role in achieving the
historic Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel in 1978. For 13
days at the Camp David, Md., presidential retreat, Carter served as
host and mediator while Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin inched toward agreement. Sadat and
Begin were jointly awarded the peace prize that year, but Carter was
not nominated.</LD>
<TE>   Since he left office in 1981, Carter has used his prominence as a
former president to broker talks in conflict-torn zones and to push
for fair elections and other basic rights in hot spots around the
world. Much of that work has been done under the aegis of the
Atlanta-based Carter Center, founded by Carter and his wife,
Rosalynn.</TE>
<TE>   Carter said the peace prize "serves as an inspiration not only to
us, but also to suffering people around the world."</TE>
<TE>   The Nobel announcement, coming as the U.S. Congress granted
President Bush authority to use force against Iraq, stirred fresh
controversy over the escalating preparations for a possible war. The
Nobel committee's statement appeared to allude to the Bush
administration's threats to use force, if necessary, to disarm Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "In a situation currently marked by threats of the use of power,"
the committee said, "Carter has stood by the principles that
conflicts must as far as possible be resolved through mediation and
international cooperation based on international law, respect for
human rights, and economic development."</TE>
<TE>   The Nobel committee chairman, Gunnar Berge, was quoted as saying
that the decision to award the prize to Carter "should be interpreted
as a criticism of the line that the current administration has
taken." But another committee member said the panel had not discussed
Bush's policy toward Iraq and that Berge's opinion was his own.</TE>
<TE>   Bush called to congratulate the former president around 7 a.m. EDT
Friday--2 1/2 hours after Carter got word of the award--and the two
spoke for "a couple of minutes," according to White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer. "The president was very pleased to be able
to extend his congratulations to a former president," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer declined to comment on Berge's comments. "The president
thinks this is a great day for Jimmy Carter. That's what he's going
to focus on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a televised interview, Carter sidestepped a question about the
committee's apparent criticism of the Bush administration's Iraq
policy. But Carter said he would have voted against the Senate
resolution authorizing Bush to use force. The resolution passed early
Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Carter said he was "humbled" by the Nobel prize, for which he had
been nominated numerous times. "People everywhere share the same
dream of a caring international community that prevents war and
oppression. During the past two decades, as Rosalynn and I traveled
around the world for the work of our Center, my concept of human
rights has grown to include not only the rights to live in peace, but
also to adequate health care, food and to economic opportunity," the
former president said in a statement released by the Carter Center.</TE>
<TE>   Carter became the third U.S. president to win the Nobel honor,
following Woodrow Wilson in 1920 and Theodore Roosevelt in 1906.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Clinton added his voice to a global chorus of
congratulatory goodwill for Carter. "I cannot think of anyone more
qualified to receive this year's Nobel Peace Prize than President
Jimmy Carter," Clinton said in a statement. "He continues to inspire
people everywhere, young and old alike, through his vigorous quest
for peace, justice and a better quality of life for all citizens of
the world."</TE>
<TE>   Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who was among this year's nominees
for the prize, said Carter "deserved it better than I, and he won it,
and I'll try for it next year." Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio
said Carter's award was "wholly deserved." Sampaio praised Carter's
efforts at achieving peace for East Timor, a former Portuguese colony
annexed by Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   As president from 1977 to 1981, Carter, a Democrat and former
Georgia peanut farmer-turned-governor, may have left his deepest mark
by emphasizing the notion of human rights as a central element of
U.S. foreign policy. He raised the profile of human rights work
during a time when such advocacy groups were springing up around the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "Jimmy Carter has done more to integrate human rights into U.S.
foreign policy than anybody else. Before Jimmy Carter, human rights
and U.S. foreign policy were like oil and water," said Kenneth Roth,
executive director of Human Rights Watch. Now, Roth said, "no one
dares say human rights are unimportant to U.S. foreign policy."</TE>
<TE>   Since leaving the White House, Carter has been an indefatigable
advocate for finding peaceful answers to messy conflicts, from Sudan
to Bosnia-Herzogovina. Over the years, his private efforts at crisis
resolution have produced a peaceful transition to civilian rule in
Haiti and defused nuclear tensions between North Korea and the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Admirers say that Carter has succeeded abroad by making effective
use of the prestige--and access to people in high places--lent by his
former office.</TE>
<TE>   "People listen to him and respect what he has to say, most of the
time. He carries the clout of the United States but not the baggage
of the United States," said Heidi Burgess, co-director of the
Conflict Resolution Consortium, which is based at the University of
Colorado and examines long-standing disputes, such as those in the
Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Carter will have little time to savor the Nobel honor. Next week,
he is to lead a delegation to observe presidential elections in
Jamaica. "This is a great day for all of us," said Phil Wise, a
Carter Center official. "But I guarantee that on Monday morning, life
will be back to normal and we'll be back at work on these issues."</TE>

<HD>Sniper Escapes After Latest Deadly Attack</HD>
<DH>Crime: The slaying at a gas station occurs just yards from
a Virginia state trooper. If linked to the earlier cases, it will be
the 10th; eight were fatal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GETTER, STEPHEN BRAUN and JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>FREDERICKSBURG, Va.</DL>
<LD>The founder of a self-help organization for African Americans was
killed by a sniper Friday morning, the latest in a series of public
slayings that have spawned a new form of terror in the suburban
communities ringing the nation's capital.</LD>
<LD>   The brazen attack--the 10th in as many days in the Washington
area--occurred within 50 yards of a state trooper who was working the
scene of a traffic accident on the other side of a nearby highway.</LD>
<LD>   A small army of law enforcement officers scrambled to seal off
nearby highways in an effort to corral a white van seen speeding away
with two men inside. But the van, said to resemble a similar vehicle
seen at some of the other shootings, eluded authorities.</LD>
<TE>   Although police said they had not determined whether the man was
felled by the same person believed responsible for the previous
attacks, the shooting deepened the sense of frustration and fear
gripping the Washington area.</TE>
<TE>   "With a uniformed trooper directly across the street, obviously
we're dealing with an individual who's extremely violent and doesn't
care," said Maj. Howard Smith of the Spotsylvania County sheriff's
office.</TE>
<TE>   Like the previous nine attacks, this one involved a single shot
from a high-powered rifle. Like three of the previous nine, this one
occurred at a service station. Like all but two of the previous nine,
the victim died.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Virginia Gov. Mark Warner said more bullet
fragments were recovered from Friday's crime scene than from the
other sniper attacks. An analysis of the ballistic evidence was
expected to be released today.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of the family identified the victim as Kenneth H. Bridges,
53, of Philadelphia. Bridges, a graduate of the Wharton business
school, was president and chairman of Matah Network, an organization
he founded in 1997 to promote black-owned business enterprises and to
encourage black self-sufficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Bridges, a father of six, was driving to Philadelphia on a
business trip. His wife had expressed concern about his travel
through the Washington area in light of the recent shootings, his
friends said at a Philadelphia news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real tragedy for the family, for us, for all kinds of
well-meaning people," said Gregory Montgomery, chief operations
officer of Matah. "A guy like Ken didn't have a bone of malice in his
body."</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting Friday, officials sealed off exits and
entrances to nearby highways and interstates, backing up traffic for
miles. Motorists waited, sometimes for hours, to get through police
checkpoints on the major highways along the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Schools imposed immediate "lock-downs" requiring all students to
stay inside. Friday night football games and other weekend outdoor
sporting events were canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities urged citizens to be extra vigilant and to report
anything they considered unusual. They were particularly interested
in any sightings of a white Chevrolet Astro cargo van with ladder
mounts on the roof.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, the killings have become a part of President
Bush's daily FBI briefing, which until now has focused almost
entirely on the war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "The president's heart goes out to the victims of these shootings
and to their families and to their loved ones," Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer said. "He understands how deeply troubling this is for the
community and for people around the country."</TE>
<TE>   Bush was informed about the latest shooting shortly after it
happened, Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Bridges was shot at 9:23 a.m. while fueling his
silver Buick at the Four Mile Fork Exxon station on the outskirts of
Fredericksburg, about 50 miles south of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The site, near the intersection of heavily traveled Interstate 95
and U.S. 1, was just one interstate exit away from the Michael's
craft store parking lot where a 43-year-old woman was shot a week
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the cashier's booth at the Exxon station, 35-year-old
Sandra Fortune heard what sounded like a tire blowout, according to
her father, Eddie Fortune of Fredericksburg.</TE>
<TE>   She looked up and saw Bridges sprawled in the center lane of gas
pumps. "She saw the man die," her father said.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Williams was sitting in his van outside a Denny's restaurant
on the other side of U.S. 1 when he heard what sounded like a gunshot
or a firecracker.</TE>
<TE>   "I just looked over to the gas station, and saw the man lying
there," said Williams, 39, who is doing remodeling work at the
restaurant. Bridges lay on the pavement near his four-door sedan, the
handle of the gas pump still inserted in its side.</TE>
<TE>   "Police got there real quick," he said. "I'd say within 40
seconds."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who lives in Maryland, said he is a hunter and is
familiar with guns. He said he thinks the shot was fired by someone
on his side of the street, perhaps near a stoplight on U.S. 1.</TE>
<TE>   When he heard the shot, he immediately thought about the sniper.
"I was hoping it wasn't him," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Alvin Evans, a trucker and deer hunter from Warrenton, N.C., said
he was about to leave a Howard Johnson's motel across the street when
he heard a loud "crack."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a high-powered rifle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Virginia state trooper on the other side of U.S. 1 heard the
gunshot too. "He was directly across the street, so it probably took
him less than a minute to get to the victim," said Smith, of the
Spotsylvania sheriff's office. "He came directly across the street to
the victim and assisted the victim until the rescue squad arrived."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Robinson, a flooring installer, entered a nearby Waffle
House restaurant a few minutes after the shooting. Almost
immediately, he saw Virginia State Police vehicles speeding up to the
Exxon. "I've never seen cops move so fast," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Bingham, a mechanic at a Mobil station next to the Denny's,
was one of the witnesses who spotted the white van. He said he was
talking to station owner Raja Abilmona when both heard a "boom."</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody just got shot," Bingham later recalled telling Abilmona.</TE>
<TE>   "No, it's just a car backfiring," Abilmona responded.</TE>
<TE>   "No, somebody just got shot," said Bingham, who spent 21 years in
the Marine Corps and is familiar with firearms. "I said, 'There's a
white van right there,' and it took off."</TE>
<TE>   Bingham, a self-described "Chevy man," recognized the vehicle as
an Astro with a rack on top. It was stopped at the traffic light with
its back to the Exxon station when he heard gunfire. It was raining,
and he couldn't see the driver clearly, Bingham said.</TE>
<TE>   The van took off quickly and headed toward the entrance to I-95 a
few hundred yards downhill, Bingham said.</TE>
<TE>   A maid at the Howard Johnson's told police she saw a white van
driving erratically away from the Exxon station.</TE>
<TE>   Police later picked up what looked like a yellow piece of paper in
a ditch along the van driver's exit route and bagged it, apparently
as evidence, after shielding it from reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Police have been upset at news organizations for reporting that
officers found a Tarot card at the site of a school shooting in
Montgomery County, Md., addressed to police reading, "I am God."</TE>
<TE>   A 911 call from a cell phone came into the Fredericksburg police
only minutes after the shooting. Dispatchers transferred the call to
the Spotsylvania County sheriff's office.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Dean Martin, the patrol commander for the Fredericksburg
police, said his pager went off at 9:32 a.m., nine minutes after the
shooting, with a digital message:</TE>
<TE>   "Possible shot fired in Spotsy county. Exxon on Route One. Caller
heard a shot and then saw a man fall down. Info passed on to Spotsy."</TE>
<TE>   "We immediately, until proven otherwise, assumed it was part of
the sniper incident. We pre-staged police cars in areas that would be
used as escape routes," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   At first, no vehicles were stopped.</TE>
<TE>   But within seven minutes, he said, he got a description of the
possible getaway vehicle from Spotsylvania County authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point on, we stopped every white van," Martin said.
"Basically, it was a chain effect. It occurred here ... and straight
up the I-95 corridor. So basically what we did by doing this was
create one giant gridlock."</TE>
<TE>   Martin conceded that the white van might not even be connected to
the shootings. "We're just going on the best information provided us
by witnesses," he said. "If it's a red herring, we're in a no-win
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to hang on to witness statements. But how do you fire a
shot and jump in a white van within less than a minute?"</TE>
<TE>   Hobert Epps, of Athens, Ga., drove toward police lines several
minutes after the shooting with his girlfriend, Mary Mervin.</TE>
<TE>   Epps, 36, said several sheriff's deputies surrounded him, searched
him and took him to a motel to interrogate him. One officer was
holding a photograph, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were looking at a little picture, and then they were looking
at me," Epps said.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy had a mustache, but it wasn't me."</TE>
<TE>   Virginia State Police spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell said a trooper was
working "a minor fender-bender" across U.S. 1 when the shooting
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The trooper contacted the sheriff's office, where a number of
troopers and agents from other departments were discussing last
week's shooting in Spotsylvania County.</TE>
<TE>   "They were able to respond from a very close area," Caldwell said.
"Once agencies heard the lookout, they knew what they had to do:
close off the ramps and go with the best information we had at the
time."</TE>
<TE>   She said police and troopers tried to pull over every van on every
interstate, highway or side road from Spotsylvania County to the
District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their best efforts, the gunman wasn't found.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just got to keep trying," Caldwell said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how we could have acted any quicker in this
particular case than we did."</TE>
<TE>   As a steady rain drenched Northern Virginia, teams of six to 12
law enforcement personnel, some accompanied by bloodhounds, searched
the crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   The officers represented a variety of agencies, including the FBI,
the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the U.S.
Marshal's Office, Virginia State Police and police departments from a
number of counties and municipalities.</TE>
<TE>   ATF agents carefully examined an area of juniper bushes near a
sign 50 yards from the shooting. They sawed off the bushes and
searched the area with bloodhounds and metal detectors.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday afternoon, a Virginia State Police helicopter took
evidence from the scene to the ATF lab in Rockville, Md.</TE>
<TE>   Two FBI geographic profilers also arrived on a helicopter in
Spotsylvania County.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime we get a shooting now, we're going to treat it as if it's
related to this [sniper] case," said Smith, of the Spotsylvania
County sheriff's office.</TE>

and demanding that operators keep records of customers and the
information they access.</LD>
<LD>   The rules, which will take effect Nov. 15, also ban smoking,
operation within 124 feet of a school and being open past midnight,
the official New China News Agency said.</LD>
<LD>   Customers are barred from viewing politically sensitive sites, as
well as those offering gambling, pornography or prostitution. Many of
the regulations were already on the books in Beijing, where a cafe
fire killed 25 people in June. The rules now apply nationwide.</LD>

<LD>Former U.S. and Russian officials and military officers who met
Friday to study the 1962 Cuban missile crisis gave President Bush bad
marks for his handling of today's Iraq events.</LD>
<LD>   Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara and other aides
to President Kennedy are participating in a three-day conference,
also attended by Cuban President Fidel Castro.</LD>
<LD>   McNamara praised Castro, Kennedy and former Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev for good judgment and the coolheaded resolution of the
crisis. Wayne Smith, the top U.S. diplomat in Havana in the late
1970s, said, "Today's crisis is not being handled in the same
careful, prudent way."</LD>
<TE>   But White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Kennedy would
have used force if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of Kennedy's advisors recommended an attack on Cuba
after U-2 spy planes discovered the Soviets were installing missile
bases, McNamara said.</TE>
<TE>   McNamara proposed a "quarantine" to stop Soviet freighters from
transporting the weapons to Cuba, and the crisis ended when Moscow
ordered the missiles' withdrawal.</TE>

<HD>Mexican Singer's Abducted Sister Freed</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Kidnappers released Laura Zapata, sister of Mexican actress and pop
singer Thalia, after holding her for 18 days, Mexico City's attorney
general said Friday. Ernestina Sodi, another sister of Thalia's who
was kidnapped with Zapata on Sept. 22, was still being held, but
Mexico City Atty. Gen. Bernardo Batiz said family members hoped she
also would soon be freed.</LD>
<LD>   "The chief of police has told me that [Zapata] showed up"
Thursday, Batiz said at a news conference. A spokesman at the
attorney general's office said she was with her family. Batiz offered
no other details.</LD>
<LD>   The Zapata family has refused to speak to reporters or file an
official report on the disappearance of the sisters. Family members
hired a private team to carry out negotiations with the kidnappers
and asked police to stay out of the case, Batiz said.</LD>
<TE>   He added that police were ready to help if the family requested
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Police found Zapata's car abandoned on a Mexico City road after
she and Sodi left a play in which Zapata had a starring role. Media
reports quoted unidentified witnesses as saying the two were followed
and ambushed at a stoplight, but police would not confirm the
reports.</TE>
<TE>   Shanik Berman, a journalist and friend of Zapata's, had said
kidnappers were demanding a ransom of $1 million for the release of
the women. It was unclear if any ransom was paid.</TE>
<TE>   Thalia, married to Sony Music Entertainment Chairman Tommy
Mottola, was in Mexico after the kidnappings but did not want to talk
to police or the media, Berman said.</TE>
<TE>   Batiz said authorities would be very careful about trying to talk
with Zapata because they did not want to put Sodi's life in danger.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>A day after tallies showed that voters had rejected the ruling party
in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah
submitted his resignation Friday.</LD>
<LD>   He will remain in office until a new government is formed, which
officials said could take about four days.</LD>
<LD>   Results released Thursday by the Election Commission showed that
no party had won a majority of seats in the 87-seat state
legislature, but the opposition Congress Party and People's
Democratic Party, or PDP, were likely to form a coalition, with the
help of independents and smaller parties.</LD>
<TE>   Before submitting his resignation, Abdullah told reporters that
fighting terrorism should be the new government's first priority.</TE>
<TE>   The PDP, likely to have a strong role in the new government, has
advocated talking to separatists who oppose Indian control of the
Himalayan state, and finding a way for militants to give up their
almost 13-year-old insurgency, which has killed more than 60,000
people, by some estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The sharp move away from Abdullah's National Conference party
indicates Kashmiris' exhaustion with militancy, death and poverty and
their readiness for a new approach. More than 830 civilians, security
force members and militants have been killed since the elections were
announced in August, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Separatist groups and rebels, who want independence for the
Muslim-majority Kashmir region or its merger with neighboring
Pakistan, had refused to participate in the elections. Militant
groups staged major attacks on each of the four polling days in the
last month.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said the elections
showed that Kashmiris want peace and to remain in India.</TE>
<TE>   Separatists said, however, that the results would not change their
demand for self-determination.</TE>

<HD>Marine Contingent in Kuwait Wrapping Up</HD>
<DH>Military: Troops at Camp Pendleton mourn comrade who was
slain in gun battle this week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The 1,000 Marines whose training exercise in Kuwait was marred by a
fatal shooting this week have finished their maneuvers ashore and are
preparing to return to their ships, officials said Friday, as the
fallen Marine was remembered in a ceremony at Camp Pendleton.</LD>
<LD>   The officials said the exercise, Eager Mace, will be completed
Oct. 20 as scheduled. In the final phase starting this weekend, the
Marines will clean their equipment and move back aboard the ships Mt.
Vernon and Denver, the officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The troops are from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, whose
flagship, the amphibious assault ship Belleau Wood, is not
participating in the exercise.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, two Kuwaiti gunmen shot two Marines participating in
the exercise on Faylakah island, killing Lance Cpl. Antonio J. Sledd,
20, of Tampa, Fla., and wounding Lance Cpl. George R. Simpson, 21, of
Dayton, Ohio. The gunmen moved to a second location and fired on more
Marines before being killed by return fire. The Kuwaiti government
denounced the attack as an act of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   At Camp Pendleton on Friday, more than 1,200 Marines dressed in
camouflage fatigues gathered solemnly to remember Sledd, who was
posthumously promoted to corporal.</TE>
<TE>   "Cpl. Sledd is our brother, and he has fallen and we will not
forget," said Col. Joe Dowdy, Sledd's commanding officer.</TE>
<TE>   Before the ceremony, a Marine plunged a rifle bayonet into the
athletic field and placed an empty helmet on its stock and left a
pair of empty boots in front of the rifle--a tribute to fallen
comrades. A lone bugler closed the ceremony by blowing taps.</TE>
<TE>   Sledd's mother, Norma Figueroa, has asked President Bush to
transfer her son's twin brother, also a Marine, from Japan to a base
near the family home in Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   "I have Tony's twin brother, Michael Hiram Sledd, stationed in
Okinawa and he is coming home for his brother's funeral," she wrote
Thursday in an e-mail to Bush. "We already sacrificed one of our sons
for our country."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces have been deployed in Kuwait since the end of the 1991
Persian Gulf War that liberated Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.</TE>
<TE>   The two attackers were part of a terrorist cell that planned more
assaults on Americans, but no connection between them and Al Qaeda
has yet been established, a Kuwaiti Interior Ministry official said
Friday.</TE>

<HD>Guards Foil Suicide Bomber in Tel Aviv</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>U.S. Embassy security guards Friday overpowered a would-be suicide
bomber who had tried to enter a crowded cafe on the nearby Tel Aviv
beachfront, Israeli police said.</LD>
<LD>   Shlomit Herzberg, chief spokeswoman for police in Tel Aviv, said a
cafe security guard stopped the man as he tried to enter the
Hatayelet cafe on the promenade about 20 yards from the embassy.</LD>
<LD>   "When he found the explosive vest, the man ran away and the guard
chased him while calling for help from security personnel of the
American Embassy," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Embassy guards overpowered the man and called police. She said a
bomb squad removed the vest and no injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect, whose identity was not immediately available, was
detained.</TE>
<TE>   Cafe guard Mikhail Sarkisov, a 30-year-old former soldier and
policeman who had emigrated from Turkmenistan 13 months ago, said
about 35 people were in the cafe when the man walked up. As he ran
after the would-be bomber, he said embassy guards--who include both
Israelis and Americans--joined the chase and caught the man just past
the embassy.</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred a day after a suicide bomber killed a
71-year-old woman and injured several other people at a bus stop near
Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Friday, more than 10,000 supporters of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement rallied in the
heart of Gaza City, many firing automatic weapons into the air in a
show of strength directed at a rival group, the militant Islamic
organization Hamas.</TE>
<TE>   An even larger crowd of police officers and militiamen marched
Thursday in the funeral procession for Col. Rajeh abu Lehiya, who was
killed Monday by a Hamas militiaman.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas leaders distanced themselves from Abu Lehiya's killing,
saying it was a case of personal vengeance. But they have said it
might have been justified under Islamic law, and they have not helped
in turning over the killer.</TE>

<HD>6 Alleged Members of Milan Cell Held</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Italian police have dismantled an alleged terrorist cell based in
Milan, part of a European network with contacts in Iran, Malaysia and
Afghanistan that is suspected of plotting attacks on U.S. targets,
authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Five North African suspects were arrested Thursday and Friday in
the Italian cities of Milan, Naples and San Remo and on the island of
Malta. A sixth remains at large and a seventh, the alleged leader, is
in a British jail.</LD>
<LD>   Their activities in recent months demonstrate that the Al Qaeda
terrorist network is trying to shake off a worldwide crackdown and
reorganize to prepare new strikes, Italian investigators said.</LD>
<TE>   The suspects allegedly scouted the U.S. embassies in Belgium and
the Netherlands as potential targets, an Italian law enforcement
official said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time here in Italy we find someone who we think
was preparing an attack," said the official, who requested anonymity.
"They have been under a lot of pressure since Sept. 11. But this
group was still active."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and Scotland Yard assisted Italian investigators in the
case. The arrests came as fears are growing of new Al Qaeda attacks
because of the apparent terrorist bombing Sunday of a French oil
tanker off Yemen, the ambush slaying of a U.S. Marine in Kuwait two
days later, and other possible signs of a gathering threat from the
terrorist network. In the tanker explosion, French authorities said
Friday that they had found traces of TNT in the hole blown in the
side of the ship, supporting their preliminary conclusion that
terrorists were behind the blast.</TE>
<TE>   Working closely with U.S. agencies, Italy has aggressively pursued
Islamic extremists. Hype and infighting among police forces have
marred some cases, officials acknowledge privately. After a
much-trumpeted sweep in February, a group of Moroccans accused of
plotting to attack the U.S. Embassy in Rome was released without
being charged with terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   This week's arrests grew out of a three-year investigation in
Milan of a support network that allegedly assisted Al Qaeda members
across Europe. Aided by extensive wiretaps and other surveillance,
prosecutors have convicted seven members of a mostly Tunisian cell of
dealing in false documents and other crimes related to illegal
immigration. They belonged to a North African organization, the
Salafist Group for Call and Combat, that is part of the multiethnic
Al Qaeda alliance.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects in Friday's case, who apparently scattered to avoid
arrest, also are allegedly Salafists. Police say the suspects had
ties to the convicted group but operated their own cell. They face
charges of terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged leader is Farj Hassan, known as Hamza the Libyan, whom
British police arrested for immigration violations in May. He was
served with a warrant in the Italian case this week, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hassan allegedly communicated with fugitives who were trying to
reorganize Al Qaeda's battered operations while in hiding, according
to investigators. One was a son of Osama bin Laden believed to be in
Iran; Italian authorities did not identify him further. The other was
a man in Malaysia known as Abu Hani, allegedly once a trainer of
suicide terrorists in Afghanistan and a suspect in the assassination
last year of Ahmed Shah Masoud, a leader of anti-Taliban guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, police say Hassan was part of a reconnaissance
operation on U.S. embassies in Brussels and The Hague for possible
attacks, the Italian official said. A U.S. official in Rome said
Friday that he did not have enough information on the arrests to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Intercepted conversations in recent months revealed other plots in
the making, investigators said. The suspects allegedly talked about
arrangements for obtaining explosives in the south of France,
according to investigators. In September, they referred to an
imminent "soccer game"--suspected code for a terrorist act. And they
allegedly said they would take revenge on Italy for its support of
the U.S. campaign against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll see what happens now in Italy, now they are causing
problems," a suspect named Nassim said in a wiretapped conversation
described by an investigator. "Maybe you'll find 300 or 400 dead in
the subway."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Warplanes from the U.S.-British coalition enforcing "no-fly" zones in
Iraq struck a missile site Friday southeast of Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon said Iraqi gunners had fired on coalition aircraft
policing the zones 122 times since Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
offered Sept. 16 to let U.N. weapons inspectors return.</LD>
<LD>   "If there was ever a case of 'watch what he does, not what he
says,' this is it," Defense Department spokeswoman Victoria Clarke
told reporters before showing video of Iraqi launchers and radar
being bombed.</LD>
<TE>   Of the 122 firing incidents, 33 were against aircraft policing a
no-fly zone over Iraq's north and 89 were against coalition aircraft
in the southern no-fly zone, Navy Rear Adm. David Gove said.</TE>
<TE>   Gove, the joint staff's deputy director for global operations,
said the U.S.-British responses were against Iraqi launchers and the
air defense system that supports the targeting of coalition aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest incident, coalition aircraft used precision-guided
weapons to attack a mobile surface-to-air missile site near Talil,
about 170 miles southeast of Baghdad, U.S. Central Command said.</TE>
<TE>   The no-fly zones were set up after the 1991 Gulf War, in which a
U.S.-led coalition drove Iraq from Kuwait. The zones, which Baghdad
does not recognize, were imposed to protect Kurds in the north and
Shiite Muslims in the south.</TE>

<HD>Gulf War Pilot Is Declared 'Captured'</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Navy on Friday declared that Persian Gulf War pilot Michael Scott
Speicher was captured by Iraq, saying there is no evidence that the
officer is dead.</LD>
<LD>   Two senators suggested that there is new, classified evidence
indicating Speicher is alive inside Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The F/A-18 Hornet that he was flying was shot down on the first
night of the Gulf War in 1991, and he was declared dead. But the
military changed Speicher's status to missing in action a decade
later, given the lack of evidence that he was killed.</LD>
<TE>   Iraq claims that Speicher was killed but has not turned over any
remains.</TE>
<TE>   Navy Secretary Gordon England on Friday changed Speicher's
official status to missing/captured.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no evidence to conclude that Capt. Speicher is dead,"
England wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "While the information available to me now does not prove
definitively that Capt. Speicher is alive and in Iraqi custody, I am
personally convinced the Iraqis seized him sometime after his plane
went down.</TE>
<TE>   "Further, it is my firm belief that the government of Iraq knows
what happened to Capt. Speicher," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Joanne Harris, Speicher's wife, said the
officer's family was pleased with the change.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said an Iraqi defector told officials
that 11 years ago he drove a wounded American pilot to a hospital.</TE>

<HD>The Big Push for U.N. Council's Support</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The U.S. and Britain seek compromise resolution
on Iraq that's acceptable to France and Russia, which have balked at
use of force.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Russia and France are still resisting a proposed U.S. resolution at
the United Nations that would authorize military force against Iraq
if it does not dismantle any biological, chemical or nuclear weapons.
But Washington and London continued to apply high-level pressure
Friday, and diplomats said they are working hard on a compromise that
will get the entire Security Council on board.</LD>
<LD>   "We're working with our other friends and allies, with the French
and the Russians, to try to achieve a resolution that everybody can
support," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.</LD>
<LD>   To win over Russia--which along with France insists that the
resolution must not automatically authorize the use of force--British
Prime Minister Tony Blair made a lightning visit Friday to confer
with President Vladimir V. Putin.</LD>
<TE>   At the end of their get-together at a hunting lodge 75 miles north
of Moscow, Putin told reporters that he is now open to "the
possibility of reaching certain coordinated decisions"--including a
new Security Council resolution.</TE>
<TE>   While Russia's deputy foreign minister, Yuri Fedotov, complained
that the proposed U.S. resolution has conditions that are
"unfulfillable," Kremlin officials said Friday that Moscow is hoping
for a "new document, yet to be drawn up," that would allow an
agreement to be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure for agreement is building. President Bush telephoned
French President Jacques Chirac on Thursday, and Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell conferred with his British counterpart, Jack Straw,
at least four times Thursday and Friday, as well as with French
Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin. The White House will dispatch
other senior envoys to Europe next week for what are expected to be
intensified talks.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has held anyone's feet to the fire yet," said a European
diplomat close to the talks. "A deal will be done. Nobody is saying
no."</TE>
<TE>   France, Russia, the U.S., Britain and China wield veto power on
the Security Council. In an attempt to slow the push toward war,
France has proposed a two-step process: First, the Security Council
would adopt one resolution strengthening the weapons inspection
process. If Iraq blocks inspectors, the council would then vote on
taking further action.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is offering to tone down the tough language in its
proposed resolution in hopes of securing a single resolution that
doesn't restrain Washington and its allies from attacking Iraq if
inspections fail, diplomats close to the negotiations say.</TE>
<TE>   The leading compromise scenario, senior U.S. and U.N. officials
say, is that the U.S. would drop from its proposed resolution the
threat to use "all necessary means"--which implies military force--if
inspections fail. Instead, the measure would call simply for
"consequences," a term more open to interpretation. The resolution
will likely require the Security Council to acknowledge that Iraq is
already in "material breach" of past resolutions and that a further
breach will trigger the "consequences."</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council has, in fact, already found Iraq in material
breach of a 1991 resolution that ended Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and
demanded Baghdad's disarmament.</TE>
<TE>   Citing that finding, the U.S. and Britain launched a bombing raid
on Iraq in December 1998 to punish Baghdad for not cooperating with
weapons inspectors. The Western allies may use that as a basis for a
new attack on Iraq, even though other Security Council members prefer
new debate.</TE>
<TE>   "That argument can be regarded as all that's needed," said Robert
Rosenstock, former legal advisor to the U.S. mission to the U.N., who
helped craft the 1991 resolution.</TE>
<TE>   While the U.S. may claim that legal basis exists for military
action, it is still crucial to build political support for an attack,
Rosenstock said. Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Canada have said they will
offer military help only if the U.N. approves the use of force. And
having the world body's backing for an attack would ensure its help
in the rebuilding of the country after any such action.</TE>
<TE>   And so the delicate diplomacy continues. In exchange for one
resolution instead of the two-step process proposed by France, the
U.S. might agree to return to the council to try winning
authorization for force if Iraq balks. But Washington would reserve
the right to act based on earlier resolutions. This would give the
French and others the cover they need to say they did not support use
of force, while granting the U.S. and Britain legal and tacit
political support for action.</TE>
<TE>   "The French want the U.S. to at least go back for a second meeting
of the council," a diplomat on the council said. "It may not have to
be a second resolution."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has not ruled out two separate
resolutions. But officials are concerned about becoming embroiled in
a second debate that could delay a strike. After March, the region's
hot weather would make it difficult for soldiers to wear heavy
protective gear and to distribute water.</TE>
<TE>   The fallback option, diplomats say, would be to agree in advance
on a second resolution authorizing action but not vote on it. If Iraq
blocks weapons inspectors, the council could meet and quickly enact
the second measure without lengthy debate.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the council ultimately refuses to approve an attack, a
process that involves the panel would allow the U.S. to show that it
has exhausted its diplomatic efforts, which is key to maintaining
international support.</TE>
<TE>   Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Richard Holbrooke recalled a
similar situation, when Russia pledged to veto a Security Council
resolution for a strike on Kosovo in 1999 and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization acted without one. If the U.S. faces that setup
with Iraq, a good-faith attempt at working with the U.N. may win the
U.S. sufficient multilateral backing, even if it fails to secure
Security Council approval.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, the resolution is a highly technical game," Holbrooke
said. "Even if the U.S. can't get a resolution, it will be clear
enough for action to be justified."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq is already dragging its feet on inspections, U.S. officials
say. Iraq said Friday that it was ready to welcome U.N. weapons
inspectors but also tried to reopen negotiations on issues that the
inspectors consider closed.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix obtained by
The Times, Iraqi Gen. Amir Saadi avoided confirming agreements
concluded in talks last week in Vienna and recorded by Blix in a
letter to Iraq. Instead, Saadi's letter asked that Iraq be paid for
assisting the inspectors. It also suggests that the "no-fly" zones
over northern and southern Iraq set up after the Persian Gulf War be
canceled, and urges that the inspections not be used as "a tool for
humiliation or espionage."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. portrayed the letter as an attempt by Iraq to avoid
fulfilling its obligations.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not surprised that once again, the Iraqis want to delay
and deceive," said Richard A. Grenell, spokesman for U.S. Ambassador
to the U.N. John D. Negroponte.</TE>

<LD>Facing budget shortfalls, the Air Force is considering closing down
its runways at Plant 42, the production center that manufactures many
of the military's most sophisticated aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   Air Force Lt. Col. Celeo Wright said runway crews could be removed
by summer because health and benefit costs are eating into the
budget. The problems were compounded earlier this year when NASA
moved its space shuttle maintenance work to Florida. That could cost
Plant 42 roughly $1 million next year, Wright said.</LD>
<LD>   The runways are used primarily to fly finished aircraft to other
bases. Wright said military flights would continue if the runway
crews were eliminated.</LD>

<HD>Court OKs Helping Political Campaigns With Criminal,
Traffic Fine Surcharges</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>The Arizona Supreme Court on Friday approved of collecting surcharges
on criminal and traffic fines to help fund political campaigns,
rejecting an argument that the system violates free-speech rights.</LD>
<LD>   Ruling unanimously, the state Supreme Court noted that the U.S.
Supreme Court has upheld the use of public money for campaign
financing, and it found that the Arizona system doesn't promote any
particular message.</LD>
<LD>   The opinion, written by Justice Rebecca White Berch, also pointed
out that state taxes already pay legislators' salaries, regardless of
whether an individual taxpayer agrees with every lawmaker.</LD>
<TE>   The 10% surcharge on court-issued fines provides about 60% of the
funding for the state's public financing of state election campaigns.
Other sources include taxpayer contributions.</TE>
<TE>   This year's candidates already have received their basic
allotments of Clean Elections money for the general election, but the
case could have affected extra funds provided to some candidates to
match private expenditures against them.</TE>
<TE>   Republican state Rep. Steve May contested the surcharge on a
parking citation, arguing that the fee infringed on payers'
constitutional free-speech rights. A trial judge ruled against him,
but the state Court of Appeals overturned that decision.</TE>
<TE>   May's lawyer said the case will likely be appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court. The Clean Elections system was authorized by Arizona
voters in 1998 and first used two years later.</TE>

<LD>Four videotapes made by the Columbine High School killers do not have
to be locked in an evidence room and can be removed from the
courthouse by attorneys working on a lawsuit related to the 1999
attack, despite fears of leaks, a Denver judge ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The tapes are evidence in a lawsuit brought by survivor Mark
Taylor against Solvay Pharmaceuticals, which makes the antidepressant
Luvox.</LD>

weapons they used in the attack and donning the clothes they wore.</LD>
<TE>   Taylor, who was wounded by Harris, claims Luvox made Harris
homicidal.</TE>

<HD>White House Seen Resisting Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Politics: Sens. McCain, Lieberman blame administration for
collapse of 9/11 deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Lawmakers pushing for an independent commission to investigate
government failures surrounding last year's terrorist attacks blamed
the White House on Friday for scuttling an apparent agreement this
week.</LD>
<LD>   Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.),
sponsors of the legislation, said administration officials are
maneuvering at the last minute to limit the panel's scope, even while
claiming publicly to support a broad, unfettered investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Some went further, saying the White House may be seeking to
quietly scuttle the commission altogether. House Minority Whip Nancy
Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said the administration is trying to
"privately move to thwart it behind the scenes."</LD>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer disputed the charges and said
Congress and the administration are close to agreement on creating
the 10-member panel. He sought to shift blame onto lawmakers for
refusing to give ground on several sticking points.</TE>
<TE>   "The president would be very disappointed if the Congress allowed
these issues to keep the agreement from happening," Fleischer said.
President Bush, he added, "thinks it can and should be done."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of victims of the attacks lambasted the White House
early in the day, accusing the administration of undermining the
deal. But their main spokesman, Stephen Push, whose wife was aboard
the plane that crashed into the Pentagon, later said he believes the
White House is negotiating in good faith.</TE>
<TE>   Creating an independent commission, patterned after those that
investigated the Pearl Harbor attack and President John F. Kennedy's
assassination, appeared to be a sure thing after the White House
recently dropped its opposition to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate last month overwhelmingly voted to create the panel and
give it broad authority to investigate a range of issues, from
immigration policies to aviation security. The House earlier approved
a commission that would be more limited in scope.</TE>
<TE>   House and Senate negotiators had announced an accord on their
differences Thursday afternoon, but it fell apart by the end of the
day when Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee, raised last-minute objections.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman and McCain on Friday blamed the White House for the
unraveling. Goss is seen by many on Capitol Hill as the White House's
surrogate in negotiations on the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Goss said Thursday that he wasn't satisfied that the panel would
have authority to investigate all branches of government, including
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But Senate aides involved in the talks said Goss had not raised
that issue before, and that he left the bargaining table Thursday
citing objections "above my pay grade," interpreted by some as a
reference to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is concerned that under the proposal,
commission members appointed by one party would have the power to
issue subpoenas. "One-political-party subpoenas lead to paralysis and
politics," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the congressional plan, the 10 commission appointments would
be equally divided between Democrats and Republicans. Subpoenas could
be issued with support from five members, meaning the decision could
be determined by a bloc vote by members of either party.</TE>
<TE>   The White House also has been pressing for a one-year deadline for
the commission's work, while the deal struck by lawmakers calls for a
two-year timetable.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the administration wants to prevent the commission
from being able to look into the government's actions immediately
after the terrorist attacks, according to a congressional staffer.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman and McCain vowed to resist any White House effort to
limit the panel's scope and said they hold out hope that the proposal
could clear Congress in its closing days.</TE>
<TE>   "Every bureaucracy ... is scared to death of an investigation,"
McCain said. "We all know ... that numerous mistakes were made."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Iraq debate may be over in Congress, but it lives on in
congressional campaigns across the country.</LD>
<LD>   In tight Senate races in South Dakota, Missouri and Georgia, the
name or image of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has popped up in
recent days in political advertising. In these and other contests,
Republicans and Democrats are arguing over which party is stronger in
foreign affairs, national defense and homeland security.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate's 77-23 vote early Friday approving the potential use
of force against Iraq, following the House's 296-133 vote of approval
hours earlier, forced many lawmakers to take a difficult stand less
than a month before the November elections.</LD>
<TE>   The roll calls yielded few surprises. Democrats in heavily
contested races tended to vote for the resolution that President Bush
sought. These included Sens. Jean Carnahan of Missouri, Tim Johnson
of South Dakota and Max Cleland of Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   A notable exception was Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, who
opposed the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The measure won near unanimous GOP support. In the House, the six
Republicans voting against it included two--Reps. James A. Leach of
Iowa and Constance A. Morella of Maryland--whose reelection hopes
hinge in part on attracting significant Democratic support. The lone
Republican senator opposing the measure--Lincoln Chaffee of Rhode
Island--represents a heavily Democratic state.</TE>
<TE>   Still uncertain is whether the focus on Iraq will recede from the
campaign trail.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, seeking to take back the Senate and keep the House,
prefer to talk about national security issues. Democrats, seeking to
expand their one-seat Senate majority and win the House, want to talk
about the nation's economic problems instead.</TE>
<TE>   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said Democrats have "a chance"
to change the subject before the Nov. 5 elections. "But have they
done it so far? No."</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, 12 Democrats who voted against the Persian Gulf War
resolution in 1991 voted for this year's resolution. Among them were
Johnson of South Dakota and Tom Harkin of Iowa, who is favored in his
reelection bid this year.</TE>
<TE>   Harkin cited the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as a major reason for
backing the current resolution. He said Hussein and Al Qaeda
terrorists "might find common cause in attacking us and our allies at
any time," presenting an "unacceptable menace" to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Harkin's opponent, Republican Rep. Greg Ganske, voted for the
resolution in the House.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who was a House member when he opposed the 1991
resolution, cites Sept. 11 as a factor in his support for the current
measure. He also has stressed his support of Bush on national defense
and homeland security issues.</TE>
<TE>   But his GOP opponent, Rep. John R. Thune, has not hesitated to
mention Johnson's "no" vote in 1991. Thune has also run a television
ad that includes a picture of Hussein and attacks Johnson as a
frequent opponent of missile defense programs.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson denies the charge. His spokesman, Dan Pfeiffer, said the
tone of Thune's ad was "over the top." But Thune spokeswoman
Christine Iverson called national security "a relevant issue."</TE>
<TE>   In Missouri, Carnahan is facing a tough challenge from former Rep.
Jim Talent. He recently launched a radio advertisement that claims
Carnahan opposed an initiative to boost oil production and reduce
U.S. dependence "on people like Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   In the same ad, Talent accused Carnahan of helping to block Bush's
proposal for a Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security.
Carnahan has stoutly defended her record on defense, Iraq and
domestic security.</TE>
<TE>   In Georgia, an ad sponsored by Rep. Saxby Chambliss, the GOP
Senate nominee, shows photographs of Hussein and Al Qaeda leader
Osama bin Laden and accuses Cleland of thwarting the Bush homeland
security plan. Cleland said the ad represented a "vicious
exploitation" of a national tragedy and an "attempt at character
assassination."</TE>
<TE>   In the House, about two dozen Democrats facing tough reelection
fights were among those voting for the Iraq resolution.</TE>
<TE>   One who voted against it was Rep. James H. Maloney of Connecticut.
He is in a close battle with Rep. Nancy L. Johnson (R-Conn.), a
head-to-head contest of incumbents created by newly drawn political
boundaries. Johnson voted for the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic senators viewed as potential presidential or vice
presidential candidates in 2004 tended to vote for the resolution.
These included John Edwards of North Carolina, John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Joseph R. Biden
Jr. of Delaware, Evan Bayh of Indiana, Christopher J. Dodd of
Connecticut and Tom Daschle of South Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   Another Democrat who backed Bush on the measure but may try to
unseat him was House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry, Biden, Dodd, Daschle and Gephardt all opposed the 1991 war
resolution.</TE>

<DH>Politics: Key issues such as energy policy and homeland

any new action.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Now that Congress has taken the momentous step of authorizing a
possible war halfway around the globe, it faces a challenge that hits
much closer to home: how to wrap up this year's contentious
legislative session and head home to campaign for November's
elections.</LD>
<LD>   Weary lawmakers are emerging from weeks of all-consuming debate
about Iraq to find that a host of other issues have languished:
energy policy, homeland security legislation and the budget, to name
a few.</LD>
<LD>   An enormous backlog of work remains--but many lawmakers are ready
to throw in the towel, adjourn until after the election and return
for a lame-duck session.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think there's much choice," Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) said Friday of a postelection session. "This is a
very complicated and a very political time of the year."</TE>
<TE>   Just a few hours after the Senate's resounding early-morning vote
authorizing military action against Iraq, Democrats sought to return
attention to the troubled economy, the issue they want to make
central to the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone invested in the market or worried about a job can take no
comfort" from the Republican stewardship of the economy, House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said at a daylong forum
staged by the Democrats to spotlight economic trends.</TE>
<TE>   But with the Iraq vote behind them, it's not clear how much more
work lawmakers have in them before they head home--perhaps at the end
of next week--to prepare for election day. Although most incumbents
are heavily favored to win reelection, the outcomes of a relative
handful of House and Senate races are expected to determine which
party controls the chambers.</TE>
<TE>   Autumn is traditionally Congress' time for tying up the loose
ends--finishing must-pass appropriation bills, negotiating final
versions of legislation in House-Senate conference committees. But
this fall is different. Congress has missed its adjournment target,
which was Friday, but it has yet to send to the White House a single
one of the 13 annual appropriation bills needed to finance the
government. Instead, federal agencies are running on stopgap funding.
And negotiations among lawmakers on several issues have stalled short
of producing bills that would, if finished, represent major
legislative accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   All those matters have been eclipsed by Iraq, at least since
Congress returned about a month ago from its summer recess.</TE>
<TE>   This has frustrated Democrats, who want voters to focus on other
issues that traditionally work more to their political advantage:
corporate corruption, unemployment, Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout this week's Iraq debate, Democrats struggled daily to
draw attention to their agenda. One day, party leaders tried to
spotlight corporate accountability by calling for the resignation of
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt. Another
day, they called a news conference to sign a pledge not to privatize
Social Security. Senate Democrats have tried repeatedly to bring up
legislation to extend unemployment benefits, only to be blocked by
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   The economic forum hosted by Democratic leaders Friday was the
latest effort to change the subject from foreign affairs. Noting a
report that President Bush was planning to spend much of the next two
weeks campaigning for Republican candidates, Daschle lashed out at
him for not giving more attention to the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "I would urge the president to cancel his political trip today,"
Daschle said. "Cancel the trip. Show the American people you're more
concerned about their jobs than you are about Republican ones."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans responded by blaming Democrats for stalling
bills--such as energy legislation and further tax cuts--that the GOP
says would help stimulate the economy. House Republicans are planning
next week to bring up legislation to expand tax breaks for investors
who suffer losses.</TE>
<TE>   As of now, no one knows for sure when Congress will wrap up its
work. House GOP leaders want to leave at the end of next week and
return for a lame-duck session in late November.</TE>
<TE>   But the Senate may hold up the departure date.</TE>
<TE>   Hanging over the chamber is legislation to create a Department of
Homeland Security. It has stalled over Bush's proposal, bitterly
opposed by Democrats, to waive some of the civil service protections
for the new department's employees. Under fire from House Republicans
for not finishing the bill, Daschle says he hopes the Senate will act
before adjourning.</TE>
<TE>   Also floundering is a major bill to make it harder for people to
discharge their debts by declaring bankruptcy. A House-Senate
compromise was reached in July, but House GOP leaders have been
reluctant to bring it to a vote because of an abortion-related
provision opposed by many of the party's conservative activists. The
provision is designed to prevent people who attack or block access to
abortion clinics from avoiding court-ordered fines by declaring
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The bill may pass during a lame-duck session, but Republican
leadership aides say it will not be brought up before the elections.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the agenda of unfinished business is a field guide to
issues that once seemed urgent, but have been overshadowed by Iraq:</TE>
<TE>   * Election reform. The 2000 presidential voting fiasco gave
powerful impetus to legislation to fix flawed voting systems, but the
effort languished for months. Now, it may be one of the few bills
that clears Congress before the elections.</TE>
<TE>   A compromise bill to give states more than $3.8 billion to improve
their voting systems passed the House this week and will come before
the Senate for final approval next week. President Bush has indicated
he will sign it.</TE>
<TE>   * Terrorism. Two bills that looked like must-pass measures in the
wake of last year's attacks are faltering, but may yet clear Congress
in the coming week.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation to provide federal financial backup for insurance
companies in the event of terrorist attacks has stalled; Bush is
pushing for a resolution and negotiations are continuing. In
addition, lawmakers are still struggling to push over the finish line
a bill to set up an independent commission to investigate government
failures leading up to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   * Energy legislation. The push for a new national energy policy
began early last year, when California was consumed by its
electricity crisis and gasoline prices surged.</TE>
<TE>   The House and Senate passed bills with significant differences
and, with the sense of crisis gone, it's not clear negotiators will
be able to resolve the disputes. If they do, it will surely be a
stripped-down bill without major initiatives, such as the increased
fuel-economy standards sought by Democrats or the significant
expansion in domestic oil drilling that Republicans pushed.</TE>

<HD>Killer Escalates Fear Factor in D.C. Community</HD>
<DH>Shootings: Residents hunker down as business owners take
precautions for reluctant customers. Many outdoor activities are
curtailed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>At a service station in Maryland, manager Danny Tomasian has parked
an assortment of vehicles to block the line of fire to his gas pumps.</LD>
<LD>   At a busy restaurant in Virginia, customers have been avoiding the
usually popular sidewalk tables, opting for indoor seating. A region
where people pride themselves on having reported for work the day
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the Pentagon is now dealing
with a more insidious form of terror, as yet another shooting--this
one in Fredericksburg, Va., on Friday--sank the area into deeper
fear.</LD>
<LD>   "We lost our innocence on Sept. 11, and now we're losing it
again," said Sally Greenberg, a lawyer with a 7-year old son. "We
realize that we can be at risk just going about our daily routine."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, the life patterns of nearly 5 million area residents are
being hurriedly revised to counter the threat of the sniper, who
before Friday had killed seven and wounded two. Teenagers are being
told to stay indoors. Dog walkers are avoiding parks. Motorists duck
and cover as they pump gas, while their passengers hunker down in
their seats.</TE>
<TE>   "I walk my son into school every day," said Greenberg, who lives
in Washington. "I make sure that I see him go in." She did not feel
comfortable giving her son's name.</TE>
<TE>   "His recesses have all been eliminated, and that is rough for a
little kid," she continued. "The first day, he told us, 'They're
keeping us inside and they won't tell us why.' We explained there was
a bad guy shooting people. When he went to bed that night, he said,
'I'm scared of that guy.'</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'He doesn't get people inside their houses.' "</TE>
<TE>   The shooter "has pretty much succeeded in terrorizing the
community," she said.</TE>
<TE>   John Muncie and Jody Jaffe, due to get married in their Silver
Spring, Md., backyard on Sunday, said five guests from North Carolina
had just canceled plans to attend. Two other friends had called from
Boston to gingerly ask if they would be safe.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to assure them this guy is not stalking us," Muncie said.</TE>
<TE>   At Piney Branch Elementary School in nearby Takoma Park, parents
were drafted to take turns as front-door guards, checking IDs before
allowing anyone into the building. A steady rain kept students
indoors, which was just as well since all outdoor recess and sports
were canceled.</TE>
<TE>   A new third-grade teacher said she is terrified each time she
walks to and from the subway station now. Students in her class, she
said, had asked that morning if they would get shot through the
window.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready to move back to Indiana," she said. "This kind of thing
doesn't happen there."</TE>
<TE>   Some long-scheduled events will go on today, including "The Taste
of D.C.," a three-day downtown festival of food and music. And the
Library of Congress National Book Festival--hosted by First Lady
Laura Bush and featuring more than 70 authors, illustrators and
storytellers--will take place on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol
and The Mall. But Capitol police are taking extra security measures,
including enclosing the area with snow fences, limiting entry and
exit ways and using hand-held metal detectors to check
festival-goers.</TE>
<TE>   "People are in a funk," said Tim Gibson, manager of Mexicali
Blues, a Mexican/Salvadoran restaurant in Arlington, Va. "People who
would normally be out are second-guessing themselves. The longer this
takes to resolve, the more effect it will have on people."</TE>
<TE>   Like most restaurants on trendy Wilson Boulevard, Mexicali Blues
offers sidewalk seating. But on a clear day earlier in the week,
Gibson said he looked down the street at lunchtime and saw few
customers dining outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   Business was at a standstill at a service station four blocks away
from Friday's fatal shooting near Fredericksburg, which has many
similarities to the others but has not yet been forensically linked
to them. Zulfiquar Ali, manager of the Four Mile Fork Shell station,
spent the afternoon counting cigarette cartons and sodas because
there was nothing else to do. "Business is very, very bad," Ali said.
"People are scared."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Dunavant, an assistant manager at a nearby Food Lion
supermarket, said employees as well as customers are fearful for
their safety.</TE>
<TE>   "After I heard about the shooting this morning, I had to get gas,"
he said. "I was standing there thinking, 'It could be me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Tomasian, the Bethesda, Md., gas station manager, remained
defiant. "This is not going to stop capitalism," he said. "This is
not going to stop the American way."</TE>
<TE>   But he added that small-business owners must take the initiative
and reassure their customers that they are taking steps to protect
them.</TE>
<TE>   "I basically keep my eyes open and tell my guys to keep their eyes
open," he said. "You try to reassure customers. You put up as many
obstacles as you can to make it as difficult as possible" for the
shooter.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Church, a labor union communication manager, said he still
patronizes the Montgomery County, Md., shopping areas near where the
shooter attacked his first five victims. One of them was killed on a
bench outside Church's favorite rotisserie chicken eatery. Church and
his wife have warily kept going to their neighborhood stores. But no
longer will they stroll together in the park.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though you play the odds, and they are very slim that
something would happen, why put yourself in that position?" asked
Church.</TE>
<TE>   When Church walks his dog early in the morning, he scans the woods
near his house and tries to use parked cars for cover.</TE>
<TE>   "The mind plays tricks on you, and you get an unsettling feeling,"
he said. "You're thinking about the worst all the time. I hate the
fact that one person has created this kind of state of mind in this
area. I'm more angry than scared of living in the Washington area."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Piacente, a federal employee who lives in Montgomery County,
said his 13-year-old son, Nick, has been ordered to remain indoors.
His two daughters, who are older, have been admonished not to linger
in open spaces.</TE>
<TE>   When a 13-year-old boy was gunned down outside a middle school in
neighboring Prince George's County this week, "it really hit home,"
Piacente said.</TE>
<TE>   He imagined himself in the place of the critically wounded boy's
parents, waiting outside the operating room for a word from the
surgeon.</TE>
<TE>   His own son plays several sports. "He plays tennis, baseball, he
goes to karate," Piacente said. "Normally, I would much prefer that
he do that. Now, you have to worry about 'Is he a developing athlete,
or is he a target?' The idea that he could be a target just frightens
me."</TE>
<TE>   Schools around the region have become like cloisters. Outdoor
athletic contests, including dozens of football games and some
homecoming events, have been canceled. Security has been increased
everywhere, particularly when students arrive and depart.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Regnier, a spokesman for the largest school system in the
area, has found his job turned upside down. Before the shootings, he
was paid to promote Fairfax County, Va., schools in the local and
national media--the more exposure, the better. Now he is working just
as hard to make sure that the system gets as little notice as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not doing any interviews on this until they catch that
guy," Regnier said. "We are trying to keep our name out of the
media."</TE>
<TE>   Superintendent Daniel Domenech summed up the tenor of the times in
an open letter to parents.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that we are living in a paradox," he wrote.
"We are determined to keep our lives as normal as possible, but, to
feel safe, we find we must postpone events that are important to our
children and us. It is not comfortable."</TE>

<HD>Insurer Clarifies Drug Plan for AARP</HD>
<DH>Health: UnitedHealth Group says it will reimburse members
for prescriptions filled outside the country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The country's biggest health insurer has informed members of the
senior citizens lobbying group AARP that it will reimburse them for
prescriptions filled in Canada and elsewhere abroad.</LD>
<LD>   UnitedHealth Group Inc. sent a letter to the 97,000 people who
purchased insurance with a drug benefit through AARP to tell them
about the coverage.</LD>
<LD>   Buying prescription drugs outside the country for use at home
violates federal regulations but is a growing practice among some
older Americans seeking relief from high prices. Insurance policies
generally cover drugs purchased abroad if a person is traveling there
and has forgotten medicine or becomes ill.</LD>
<TE>   UnitedHealth and AARP appeared to want to keep the measure
low-key, but it was certain to meet with approval from AARP plan
members and thousands of other senior citizens who buy their drugs in
Canada and Mexico, where they are drastically cheaper.</TE>
<TE>   Viola Qurion, 76, a retired garment worker who lives in
Waterville, Maine, on $1,027 a month, makes an annual pilgrimage to
Canada to buy medicine. She said she otherwise would have to choose
between drugs and food.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't like to go," she said in a telephone interview. "It is
hard for a lot of us to get around, but what choice do we have?"</TE>
<TE>   She said she saved about $500 on the medicines for allergies and
indigestion she bought during a trip this week.</TE>
<TE>   AARP said it is not advocating purchasing drugs abroad. It
described the letter as a reminder of policy and called its timing
"unfortunate," coming so soon after a failed effort at legislation to
allow people to import prescription drugs for their own use.
Currently, U.S. law prohibits Americans from importing medicines that
are available in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "The letter was just an informational letter to members letting
them know that we would be paying claims for all drug purchases,"
said Julie Alexis, manager of member health products at AARP.</TE>
<TE>   UnitedHealth said its letter did not reflect a change in coverage
but was meant to clarify a misunderstanding. It also said it was not
trying to encourage anyone to violate federal Food and Drug
Administration regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone is driving at a high rate of speed and they get in an
accident we cover them, but it's not like we advocate such behavior,"
said UnitedHealth spokesman Mark Lindsay.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay says the insurer doesn't know how many of the 97,000
individuals get their drugs abroad to save money.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAITHERSBURG, Md.</DL>
<LD>They came to honor a man who lost his life mowing grass for a friend.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the grim echo of a sniper's bullet reached even into Friday's
memorial service for James L. Buchanan, a friendly 39-year-old with a
penchant for poetry, a man known to everyone as "Sonny."</LD>
<LD>   "This is still happening around us," said Pastor Charles Updike,
informing the crowd of perhaps 200 mourners that there had been
another fatal shooting.</LD>
<TE>   As police frantically hunted for a van that reportedly raced away
from the murder scene in Fredericksburg, Va., mourners gathered in a
Baptist church across the Potomac River in Maryland with other
thoughts on their minds.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the taped-off crime scenes that have multiplied around
Washington, or the police briefings that now dominate the airwaves,
the subject at hand had nothing to do with catching a killer. Rather,
talk and tears inside the sanctuary were all about a much more
personal matter--the meaning of one individual life, shattered in an
instant by a .223-caliber bullet.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Buchanan was remembered for the handwritten valentine
he sent his girlfriend last year, for the personal attention he
showered on young people and for a frigid winter night long ago, when
he volunteered to guard a stand of Christmas trees for the local Boys
and Girls Club.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look around, you can see that Sonny touched many, many
hearts," said Chuck Thomas, a longtime friend, as he addressed the
mourners.</TE>
<TE>   In a region that is home to many rich and powerful, the elusive
sniper has taken a growing toll on the unheralded working people
whose names are rarely in the news. Each has been killed while going
about the most routine activities of daily life: Pumping gas. Waiting
for a bus. Going to the store. Vacuuming a car.</TE>
<TE>   And as in all tragedies, each victim leaves a personal legacy,
some sort of imprint on the circle of survivors left behind.</TE>
<TE>   Premkumar Walekar, a cab driver from India, 54, was "a
hard-working person who loved his kids and wife," said his brother,
Vijay Walekar. Walekar was slain while pumping $5 worth of gas,
moments after buying a newspaper, a lottery ticket and a pack of gum.</TE>
<TE>   Family members described James D. Martin, 55, shot in a grocery
store parking lot, as a man "who enjoyed the simple pleasures in
life."</TE>
<TE>   Lori Ann Lewis-Rivera, 25, left behind a husband, a 3-year-old
daughter, and a heartbroken family in Mountain Home, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   She was "open and friendly with just about everybody," her father
recalled in an interview Friday. Marion "Boots" Lewis went on to
describe the pain that survivors must now endure: "This animal has
denied us of our daughter .... He killed Lori, he killed a part of
us."</TE>
<TE>   Several days after her death, the answering machine at
Lewis-Rivera's house still played the voice of a little girl
informing callers: "Mommy and daddy will come back soon. Bye."</TE>
<TE>   Two shooting victims, their names withheld for their own safety,
remained alive Friday. Friends described one of them, a 13-year-old
boy who was shot just steps from the front door of his middle school,
as an enthusiastic math student and a fan of basketball and football.
"He's fun to hang with. He don't start trouble," said Tim Thorne, 13.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan was shot while pushing a light green power mower along a
strip of grass near busy Rockville Pike in the Maryland suburbs. He
had recently left the landscaping business and was living at his
father's Virginia farm, but he wanted to help out a longtime
customer.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan was remembered Friday as a caring, generous individual
who tried hard to be a mentor to young people and routinely became
friends with his landscape customers.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who addressed the congregation was Stephanie Lykins,
described in the program as his "beloved partner." Friends said they
had expected the couple to get engaged in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   Her voice quivering, Lykins read aloud the valentine Buchanan sent
her in February, a poem that contained the lines "Sometimes we meet
someone whose eyes smile into our soul ... and that someone is you!"
Shortly after learning of his death, she added, she drove past a
homeless man who sought money from motorists, and she could not help
but respond the way she thought Sonny would have: "I instantly rolled
down the window and handed the man a dollar bill."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Wims, vice president of the Boys and Girls Club of
Montgomery County, said the temperature was below zero one night a
few years ago when Buchanan insisted on guarding a batch of Christmas
trees. "He wouldn't leave," Wims said. "He wanted to make sure nobody
took the trees. He wanted to make sure that every penny was used for
the kids."</TE>
<TE>   One of those kids was George Jones, now a student at Frostburg
State University in Maryland. Speaking from the pulpit, Jones
recalled how Buchanan took him under his wing and got him work.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the church, as a steady rain fell, Jones said Buchanan
always made him feel like an equal--more like they were brothers than
a kid being lectured to by a stern, parental figure. The approach
touched him deeply: "I never had a chance to say thank you," Jones
said.</TE>
<TE>   In Buchanan's honor, his friends are putting together an
organization to provide scholarships and educational funds for
students in need. The Web site is http://www.sonnyskids.org.</TE>

<HD>Military Weaponry in Civilian Hands</HD>
<DH>Technology: The .223-caliber round was developed to solve
problems outlined by an Army study. As many as 28 rifle types now use
it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When Army researchers studied battlefield casualties after the Korean
War, they turned up a major surprise. A carefully aimed rifle, they
learned, did less damage to the enemy than did shooting at random.</LD>
<LD>   Today, half a century later, the results of that study are playing
a role in the chilling sniper attacks in and around the nation's
capital. The Army went on to develop a more accurate rifle for use at
moderate ranges. And someone is now using a version of it to kill
civilians.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities have not said whether they know which make of firearm
the sniper is using. But they have revealed that many of the victims
were hit by a single .223-caliber round. As many as 28 types of
weapons are thought to handle a slug that size.</LD>
<TE>   Originally, the .223 was developed to solve the problems outlined
by the Army researchers. "Once that round was adopted by the
military, it was also quickly adopted for civilian use," said Tom
Diaz of the Violence Policy Center, a Washington group working to
reduce firearm violence. "I would say it's now ubiquitous."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe it's that good for hunting," said Joe Vince, a
former head of the crime guns analysis unit of the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. "I think there's a lot better
deer-hunting rifles out there."</TE>
<TE>   In their statistical study of battlefield wounds, the Army
researchers considered 3 million casualty reports from World War I,
World War II and Korea. They concluded that long-range shooting was
seldom effective and that even top marksmen could not hit targets
beyond 300 yards, according to Duncan Long in his book "The Complete
AR-15/M16 Sourcebook."</TE>
<TE>   The study signaled that the Army should scrap the heavier
ammunition designed to travel long distances. It showed the need for
lighter bullets traveling at higher velocity, capable of use over
shorter distances and of piercing body armor.</TE>
<TE>   The Army challenged gun makers to produce a lightweight weapon to
handle that kind of ammunition. By the early 1960s, the ArmaLite
AR-15 became the leading contender.</TE>
<TE>   Made by the ArmaLite division of Fairchild Industries, an airplane
and engine company, the AR-15 eventually sold well in foreign
nations, notably in South Vietnam. It also was the prototype for the
U.S. military's official rifle, the M-16, a fixture of the Vietnam
War that eventually was adopted by NATO and other military
institutions.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the .223 entered civilian use. Because the
ammunition was widely available, gun makers created a range of
weapons to use it. "And firearms that have some military or police
cachet just sell better," Diaz said. "Some people just like that kind
of branding, so to speak."</TE>
<TE>   Weapons that fire .223-caliber rounds include the Sturm, Ruger
Mini-14 and the Colt AR-15, a descendant of the original AR-15. The
Colt weapon is the civilian, semiautomatic version of the fully
automatic M-16. Colt bought the rights to the AR-15 even before it
became a popular military weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The Colt AR-15 is banned as part of the 1994 federal assault
weapon ban, though weapons lawfully owned before the ban may still be
possessed and sold. The Ruger model was exempted from the 1994 ban.</TE>
<TE>   Vince said the .223 would make a good target-shooting round but is
less useful for hunting. Taking down a deer, which has a larger frame
than a person, would generally require a larger round, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Former FBI senior metallurgist William A. Tobin said the bullet
can be devastating to a person.</TE>
<TE>   Tobin, who carried an M-16 as a Marine in Vietnam, said the light
weight of the round means it can travel with high speed, imparting
high energy against its target. In addition, the bullet tends to
wobble, causing great internal injures.</TE>
<TE>   "It just does incredible damage," he said.</TE>

<DL>CHARLESTON, S.C.</DL>
<LD>After wandering deep in the Atlantic for three weeks, Tropical Storm
Kyle sideswiped the South Carolina coast Friday, swamping streets and
homes with as much as 8 inches of rain and packing destructive winds.</LD>
<LD>   The storm's center passed across Charleston Harbor, the first
tropical system to do so since Hurricane Hugo hit the state in 1989.</LD>
<LD>   The storm was moving north parallel to the coast with sustained
winds of 45 mph.</LD>
<TE>   In Clarendon County, between Charleston and Columbia, roads were
washed out after about 6 inches of rain fell.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen people were rescued from homes surrounded by rising
water, said Colleen Gates, the county's emergency preparedness
director.</TE>
<TE>   In Berkeley County, close to Charleston, about 8 inches of rain
flooded several homes, a grocery store and a senior citizen center.</TE>

<HD>Fox Officials Rethink Release of Sniper Film</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the movie "Phone Booth," actor Colin Farrell plays a man who
decides to answer a ringing public telephone in New York, only to
discover that the anonymous caller is a crazed sniper with a rifle
telling him he'll be shot dead if he hangs up.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, as police on the East Coast conducted a massive
manhunt, executives at 20th Century Fox were pondering whether to
postpone the film's Nov. 15 release because of its similarity to news
events.</LD>
<LD>   "We are evaluating the situation," said Flo Grace, a spokeswoman
for Fox.</LD>
<TE>   But for Larry Cohen, the veteran screenwriter responsible for
"Phone Booth," the drama being played out near the nation's capital
has cast a pall over the film.</TE>
<TE>   "Even before today, I was concerned that a sniper was killing
innocent people and that we had a movie about a sniper who traps a
man in a telephone booth," Cohen said Friday. "It went over
fabulously when we showed it [recently at the Toronto Film Festival].
It was a real ride.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it would be considered a ride now. It would be an
excursion into dark reality."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said he would have no objection if Fox decides to delay the
release.</TE>
<TE>   "I would certainly not call them up and tell them not to do it,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said he visited a theater 10 days ago and watched the
audience react to the film's preview as though they were seeing an
entertaining thriller like "Speed" or "Die Hard."</TE>
<TE>   But when he visited another theater after the East Coast attacks
began, "the reaction had changed completely because of what was
happening in the news. They were gasping at the picture in its
current incarnation."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said he sees parallels between the fictional sniper in the
movie and the real-life serial killer stalking innocent victims.
"Both guys are fixated with a God complex," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They both think they can control people's lives and strike them
down at will because they feel they are omnipotent."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was grateful that the film didn't come out before the
killing began.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize movies can have an influence over people, particularly
people who are mentally deranged."</TE>

<HD>'Sopranos' Feud Puts Mayor on Parade Sidelines</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The great Sopranos War escalated Friday when Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg said he would skip the city's Columbus Day Parade next week
after organizers blocked him from marching with two members of the
HBO hit show.</LD>
<LD>   Bloomberg had invited Lorraine Bracco and Dominic Chianese to join
him in the annual parade Monday up Fifth Avenue, but parade
organizers objected, saying the show about New Jersey mobsters
demeans law-abiding Italian Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor said he had invited Bracco and Chianese as New Yorkers
who have done important volunteer work for the city, not as members
of the cast.</LD>
<TE>   And he scoffed at organizers' predictions that he would back down
on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   But Bloomberg switched gears Friday when the city's corporation
counsel--the mayor's top lawyer--agreed in a brief court hearing that
organizers had the right to rescind any invitation. The U.S. District
Court hearing had been sought by the parade sponsors. Soon afterward,
the mayor announced he would find another Columbus Day event to march
in--a smaller one in the Bronx, perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   It marks the first time in recent memory that a New York City
mayor has decided to stay away from one of the city's most popular
parades.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry if anyone's annoyed, but if my friends can't march ...
[organizers] don't have to have the mayor," he said. Later,
attempting to do his impression of Marlon Brando in "The Godfather"
on his weekly radio show, Bloomberg continued: "I'm sort of walking
along, invite two Italian Americans, want to say thank you on behalf
of the city. And bada bing, bada boom--all of a sudden they're down
my throat, OK?"</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Columbus Citizens Foundation, which runs the
parade, reiterated their belief that the HBO show is a slur on
Italian American culture.</TE>

<DL>SHELBY, N.C.</DL>
<LD>The president of a small Baptist university resigned Friday after
coming under fire from students and alumni for tampering with the
grade point average of a star basketball player two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher White, president of Gardner-Webb University since
1986, admitted at a Sept. 10 faculty meeting that he had ordered that
an F on the player's record be left out in calculating his average.</LD>
<LD>   Professors took a 63-39 vote of no confidence in White. But the
board of trustees, meeting Sept. 27, announced that it would keep
White while demoting two deans who criticized him.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, many of the college's 3,500 students protested almost
daily, instructors taught in black to symbolize the death of the
school's honor code, and alumni criticized the president. Three
professors resigned in protest, including one for whose grandparents
the school was named.</TE>
<TE>   "This is clearly the most wrenching decision I have ever made, but
one I must make in the best interests of helping the university move
away from the pain and divisiveness of recent weeks," White said in
his resignation letter.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sorry that what I did two years ago, out of fairness to a
student, has led to such turmoil and controversy," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   White said he ordered the change in Carlos Webb's GPA because
another school official gave him bad advice about how to improve his

<HD>Plenty of Theories and Questions About Shooting Spree</HD>
<DH>Scene: Police had not confirmed killing is tied to others,
but locals drew their own conclusions.</DH>

<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FREDERICKSBURG, Va.</DL>
<LD>At the latest epicenter of a deadly whodunit along the mid-Atlantic
coast, the fatal gunshot that police assume is the 10th in a series
of sniper shootings turned every observer into a psychoanalyst.</LD>
<LD>   Stranded at a Howard Johnson's motel parking lot, unable to leave
an area taped off by police, truckers questioned the motive for
slayings they described as a deadly lottery. The latest target in a
string of shootings of people who were simply leading their lives was
Kenneth H. Bridges, a 53-year-old Philadelphia man who made the fatal
choice Friday morning to buy gas for his Buick.</LD>
<LD>   "Why is this person doing this? Is it political?" wondered John
Osborne, a veteran driver from Victoria, N.Y., who heard the shot
from outside the Howard Johnson's across the street. "I just hope
whoever it is lives long enough to say why he did it."</LD>
<TE>   Wagging the Teamsters cap on his head, fellow trucker Dennis Shira
of Youngstown, N.Y., said that was unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this guy wants a confrontation. I think he's going to go
down in a hail of gunfire," said Shira, 51, who makes Fredericksburg
a regular stop. "This is a military guy gone bad, just from the way
he's moving and operating. This guy is taking one shot and making it
count."</TE>
<TE>   "He's military--or something," added Alvin Evans, a trucker from
Warrenton, N.C., who also waited hours in the parking lot before
police would let anyone leave.</TE>
<TE>   As two FBI geographic profilers touched down in a helicopter
behind the Exxon station, where the nozzle of the gas pump was still
in the tank of the dead man's silver Buick, residents wondered: Why
here?</TE>
<TE>   It's a game of cat and mouse with the police, Osborne proffered:
"This guy knows the area."</TE>
<TE>   Thinking of the 13-year-old boy wounded Monday in Prince George's
County, Md., after officials opted not to let the initial seven
shootings force the closing of schools, Shira agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "They said they had the kids protected," he said. "I think he did
it just to show them they're wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Along Interstate 95, northbound drivers had plenty of time to get
philosophical. Within an hour of the shooting, police were stopping
white vans heading from the Fredericksburg area toward Washington.
Just south of the Capital Beltway, which encircles Washington, a line
of black-clad police officers in ski masks--standard attire for
police SWAT teams--stood in the traffic lanes in the driving rain.
They were searching for a Chevrolet Astro van that had been seen by
mechanic Bruce Bingham, a self-described "Chevy man" who works in a
Mobil station across the street from the shooting site. But they
looked into the windows of all the passing vans used by the thousands
of construction contractors in the area, in at least one case pulling
a driver out, guns drawn.</TE>
<TE>   They stopped Fords and GMs as well, and box trucks and vans. While
southbound commuters slowed to gape, northbound drivers were mired in
bicycle-speed traffic for hours on the main north-south route that
links Florida and Maine. Carpool lanes were shut down, permitting
groups of police on motorcycles and in cars to speed up and down the
highway.</TE>
<TE>   At day's end, despite having stopped hundreds of vehicles, no
gunman was found. Montgomery County, Md., Police Chief Charles A.
Moose and Spotsylvania County, Va., Sheriff's Office spokesman Maj.
Howard Smith, two officials divided by 60 miles but united by eight
slayings, expressed optimism in the same words: "I am not
frustrated."</TE>
<TE>   But Fredericksburg residents were.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just too close to home--a gas station that we frequently
use," said Patrick Hernandez as he looked across the street at the
victim's car, its license plate covered by cardboard to protect the
owner's identity while police sought to notify his family.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked to some people who are scared to come out. They don't
want to be around windows."</TE>
<TE>   Police, who took evidence from the shooting to a laboratory run by
the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, could not
confirm Friday that the shooting was linked to nine others, seven of
them fatal, in the last 10 days. But irate locals drew their
conclusions: The gunman had now struck in their area twice--the first
time a week before, injuring a woman in a parking lot outside a
crafts store.</TE>
<TE>   "It's made people pretty angry about what's happening," said
Hernandez, a soldier stationed at nearby Ft. Lee, Va.</TE>
<TE>   By noon the reporters had arrived, nearly matching the more than
100 officers from the county sheriff's office, the state police, the
FBI, the ATF and its Virginia counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the Exxon station, divided by yellow police tape that lined
U.S. 1, stood perhaps three dozen TV satellite trucks. Some lined up
to take down the stories of witnesses and bystanders such as Joseph
Drennan.</TE>
<TE>   Drennan had picked Friday to move and was meeting with his movers
at a restaurant at 9:23 a.m. when a middle-age man came running from
the Exxon next door.</TE>
<TE>   "He was hunched down like he was under fire," said Drennan, an
attorney who practices in Alexandria.</TE>
<TE>   "He was shouting, 'Someone was shot at the gas pump.' "</TE>
<TE>   As Drennan phoned 911, plates clinked as diners dropped their
utensils and hit the ground, where they remained for the next 10
minutes or so, when sheriff's deputies and ATF agents arrived. When
he awoke that morning, Drennan said, he had hoped the rain would keep
the gunman at bay.</TE>
<TE>   Bingham, the mechanic, was standing in front of the Mobil station
across the narrow highway when he heard a loud bang.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody just got shot," he told his boss.</TE>
<TE>   "No, that's just a backfire," said station owner Raja Abilmona.</TE>
<TE>   But Bingham, a 21-year Marine Corps veteran, was certain.</TE>
<TE>   " 'No, somebody just got shot,' " Bingham recalled saying. "I
said, 'There's a white van right there,' and it took off."</TE>

<HD>Maine Mayor Vows to Reduce Tension With Somalis</HD>
<DH>Migration: The official inflamed the refugees with a letter
calling their influx a burden.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The mayor of Lewiston, Maine, on Friday backed away from his earlier
statement that a recent, dramatic influx of more than 1,000 Somali
refugees was creating an overwhelming financial burden in his city of
36,000.</LD>
<LD>   Following a meeting with elders from the Somali community, Mayor
Larry Raymond vowed to work to reduce tensions with the hundreds of
mostly Muslim families who have migrated to Maine's second-largest
city.</LD>
<LD>   Raymond was not available for comment. But in a written statement
released after Friday's meeting at City Hall, the Somali elders said:
"Like all families, we have our misunderstandings, but families draw
strength from resolving their issues."</LD>
<TE>   The dispute surfaced earlier this week after Raymond wrote a
three-page letter to Somali leaders in Lewiston charging that the
city was "maxed-out financially, physically and emotionally" by the
influx of immigrants from the east African nation.</TE>
<TE>   Raymond said his city would be unable to absorb more newcomers
from Somalia "without negative results for all."</TE>
<TE>   A contingent of 25 Somalis responded in a letter that Raymond's
message was "inflammatory and disturbing"--and that the mayor himself
was "an ill-informed leader who is bent toward bigotry."</TE>
<TE>   In February 2001, Somali families began arriving in a city filled
largely with descendants of French and Irish immigrants who came to
work in Lewiston's mills and shoe factories more than a century ago.
Lewiston is 98% white; and according to the 2000 U.S. census, Maine
has the highest percentage of white residents of any state.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Somalis were "second-wave" immigrants, meaning they
first settled elsewhere in the U.S. after fleeing to camps in Kenya
from a homeland ravaged by civil war. Many first attempted to put
down roots near Atlanta. But they found the area to be crime-ridden
and inhospitable.</TE>
<TE>   Through service agencies such as Catholic Charities USA, large
groups of Somali families next found their way to Portland, Maine.
But with a rental housing vacancy rate less than 1%, the state's
largest city was unable to absorb the quick surge in its population.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Nadeau, assistant city administrator of Lewiston, said in an
interview Friday that the sudden arrival of more than 1,000
immigrants from Somalia posed challenges and opportunities for a
starkly homogenous community.</TE>
<TE>   "This city had no infrastructure in place to respond to this,"
Nadeau said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the immigrants appeared in Lewiston after their refugee
resettlement assistance from the federal government had run out.</TE>
<TE>   "It is pretty clear that this particular group has needs," Nadeau
said, citing issues such as language, education, housing, health care
and job training.</TE>
<TE>   "These needs have not been met exclusively through those programs
which the federal government has in place to resettle refugees
initially in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen city and regional agencies have provided aid to the Somali
refugees, Nadeau said. General assistance spending in Lewiston has
more than doubled since the immigrants began arriving, with most of
it going to the Somali community, an aide to Nadeau said.</TE>
<TE>   About half of the 412 Somali adults living in Lewiston have found
work, city officials said. An old grocery store on Lewiston's main
street was converted to a mosque. Somali-owned businesses have
blossomed in a downtown that lies close to Bates College.</TE>
<TE>   Mohamed Diriye, who moved to Lewiston from Atlanta, said earlier
in the week, "To be calm and without trouble, that is why we chose
here. In big cities, life is hard."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Friday, Raymond acknowledged that he erred in
sending his letter to Somali leaders without first meeting with them.
But he also said the intent of his missive was misunderstood.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who have interpreted my letter as a 'call to battle' or
have used it as a 'call to draw lines in the sand' totally
misunderstood my message," Raymond said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's letter generated healthy debate on the streets of
Lewiston, as well as on the editorial page of the city's daily
newspaper. Raymond's predecessor, former Mayor Kaileigh Tara,
announced that she "wanted to cry" after reading what Raymond wrote.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with Raymond on Friday, the Somali leaders said they
appreciated "the social and economic pressure that new entrants bring
to the community."</TE>
<TE>   Their statement also said, "We believe that we are part of
Lewiston's future. We believe this is a city where we and our
children can prosper. To that end, we, the city and the mayor are at
one working for the future of Lewiston."</TE>

<LD>Cancer patients have a better chance than previously believed of
living for 15 or 20 years after their disease is diagnosed, according
to a study of 1.7 million cancer patients published in today's
Lancet. Survival rates are as much as 11% higher than earlier
estimates suggest, according to the study by Hermann Brenner of the
German Center for Research on Aging. Brenner used data from the U.S.
National Cancer Institute, comparing 1998 cancer cases and cases
diagnosed between 1978 and 1993.</LD>
<LD>   Improvements in early detection and treatment of cancer, which
have boosted patients' chances of long-term survival, aren't
reflected in older estimates, the study found.</LD>

survival rates for melanoma, Hodgkin's disease and cancers of the

<DL></DL>
<LD>Research suggests the worst of the drought may be over for Colorado
and the Southwest, with El Nino potentially bringing more snow this
winter. But scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration cautioned this week that it will take awhile to
recover from the drought, one of the most severe on record.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists also are unsure of the long-term effect of rising ocean
temperatures that may have worsened the drought stretching from the
United States to central Asia this year. They said the higher
temperatures may be linked to higher volumes of man-made,
heat-trapping gases, associated with global warming. "This has
certainly been a huge drought for the Western United States, with
substantial implications across the board," said NOAA's Randall Dole.</LD>
<LD>   Relief could be on the way, particularly for the Southwest,
including New Mexico and Arizona, because of the return of El Nino,
meteorologist Klaus Wolter said.</LD>

<LD>Archeologists have found a large cache of early 17th century armor
deep in a well in historic Jamestown, Va., a hint as to the military
readiness of the New World's first permanent English settlement.</LD>
<LD>   The pieces, found about 10 feet below the surface, include body
armor and possibly breast plates, back plates and helmets.</LD>
<LD>   "Most archeologists will go their whole lives and not find a
single piece of armor," archeologist Eric Deetz said as each new
piece emerged from the narrow, brick-lined shaft.</LD>
<TE>   Led by Bill Kelso, researchers for the Jamestown Rediscovery
excavation project recovered the first piece of armor from the well
about two weeks ago, when they were only 3 feet below the surface.</TE>

<LD>Is it the skull of an ancient ancestor of modern humans, or does it
belong to an ape that lived 7 million years ago? That depends on whom
you ask. The skull unearthed in the desert of Chad was hailed as
arguably the most important discovery in living memory when it was
revealed and made world headlines in July.</LD>
<LD>   Michel Brunet, of the University of Poitiers, and the team that
reported the find in the journal Nature to much acclaim dubbed it
"Toumai," the name given to children in Chad born close to the dry
season. Its unusual mixture of primitive and humanlike features
prompted scientists to believe it was the earliest member of the
human family found so far and a historic discovery that would shed
light on human evolution.</LD>
<LD>   But other French scientists quickly criticized the claim.
Anthropologist Milford Wolpoff and colleagues at the University of
Michigan joined the doubters this week, arguing in Thursday's edition
of Nature that it was the fossil of an ape.</LD>
<TE>   "It is not a human or a direct ancestor of humans," Wolpoff said
in an interview.</TE>

<LD>An international team of researchers has discovered more than 100 new
frog species in the Sri Lankan rain forest, making the island an
amphibian hot spot of global significance. Biologist Madhava
Meegaskumbura of Boston University and his colleagues confirmed the
novelty of each species by comparing them with Sri Lankan specimens
in museums around the world.</LD>
<LD>   Sri Lanka now has 140 species of frogs--on an island of more than
65,000 square kilometers, which has lost more than 95% of its rain
forest habitat.</LD>
<LD>   The number of species is comparable to the number on tropical
islands that are 10 times larger, such as Madagascar. The findings
suggest additional places of rich vertebrate diversity may be found
elsewhere in tropical Asia, the authors reported in Friday's edition
of Science.</LD>

<HD>Pastor of Megachurch Making Equally Big Splash With Book</HD>
<DH>Media: Rick Warren of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest
began 'The Purpose-Driven Life' as a series of sermons. The launch is
a kind of virtual Sunday school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Warren, a superstar pastor in the megachurch movement, will kick
off one of the most ambitious book promotions in Christian publishing
history today by beaming via satellite a sermon based on his book to
an estimated 500,000 people in 1,500 churches worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign for the book, "The Purpose-Driven Life," is called
"40 Days of Purpose" and is meant to be a 21st century form of Sunday
school for Christian adults who are fuzzy on the fundamentals of
living a God-centered life. And it's only the latest entrepreneurial
move by Warren, head of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, Warren has earned international recognition by
training more than 250,000 pastors from 125 countries, launching the
pastors.com Web site for those in the ministry, and signing up 60,000
pastors for a free e-mail newsletter, Rick Warren's Ministry Toolbox.</LD>
<TE>   Advance sales of the book, an outgrowth of a sermon series Warren
has given at Saddleback for three years, topped more than 500,000
copies before it hit retailers Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The publisher, Zondervan, said the figure is the second highest in
company history, after Billy Graham's autobiography, "Just As I Am,"
which was co-published with Harper Collins in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The early flood of sales stems from Warren's popularity with
evangelical Christians and a carefully planned and expensive book
launch designed to get the faithful reading a chapter daily for the
next 40 days.</TE>
<TE>   Pastors across the nation--and at 52 churches in Los Angeles and
Orange counties--will gear their next six Sunday messages to the
book's material, with sermon outlines provided by Warren.</TE>
<TE>   They'll have access through the Internet to videos of Warren's
services built around "The Purpose-Driven Life" theme at Saddleback,
which started two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   A national marketing campaign takes in all forms of media, secular
and Christian. And a CD, "Songs for a Purpose-Driven Life," features
recordings by popular Christian artists.</TE>
<TE>   "The [promotion] budget for 'The Purpose-Driven Life' is two to
three times more than any book we'll publish this year," said Greg
Stielstra, associate marketing director for trade books.</TE>
<TE>   Warren said his book answers three of life's most basic riddles.
The question of existence: "Why am I alive?" The question of
significance: "Does my life matter?" And the question of intention:
"What is my purpose?"</TE>
<TE>   Scott L. Thumma, who studies the megachurch movement at the
Hartford Institute for Religious Research in Connecticut, said Warren
has created an evangelical teaching program dealing with the basic
tenets of faith for those drawn to "seeker-friendly" churches.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a contemporary rendering of confirmation and catechism
classes," Thumma said. "But it's slick, user-friendly and
media-savvy.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never been a curriculum that the whole entire adult
congregation was going to go through at the same time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Warren has made books more affordable to churches by waiving his
royalties for those sales. He bought 25,000 copies for his church,
which started in 1980 with two families and now averages crowds of
16,000 for weekend services.</TE>
<TE>   The new book is the follow-up to Warren's seminal book, "The
Purpose-Driven Church," a pastor's blueprint for a spiritually
healthy church, which has sold 1 million copies and been translated
into 20 languages. It was also listed in "100 Christian Books That
Changed the 20th Century."</TE>
<TE>   Warren said evidence already shows the positive effects of the
book's materials. The first test program was rolled out in 1999 at
Saddleback Church. He said there were dramatic increases in baptisms,
church membership, daily Bible reading and small-group study. A
broader pilot program "quietly tested" last year at 50 churches
produced similar results.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the new campaign, attendance at Saddleback in the last
three weeks has increased 3,000 for weekend services, Warren said.
"What I am most excited about is the 25,000 we have meeting in homes
in 2,400 small groups" to study the material.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Flippin, senior pastor of the 300-member Blue Ridge
Christian Fellowship in Galax, Va., has spent $3,500 on copies of
Warren's book and $15,000 more to market the "40 Days of Purpose"
campaign. He took out five billboards near the church, had novelty
key chains made and placed ads in local papers.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that strongly that will change their lives," Flippin
said.</TE>

seller.</CP>

<HD>Angels in the Classroom Are a Hit With Elementary School
Pupils</HD>

<LD>Believe in the power of the Rally Monkey. Even more impressive than
getting the Anaheim Angels this far, it can keep a roomful of
squirming third-graders intent on learning.</LD>
<LD>   Watching over pupils at Panorama Elementary in Santa Ana as they
profile players or compose poems about halos and home runs is a plush
version of the baseball team's good-luck charm along with a souvenir
stand's worth of pennants, jerseys and posters.</LD>
<LD>   Teacher Ginger Silverman and several other Orange County teachers
are using the success of the Angels to teach their lessons, saying it
makes learning easier and more relevant when required topics like
complete sentences, geography and division involve something fun.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not just teaching rah rah Angels," said Silverman, who has
long used baseball as a teaching tool in her 11 years with the Orange
Unified School District. "I'm teaching them things they need to know
anyway, but in a way that makes them look forward to learning."</TE>
<TE>   Students such as Anthony Delaney, who usually scorn journal
writing and poetry, are happily spinning tales--in complete sentences
using compound words like bullpen and home run--of the Angels' march
through the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony said he looks forward to writing about subjects like the
Angels' winning their division or responding to such sentence prompts
as: "The bat hit the ball, and the ball hit a bird ...."</TE>
<TE>   "It's way more fun, and it's easier because I can write better
sentences because I already know what the words mean," said Anthony,
who giggled as he relayed his last journal entry, in which the bird
died and landed in third baseman Troy Glaus' hand.</TE>
<TE>   This week, children drew baseball stadiums with chalk and pastels,
inspired by an 1875 painting of baseball players practicing.
Silverman plans to post them alongside the students' player profiles
and five-line poems about the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   At Calvary Chapel Anaheim, second-grade teacher Joy Barber is
using the Angels' success to teach lessons about sportsmanship,
teamwork and goal-setting. And in Laguna Niguel, baseball has been
integrated into nearly all of fifth-grade teacher Nona Reimer's
lessons at John Malcolm Elementary.</TE>
<TE>   Reimer's students learned the state capitals and how to round
numbers as they plotted a cross-country baseball stadium pilgrimage,
compared poetry using stanzas of "Casey at the Bat," and made oral
presentations on players' lives.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives more meaning to learning about those things when I can
relate them to something they're interested in already," the teacher
said. "Otherwise, it's just rote memorization."</TE>
<TE>   Reimer scoffs at those who think teachers are straying too far
from state-defined standards.</TE>
<TE>   "To me it's important that kids don't learn the standards just to
be able to bubble in accurately on a standardized test," Reimer said.
"They have to be able to hook the standards into real-life situations
and know how the standards relate to the world that they live in."</TE>

<LD>As University of California lecturers statewide get set to strike for
two days next week, UC Irvine Chancellor Ralph J. Cicerone is
encouraging students to cross picket lines and report to class.</LD>
<LD>   In an e-mail to students this week, Cicerone predicted that a
walkout Monday and Tuesday by more than 400 contract lecturers at the
Irvine campus would not disrupt classes or other activities.</LD>
<LD>   "Please remember that your right to cross picket lines--to attend
class, go to work or conduct campus business--is fully protected by
law," he wrote.</LD>
<TE>   The strike by members of the American Federation of Teachers over
alleged unfair labor practices comes after more than two years of
stalled contract negotiations.</TE>

<HD>Missing Hiker's Family Hopes for a Miracle</HD>
<DH>Search: Retired Marine, 66, has not been seen since he took
off into the Yosemite wilderness three weeks ago. His sons keep
hunting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter Reinhard walked into the Yosemite woods three weeks ago and
hasn't been seen since. Not a trace.</LD>
<LD>   Park rangers found his car parked benignly at the White Wolf trail
head west of Tuolumne Meadows. They searched long and hard, with
helicopters and bloodhounds, boats and a big crew of park employees.</LD>
<LD>   Not a sign has turned up of the 66-year-old retired Marine from
Oro, Ariz.</LD>
<TE>   Reinhard's sons long ago joined the hunt, and haven't given up.
They know that with each passing day the possibility their father
might be found alive slips further off the charts.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, they're pressing ahead, hoping that somehow he found
shelter from the three storms that have poured rain, hail and snow on
the park in recent weeks, that somehow he found food and water.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it's slight; we know we're maybe grasping at straws, but
we're hoping," said Kevin Reinhard, 32, who lives in Rochester, N.Y.
"It's not probable, but it's possible that he is alive. It would be a
miracle, but that's what we're hoping for."</TE>
<TE>   Park officials have no reason to suspect foul play, said Deb
Schweizer, a park ranger. Instead, they figure Reinhard--a veteran
hiker--decided to venture alone into the woods and something went
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   They hope some visitor might have run across Reinhard the day he
became missing, believed to be around Sept. 19. Since then, there's
been no activity on his credit cards or any other sign of him.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhard is described as 5 feet 8, 145 pounds, with blue eyes,
graying brown hair and clean-shaven at the time of his departure. He
is balding and has a fair complexion.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Reinhard, who came west nearly two weeks ago and has
searched every day since along with his brother, 30-year-old Walter,
said his father was in terrific physical shape.</TE>
<TE>   He had no medical problems and didn't take any medications. He
worked out every day, took hikes of up to 24 miles twice a week. If
he wasn't hiking, he was in the gym three hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   He was active in the hiking club at the retirement community where
he lived near Tucson. But mostly Reinhard hiked alone. No one else
could keep up with the old Marine, his son said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Marine Corps, his father was a member of the elite Force
Reconnaissance squad, and spent two combat tours in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhard was last seen wearing a gray felt alpine hat with a
narrow brim and leather hiking boots. He usually carries a large
fanny pack when he hikes.</TE>
<TE>   But his Swiss army knife was left in the car, Reinhard's son said.
Almost every night has been below freezing.</TE>
<TE>   The son said Reinhard's credit card was last used Sept. 19 to fill
up at a gas station about 15 miles from the trail head where his car
was found.</TE>
<TE>   A park employee who was closing down a lodge in the White Wolf
area is believed to be the last person to have seen him, about 9
a.m., Kevin Reinhard said. He remembered a fellow with a German
alpine hat asking directions that morning to a lake a few miles up
the trail.</TE>
<TE>   The son suspects that his father, who was expected to depart the
park that day, might have decided to stay longer once he hit the
trail. He might have opted for a longer hike, perhaps to distant
Smith Peak, which affords a stunning view of the Tuolumne River
gorge.</TE>
<TE>   The active search was called off last week. Park employees and
volunteers searched all the trails within a 150-mile radius of the
White Wolf trail head. They have calculated that there's a 97%
probability that he's nowhere they've looked so far.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a wilderness area, it's extremely rugged, and there are
some cliffs that couldn't be searched for safety reasons," Schweizer
said. "We're appealing to anyone who might have bumped into him to
let us know. Where was he headed? What we're needing right now are
some leads."</TE>
<TE>   The sons and a large number of park employees--volunteering their
time--have continued the hunt. Today, they'll be joined by a team of
at least 28 Marines from the Mountain Warfare Training Center in
Bridgeport, Calif., Kevin Reinhard said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll stay here until they leave," he said. "Hopefully, by then
we'll have some resolution to this."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who may have information about Walter Reinhard, or anyone
who was in the White Wolf area on Sept. 19, is asked to call the
Yosemite National Park communications center at (209) 379-1992.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 34-year-old Simi Valley man riding his motorcycle at 90 mph on a
city street was killed Thursday night when he collided with a pickup
truck during a police pursuit.</LD>
<LD>   James Vargas died when his Suzuki 750 hit a Dodge Ram carrying two
women on Fitzgerald Road. The women were not injured.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began about 8 p.m. when Officer Vernon Trujillo tried
to pull Vargas over for speeding, said Lt. Rex Jones.</LD>
<TE>   Trujillo followed Vargas, without his red lights or siren on, but
the officer never got closer than 100 yards, said Capt. Tony Harper.
On Fitzgerald, Vargas tried to pass the Dodge Ram on the left while
the driver was attempting a left turn, Harper said.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas slammed into the driver's side of the pickup and was thrown

<LD>A Kern County judge has approved an environmental report for two
proposed 14,000-cow dairies, allowing the project to go forward.</LD>
<LD>   During the last two years, Judge Roger Randall twice has ordered
additional review for the projects, but said this week the latest
environmental review was sufficient.</LD>
<LD>   George and James Borba have been proposing to build the two
separate dairies for the last four years.</LD>
<TE>   In 1998, environmental groups filed suit when it appeared the
dairies would be approved by Kern County without environmental
review. The groups sued again two years ago after they said they
weren't satisfied with the environmental report.</TE>

to appeal the judge's ruling, made Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Farm Workers' Families to Get $2 Million in Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The families of 13 farm workers who were killed and two others who
were injured in 1999 when their van crashed on their way home from
picking tomatoes in California will receive nearly $2 million, the
Mexican government said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Officials in Mexico City handed out symbolic checks from a ruling
by a U.S. judge earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   "The life of these people will change because they are from the
countryside and dedicate themselves to agriculture," said attorney
Robert Perez. "They depended a lot on the money that comes from the
United States."</LD>
<TE>   Judge Stephen Webster ruled that the families of 13 people killed
in the accident and two survivors were eligible for workers'
compensation claims and death benefits. The decision exempted the
workers from the state's "going and coming" rule that prevents
commuters from collecting workers' compensation benefits. The judge
said the survivors could collect workers' compensation because they
were required to use the labor contractor for transportation, and
both the labor contractor and grower benefited from the
transportation they were provided.</TE>
<TE>   The workers were headed home when their van slammed into a truck
making an illegal turn near the tiny community of Five Points,
southwest of Fresno. The majority had been riding on wooden benches.
The crash inspired a California law that requires farm worker
vehicles to have seat restraints along with factory-made seats
instead of wooden benches.</TE>

<HD>Simon Makes Pitch in Mexico, Promises More Cooperation</HD>
<DH>Politics: With an eye on the Latino vote, he vows to
improve relations if elected. But some in his audience are skeptical
and Davis gaffe follows him across the border.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>After a tumultuous week of campaigning, Bill Simon Jr. went south of
the border Friday, where the GOP gubernatorial candidate told Mexican
officials and business leaders that he would work to better relations
between California and its neighbor.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at a national conference on globalization here, Simon
promised if elected to meet regularly with his counterpart in Baja
California, help the federal government to improve trade and shorten
delays at border crossings. He also met privately with Baja
California Gov. Eugenio Elorduy.</LD>
<LD>   "As governor of California, it will be my solemn vow, solemn
pledge to you today, to meet regularly with your governor to address
mutual issues," the Republican businessman told several hundred
people gathered at an upscale Tijuana hotel for a three-day economic
development conference.</LD>
<TE>   With Friday's trip, Simon attempted to raise his stature and
appeal to Mexican Americans, most of whom tilt Democratic. His visit
was similar to a tactic used by Gray Davis, who led a Democratic
delegation to Mexico City when he was campaigning for governor in
1998 and promised a dramatically different relationship between
Mexico and California.</TE>
<TE>   Since his election, Davis has made at least four trips to Mexico,
including one just four weeks after taking office.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's outreach to Mexican leaders Friday got mixed reviews, with
many conference participants complaining that his remarks were vague
and his goals unclear.</TE>
<TE>   "He did not bring a plan; he did not say what he was going to do,"
said Maria Vidal, the Tijuana director for the National Urban
Alliance, and member of an umbrella civic organization that invited
Simon. "It seems he just he wanted to come and show himself off. We
don't want a governor who we can never get to understand the
anxieties that we have on the border."</TE>
<TE>   But Joaquin Aceves, the representative of a Tijuana business
organization, said he hoped the candidate's remarks would lead to
more cooperation on economic development projects along the border.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that in a near future this could lead to a better
relationship because the economy we have is so interdependent,"
Aceves said.</TE>
<TE>   Only a handful of California reporters were alerted to Simon's
trip, almost all of them members of the Spanish-language media. And
Simon, who was lambasted this week for falsely accusing Davis of
accepting a political donation in a state office, refused to take any
questions in Tijuana, leaving an angry group of Mexican reporters in
his wake.</TE>
<TE>   In a later phone interview with The Times, Simon said there was
not enough time to take questions. He said he wanted to focus on his
speech and meeting with the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that makes the economy of Mexico stronger I think is
good for the state of California and the United States," he said,
elaborating on his formal remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Even with Simon out of the country, however, Davis continued to
hammer him over his rival's accusation that he had illegally
collected campaign cash in a state office. Actually, the check was
turned over at a private home.</TE>
<TE>   Davis insisted that the Republican candidate owes him an apology.
On Thursday, Simon said he regretted the incident, but did not use
the word "apology."</TE>
<TE>   "You do not accuse a sitting governor of committing a crime unless
you have all of the facts," Davis told reporters after a speech on
health care at a hotel near LAX. "He had none of the facts. He turned
out to be totally wrong. I'm sure he's embarrassed. But the least he
could do is express an apology to the person he essentially defamed."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said that his expression of regret would have to suffice.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess they'll never be happy," he said in the phone interview,
adding that he still wants an apology from Davis for the negative
television commercials the governor has run. And he called for a
change in the tenor of the race. "Really, at this point, with 25 days
left, I think it's time to focus on the issues that affect people
every day."</TE>
<TE>   But Simon nonetheless had to field a barrage of additional
criticism about his bungled accusation from conservative radio hosts
usually supportive of his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   During an interview on KMJ-AM (580) in Fresno, Simon tried to
shift blame to the California Police and Sheriffs Organization, the
group that gave Davis the check and released a picture purporting to
show an illegal contribution. On Tuesday, however, Simon had called
the photo "proof" that Davis broke the law.</TE>
<TE>   "You're the man running the campaign," host Bill Manders told him
in a tone of exasperation. "You're running for governor."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Simon faced an intense interrogation on the "John and Ken
Show" on KFI-AM (640) when he again tried to distance himself from
the fiasco, blaming the release of the photo on COPS.</TE>
<TE>   "This is their dog in the hunt," Simon said. "It was a mistake for
us to be in the vicinity."</TE>
<TE>   "In the vicinity?" shouted one of the hosts, both of whom have
fiercely criticized Davis. "You turned the spotlight on it."</TE>
<TE>   There is "an overwhelming perception that your campaign is just
one big screw-up," one of the radio personalities added.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, Simon sent a letter of apology to the former head of
COPS, who was pictured giving a check to Davis in the contested
photo.</TE>
<TE>   Simon did not send a letter of apology to Davis. "You don't see
any apology coming from Gray Davis for running a multimillion-dollar
campaign of deceptions and lies against Bill Simon," said spokesman
Mark Miner.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Simon's campaign began airing a new television commercial
that criticizes Davis for his fund-raising practices and handling of
the state's budget and energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   During his visit to Tijuana, Simon tried to ignore the week's
controversy. He showcased his work as a businessman and said he would
work to protect the environment on both sides of the border.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fate is united by both our history and our future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon did not mention his opposition to a bill that would have
granted some illegal immigrants driver's licenses, or his support for
strengthening border security.</TE>
<TE>   Elorduy, the governor of Baja California, said he welcomed Simon's
visit.</TE>
<TE>   Although Davis has visited Mexico frequently, he has not
participated in joint meetings with the governors of Mexican and
American border states, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's necessary for the government of California to be closer to
us than it is," the governor said before his meeting with Simon. "On
some occasions, we feel distant. We have too many common situations,
and that's why it's important that the governor of our northern
neighbor is more aware of what is happening in this state."</TE>
<TE>   However, Iris Juarez, the director of Grupo Fraternidad, an
umbrella organization of civic groups in Tijuana that invited Simon
to address the conference, said she was disappointed with his visit.</TE>
<TE>   "People know [Davis] has been sensitive to our issues," Juarez
said. Simon's "speech was very brief. We would have liked to hear
more proposals. If he became governor, what would his plans be for
the border?"</TE>
<TE>   Simon made an attempt to speak some Spanish during his remarks,
awkwardly enunciating his words with a thick American twang. Twice,
when he referred to the city of Ensenada, he pronounced it
"En-se-NEE-da," prompting clucks of disapproval from the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't know how to speak Spanish, don't try," grumbled

<LD>WASHINGTON--Some local authorities and private firms in Germany use
"sect filters" focused on the U.S.-based Church of Scientology in
hiring and contracting, the annual report from the U.S. State
Department's Office of International Religious Freedom said.</LD>
<LD>   Federal agencies in Germany have discouraged property sales to
Scientologists. Civil service job applicants in Bavaria must list
Scientology ties, and followers elsewhere report employment problems.</LD>
<LD>   The German government has said Scientology has some traits of
organized crime that potentially undermine democracy, and placed it
under scrutiny by domestic intelligence agents in 1997.</LD>

<LD>In a look at Americans' beliefs, a new survey shows that 44% think
the Bible, the Koran and the Book of Mormon express the same
spiritual truths.</LD>
<LD>   The survey by the Barna Research Group also found that
three-quarters of American adults believe in the Trinity, agree that
"every person has a soul that will live forever, either in God's
presence or absence," and reject the idea that only well-trained
theological scholars can correctly interpret the Bible.</LD>
<LD>   Though 44% of those surveyed said "the Bible, the Koran and the
Book of Mormon are all different expressions of the same spiritual
truths," 38% disagreed.</LD>
<TE>   Fifty-one percent of Americans agree that "praying to deceased
saints can have a positive effect in a person's life" and 39%
disagreed. But the difference of opinion is more striking between
Protestants and Catholics, with 80% of Catholics agreeing, compared
with 41% of Protestants. Sixty percent of Latinos agree with the
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-five percent of American adults believe it is "possible to
communicate with others after they die," compared with 55% who
dispute that idea</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-nine percent of those polled said Satan, or the devil, is
not a living being but rather a symbol of evil, compared with 34% who
believe Satan exists.</TE>
<TE>   Americans are divided over whether Jesus sinned when he lived on
Earth, with 42% saying he did and 50% saying he did not.</TE>
<TE>   Respondents also were divided about whether a person who "is
generally good or does enough good things for others" while on Earth
will earn a place in heaven. Fifty percent agreed and 42% disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether "the Bible does not specifically condemn
homosexuality," 27% agreed and 53% disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   George Barna, president of the Ventura-based marketing research
firm, said the results reflect an increasing inclusiveness about
faith among many Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "Christians have increasingly been adopting spiritual views that
come from Islam, Wicca, secular humanism, the Eastern religions and
other sources," he said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we remain a largely Bible-illiterate society, few are
alarmed [by] or even aware of the slide toward syncretism--a belief
system that blindly combines beliefs from many different faith
perspectives."</TE>
<TE>   The results are based on a telephone survey of 630 American adults
in August and had a margin of error of 4.1 percentage points.</TE>

<HD>Evangelists Defend Trying to Convert Jews</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WHEATON, Ill.--The World Evangelical Alliance is taking issue with an
August report from U.S. Catholic bishops that opposes efforts to
target Jews for conversion.</LD>
<LD>   The evangelical organization, an alliance of 120 national and
regional church fellowships and 75 nondenominational ministries, has
reaffirmed and reissued a declaration defending Jewish evangelism
that was written in 1989 by 16 theologians from nine nations.</LD>
<LD>   One of them, the Rev. J.I. Packer, an Anglican teaching at Regent
College in Vancouver, British Columbia, endorsed the reaffirmation.
"Sharing Jesus Christ with our Jewish friends is as important a task
as it ever was," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The Catholic bishops said deepened appreciation of God's unbroken
covenant with the Jewish people means "campaigns that target Jews for
conversion to Christianity are no longer acceptable in the Catholic
Church."</TE>
<TE>   But the evangelical paper defends such targeted evangelism, and
denies that Israel's covenant relationship by itself brings salvation
or that "any person can enjoy God's favor apart from the mediation of
Jesus Christ."</TE>

<LD>WASHINGTON--There are as many as 3.5 million Muslims in the United
States, according to the latest estimate from a Muslim researcher.
That's fewer than other efforts to count the population have found.</LD>
<LD>   Mohamed Nimer of the Council on American-Islamic Relations
presents his figure in The North American Muslim Resource Guide, the
first comprehensive listing and analysis of all types of Muslim
organizations in the United States and Canada.</LD>
<LD>   Nimer says the "minimum" number of Muslims in the U.S. is between
2,560,000 and 4,390,000;3.5 million is a rough average.</LD>
<TE>   He bases that figure on data for immigrants (factoring in that
many people from Islamic lands or with Arabic surnames are
Christian), plus projections for U.S.-born Muslims from religious
identifications on high school SAT test questionnaires.</TE>
<TE>   A survey co-sponsored last year by Nimer's council, The Mosque in
America, estimated that there are 6 million to 7 million U.S.
Muslims, 2 million of whom attend mosque during major religious
festivals.</TE>

<LD>VANCOUVER, British Columbia--The Canadian government was scrambling
this week to explain why three wives of a Mormon polygamist in
British Columbia had been allowed to immigrate to Canada from the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   Saying polygamy is illegal in Canada, opposition members in the
House of Commons this week peppered the federal immigration minister
with questions about how senior officials came to allow the three
wives to cross the Idaho-British Columbia border to live in a
polygamist commune. Immigration Minister Denis Coderre promised to
look into news reports that staff members in his department had
granted the three women permission to immigrate in the 1990s to live
with Winston Blackmore, who until last year was leader of the
1,000-member sect called Bountiful, near the town of Creston.</LD>
<LD>   The polygamist group is known as the Fundamentalist Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a Mormon offshoot rejected by the
established Mormon church.</LD>

<HD>An Issue That Can Try Body and Soul</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Religious attitudes toward organ donations vary.
The Catholic Church and Islamic groups see such acts as charity.
Among Jews, a debate rages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Los Angeles screenwriter Robert Avrech, it was a wrenching choice
between two of his greatest loves: his Orthodox Jewish faith and the
life of his only son.</LD>
<LD>   His son, Ariel, is in critical need of a lung transplant. Avrech
knew of a man who had just collapsed on a softball field and was in a
coma. But Avrech, guided by his religious and moral compass, would
not approach the family about a possible organ donation.</LD>
<LD>   It seemed "ghoulish," he said. He saw a slippery slope that would
turn the desire for healing and life into a morbid wish for death to
harvest organs. Wouldn't that make him no better than a Nazi?</LD>
<TE>   Even after the man eventually died, Avrech still declined to
approach the family, for he says his Jewish values, particularly the
need to show reverence to the body and respect for mourning, overrode
even his own desperate desire to save his son's life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult situation for me, because I want to save Ariel's
life," Avrech said slowly, his voice weighted with emotion he does
not try to hide. "But there are worse things than death, like leading
an immoral life."</TE>
<TE>   Avrech's case underscores the sometimes wrenching dilemmas--and
vast divergence of belief--that occur in the religious world over the
issue of organ donations.</TE>
<TE>   All religions cherish the value of saving lives, but questions of
when death begins and when donated organs may be used have raised a
thicket of moral issues.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, for instance, an ancient religious belief that cutting a
corpse defiles the individual's spirit has severely hampered organ
donations. Not until 1997 did the nation recognize brain death as
legal death, becoming the last advanced industrial nation to move
away from the idea that death occurs only when the heart and lungs
cease working. In part, the hesitation stemmed from beliefs among
some Buddhist schools of thought that transplants from the brain-dead
would deprive a soul of reincarnation.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic Church, by contrast, has an "upbeat, positive
attitude" toward organ donation, said James Walter, the O'Malley
professor of bioethics at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.
At St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, he said, a pastoral care
team broaches the subject of donations with families as early as the
onset of brain death. As a result, the Roman Catholic hospital is one
of the largest sources of organ donations in Los Angeles County, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The positive Catholic tradition stems from the 1940s, when
theologians began promoting organ donations as an act of charity,
"the willingness to sacrifice for the sake of other people," Walter
said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials turned to the concept of charity to legitimize
donations, because the church until then had frowned on mutilating
the body except for the purpose of benefiting the greater
whole--amputating a gangrenous limb, for instance. That "principle of
totality," sacrificing a part for the whole, could not be used to
justify donations lest it open the door for totalitarian societies,
for instance, to claim ownership of people's organs. So a new
principle--personal acts of voluntary charity--had to be established,
Walter said.</TE>
<TE>   Within Islam, organ donations are encouraged under the Koranic
exhortation that "whoever gives life, it is like giving life to all
human beings," said Maher Hathout, a retired Muslim physician and
member of the Kuwait-based Islamic Medical Conference. The group
affirmed organ donations as an act of charity several years ago, he
said, stipulating that organs were not to be bought and sold and that
living donors could not endanger themselves in offering organs. He
added that Muslim scholars have also affirmed the use of organs from
pigs--a growing supply source--despite prohibitions against eating
pork.</TE>
<TE>   In the Jewish world, debate rages between religious movements and
even within them.</TE>
<TE>   "To many people the issue of organ donations is very
emotion-laden," said Rabbi Yitzchok Adlerstein, a professor of Jewish
law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. "Unless you have a very,
very definite cause, and usually an immediate need, Judaism attaches
a high value on keeping the body intact."</TE>
<TE>   Adlerstein said that entrenched value explains why crews in Israel
can be seen gathering up the body pieces of a victim killed in
terrorist blasts, for instance, to ensure a proper burial. There is
also a folkloric belief that the body should be intact for
resurrection after death, he and others say.</TE>
<TE>   Those attitudes, however, appear to be changing in at least some
sectors of Judaism. In 1995, legal scholars from the Conservative
movement, the Jewish grouping with the highest number of U.S.
synagogue members, approved a rabbinical ruling that not only
declared organ donations permissible but said they were an obligation
under Jewish law.</TE>
<TE>   "Saving a life takes precedence over the general principle that
honor is due to the dead body," said Rabbi Elliot Dorff, an expert in
bioethics at the University of Judaism in Los Angeles and author of
"Matter of Life and Death: A Jewish Approach to Modern Medical
Ethics." He added that organ donations in fact constitute honor to
the dead body and give meaning to the death of loved ones for
grieving families.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1995 decision to deem organ donations a religious
obligation, many Conservative temples have promoted them through
sermons, fliers and distribution of donor cards, said Rabbi Bradley
Shavit Artson, dean of the Zeigler School of Rabbinic Studies at the
University of Judaism.</TE>
<TE>   The issue, however, remains highly controversial within Orthodox
Judaism. Rabbis from opposing camps continue to vociferously debate
when death begins-- at the cessation of neurological functions, known
as brain death, or when the heart and respiratory systems fail. The
definition is key to organ donations, because doctors using
heart-lung machines can keep those systems working a long time.
Rabbis also disagree about whether there is consensus on the issue
within Orthodoxy and about the scope of a late 1980s decision by the
Chief Rabbinate of Israel that accepted brain death as the standard
and paved the way for heart and liver transplants.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi David Bleich, a professor of the Talmud at Yeshiva
University in New York, said the vast majority of Orthodox scholars
reject the brain-death standard. Traditional Jews cannot be party to
pulling the plug on a patient before the heart and respiratory
functions stop, he said. He added, however, that Orthodox Jews could
receive organs extracted from brain-dead patients as long as they had
nothing to do with obtaining them. Bleich also criticized the Chief
Rabbinate's decision, saying it relied on "erroneous information" in
making its ruling.</TE>
<TE>   That position provokes a withering rebuttal from Rabbi Moshe David
Tendler, a professor of medical ethics and chairman of the biology
department at the same Yeshiva University. He said Jews who reject
brain death should not then be able to harvest organs from brain-dead
patients, or they would be akin to "hit men" waiting for others to
kill someone so they benefit. Tendler accepts brain death as the
standard and maintains that organ donations are required by Judaism.
He said that only "inconsequential scholars" disagree with him.</TE>
<TE>   As the debate rages, Ariel Avrech needs new lungs. At minimum, he
needs donations of two lung lobes, which can be extracted in what
medical experts regard as a relatively safe procedure.</TE>
<TE>   The 21-year-old rabbinical student suffers from pulmonary
fibrosis, a severe scarring of the lungs caused by massive
chemotherapy he has undergone since being diagnosed with a brain
tumor at age 14. In May, his breathing functions deteriorated so
rapidly that he was forced to return to Los Angeles from his
rabbinical studies in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time, Avrech is attached to an oxygen machine. He
tires easily, and can no longer devote his customary nine hours a day
to his beloved Talmud study--managing only an hour at most these
days. The soft-spoken, self-contained student, who wears a black
velvet yarmulke and white tassels as a reminder of the commandments,
spends most of his time now in prayer, with doctors or receiving a
stream of phone calls and visits from well-wishers.</TE>
<TE>   Homebound, Avrech also serves as a culinary guinea pig for his
father, who has learned to cook for his son--aspiring to move from
George Foreman grill items to fancy concoctions like Portobello
Napoleon. They spend hours watching DVDs together--most recently,
howling over a documentary on a Thai Elvis impersonator. Avrech says
his son, who has endured his illnesses without complaint, has become
his hero.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if this is God's intention, but Ariel and I know
each other better and love each other more than ever before," said
the elder Avrech, his eyes filling with tears, "I wish Ariel weren't
ill, but I'm going to take advantage of it."</TE>
<TE>   The family's Orthodox community has rallied around them. Members
of Avrech's synagogue, Young Israel of Century City, have brought
food, gifts and even daily services to his home during the High Holy
Days. The Jewish Healthcare Foundation has distributed an e-mail on
Avrech's plight throughout the Americas, Europe, Brazil and Israel.
The appeal, a "Life-Saving Search for a Living Lobar Lung Transplant
Donor," says the suitable donor would be an adult male, age 18-50,
5-foot-8 or taller, blood type A or O, a nonsmoker and non-asthmatic
in good health.</TE>
<TE>   So far, more than 20 potential donors have stepped forth. But few,
if any, appear to meet the qualifications--including a New York man,
75, who had donated a kidney before and was now eager to offer Avrech
a lung lobe. As time ticks by, the family is reaching out to the
broader community.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Ariel Avrech says his ordeal simply represents the
unique challenges God presents everyone, challenges that have helped
him grow. He focuses not on his pain but the beauty and godliness his
illness has elicited.</TE>
<TE>   "People have displayed tremendous courage, bravery and generosity,
and they wouldn't do this if I weren't sick," he said. "I see all of
the beautiful things coming out in this world because of me."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Bishops' Leader to Discuss New Sex Abuse Policy With
Vatican</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>The Vatican is withholding its response to the U.S. bishops' new
"zero tolerance" rules on pedophilia in order to discuss its strong
reservations with Bishop Wilton Gregory, president of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, according to Vatican sources.</LD>
<LD>   The sources said that Gregory, expected in Rome today on a
regularly scheduled visit, will meet next week with officials of the
five Vatican agencies directly concerned: the Congregations for the
Doctrine of the Faith, Bishops, Clergy, Institutions of Religious
Life and Legislative Texts.</LD>
<LD>   The sources said that although Vatican officials support prompt
action against priests who commit sexual offenses, they also want to
ensure that accused clergy are guaranteed their fundamental rights
under both U.S. and church law to the presumption of innocence until
proved guilty and due process of law.</LD>
<TE>   It appears, however, that the officials are increasingly inclined
to grant the bishops' plan a two-year trial period. The Vatican is
reluctant to take any action that might undermine the bishops'
credibility at a time when they are under attack for failing to crack
down on abusive priests.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican presumably would monitor the situation for two years
and perhaps suggest modifications before deciding whether to give the
policy "recognito," or final approval.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bishops' new rules, dioceses would be required to remove
accused priests from their ministries and, in some cases, from the
priesthood. Canon lawyers have questioned whether this might violate
the clerics' rights.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 priests have been suspended since the scandals erupted
in January with the case of a cleric in the Boston Archdiocese who
was transferred instead of disciplined and continued to offend in
each new parish. Several of the suspended priests have asked the
Vatican to reinstate them.</TE>
<TE>   In an article in the Oct. 7 issue of the Jesuit weekly America,
Father John P. Beal, associate professor of canon law at Catholic
University of America in Washington, warned that the definition of
sexual abuse in the rules is "exceedingly broad and vague."</TE>
<TE>   Beal also criticized the process under which a bishop suspends a
priest when an accusation against him is found to be "credible" and
leaves it to the accused priest to prove himself innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Lay review boards, which play an increasingly important role in
the process, are giving more weight to their responsibility to
protect children than to their duty to "priests about whose guilt
there is reasonable doubt," Beal wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "After decades of dismissing or discounting complaints of sexual
abuse against priests, authorities, both secular and ecclesiastical,
are now inclined to give implicit credence to accusations against
priests and to dismiss their denials rather summarily," he said.</TE>

<LD>Troy Glaus continued to give us his best Mike Schmidt impersonation,
hitting the game-winning homer off J.C. Romero in the bottom of the
eighth inning. It was his fourth solo homer of the postseason. It
also was the first run given up by the Twin bullpen in 5 2/3 innings
in the series.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   The Angels had a chance to break the game open in the second
inning after Garret Anderson led off with a homer. With one out,
Scott Spiezio walked and Shawn Wooten singled, sending Spiezio to
third. But Eric Milton got off the hook when Bengie Molina popped to
first and Benji Gil struck out.</LD>

<LD>The Angels are having the time of their lives. They've even started
to show it.</LD>
<LD>   The men of summer became the boys of autumn Friday at Edison
Field, sharing childlike glee for all the world to see. There was
Troy Glaus, hitting the game-winning home run in the eighth inning
and pumping his fist not once, not twice, but three times while
rounding first base. There was Troy Percival, the closer, thrusting
both arms high into the sky, as if signaling a touchdown. There was
Garret Anderson, the left fielder, falling to the ground after making
a splendid catch for the final out, then scrambling to his feet,
showing off the widest smile you've ever seen and sprinting toward
center fielder Darin Erstad in celebration.</LD>
<LD>   These Angels, so doggedly even-tempered so long this season,
couldn't help smiling Friday, not after a dramatic 2-1 victory over
the Minnesota Twins in the American League championship series. The
Angels lead the series two games to one, and they're two victories
away from becoming the first American League wild-card team to
advance to the World Series.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the time to enjoy it," Erstad said. "Who knows if you
ever get a chance to play in the postseason again? This is the time
when it's exciting, and we need to enjoy it."</TE>
<TE>   Said right fielder Tim Salmon: "When guys show that much emotion
on the field, you know it's pure. And it's awesome."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won, uncharacteristically, with pitching and power. On
a night when the clutch hitting was nonexistent and the defense was
poor, the Angels won with solo home runs from Anderson and Glaus and
with their three best pitchers combining on a six-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn, their ace, carried a shutout into the seventh
inning, walking none and striking out seven. Francisco Rodriguez,
their phenom, pitched a perfect eighth, striking out two.</TE>
<TE>   Of the Angels' five postseason victories, Rodriguez has received
credit for three, and deservedly so. He has gotten 25 outs, 13 by
strikeout, and held opponents to a .107 batting average.</TE>
<TE>   Percival, their closer, worked a perfect but hardly easy ninth
inning. Before the inning, Angel Manager Mike Scioscia inserted Alex
Ochoa as a defensive replacement for Salmon, who started despite a
sore right hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   The first out was a line drive hit by Doug Mientkiewicz into
right-center, a ball Salmon could not have caught. Ochoa sprinted,
then dived, making a terrific catch.</TE>
<TE>   The second out was a fly ball to Ochoa. The final out, a looper
hit by A.J. Pierzynski into short left field, was snared by Anderson,
with a splendid run and a shoestring catch.</TE>
<TE>   "I just about did a cartwheel out there," Erstad said. "I'm glad
he caught it, because I wasn't really backing up. I was cheering for
him."</TE>
<TE>   Angel coach Joe Maddon calls Anderson "the definition of
even-keeled." But there he was, not only participating in a
celebration but initiating one.</TE>
<TE>   As a lifelong Angel, Anderson was a playoff novice. In search of
advice, he called two old friends and teammates--Chili Davis, who
left Anaheim to play with the Twins in the World Series, and Jim
Edmonds, who left Anaheim and reached October with the St. Louis
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   The advice from each was the same: Play hard, and have fun. Next
thing he knew, he was the one jumping around and smiling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the emotion of the postseason," Anderson said. "It's a fun
time of year."</TE>
<TE>   There wasn't much fun about the first six innings, when the Angel
defense nearly sabotaged Washburn with two errors and a botched
rundown. There wasn't much fun about the seventh, either.</TE>
<TE>   In the top of the inning, the Twins tied the score, 1-1, on a
two-out double by Jacque Jones. In the bottom of the inning, the
Angels had runners on second and third with one out but pinch-runner
Chone Figgins was thrown out at home plate, trying to score on a
ground ball. In six at-bats with runners in scoring position Friday,
the Angels were hitless.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins used four relievers to escape the seventh inning,
leaving closer Eddie Guardado and long man Kyle Lohse as the only
available relievers. With left-hander J.C. Romero left in to face the
right-handed Glaus, the Angels' rejuvenated slugger hit the
game-winning home run.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus, who led the league with 47 home runs two years ago and hit
41 last year, hit only 30 this year. In 26 postseason at-bats, he has
four home runs, two more than he hit in July.</TE>
<TE>   His triple fist-pump as he rounded first base, he said, was
"spur-of-the-moment emotion," prompted by the knowledge that he had
given Percival a lead to protect.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels reminded everyone who would listen that the series is
not over, that the Twins came back from a two-games-to-one deficit in
the division series and certainly could do so again. And the Angels
have an absolutely miserable track record against tonight's Twin
starter, Brad Radke.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no momentum in this series until you clinch," Scioscia
said.</TE>
<TE>   But, as the Angels headed home late Friday, the image that stuck
in their heads was that of Anderson, their perpetually stoic left
fielder, grinning and bubbling over with happiness on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never seen him quite like that," infielder Benji Gil said.
"Hopefully, we'll see that reaction on his face another six times
this year."</TE>

<LD>Andy Rooney, the 83-year-old "60 Minutes" commentator, appeared
recently on MSG Network's "Boomer Esiason Show" and caused a stir
with this comment relating to "Monday Night Football": "The only
thing that bugs me about television's coverage is those damn women
they have down on the sidelines who don't know what the hell they're
talking about.</LD>
<LD>   "I mean, I'm not a sexist person, but a woman has no business
being down on the sidelines trying to make a comment about a football
game."</LD>
<LD>   Comment from Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News: "If Rooney
was specifically pointing to 'MNF' sideline reporter Melissa
Stark--and it sure sounds as if he was--he's being even loopier than
usual."</LD>
<TE>   Stark has been called the "consummate pro" by John Madden.</TE>
<TE>   More Rooney: Jon Saraceno of USA Today, on what Rooney really
meant to say:</TE>
<TE>   * "Why aren't the Giants starting Y.A. Tittle?"</TE>
<TE>   * "When did they stop using leather helmets?"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which school leads the nation in bowl victories?</TE>
<TE>   Spooky place: On Fox's "The Last Word With Jim Rome," Minnesota
Twin first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz said of the noise inside the
Metrodome: "That's the first time in my life that I realized sound
had feel."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, he said, "In '99 we could hear a guy buying a
hot dog in the upper deck."</TE>
<TE>   Reason enough: What keeps Penn State football Coach Joe Paterno
going at age 75?</TE>
<TE>   Son Jay, the Nittany Lions' quarterbacks coach, told the New York
Times, "He's got 11 grandchildren, all under the age of 8. I think
he's scared to death being home with all of them at one time."</TE>
<TE>   Vicious: George Easterbook of ESPN.com: "The curly horns on St.
Louis helmets should be replaced with a curlicue letter Q--for
Quitters.... St. Louis played with no heart [against the 49ers] and,
trailing in the fourth quarter, lackadaisically strolled up to the
line on offense making no attempt whatever to hurry up for scores."</TE>
<TE>   Seventy-nine years later: Steve Kroner of the San Francisco
Chronicle points out that if California beats USC today at the
Coliseum, the Bears will accomplish something they haven't done since
1923, when they had a four-game road winning streak over the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that was Cal's "Wonder Team" that was in the midst of
an overall five-year unbeaten stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Two more wins: San Francisco Chronicle columnist Ray Ratto, on why
"most longtime Giants fans know this is the absolute worst time to be
a Giants fan.</TE>
<TE>   "They will remind anyone who asks about the '85 Dodgers and Blue
Jays, who won the first two games of their respective playoff series
with the Cardinals and Royals at home but still crashed and burned."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Alabama, with a 29-19-3 record. Runner-up is USC,
25-15-0.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Tim Tucker in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: "So,
for the 11th time in 12 years, the team with the best regular-season
record will not win the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "The Giants were the, count 'em, ninth different franchise to
eliminate the Braves since '91."</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Jaric Still Has a Reason to Smile</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marko Jaric was featured in a fashion layout in the Italian edition
of GQ magazine when he played for Kinder Bologna. He was set to flash
his megawatt smile during his Clipper debut Friday at Staples Center.
Then he lost a tooth the other night in Portland and decided he would
stick to what he called a "small smile." No teeth.</LD>
<LD>   Jaric's strained groin improved sufficiently to let him play
against the Seattle SuperSonics, and there was no way he was going to
let dental surgery keep him on the bench for the Clippers' third
exhibition game.</LD>
<LD>   It turned out that he cracked a tooth on a tough piece of popcorn
and had to have it removed. "Such big pain," he said of his extracted
tooth.</LD>
<TE>   Asked about the groin injury that sidelined him for the Clippers'
victory Tuesday over the Lakers at Bakersfield and their loss
Thursday against the Trail Blazers at Portland, Jaric said it was
much improved.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my first NBA game," said Jaric, the Clippers'
second-round pick in the 2000 draft, who was signed to a three-season
contract during the off-season. "I need to prepare for the start of
the season. I need to get the experience of these preseason games."</TE>
<TE>   Jaric is the first of the Clippers' corps of injured players to
return to action. Coach Alvin Gentry said he wasn't expecting much
from his backup point guard, unwilling to judge his play too harshly
one way or the other.</TE>
<TE>   "If he plays great, I'm not going to get excited about it," Gentry
said. "If he plays awful, I'm not going to get excited about it. I
just know he's going to be a good player.... I have no doubt about
that.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody who works that hard and has talent is going to fail in the
NBA. I haven't seen it happen in my 15 years in the NBA."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jaric had seven points and nine assists in 37 minutes, but had a
tough defensive assignment late in a game that went to double
overtime before the Clippers pulled out a 119-116 victory before
11,966 at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers let a 22-point lead slip away, largely because
Seattle's Gary Payton torched Jaric and all comers for 40 points in
46 minutes. Payton had all 10 of the SuperSonics' points in the first
overtime, making all five of his shots.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Batiste, a free agent with little chance of making the team
when training camp began, scored 33 points in 39 minutes to lead the
Clippers (2-1 in exhibition play). Eric Piatkowski had 19 points,
making eight of 11 shots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry said he expects rookie Chris Wilcox, one of two Clipper
first-round picks, to be ready to play Sunday against the Memphis
Grizzlies at Staples Center. Wilcox has been nursing a strained right
quadriceps.</TE>
<TE>   Keyon Dooling, who has had a badly sprained right ankle since last
Nov. 14, could be fit to play in the next eight to 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson, who suffered a sprained right knee at training
camp, probably will be sidelined for another two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Melvin Ely, who has tendinitis in his left big toe, isn't
expected to play for a least two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry had 11 fit players Friday against Seattle. He had only 10
in Thursday's 99-75 loss to the Trail Blazers.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Are Put in Place</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Guerin's two goals and two assists lead Stars to
4-2 victory as Anaheim struggles one day after season-opening win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Everyone knew this was going to take the Mighty Ducks a little
time--OK a lot of time--to rise from the depths.</LD>
<LD>   The Dallas Stars, on the other hand, seem to have been rebuilt in
a moment. Bill Guerin's signature wasn't dry on the contract and the
Stars were back among the NHL elite.</LD>
<LD>   That was clear Friday, as Guerin's two goals and two assists gave
the Stars a 4-2 victory Friday in front of 18,532 at the American
Airlines Center.</LD>
<TE>   The Ducks worked hard, especially late, and got an unlucky bounce.</TE>
<TE>   The Stars worked harder, from the start, and received a kind
bounce.</TE>
<TE>   Guerin outworked everyone and bounced bodies. He had a Gordie Howe
hat trick--a goal, an assist and a fight--in the second period alone.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy is the total package," Duck forward Matt Cullen said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were coming off a season-opening victory over St. Louis
on Thursday, but could only admire Guerin and the Stars' handiwork.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that was part of the problem, their coach said.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked to me at the start we were in awe and way too
respectful at the start of the game," Mike Babcock said. "When you
show that much respect for the opposition, you don't show any respect
for yourself.</TE>
<TE>   "Our power play had one goal tonight and we had layups for empty
nets. They came through our neutral zone forecheck like we weren't
there. Is that because we're in awe? Is that because it's early and
we played last night?"</TE>
<TE>   Or is it because the Ducks were playing a team that is
significantly improved?</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Stars missed the playoffs for the first time
since 1995-96. Like the Ducks, they needed to change. The difference
was, the Stars were already higher on the NHL food chain.</TE>
<TE>   They signed Guerin, brought in King assistant Dave Tippett as head
coach and did some nips and tucks. The team that obstructed its way
to the Stanley Cup championship in 1998-99 was a threat offensively.</TE>
<TE>   Goalie Ed Belfour packed and hauled his baggage to Toronto,
clearing the way for understudy Marty Turco, who stopped 24 of 26
shots and had Star fans chanting his name Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "That's as good a Dallas team as I've seen," Cullen said.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas led, 1-0, midway through the second period, when Guerin
took a cross-ice pass from Mike Modano and ripped a shot between the
legs of goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere, who was pulled after two
periods in favor of rookie Martin Gerber.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the period, Guerin burst into the Duck zone and fired a
shot that hit the side of the net and somehow bounced in front of the
net. Modano knocked home the strange ricochet for a 3-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   When the puck was dropped on the ensuing faceoff, Guerin and Kevin
Sawyer tangled. Guerin, who assisted on Sergei Zubov's first-period
goal, had an empty-net goal to clinch things.</TE>
<TE>   "The cream always rises," said Stars' owner Tom Hicks, whose
free-agent dealings with his Texas Rangers in baseball haven't worked
out as well.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were left to bemoan chances that got away.</TE>
<TE>   With the game scoreless in the first period, Adam Oates seemed to
have a sure goal on a power play.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Rucchin's pass left Oates with the whole right side of the
net open. But Turco dived frantically to smother the shot.</TE>
<TE>   On a second-period power play, Paul Kariya whipped a shot from the
slot only to hit the post.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were one for five on the power play.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd bet good money on Paul with a shot like that," Oates said.
"It's hard not to get frustrated. You create chances like that, you
like to think you're going to get one."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks came on late, getting Rucchin's goal and another by
Cullen.</TE>
<TE>   "You got to play when the game is on the line," Babcock said. "It
was out there at the start. We had our chances. We didn't execute."</TE>

<HD>Enforcer Brown Added to Roster</HD>

<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks got tougher Friday, claiming Vancouver's Mike Brown
off waivers. To make room, they designated center Jason Krog for
assignment.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, 23, was a first-round draft pick of the Florida Panthers in
1997. He was traded to Vancouver in a six-player deal that sent Pavel
Bure to the Panthers in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   "He hasn't done everything we thought he would," said Duck General
Manager Bryan Murray, who was the Panthers' general manager at the
time. "We think he has the potential to be a regular player.
Obviously, he's behind schedule. He hasn't always shown the
commitment to get there. I think now he really wants to be a player.
He just got married. All those things help."</LD>
<TE>   Brown, who is 6 feet 4, 225 pounds, will support the Ducks' Kevin
Sawyer in the enforcer role. Brown had 72 penalty minutes in 15 games
with Vancouver last season.</TE>
<TE>   Krog, who had an impressive training camp, will be sent to minor
league Cincinnati, but he must clear waivers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left wing Stanislav Chistov had the most impressive NHL debut in
25 years with a goal and three assists in the Ducks' 4-3 victory over
St. Louis on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Al Hill set the NHL record when he scored five points in his first
game for Philadelphia on Feb. 14, 1977.</TE>
<TE>   "[Chistov] was the best player I had seen in the draft in 10
years," NHL scout Jack Ferreira said. "What I like about him is his
ability to make something out of nothing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former goalie Guy Hebert will return to the Ducks as director of
the newly formed alumni association.... A group of 12 players from
the Ducks' first season (1993-94), including Hebert, Stu Grimson and
Todd Ewen, will be honored before the Ducks' home opener against
Detroit on Sunday and will sign autographs between periods. The
ceremony is scheduled for 5:45 p.m.</TE>

<KH>KING REPORT</KH>
<HD>Red Wings' Lineup Adds Young Players</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After watching Detroit rip San Jose to open the season Thursday, King
Coach Andy Murray said the Red Wings still look the same even though
the defending Stanley Cup champions have a new coach and some new
faces in the lineup.</LD>
<LD>   "The only thing I noticed is that they now have some real good
young players too," said Murray, whose Kings play the Red Wings
tonight at Staples Center. "They have filled some key spots with
players with good quickness. They are doing things a little
differently with some subtle changes, but for the most part they are
still [the Red Wings]."</LD>
<LD>   Longtime Detroit assistant Dave Lewis, who took over as head coach
after Scotty Bowman retired, will send out a lineup tonight that
features a mix of experience and youth. Such veterans as Sergei
Fedorov, Brendan Shanahan and Tomas Holmstrom are being teamed with
rookies Henrik Zetterberg and Jason Williams.</LD>
<TE>   But the biggest change for the Red Wings is in goal, where Curtis
Joseph has replaced the retired Dominik Hasek. Joseph, who signed as
a free agent from Toronto during the off-season, was solid against
San Jose with 23 saves.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to tell our guys anything because they know them
pretty well," Murray said. "Except for one game last season at
Detroit, all of the games between us since I've been here have been
battles."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Murray said rookie Alexander Frolov played well in the Kings' 4-1
victory over Phoenix on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was really solid for his first game," Murray said.
"The only thing that he may have done wrong was stay on the ice a
little too long for a couple of shifts."</TE>
<TE>   The ideal shift for the Kings lasts 40 seconds, and one time
against the Coyotes Frolov was on the ice for nearly two minutes. A
mistake Murray let him know about by sitting him down for a couple of
shifts.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a smart kid and a quick learner," Murray said. "I think he
understood what he did wrong after I talked to him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Jaroslav Modry, who will team again with Lubomir
Visnovsky tonight, was all over the ice against Phoenix. Murray and
some King players were still talking Friday about his open-ice
challenge of the Coyotes' Tony Amonte, one of the fastest skaters in
the league.</TE>

<HD>Cuban Speaks Up in Defense of the Whiners</HD>

<DL>LITTLE ROCK, Ark.</DL>
<LD>Someone has to speak for the "whiners and complainers" of the NBA,
loosely defined in Laker circles as anyone who disagrees with Phil
Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson this week dismissed as such those coaches trying to
regulate Shaquille O'Neal's occasional habit of stumbling into the
lane as part of his free-throw mechanics. The topic arose during
recent coaches' meetings in Chicago, and although those who were
there remember it as being as much about Anthony Mason as O'Neal,
Jackson came away disgusted at another so-called "Shaq rule."</LD>
<LD>   Not unpredictably, Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban was first to
defend the letter of the rule and to challenge Jackson's view of it.</LD>
<TE>   "There's nothing worse than someone who thinks the rules should be
different for them," Cuban said. "This is a game where it's at its
best when everyone plays by the same rules and the best players stand
out. When people complain that they can't get special treatment, it's
usually because they need it."</TE>
<TE>   That being said, Cuban said, "Shaq should be on his hands and
knees, thanking me. No one else seemed to want to stand up ... about
his stepping over the free-throw line. I did. He knew he was wrong
and fixed it. That's what great players do. If no one had spoken up,
he would have gone down in history as the big guy with three rings
that wasn't strong enough to get a free throw to the basket without
stepping on the line."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal grinned.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," he said, agreeably. "Tell Mark I said, 'Thank you very
much.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, O'Neal ventured a guess when he'll return to
the floor. He said he doubted his surgically repaired toe would be
healed enough to play by Oct. 29, opening night, but figured to play
"within a couple weeks" of that.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal could be cleared to begin light running next week.</TE>
<TE>   "The true test will be when I start banging and jumping," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels pretty good, though."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who sat out Friday's 95-87 victory over the Memphis
Grizzlies, isn't talking about retiring when Jackson does anymore.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, he often said he would leave basketball when Jackson,
who has two years remaining on his contract, left the Lakers. Friday,
he said he might play five years beyond his current contract, which
has three years on it, and that he's committed to at least two more
championships.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to be on the same [level] as Magic and Kareem,"
O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal also took the opportunity to lobby for 7-foot center
Soumailia Samake, in camp on a make-good contract. O'Neal said he
would like the Lakers to sign a backup center with the size and
strength to spell him for 10 minutes or so a game, and apparently he
doesn't see that guy among the 12 guaranteed contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "It will put some years on my career if I have a guy like [Samake]
backing me up," he said. "I have proven when I get rest ... I'm
better."</TE>
<TE>   Samake, who played in Italy last year, had 10 points and 13
rebounds in 26 minutes Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark Madsen's strained left hamstring is severe enough that he
could miss the rest of the exhibition season, Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Madsen landed awkwardly trying to break up a pass in Thursday's
practice, and Friday he walked with a heavy limp.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant had 18 points against the Grizzlies and Derek Fisher,
in his return to his native Little Rock, scored 13.... Jerry West
watched the game from a seat behind the scorer's table. Before the
game, he bumped into O'Neal. "You look cool," West told him. "But you
always look cool." ... Rick Fox, who has a sore lower back, did not
play and probably won't play tonight against the Denver Nuggets in
Oklahoma City.</TE>

<TE>   It is impossible to pick the most valuable of this year's Angels,
since throughout the season and now in the playoffs, several players
have regularly stepped up to provide the game-winning hit or pitching
performance. This, students, is a prime example of what is termed
"playing as a team," something rare in this era of overpaid, pampered
and ego-driven athletes. Whether the Angels win or even reach the
World Series, 2002 will forever mark the end of the Dodgers'
dominance of Southern California baseball fans. Hey, it's about time
Disney beat Murdoch at something!</TE>
<TE>   Sid Skolnik</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OK, I admit it. As a Dodger fan I watch the Angels with shameless
envy. Not because they're in postseason play and the Dodgers aren't,
but because the Angels' offense does everything Dodger offenses
haven't done for years.</TE>
<TE>   Every player in Anaheim's lineup and on the bench understands the
importance of a quality at-bat. Angel batters are patient at the
plate, work long counts, move runners over, hit the ball where it's
pitched, consistently lay down sacrifice bunts, don't overswing ...
the list goes on and on.</TE>
<TE>   Attention Bob Daly and Dan Evans: Angel postseason baseball should
be mandatory viewing for Jim Tracy, the Dodger coaching staff, and
the entire player roster. Either the Dodgers learn to handle their
bats, or I learn to become an Angel fan.</TE>

<TE>   Like most Dodger fans, we didn't want the Giants to beat Atlanta
and win the series. But how great was it to see Gary "Don't
disrespect me" Sheffield strike out in the bottom of the ninth in the
deciding game and the Braves' season on the line? Didn't they get him
for this exact situation? The "franchise" player Sheffield batted a
whopping .063 for the series by going one for 16 and was a
non-factor.</TE>
<TE>   I think I actually like Barry Bonds more than Gary Sheffield, and
that's saying a lot. But of course, I'm an Angel fan now.</TE>

<TE>   I know how much L.A. hates the San Francisco Giants, but the lack
of NLCS coverage in the Oct. 10 sports page is just unbelievable. You
didn't even mention that the Giants broke the record for consecutive
hits with six in the second inning in Game 1.</TE>

so successful?</TE>

<TE>   Just when you think things can't get any more stupid in Major
League Baseball, they do. The ALCS and the NLCS playing their
nationally televised games at the same time Wednesday. What is this?</TE>
<TE>   I watched baseball all year long, despite my disgust over the
commissioner's attempts to eliminate two teams, including one that is
three games away from the World Series, and might win it; despite my
disgust over billionaire owners and multi-millionaire players pushing
the sport to the brink of a strike, making us live under that cloud
of possibility all summer; despite my absolute disgust at the first
All-Star game where the commissioner stopped the game before it
finished, for reasons that seriously strained the legitimacy of
competition.</TE>
<TE>   And now I have to decide which of the two playoff games to watch?</TE>
<TE>   Why is not one game an afternoon game, as in previous years? Fox,
Bud Selig and Major League Baseball seem to be interested only in
pushing the fan to the brink of forgetting about baseball.</TE>

<TE>   With the demise of the Braves, we finally have gotten rid of the
sophomoric, inane and annoying tomahawk-chops chant. Now, if we could
only be rid of the sophomoric, inane and annoying baseball coverage
by Fox.</TE>
<TE>   There is a baseball game in there somewhere buried under the
screen-hogging graphics, intrusive music and sound effects, endless
promotions (Kiefer Sutherland, anyone?), and the uninformative
blather of Tim McCarver and Steve Lyons.</TE>
<TE>   Please, Fox, let me watch the ballgame!</TE>

<TE>   My brother and I were arguing the other day over who is the worst
television sports color analyst. I said it is Joe Morgan, someone who
cannot resist the urge to say anything about anything without first
considering what he is about to say. My brother says it's Tim
McCarver, who cannot resist the urge to say something about
everything to propose that he knows more about baseball than anyone
... ever. (He doesn't.)</TE>
<TE>   I said Morgan repeats everything he says at least once. My brother
said he learned that from McCarver. (Just listen, he said. I can
confirm he's right.)</TE>
<TE>   I said Morgan brings a joyless and inane dissection of the
ordinariness of the events in a game, expecting to educate viewers
who have actually seen these things before. My brother says that
McCarver pontificates endlessly on the play on the field as though
his palaver is required by viewers to know what is going on, sucking
all the fun out of the game.</TE>
<TE>   My brother and I weighed each other's comments and decided to put
it to a vote. It was unanimous, two to zero. The worst television
sports color analyst: John Madden.</TE>

<LD>T.J., glad to hear you left the King game early. As a longtime
season-ticket holder, I hate seeing nonfans at the game when loyal
fans could be in those seats. How sad is it that any sportswriter
would leave an event early. Do us all a favor and leave the Kings out
of everything you say or write. Let your editor assign Lonnie, Helene
or Jerry to future King games.</LD>
<LD>   And who cares about your personal dislike of Phil, Tim and the
AEG!? Their millions of investment money have brought great
entertainment to the L.A. market. I thank them every chance I get!</LD>
<LD>   Next time your editor assigns you to a hockey game, just cover it
from home and watch boringball, I mean baseball, instead. Nothing
greedy about that sport.</LD>

<TE>   You know, T.J., as a citizen of the U.S. and a member of the
media, you are certainly entitled to your opinions, even if they are
wrong. But I think it was pretty classless for you to write a column
criticizing the greatest hockey player to ever live, not to mention
one of the most gracious, humble, and classiest athletes in
existence, on the one occasion we have in Southern California to
finally honor Wayne Gretzky for the incredible talent and the human
being that he is.</TE>
<TE>   I happen to love the Angels too, but my choice was to be at
Staples Center on Wednesday night for a once-in-a-lifetime event for
a once-in-a-history athlete.</TE>

<TE>   Let's set the record straight.... Do we really believe that Ryan
Killeen's missed extra-point attempt and two missed field-goal
attempts lost the game against Washington State. Well, quite frankly,
yes! And please, don't get me started on the absolutely pathetic
running game. In any case, I lay the blame right at the feet of
Carson Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   Say what you might about his potential (translation: he stinks
right now), two inexcusable plays really cost the Trojans the game
last Saturday. How do you throw a lollipop pass into the end zone for
an interception and how can you take a sack in overtime and then say,
"I should have thrown it away?" You think?</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans' season is now officially over. No national
championship game. No Rose Bowl. With Palmer leading the worst-ranked
offense in the Pac-10, it's time to work on next season.</TE>

honestly [Oct. 10]. Well, that's funny. Because if you look at who
the Hokies have played, you'll notice that not only have they not
played a team in the top 25, they haven't played a team that has
played a team in the top 25. And they won't play a team in the top 25
until the last game of the season. Most of the teams they play
couldn't win one game in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't belong in the championship game then, and they don't
belong in the championship game now. A computer might not be able to
figure that out. But a 12-year-old paying attention to detail could.</TE>

<LD>The way that Billy Hunter, the NBA's union director, has sprung to
Latrell Sprewell's defense suggests that there is really only one
difference between those various schmoes who head up players' unions
and criminal defense lawyers: The latter occasionally represent
innocent clients.</LD>

<TE>   Another Clipper season is about to start, and once again, Donald
Sterling hasn't been good to his word. He refuses to put his money
where his mouth is. He has done nothing to keep this team together
and build toward the bright future the talent level would suggest is
possible. Fans should enjoy the Clippers now, but if history is any
indicator, many of these players will be gone next year.</TE>
<TE>   Time has proven that winning and losing on the court means little
to Sterling. He doesn't care that he's a laughingstock in NBA
circles. He's a real estate man and in real estate circles, the
Clippers are a huge winner.</TE>
<TE>   Well, at least we have this year. Hopefully, the players will work
hard and unselfishly, even though their future here is unlikely, and
even though they work for the worst owner in professional sports.</TE>

<LD>Sacramento King point guard Mike Bibby was scheduled to have surgery
on his right foot today for a fracture he sustained during practice
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   No time frame was given for Bibby's return, but Geoff Petrie,
Sacramento's president of basketball operations, said in a statement
Friday that the surgery would be a minor delay in Bibby's season.</LD>

<TE>   Point guard Raul Lopez probably will sit out all of his first NBA
season because of a torn knee ligament, but the Utah Jazz hope he
will eventually replace John Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez had surgery nearly two weeks ago on his right knee. He first
injured the knee in 2001--after being drafted by the Jazz--and
reinjured it in an exhibition with Spain's national team in August.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stephon Marbury of the Phoenix Suns will play with a sore ankle
this season unless the pain becomes too much to bear. Marbury
underwent surgical procedures on both ankles during the summer, but
pain caused by bone spurs in his left ankle has persisted.</TE>

<TE>   Indiana Pacer forward Ron Artest will be sidelined for two weeks
while waiting for a dislocated finger on his shooting hand to heal.
Artest had surgery Sept. 5 and participated in the Pacers' training
camp last week.... The Philadelphia 76ers waived guard William Avery
and center Alvin Jones.</TE>

<LD>Amazing story out of Minneapolis, and it has nothing to do with the
Twins.</LD>
<LD>   The Vikings, 0-4 in their worst season since 1967, planned a
"garage sale" last Saturday at team headquarters. They invited the
public to come and pick through used exercise equipment, office
furniture, books, jerseys, helmets, anything and everything. The
proceeds would go not to charity but to owner Red McCombs, who made a
fortune in Texas as a car salesman and now is aggressively trying to
sell his football team.</LD>
<LD>   It gets weirder.</LD>
<TE>   The first sale didn't draw much of a crowd, so the club scheduled
another three days later, storing the stuff in the indoor practice
facility. The Vikings, coming off a bye week, tried to practice
outside Monday but the drizzly weather wouldn't allow it. So they
moved inside.</TE>
<TE>   And there they found that the south end zone of the facility was
cluttered with desks, cabinets, blocking sleds, and more than a dozen
old TVs. Everything had a price tag, even the six cases of Skin
Bracer after-shave--25 cents a bottle--which, amazingly, weren't
snapped up by sportswriters in the first go-round.</TE>
<TE>   At last check, the rest of the team wasn't up on EBay.</TE>
<TE>   An L.A. Update</TE>
<TE>   I mention the Vikings because that's the team that's moving to Los
Angeles. Or, wait, it's the Colts. No, Chargers. Hold on, what week
is this?</TE>
<TE>   An Indianapolis TV crew spent three days in L.A. this week,
talking to officials from the Coliseum and Rose Bowl, dropping by
sports bars to quiz patrons, essentially doing some early
house-hunting for those Colt employees who plan to move west with the
football team.</TE>
<TE>   Folks in Indianapolis are deeply concerned that they might lose
the Colts to L.A., and team owner Jim Irsay is doing very little to
disabuse them of that notion, beyond saying he plans to stay through
the 2003 season. There could be loopholes in the team's RCA Dome
lease that would allow the Colts to pull out before the first obvious
exit clause in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Then, there are the San Diego Chargers, who are more than ready to
get out of aging Qualcomm Stadium and are quietly hoping this
season's Super Bowl exposes the place as a dump. They are moving
their training camp from La Jolla to Carson next summer and still
have the inside track on moving to the nation's No. 2 TV market,
according to NFL owners with whom I've spoken.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in L.A., all this jostling is met with a collective
yawn.</TE>
<TE>   This city has been without an NFL franchise since the Raiders and
Rams moved after the 1994 season, and there's no indication that will
change soon.</TE>
<TE>   There is, after all, no place for a team to play. NFL owners and
executives have said they don't want to return to the Coliseum, and
any renovation of that venue would require G-3 loan money and the
promise of multiple Super Bowls as a financing tool. In other words,
the NFL has to be on board.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl is in a similar bind, since the city of Pasadena has
no plans to pitch in any money toward renovating that stadium, an
endeavor that would cost about $400 million. The city isn't even
paying John Moag, the consultant who's trying to position that
stadium to land an NFL team. The Rose Bowl is facing a string of
hurdles that stretches into the distance--among them poor freeway
access, historical preservation issues, a neighborhood that might be
unreceptive to the number of major events such a renovation would
demand.</TE>
<TE>   In short, there's no stadium solution on the horizon, and no one's
stepping up with the money to change things.</TE>
<TE>   Well, there is one money-making mechanism that could rectify the
situation. It's a little extreme, but here goes.... Garage sale!</TE>
<TE>   Around the League</TE>
<TE>   AFC EAST--Good news and bad news in Buffalo. Good news: The Drew
Bledsoe-powered Bills are averaging 32.5 points, 406.4 yards and
327.4 yards passing a game. Bad news: They are on pace to give up 576
points, an NFL record. Oh, and Buffalo's is the only NFL defense
without an interception.... Why are the Patriots stumbling? It starts
with their run defense. In the last three games, they have been
shredded by Kansas City's Priest Holmes, 180 yards; San Diego's
LaDainian Tomlinson, 217, and Miami's Ricky Williams, 105.... The
Dolphins, who play at Denver on Sunday, have won 12 in a row against
AFC West opponents.... Two days after New York Jet safety Damien
Robinson pointed fingers all over the locker room, assigning blame
for the team's shortcomings on defense, he claimed he was misquoted
and taken out of context. But what about all those reporters who were
recording his words? Details, details.</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH--Hard to believe, but the Ravens are now sticking up for
the Browns. Specifically, Baltimore Coach Brian Billick defended
Cleveland quarterback Tim Couch, who was booed by his own fans last
Sunday in a home loss to the ex-Browns, a.k.a. Ravens. "When you go
into a stadium like that, obviously that emotion makes a difference,"
Billick said. "When the fans turn like that and start booing ...
you've got to know it's an emotional boost for this team. It never
ceases to amaze me that the great, passionate fans in Cleveland, if
they could stop and think about what they're doing, would they do
that?" ... With Kelly Holcomb out, the Browns have no choice but to
start Couch on Sunday against Tampa Bay. There's a picture of him on
Warren Sapp's official Web site, "QB Killa," and he's posted as the
next victim under a section called "Tha Hit List." ... Times sure
have changed in Pittsburgh, where no Bill Cowher-coached team has
surrendered 30 points four times in a season. It has already happened
three times this season.</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH--Jacksonville has won three consecutive games and
figures to roll over Tennessee on Sunday. That's especially good news
for the Jaguars, considering every team that won four in succession
last season made the playoffs.... Buffalo Coach Gregg Williams, a
longtime assistant coach with the Oilers, will be making his return
to Houston when the Bills play there Sunday. The last time he was in
Houston for an NFL game was the Oiler franchise finale in 1996, which
drew a crowd of 15,131 to the Astrodome. Sunday, his team will be
playing before a crowd of more than 69,000 at Reliant Stadium. Ten
years ago, the Oilers blew a 35-3 third-quarter lead and lost to
Buffalo, 41-38, in an AFC wild-card game. "I try to keep that game
out of my mind as much as possible," said Williams, who was the
Oilers' quality-control coordinator at the time. "But as you can
imagine, it's a big part of the tradition here. It wasn't until I'd
been on the sidelines as the Bills' coach two or three times that I
quit thinking about it."</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST--The Raiders are averaging a league-high 40.5 points a
game, but Jerry Rice isn't getting too comfortable. "You know what
the scary thing is? I don't think anybody is really satisfied with
what went down today," he told reporters after Oakland's 49-31
victory at Buffalo. "We won the game, but we could have been even
better. This offense is going to be something really special." The
Raiders are on pace to score 640 points, which would eclipse the NFL
record of 556 set by the 1998 Vikings.... How's this for a
high-altitude edge: The Broncos have won 15 of 17 at home.... Denver
defensive tackle Lional Dalton won a trip for two to Jamaica at
Shannon Sharpe's Halloween party last year. Or he thought he'd won.
"Considering it's been almost a year since the trip was supposed to
take place, there's a good possibility Lional might not be going on
this trip," Sharpe told the Denver Post. "If I was him, I wouldn't
get the suntan lotion just yet." What's the use of lotion? Sounds as
if Dalton has already been burned.</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST--Even in death, former Dallas receiver Bob Hayes brought
people together. Cowboy owner Jerry Jones used his private jet to
shuttle half a dozen former players and team executives to Hayes'
funeral in Florida last month. On board were former personnel chief
Gil Brandt, who was fired when Jones bought the team in 1989, and
receiver Drew Pearson, who had had a falling out with Jones over the
Ring of Honor, the team's honor society.... The Giants are the NFC's
worst team in the red zone, having scored four touchdowns in 13
chances (30.8%). The only teams worse? Houston (25%) and Cincinnati
(14.3%).... Philadelphia's offensive line has to do a better job of
protecting Donovan McNabb, who's on pace to be sacked 60 times this
season. Jacksonville dropped him five times last Sunday, and that's a
defensive front that had only four sacks in its first three games.
Still, McNabb has been good about not forcing throws under pressure.
He has thrown only one interception in his last 174 passes.</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH--Tough time to be a Bear. Chicago has lost at least one
starter to injury in each of its five games. Against Green Bay, the
Bears lost left guard Rex Tucker, out for the season because of a
dislocated ankle and broken leg, and receiver David Terrell, out
indefinitely with a fractured foot.... While New England's defense is
making running backs look superhuman, Chicago's is doing the same for
opposing quarterbacks. In consecutive losses to New Orleans with
Aaron Brooks, Buffalo with Bledsoe, and Green Bay with Brett Favre,
the Bears have given up 921 yards passing and 10 touchdowns. On deck
for the star treatment: Detroit's Joey Harrington on Oct. 20, with
Minnesota's Daunte Culpepper, Philadelphia's McNabb and New England's
Tom Brady awaiting their chances.... The No. 1-selling NFL jersey is
that of Chicago linebacker Brian Urlacher, but Harrington's is
rapidly climbing the charts. "Joey Heisman" is the No. 4 seller at
the moment, and, according to the Detroit News, 650 Harrington
jerseys were sold at the "Roar and More"--the apparel shop at Ford
Field--during the Lion-Saint game on Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH--In their four-game winning streak, the Buccaneers have
surrendered an average of 6.7 points. Tampa Bay's defense has scored
as many touchdowns, four, as it has given up.... Tampa Bay's Mike
Alstott wants to carry the ball more, but he's in the wrong offense
for that. Jon Gruden, it seems, doesn't believe in handing off to the
fullback. Gruden had a good one in Oakland's Jon Ritchie and the
Raiders almost never handed off to him. Ritchie had zero rushing
attempts in 2000 and 2001, despite having started 22 games over that
span.... Things are looking up for DeShaun Foster, the former UCLA
running back and Carolina's second pick. He has been out since
training camp because of arthroscopic knee surgery, but he's making
strides, particularly with his straight-ahead running. Don't expect
the Panthers to rush his return, though. Their next games are against
Dallas and Atlanta, both artificial-turf teams.</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST--Just imagine, the San Francisco 49ers spent so much time
fretting about beating the Rams, then the St. Louis game wound up
being one of this season's few gimme games. After playing Seattle on
Monday night, the 49ers' next six games are against New Orleans,
Arizona, Oakland, Kansas City, San Diego and Philadelphia. Combined
record of those teams: 21-8.... A glaring problem for St. Louis--and
there are many--is missed tackles. On the second play of the 49er
game, for instance, Garrison Hearst slipped through the grasp of
safety Adam Archuleta at the line of scrimmage and tore off a 41-yard
gain.... Arizona kicker Bill Gramatica blew out a knee celebrating a
first-quarter kick against the Giants last season, so he has been a
bit more reserved this season--even last Sunday when he made a
50-yard field goal with 16 seconds remaining to edge Carolina, 16-13.
That kick earned him a hug from Cardinal Coach Dave McGinnis,
although the good feelings didn't last long. Gramatica booted the
ensuing kickoff out of bounds. Talk about a mood swing. "I wanted to
kiss the kid and adopt him," McGinnis said. "Then, I wanted to
divorce him and behead him."</TE>
<TE>   The moral to that story: Don't get divorced in Phoenix.</TE>

<HD>Ravens' Lewis Sidelined by Dislocated Shoulder</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Linebacker Ray Lewis will not play when the Baltimore Ravens face the
Indianapolis Colts on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis, a five-time Pro Bowler, partially dislocated his shoulder
while trying to recover a loose ball during last Sunday's 26-21
victory over Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   He has not practiced all week and will break his string of 69
consecutive starts by missing the game. Lewis leads the Ravens with
69 tackles and has two interceptions and a forced fumble.</LD>
<TE>   "Ray's not gonna play, it's just not going to happen," Coach Brian
Billick said.</TE>
<TE>   The game will be the first Lewis has missed since a dislocated
elbow sidelined him for three games in the middle of the 1998 season.
Free agent Bernardo Harris, who has been inactive the last two weeks,
will replace Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Vick will be the emergency No. 3 quarterback for the
Atlanta Falcons on Sunday against the New York Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Falcon Coach Dan Reeves said he would use rookie Kurt Kittner as a
backup if Doug Johnson were to leave the game at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Vick sprained his right, non-throwing shoulder in last week's loss
to Tampa Bay. He tried to throw the football early in practice Friday
but felt too much pain to continue for more than five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta defensive end Patrick Kerney signed a new contract that
includes a team-record $8.5-million signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a winless team off to its worst start in nearly four decades,
St. Louis Ram running back Marshall Faulk apparently didn't care to
discuss it with broadcaster Bob Costas this week.</TE>
<TE>   During a Monday taping for this weekend's "Inside the NFL" on HBO,
Faulk abruptly ended an interview with Costas after being questioned
about the Rams' dismal start, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in
a story on its Web site Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk has not discussed the interview, though Costas said Faulk
appeared uncomfortable from its outset.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wish for Marshall's sake he had declined the interview,"
Costas said. "He's a bright guy, and I think it occurred to him that
as we got a few questions into it that if he answered with any candor
he would be in a no-win situation. So I think he decided to cut his
losses."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams continued their quarterback shuffle, tapping Marc Bulger
to make his first NFL regular-season start Sunday against the
undefeated Oakland Raiders. He will replace injured Jamie Martin.</TE>

31    MINNESOTA (0-4)      Already inexperienced Viking defense seems
                           to get younger by the week. (31)

<HD>Canadiens' Theodore Spoils Night for Rangers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jose Theodore did pretty much everything last season except beat the
New York Rangers.</LD>
<LD>   He took care of that in this year's season opener, stopping 20
shots in the Montreal Canadiens' 4-1 victory that spoiled the
Rangers' home opener Friday night at Madison Square Garden.</LD>
<LD>   Theodore was the league MVP, the Vezina Trophy winner and the
goalie who helped end the Canadiens' three-year playoff drought a
season ago. He was also the guy who went 0-4 against New York.</LD>
<TE>   "The first win is never easy to get, especially here in New York,"
said Theodore, who won 30 games against the rest of the NHL last
season. "Whatever happened last year, we just forget about it."</TE>
<TE>   Yanic Perreault had a goal and an assist during Montreal's
three-goal second period that turned around an early 1-0 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Oleg Petrov had two assists and Mariusz Czerkawski scored an
empty-net goal with 3.1 seconds left as the Canadiens beat the
Rangers for the first time since April 5, 2000, ending an 0-7-1
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 5, Nashville 4--Robert Lang poked home the winning goal
during a scramble on a five-on-three power play with 1:04 remaining
for the Capitals at Washington. Lang's goal capped a wild third
period that included five goals and three five-on-three power plays,
two of which were killed despite each lasting nearly a minute.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Bondra had two goals and an assist, including a goal that
bounced off goaltender Mike Dunham's back. Jaromir Jagr had one goal
and two assists for the Capitals.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 5, Atlanta 3--Joe Vasicek scored the go-ahead goal less
than two minutes into the third period as the Hurricanes twice
rallied from two-goal deficits to win at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta lost its season opener despite leading 2-0 and 3-1. The
Thrashers are 0-13-3 all-time against the defending Eastern
Conference champions.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Boston 1--Andrew Brunette had a goal and an assist
and Manny Fernandez stopped 26 shots to lead the Wild at St. Paul,
Minn. It was the first season-opening win for the third-year Wild.</TE>

<HD>Giants' Baker Tries to Play It Cool</HD>
<DH>National League: A city favorite, manager lacks vote of
confidence from his boss but downplays contract speculation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Dusty Baker returns home at the peak of his managerial career, his
San Francisco Giants poised just two victories from the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   His players love him.</LD>
<LD>   His opponents respect him.</LD>
<TE>   His city embraces him.</TE>
<TE>   And his bosses would like to kick him out the door.</TE>
<TE>   For what, you ask?</TE>
<TE>   The only one who can say is Peter Magowan, the Giants' managing
general partner, and he's not saying much.</TE>
<TE>   With Baker concluding a two-year, $5.3-million contract, all
Magowan has told reporters is that first, the future of General
Manager Brian Sabean will be determined, and then Sabean will
determine who the manager is.</TE>
<TE>   What, no vote of confidence for Baker? All his Giants have done
is:</TE>
<TE>   * hold off the Dodgers in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   * beat the Atlanta Braves in the best-of-five division series
after falling behind in games, 2-1. The Giants pulled it out by
winning back-to-back games on opposite ends of the country on
back-to-back nights.</TE>
<TE>   * take a 2-0 lead over the St. Louis Cardinals in the
best-of-seven National League championship series, which resumes this
afternoon at Pacific Bell Park. Against a Cardinal team that had won
21 of its last 25 regular-season games to wrap up the NL Central
championship and then swept the defending World Series champion
Arizona Diamondbacks in a division series, the Giants have won with
hitting in Game 1 and pitching and defense in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   Baker is pushing all the right buttons. In Game 2, he took out
shortstop Rich Aurilia, who had hit two home runs in the game, in a
double switch and was left with Aurilia's replacement, the
lighter-hitting Ramon Martinez, at the plate in the ninth inning with
a runner at third.</TE>
<TE>   No problem. Baker called for a rare squeeze play and it worked
perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources close to the team, Magowan is troubled by the
acclaim Baker has received and, until this year, questioned his
managerial ability.</TE>
<TE>   Although San Francisco has won at least 90 games in each of the
past three seasons, Baker's postseason record in his decade at the
Giants' helm has been disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   The team qualified for the postseason only twice and failed to get
past the first round on each occasion. The Florida Marlins swept
three consecutive from San Francisco in 1997, and the New York Mets
took three of four from the Giants in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Baker's situation Friday, Sabean would only say: "My
future is undecided. I'm not going to comment on Dusty's."</TE>
<TE>   And what does Baker himself say?</TE>
<TE>   "I have to practice what I preach to my own players," he said. "I
tell them, 'Don't worry about your contract. Go out and perform and
the contract will take care of itself.' If you keep it in that order,
it's no distraction.</TE>
<TE>   "I get tired of answering questions about it, questions that I
have no answers to because I have not been approached, and I have not
approached anybody else. There's a lot of speculation, people are
talking a lot, but regardless, the more we win, the better position
it puts me in personally."</TE>
<TE>   Considering the Giants' unexpected success, with a possible World
Series berth looming, Magowan may be forced to give in to public
pressure and rehire Baker, at considerably more money than he would
have been forced to shell out several months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Or Baker could tell Magowan what to do with his job and seek
another managerial opening.</TE>
<TE>   The 53-year-old Baker's calmness in the eye of this storm stems,
at least partially, from his experience in the off-season with a much
more threatening storm. He underwent successful surgery for prostate
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Before he knew how things were going to turn out, the usually
optimistic Baker had a down day while on a hunting trip up in Grass
Valley, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this hippie dude in this bar," said Baker, who noticed
the man was wearing a hat which read, "I Don't Give a [Bleep] Club."</TE>
<TE>   Baker was told there actually was such a club and that he could
get a membership card for only $3.</TE>
<TE>   Baker paid up, but, long before the card arrived, his positive
mood had returned.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just that one day that I didn't give a [bleep]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the surgery, Baker flew to Hawaii and prayed at a
mountaintop healing center.</TE>
<TE>   Then he told his family, "Yeah, I'm going to make it big time."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, Peter Magowan wasn't listening.</TE>

<HD>Angel Nostalgia Must Be Put on Hold for Finley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>He is a remaining link to the bitter Angel past. And he could find
himself in a position to make their future bitter as well.</LD>
<LD>   But none of that will be on Chuck Finley's mind today. He has far
more immediate concerns.</LD>
<LD>   Like keeping his current club in contention.</LD>
<TE>   Finley will be on the mound at Pacific Bell Park this afternoon
for the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 3 of their best-of-seven National
League championship series with the San Francisco Giants. Trailing
two games to none, with both losses coming at St. Louis, the
Cardinals know they must win today to have a realistic chance of
advancing to the World Series. No club in baseball history has come
back to win a seven-game series after losing the first three.</TE>
<TE>   "I recognize it is what it is," Finley said. "Obviously we would
like to have come out here with a split as opposed to where we are."</TE>
<TE>   Finley, 39, doesn't know where he'll be after this season, or if
he'll be pitching at all. As of early July, he didn't know he would
be in this spot with the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Finley spent 14 seasons with the Angels, beginning in 1985, and
then spent 2 1/2 seasons with the Cleveland Indians.</TE>
<TE>   By the All-Star break of this season, the Indians were going
nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I was going somewhere," Finley said. "[Cleveland General
Manager] Mark Shapiro told me he thought I was going to the
postseason. First call he gave me ... he told me I was going to the
Giants. I said, 'Fine.'</TE>
<TE>   "He called me back a couple of hours later and said, no, you're
going to the Reds. Called me back a few minutes later and told me I
was going to the Cardinals. Called me back a few minutes later and
said, 'I don't know where the hell you're going.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Finley was traded July 19 for minor leaguers Covelli
Crisp (an outfielder) and Luis Garcia (an infielder/outfielder).</TE>
<TE>   Finley went 7-4 for St. Louis with a 3.80 earned-run average to
give him a lifetime record of 193-169.</TE>
<TE>   Finley then started the second game of the division series and
blanked the Arizona Diamondbacks for 6 1/3 innings on four hits,
striking out seven and walking two, in a game St. Louis went on to
win.</TE>
<TE>   An Angel-Cardinal World Series would be a dream matchup for
Finley. But if he can't hold the Giants down today, the dream could
be over soon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another day went by Friday without St. Louis third baseman Scott
Rolen (sprained left shoulder) taking batting or fielding practice.</TE>
<TE>   Said Cardinal Manager Tony La Russa of Rolen, who was injured in
the division series, "Until you see him out there [practicing], he's
not close."</TE>

<LD>In the middle of a busy Orange County Friday night they appeared,
suddenly, swiftly, as surprising as snow.</LD>
<LD>   Eight tiny fist pumps.</LD>
<LD>   From Troy Glaus.</LD>
<TE>   "Never seen anything like it," said Scott Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, in the middle of home plate, something else
appeared, quickly, powerfully, as stunning as an empty freeway.</TE>
<TE>   A celebration punch.</TE>
<TE>   From Troy Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   "His fist hit my fist really hard," Spiezio said. "I thought, this
is different."</TE>
<TE>   Different and dramatic and right on time.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels are leaving their past, Troy Glaus is coming out of
his shell.</TE>
<TE>   The more he is confronted with big October moments, the harder the
aloof slugger embraces them, even if it means doing something
entirely unnatural, like smiling.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, it happened again, this time with a squeeze that turned
the fresh-faced Minnesota Twins pale.</TE>
<TE>   Eighth inning, none out, tie game, 3-and-1 count against a
pitcher, J.C. Romero, who had allowed only three home runs all
season.</TE>
<TE>   Make that four.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus flicked a fastball over the fence in right-center field to
make his fist move, fireworks blast and Mickey Hatcher dance. The
Angels needed nothing more in an eventual 2-1 win in Game 3 of the
American League championship series.</TE>
<TE>   After which, yeah, Glaus even smiled.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so it might have been a snuff-dripping-off-his-lower-lip
smile, but it was a smile nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, it's all right," Glaus said afterward. "It beats being at
home right now."</TE>
<TE>   In a world where the Glaus always seems half empty, that statement
qualifies as a bona fide "yahoo" and "yippee."</TE>
<TE>   "I think what's happening is, Troy has never done anything like
this before, and he really likes it," said Spiezio. "It's nice to
see."</TE>
<TE>   Especially since, this postseason, Angel fans usually have their
vision directed to somebody else.</TE>
<TE>   Flashier is Francisco Rodriguez. Spunkier is David Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone admires Mike Scioscia's calm and Troy Percival's
sentiment and Darin Erstad's grass stains.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, the two biggest hits of October have belonged to
Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   First, there was the tiebreaking home run in the eighth inning in
Game 2 of the division series in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Friday's shot, which was even bigger. By going to
right-center field, it went against every instinct in a player like
Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, one reason I loved it is because of where it went," said
batting coach Hatcher, who danced in the dugout like it was 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus, you see, is a right-handed power hitter. In those guys, the
urge to pull that power to left field is sometimes almost as strong
as the urge to eat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard, because growing up, most people tell you that home
runs are pulled," said Spiezio. "And most people are only strong
enough to pull them."</TE>
<TE>   But Glaus is different. Glaus is stronger. Glaus has the potential
power of a Barry Bonds or an Alex Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   It was always thought that Glaus, given the proper patience and
unselfishness, could be like those guys and hit those outside pitches
into right-field seats.</TE>
<TE>   This year, under constant harping by Hatcher, he finally has those
traits.</TE>
<TE>   In the last couple of days, he has hammered with those traits.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins have decided to pitch him away, and Glaus has made them
regret that decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The last couple of days, I'm just fortunate to get a couple of
pitches outside," Glaus said. "And put some good swings on them and
not pop them or do what I have done in the past."</TE>
<TE>   His two hits in Game 2 were to right field, including a
sixth-inning triple that Hatcher felt set the tone for Friday's
at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw him do that, I knew he was in the right frame of
mind," Hatcher said.</TE>
<TE>   Then when Glaus had a single to right field in the fourth inning
Friday, the stage was set.</TE>
<TE>   "The big man was going to be aggressive up there," Hatcher said.
"He was going to swing at what they gave him."</TE>
<TE>   And so he did, smashing an outside pitch that has given the Angels
a two-games-to-one lead and a tentative inside track to the World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels can defeat Minnesota ace Brad Radke today, this ALCS
is over.</TE>
<TE>   Just when Glaus is starting to enjoy it.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he's not into the press and the attention, he just likes
to play the game," Hatcher said with a grin. "But I really think he's
trying to learn all that baseball lingo so he can start talking more
to you guys."</TE>
<TE>   In a news conference late Friday, Glaus gave it his best shot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun playing in the postseason, it's fun doing that," he
said. "That's why we put all the time in ... to be playing now. I
think we're just all excited to be playing now and not worried so
much about everything else that's going on."</TE>
<TE>   He smiled, then stopped, then marched off the interview podium in
a rush to get to the elevator.</TE>
<TE>   Turning a corner, he ran smack into an Angel publicist.</TE>
<TE>   And promptly hugged her and smiled again.</TE>
<TE>   That makes three big postseason hits.</TE>

<HD>Still on the Hook</HD>
<DH>Brown, Simms haunted by Longhorns' big-game failures</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUSTIN, Texas</DL>
<LD>Texas Coach Mack Brown sat with legs crossed in his Texas-sized
office, the acreage best described as an ode to leather and
taxidermy.</LD>
<LD>   Brown appeared remarkably at ease, and you wondered why.</LD>
<LD>   In two days, he was going to have his hide parked on the sideline
at the Cotton Bowl, staring across the field at Oklahoma Coach Bob
Stoops, wondering if this is the year he is going to finally win the
big game.</LD>
<TE>   Never mind that Brown is 2-2 against Oklahoma since he arrived at
Texas. As he says of Longhorn fans, "They don't remember us beating
them the first two years."</TE>
<TE>   Brown used to worry about what people thought, mainly that he was
a fantastic recruiter who also had this side gig as a coach. If Brown
were on the PGA Tour, he would be tagged with that infamous label:
best golfer never to have won a major.</TE>
<TE>   "It bothered me, honestly," Brown said of the criticism. "I got
tired of it. Then, when people started comparing me to Phil Mickelson
and [Kansas basketball Coach] Roy Williams, I said, 'That's pretty
good.' "</TE>
<TE>   Brown has won nine or more games in each of his four seasons in
Austin, but his teams have faltered at critical times, losing the
last two years against Oklahoma in games with national title
implications.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has nearly restored Texas to greatness--the team finished
11-2 last year and was ranked fifth--but that only further fuels
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "The monster is back," Brown says, "and you have to feed it every
week."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in this Texas-Oklahoma week, senior quarterback Chris
Simms plopped down for an interview wearing a T-shirt, baggy jeans
and work boots.</TE>
<TE>   You couldn't tell if he was days removed from the defining game of
his career or about to go on spring break. At one point, Simms broke
into an impression of Woody Woodpecker, his favorite cartoon
character.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to remember his laugh," Simms said. "He was pretty
quick on his toes."</TE>
<TE>   Simms appeared remarkably at ease, and you wondered why.</TE>
<TE>   He, like his coach, heads into the Oklahoma game today trying to
beat a rap.</TE>
<TE>   Although he possesses a bright smile, quick wit, a whip for an arm
and all the talent to become an NFL star, Simms has so far come up
short in college when it counted.</TE>
<TE>   He is 20-4 as a starting quarterback, but 0-3 against top-10
teams. In those games, he has thrown 12 interceptions and no
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, in a 14-3 loss to Oklahoma, Simms threw four
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   He ended the season on the bench, watching senior folk hero Major
Applewhite lead Texas to a comeback win over Washington in the
Holiday Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   To many who follow Texas football, this is now-or-never week for
Brown and Simms, two talented men who need to beat Oklahoma to
establish their claims to something other than raw-data success.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes don't get much higher than No. 2 Oklahoma versus No. 3
Texas in the Red River Shootout, although if Texas loses, the
Longhorns may just be steak.</TE>
<TE>   To those who bow to the bovine Bevo, and exchange "Hook 'em horns"
hand signs in airports, this might be the biggest Texas-Oklahoma game
since 1963.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if people will ever be able to say that Texas is
back as one of the elite programs until we beat OU," Simms admitted.
"I think that's the biggest thing about this game, we want to make it
legit."</TE>
<TE>   Time is running out for the team of Brown and Simms, the dynamic
duo that was supposed to deliver Texas' fourth national title and its
first in three decades.</TE>
<TE>   After all, life tosses you only so many chances.</TE>
<TE>   Coach and player, in fact, had an opportunity to make amends for
last year's Oklahoma loss. Through a series of BCS quirks and
bounces--and Oklahoma State's stunning upset of Oklahoma--Texas ended
up winning the title in the Big 12 South and had a chance to play
Miami in the Rose Bowl for the national championship.</TE>
<TE>   All Texas had to do was beat Colorado in the Big 12 title game, a
team it had crushed in the regular season, 41-7.</TE>
<TE>   If you'll recall, that game ended up being another sequel to
"Nightmare on Austin Street." Simms had a horrible game and Brown--in
another debatable game-management decision--waited too long to pull
his starter.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Brown made the move, Simms had thrown three
interceptions and Colorado led, 29-10.</TE>
<TE>   Applewhite was spectacular in relief and nearly rescued his team,
Colorado needing to recover an onside kick at the end to preserve a
39-37 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Criticized in some quarters (usually the first, second, third and
fourth) for his handling of Simms versus Applewhite, Brown had no
choice but to name Applewhite the Holiday Bowl starter.</TE>
<TE>   After another heroic performance, Applewhite ended his career as
one of the most celebrated stars in Texas history. He will join the
Texas coaching staff in the spring, but for now he's drawing rave
reviews as host of a daily sports-talk radio show.</TE>
<TE>   Simms still can't shake Applewhite.</TE>
<TE>   Even more than last year's loss to Oklahoma, though, it was the
Big 12 title-game defeat by Colorado that really left Simms crushed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty brutal," Simms recalled. "I'm the type of guy that
I beat myself up a lot. I was disgusted with myself for a while,
really. It was one of those things where you go into the game
extremely confident. I mean, we beat them, 41-7, here. All of a
sudden, one thing went wrong, and I couldn't get anything to go right
after that. It was torture, it really was."</TE>
<TE>   A month later, Simms forced himself to watch film of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to watch them," he said of those moments. "You get
frustrated all over again. You relive old memories a bit, but they do
make you better, no doubt about that."</TE>
<TE>   Simms knew he had one last, precious senior year left to redeem
himself. Texas was his team now, Applewhite moved from behind center
to behind microphone, the Longhorn supporting cast had matured and
improved and every goal Simms set out to achieve was still on the
table.</TE>
<TE>   As for the defining moment in his career? "It probably starts this
weekend," Simms said.</TE>
<TE>   In five wins this year, Simms has done just about everything
right, throwing for 1,161 yards with 10 touchdowns and only three
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, a man who knows the story line, has become his
quarterback's most vocal supporter.</TE>
<TE>   "He's 20-4 as a starter, my gosh," Brown says of Simms, "but for
whatever reason, he's been held to a different standard across the
country."</TE>
<TE>   Brown insists today's game will not define him. "My life will not
change if we beat OU," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown says what he is feeling is not pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure, he says, was the time at North Carolina in 1990 he had
to beat Wake Forest to save his job.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be here if I hadn't won that one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown says he does not lie awake nights, thinking about Oklahoma
or what victory or defeat might mean.</TE>
<TE>   He knows that even if Texas beats Oklahoma, it will mean nothing
if the Longhorns follow up by losing at Kansas State, the only
conference school Brown has not defeated.</TE>
<TE>   Simms is through beating himself up over scores and interceptions
he cannot retrieve. If he has learned one thing from his famous
father, Phil, who endured the emotional gamut as the New York Giants'
quarterback, it's that you keep breaking the huddle until you get it
right.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a man's game and you need to be a man at all times,"
Simms said. "If you make a mistake on the field, you be a man and say
it was your fault. That's just part of being a quarterback and a
leader on the team."</TE>
<TE>   Once, during Brown's one-year stint as Oklahoma's offensive
coordinator, Sooner Coach Barry Switzer told him, "At OU, you have to
beat Texas to keep your job. At Texas, you have to beat everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Brown says the compact the Texas coach has with its fans is
binding--win every game or else.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's fair," Brown said. "If you're going to stay here, you
have to understand that."</TE>

<KH>UCLA VS. OREGON</KH>
<HD>These Ducks Now Receive Top Billing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oregon has always been green, but once upon a time it was from envy.
UCLA had the recruiting pool, the fan base, the big-dollar donors
and, of course, perpetual sunshine.</LD>
<LD>   But the Ducks raided the recruiting pool, matched the attendance
and found their own big-dollar donors to take facilities to a
sparkling new level.</LD>
<LD>   Sunshine might be beyond their control, but all that Northwest
rain is only one reason the grass looks greener on the Oregon side of
the state line.</LD>
<TE>   Envy runs the other way these days, although no one at UCLA will
acknowledge it.</TE>
<TE>   Fear and loathing, however, are acknowledged in great abundance.</TE>
<TE>   "They are considered the premier team in the conference and
there's that whole Northwest thing going on, where everybody says the
balance of power is up there now," Bruin senior cornerback Ricky
Manning said. "That's the perception, and the only way to change it
is to win."</TE>
<TE>   Seventh-ranked Oregon (5-0) visits UCLA (4-1) today in a Pacific
10 Conference game that will set the course for the season. Both
teams won conference openers last week. Both believe a victory will
provide the springboard to greater glory.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes or breaks the season," Bruin junior receiver Tab Perry
said. "My freshman year, they won when we were 4-0. Last year, if we
won, we would have gone to a bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   "Their coaches do a good job of preparing them. They execute like
a machine. We usually play them close and I expect another close
game."</TE>
<TE>   In Coach Mike Bellotti's previous seven seasons, the Ducks have
played UCLA at the Rose Bowl four times. Each game was decided on the
final play and the combined score was 126-126.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon won, 21-20, last season when a 50-yard field goal try by
Bruin Chris Griffith fell short on the last play. The Ducks went on
to the Pac-10 title, a Fiesta Bowl berth and a No. 2 ranking. UCLA
collapsed, losing to USC, 27-0, the next week and did not play in a
bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, UCLA held on to win, 34-29, by tackling Duck receiver
Marshaun Tucker at the one-yard line as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, UCLA won in overtime, 41-38, on a field goal by Chris
Sailer after quarterbacks Cade McNown of UCLA and Akili Smith of
Oregon had traded blows for four quarters. The victory was the 15th
in succession for No. 2 UCLA and spoiled a 5-0 start for the No. 11
Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Terry Donahue's last season as UCLA coach, Bellotti was
in his first with the Ducks. The rookie won his first conference game
by beating the Bruins, 38-31. And that time, it was UCLA stopped at
the one as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   "The games have been close and that's what has made this a great
rivalry of late," Bruin Coach Bob Toledo said. "Every game is down to
the wire.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for us to play well. The team that wins is in a
good position in the conference. It is very meaningful."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo is 4-2 against Oregon since replacing Donahue, but the
losses were dealt him in the last two years. The pendulum has swung
in more ways than one.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon has won its last 10 games and 32 of its last 35. Crowds at
Autzen Stadium are averaging beyond capacity for the seventh time in
eight years. Nike founder and alum Phil Knight donated $30 million to
expand the stadium from 55,000 to 64,000 by next year.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks can schedule nonconference home games against weak
opponents because Autzen would sell out even if Oregon played
Division I-AA Portland State. In fact, the Ducks did play Portland
State two weeks ago, winning, 41-0, before their 20th consecutive
capacity crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, UCLA must schedule strong opponents to guarantee that
enough of its fickle fans will show up to generate revenue. So the
Bruins played Colorado State and Colorado instead of, say,
Mississippi State and Idaho--two other patsies the Ducks demolished
this year.</TE>
<TE>   The difference in schedules is the primary reason UCLA is favored
by 2 1/2 points. There is also the Bruins' stellar play the last two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Cory Paus has never played better, having thrown for
594 yards in victories over San Diego State and Oregon State. The
Bruins scored 43 points in each game, utilizing an array of receivers
and last week unleashing redshirt freshman running back Tyler Ebell,
who rushed for 203 yards in three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Receivers Craig Bragg and Perry, as well as tight end Mike
Seidman, will draw man-to-man coverage. It will be up to Paus to find
them.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have a chance to put up some numbers," Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   So does Oregon, which averages 402 yards a game. Quarterback Jason
Fife has thrown for 1,124 yards and 10 touchdowns with one
interception.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Onterrio Smith has five consecutive 100-yard games
and is coming off his best game, a 145-yard effort against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "He can change the game in the blink of an eye," UCLA safety Matt
Ware said. "We have to know where he is all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The only edge the defenses have is familiarity.</TE>
<TE>   "The offenses are so similar it's amazing," Toledo said. "I can
call every play on their film."</TE>
<TE>   There's the common ground--the playbooks of UCLA and Oregon are
nearly identical. Everything else about these programs is different
enough to make this a rivalry game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become more of a rivalry every year because the games mean
so much and they are always close," Manning said. "We're kind of
playing for Southern California. They shouldn't come down here and
beat us. That shouldn't happen."</TE>

<HD>It's No Longer Low-Cal Feast for the Trojans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This was supposed to be the breather, the only certain victory on
USC's otherwise ultra-tough 12-game schedule.</LD>
<LD>   That was before rejuvenated California scored 70 points against
Baylor in its opener. Before the Golden Bears whipped
then-15th-ranked Michigan State on the road to improve to 3-0. And
before Cal recovered from consecutive losses to No. 21 Air Force and
No. 12 Washington State by upsetting No. 22 Washington last week.</LD>
<LD>   So today's Pacific 10 Conference game at the Coliseum, once
regarded as a potential break for USC, instead carries make-or-break
implications for the No. 20 Trojans.</LD>
<TE>   "This game is huge," USC quarterback Carson Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   It's big because after USC had shut out Oregon State in its
conference opener, the Trojans followed with a sloppy 30-27 overtime
loss at Washington State. That defeat dropped the Trojans (3-2, 1-1
in conference play) into a fifth-place tie with California (4-2, 1-1)
in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   With games against Washington and at No. 7 Oregon coming up, USC
needs a victory to stop a potential downward spiral in Coach Pete
Carroll's second season.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be easy against a Cal team enjoying one of the most
dramatic turnarounds in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   New Coach Jeff Tedford, former offensive coordinator at Oregon,
replaced Tom Holmoe and wasted no time erasing memories of last
year's 1-10 finish, the worst record in school history.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no timetable, just a week-to-week basis," said Tedford, who
has the Golden Bears off to their best start since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Cal cannot participate in a bowl game this season because of NCAA
rules violations, but the Golden Bears appear on track for their
first winning season since 1993, when they defeated Iowa in the Alamo
Bowl and finished 9-4.</TE>
<TE>   Senior quarterback Kyle Boller is flourishing under Tedford, who
tutored Trent Dilfer at Fresno State and Akili Smith and Joey
Harrington at Oregon. Boller, 6 feet 4 inches and 225 pounds, has
passed for 1,478 yards and 16 touchdowns. For the first time in his
career, he is enjoying protection from an offensive line that has
given up only seven sacks.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Boller led Cal to its first victory over Washington
since 1976, a streak of 19 games.</TE>
<TE>   "He looks like a real pro prospect, where last year he looked like
just another guy," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Cal is averaging 40.5 points and has outscored opponents, 142-38,
in the first half. The Golden Bears have scored in all but one of
their 26 trips inside the opposition's 20-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Cal ranked 114th out of 115 schools with a minus-17
turnover margin. This season, Cal ranks fourth in the nation in
turnover margin at plus 13 and has scored 70 points off turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "The turnover thing is ridiculous and giving their team an
opportunity on offense," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   USC routed Cal at Berkeley last season, 55-14. The Trojans,
however, must improve in several areas if they hope to defeat Cal at
the Coliseum for the first time since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   USC gave up several big plays against Washington State, among them
a 75-yard touchdown run and a 53-yard pass play that set up the field
goal that sent the game into overtime. That does not bode well
against a Cal team that has produced 12 plays of 50 yards or more.</TE>
<TE>   Making matters worse, USC might be without All-American safety
Troy Polamalu, who suffered a high ankle sprain against Washington
State and did not practice this week. Carroll said Polamalu's status
would be determined after warmups today.</TE>
<TE>   Trojan special teams must also perform better. Kicker Ryan Killeen
missed two field-goal attempts and a critical extra-point attempt
late in the fourth quarter against Washington State that prevented
the Trojans from taking a four-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   Like Washington State, which forced overtime and won the game with
field goals, Cal has a reliable kicking game.</TE>
<TE>   "Our hands are full in all phases of the game," Carroll said.</TE>

<HD>Next on 'Fear Factor': Pitching to This Guy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds is the most feared hitter in baseball, and even though he
has only one hit in five at-bats against St. Louis in the National
League championship series, he's having as big an impact on the
playoffs as he did on the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   The mere threat of Bonds in the San Francisco Giants' lineup has
opened things for his teammates, who have feasted on fat pitches left
over the plate.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis pitchers have sometimes seemed preoccupied with the goal
of keeping first base open so they can walk Bonds, and the rest of
the Giants have made them pay in taking a 2-0 lead heading into
today's Game 3.</LD>
<TE>   Shortstop Rich Aurilia bats two spots ahead of Bonds and he jumped
all over St. Louis right-hander Woody Williams with two home runs in
the Giants' 4-1 victory in Game 2. Although Bonds failed to get a hit
in three official at-bats, he made a difference with his presence
after stepping up big in San Francisco's 9-6 Game 1 victory.</TE>
<TE>   In the series opener, Bonds drove in two runs with a laser triple,
walked three times and scored twice. Bonds spoon-fed Benito Santiago
several golden opportunities and the veteran catcher took advantage
with two singles and a two-run homer, and three of his four RBIs came
after Bonds had been walked.</TE>
<TE>   That's having an impact.</TE>
<TE>   But Bonds has done that to everyone this season and he has done it
in many ways, not only with home runs. Bonds shattered Ted Williams'
51-year-old on-base percentage record of .551, posting a .582.
According to STATS Inc., if you turned every one of Bonds' 149 hits
into outs, his remaining OBP of .338, built with a major
league-record 198 walks, would still be better than the .332 by
American League MVP candidate Alfonso Soriano of the New York Yankees</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who has reached base in 14 of 30 plate appearances during
the playoffs, has finally been getting the job done in postseason
play. The one knock on him over the years has been his playoff
failures, but he's hitting .273 with a .452 on-base percentage and a
home run in every 7.3 at-bats in this year's playoffs, compared to
.196, .319 and every 97 at-bats in his previous playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds has completely unsettled pitchers the last two seasons. And
the key to his effectiveness has been his patience. He doesn't swing
at bad pitches and handles the inside pitch with power. He has a
super-quick bat and a pure-hitter swing. An equal opportunity batter,
he hits righties and lefties the same.</TE>
<TE>   Even pitchers who have handled Bonds well over the years give the
San Francisco slugger his due. Dodger veteran Jesse Orosco--in his
younger days, he pitched against Barry's father, Bobby--is one of
five active pitchers who have held Barry below a .190 batting average
with at least 25 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Orosco said that facing today's Bonds is every bit as difficult as
it looks.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me just say it this way, any pitcher is not too fond about
facing him, even if you've had some success against him in the past,"
said Orosco, who has held Bonds to a .160 batting average. "He's a
very feared hitter up there. You don't get that many intentional
walks without a reason. Sometimes pitchers do not mind when a manager
tells him to walk [Bonds]."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two seasons, Bonds has walked 375 times.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Lieber of the Chicago Cubs has done the best against Bonds,
holding him to five hits in 36 at-bats (.139); followed by former
Dodger Ismael Valdes of Seattle and Orosco at .160, John Thomson of
the New York Mets, .185, and Greg Swindell of Arizona, .188.</TE>
<TE>   But like most pitchers who have had success against Bonds, Orosco
had most of his when Bonds was younger and played for the Pittsburgh
Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry was very aggressive when he was young, more like his
father," Orosco said. "I faced him when he was real young and then I
went off to the American League. He's more patient now. He's taken a
different approach and it works for him."</TE>
<TE>   But there is a way to reduce Bonds' effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   It will not be easy, but the Cardinals can get it done today in
Game 3 with left-hander Chuck Finley, who has walked Bonds twice and
given up one hit in Bonds' four at-bats against him.</TE>
<TE>   Hall of Fame pitcher Juan Marichal has said the key to pitching to
Bonds is to not pitch to him in any certain way and to keep moving
the ball inside and outside.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly how the Cardinals attacked Bonds on Thursday, and
Williams was able to get him out with ball movement. Williams jumped
out to 0-2 counts the first two times he faced Bonds but had to go to
full counts each time before getting him out.</TE>
<TE>   Williams challenged Bonds, but not with a lot of fastballs.
Williams threw curveballs for strikes and had Bonds swinging at
sliders out of the strike zone. The third time Bonds faced Williams,
he worked a walk and then finished his night by striking out in four
pitches against left-hander Jeff Fassero.</TE>
<TE>   If St. Louis learned anything from Game 2, it's not to back down
against Bonds. Cardinal Manager Tony La Russa seems determined to get
Bonds to swing at pitches out of the strike zone, and he's doing a
good job of that by getting his pitchers to go after him aggressively
to get ahead in the count.</TE>
<TE>   You also can't be afraid to pitch hard inside. It's a tactic some
pitchers do well, while others just make things more difficult for
themselves because Bonds never backs down. But if you can do it
right, the deeper in the count you can get Bonds, the better chance
you have of getting him out. He hit .420 on first pitches during the
regular season and only .280 when the count was full.</TE>
<TE>   Finley still can bring some heat and he was able to move the ball
around well against Arizona in the first round of the playoffs. But
he didn't have to face Bonds, who will surely make his job more
difficult today.</TE>

<HD>Figgins Thinks He Was Safe</HD>

<LD>Pinch-runner Chone Figgins, called out at the plate on Darin Erstad's
fielder's choice grounder in the seventh inning, maintained he was
safe--and that his other baserunning decisions in the inning were
correct.</LD>
<LD>   Figgins, running for Bengie Molina, moved to second on Benji Gil's
sacrifice. When David Eckstein lined a shot off the second baseman's
glove for a single, Figgins moved to third.</LD>
<LD>   With an 0-and-1 count on Erstad, Johan Santana uncorked a wild
pitch, but Figgins stayed put while Eckstein moved to second. Figgins
was called out at home on Erstad's grounder to second, although
replays didn't clearly show whether Minnesota catcher A.J. Pierzynski
had tagged him.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't think he tagged me because he was so far in front of the
plate," Figgins said. "The umpire [Brian Gorman] saw the ball beat
me. That's probably why he called me out. He had to reach back. I
thought I was in there."</TE>
<TE>   Figgins also said he couldn't go on Eckstein's liner because he
thought it might have been caught; he didn't go on the wild pitch
because he thought it wasn't worth the risk. The Angels failed to
score in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Helene Elliott</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Gene Autry founded the Angels in 1961, the legendary
entertainer often invited his show business buddies to join him at
the ballpark. The suddenly trendy Angels are Hollywood's team again,
with Edison Field the hot new place for celebrities to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Kevin Costner joined Disney Chairman Michael Eisner in a
private suite Friday. The all-star roster scheduled to attend at
least one of the three American League championship series games this
weekend includes singer Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit and actors Pierce
Brosnan, Dennis Quaid, David Hasselhoff and Matt LeBlanc, one of the
stars of "Friends."</TE>
<TE>   "It's awesome. It's cool," Gil said. "Hopefully, they'll give us
some guest appearances in their movies and shows.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to be on 'Friends.' That might be the highlight of my
life."</TE>
<TE>   Really?</TE>
<TE>   "Other than family and baseball," he said, quickly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Autry, the honorary president of the American League and
former co-owner of the Angels, is scheduled to throw out the
ceremonial first pitch tonight. While Autry is not interested in
buying back the team her husband founded, she said she would be happy
to speak with any incoming owner interested in embracing the Angels'
Autry legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Three of Gene Autry's favorite players--shortstop Jim Fregosi,
second baseman Bobby Knoop and catcher Buck Rodgers--are scheduled to
throw out first pitches Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan, invited to throw out a first pitch this
weekend, had scheduling conflicts but could be available for a World
Series game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right fielder Tim Salmon, forced from Wednesday's game because of
a strained right hamstring, started Friday. He was cleared to play
after two therapy sessions Thursday and an intensive pregame workout
Friday.... Eckstein and pitcher Scott Schoeneweis have been selected
to play on a team of major leaguers scheduled for a tour of Japan in
November.... Maybe this is why Eisner says Disney might sell part,
but not all, of the Angels: Half an hour before Friday's game, about
120 people stood in line outside the stadium store, waiting at least
20 minutes for the right to enter the store and spend $20 on a
stuffed monkey.</TE>

Guzman hit a slow bouncer to Glaus, but Gil dropped his throw, giving
the Twins runners at first and second. Yes, Adam Kennedy bats
left-handed and Milton is a left-hander, but Kennedy probably would
have handled that throw. Koskie struck out swinging again. LeCroy
flied to left. No runs, one hit, one error, two left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Twins 0--Eckstein fouled to right. Erstad
singled to short left, a 'tweener just over the outstretched glove of
Koskie. Salmon lined to left. Anderson flied to left, Jones making
the catch in front of the 330 sign. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 1, Twins 0--Hunter fouled to first. While
Mientkiewicz was batting, Fox flashed a graphic telling us that he
once caught 17 fish during a televised fishing show. Wow! Anyway, he
then grounded to short. Mohr lined a single to right-center. Washburn
appeared to have Mohr picked off first and threw to Spiezio. Mohr
took off for second, but slid under Eckstein's tag. Pierzynski flied
to center. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Twins 0--Glaus singled to right. Spiezio flied
to right. Wooten popped to short. Molina struck out. No runs, one
hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 1, Twins 0--Rivas grounded to short. Jones grounded
to first. That made him hitless in 12 at-bats in the series. Guzman
struck out swinging on a nasty slow curve. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Twins 0--Gil flied to center. Eckstein fouled to
first. Erstad lined a shot to left that appeared to hit the line, but
left-field umpire Ed Montague called it foul, believing it was just a
bit outside. Erstad then popped to short. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 1, Twins 0--Koskie struck out looking. LeCroy struck
out swinging. Hunter lined a single to left. Mientkiewicz grounded to
second. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Twins 0--Salmon flied to left. Anderson lined a
double off the wall in right. Glaus walked. Spiezio flied to right,
but Anderson did not bother to tag up and couldn't advance. Wooten
flied to shallow center. No runs, one hit, two left.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 1, Twins 1--Mohr hit a high chopper between Glaus
and Eckstein for a single. Pierzynski went after the first pitch and
hit a routine fly to left. Rivas flied to right. Finally ... Jones
returned to the hit column, driving a double over Anderson's head off
the wall in left, Mohr scoring. Guzman popped to second. One run, two
hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Twins 1--LaTroy Hawkins pitching. Molina walked.
Chone Figgins ran for Molina. Gil sacrificed. With the count 0-2,
Eckstein hit a liner to the right of Rivas. If it's caught, it would
be a double play. If it's missed, it would be a run for the Angels.
Rivas only got his glove on it, and Figgins took third. Johan Santana
replaced Hawkins. With the infield playing in, Erstad hit a grounder
to second. Rivas threw home and got the sliding Figgins on a very
close play, Eckstein taking third. Mike Jackson replaced Santana.
Salmon walked on a full count, loading the bases. J.C. Romero
replaced Jackson. Anderson flied deep to right. No runs, one hit,
three left.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 1, Twins 1--Francisco Rodriguez pitching. Jose
Molina catching. Koskie struck out looking. David Ortiz, batting for
LeCroy, struck out looking at a curveball on the outside corner.
Hunter flied to left. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 2, Twins 1--Glaus drove a 2-1 pitch over the wall
in right-center. Spiezio struck out swinging. Wooten struck out
looking. Molina grounded to second. One run, one hit.</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 2, Twins 1--Troy Percival pitching. Alex Ochoa to
right. Mientkiewicz lined to right, Ochoa making a diving catch. Mohr
flied to right. Pierzynski flied to shallow left, Anderson making a
sliding catch. No runs, no hits.</TE>

<HD>Angels Need Him, so Anderson Dives Right in</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it was the emotion of a tense playoff game or the fevered pitch
of a Thunder Stix-wielding crowd of 44,234 in Edison Field, but
something swept Angel left fielder Garret Anderson off his feet
Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   The result was something so out of character, so out of the
ordinary, so remarkable, that center fielder Darin Erstad said he
"almost did a cartwheel out there," and the usually stoic Anderson
actually broke into a grin as wide as the left-center field gap.</LD>
<LD>   After ending an 0-for-8 American League championship series
drought with a solo home run off Eric Milton in the second inning,
Anderson, who is about as foreign to grass stains as Erstad and
shortstop David Eckstein are to clean uniforms, made a lunging,
diving shoe-string catch of A.J. Pierzynski's flare for the last out
in the Angels' 2-1 Game 3 victory over the Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<TE>   "G.A. leaving his feet like that--wow, you don't see that very
often," said Angel right fielder Tim Salmon, an eight-year teammate
of Anderson's. "But these kinds of games bring out the best in you.
This time of year, you're going to see guys do things differently.
That was a great reaction, a great play."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson will receive strong consideration for AL most valuable
player honors this season after hitting .306 with 29 home runs and
123 runs batted in, and he has been the Angels' most consistent
run-producer for the last three or four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   But he has never won a Gold Glove Award, he rarely shows up on
ESPN's web gem segment, and Angel bench coach Joe Maddon, who has
worked with Anderson at the minor league and big league levels,
doesn't understand why.</TE>
<TE>   "G.A. is probably the best left fielder in the game, and people
don't know that," Maddon said. "Why? Because he doesn't get dirty. He
doesn't dive around. That's not a rap. He stays on his feet because
he positions himself so well, and he studies hitters so much, so why
should he [dive]?"</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: With a 1-and-2 count in the ninth inning on
Pierzynski, a left-handed hitter with a reputation for opposite-field
bloop hits, Anderson took a few steps in from his already shallow
position.</TE>
<TE>   "He cheated in a bit," Maddon said, "and no one told him to do
so."</TE>
<TE>   Those few extra steps before the pitch were the difference between
a highlight-reel catch and a two-out single and a potential rally
against Angel closer Troy Percival, who retired the side in order in
the ninth and has not allowed an earned run in 37 1/3 career innings
against the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't going to stop running," Anderson said of the play. "I
knew it was soft enough to where if I missed it, it wasn't going to
get too far away from me. I didn't really think about it. It just
happened."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's actions in the field are usually measured, calculated.
He rarely dives for balls or crashes into walls because he knows he
is not as athletic as Erstad or former Angel center fielder Jim
Edmonds and would probably get hurt if he played with the reckless
abandon they play with.</TE>
<TE>   That the left-handed-hitting Anderson, who hit .389 with one homer
and four RBIs in the division series against the Yankees, came up
with a clutch hit Friday night was no shock.</TE>
<TE>   He has always hit left-handers (.284) almost as well as he hits
right-handers (.316), and he had a .364 career average (eight for 22)
with four homers and six RBIs against the left-handed Milton before
jumping all over an 0-and-1 fastball in the second, sending it deep
into the right-field seats for a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes left-handers keep me more honest," Anderson said. "You
really have to be on your game against them, especially the tough
ones. Something about hearing in the minor leagues that you can't hit
left-handers still motivates me to prove them wrong."</TE>
<TE>   He won't have anything to prove to Milton, who gave up one run and
five hits, including Anderson's sixth-inning double, in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Milton didn't make many mistakes, but one of them was a fastball
he didn't get where he wanted to with Garret," Angel Manager Mike
Scioscia said. "And Garret didn't miss it."</TE>

<TE>   Update--John Lackey makes his first playoff start. In the first
round against New York, he appeared once in relief, making the
Angels' comeback from a 6-1 deficit possible by relieving Ramon Ortiz
in the third inning and pitching three shutout innings. He has faced
the Twins once, giving up five runs (three earned) over six innings.
Brad Radke, with perhaps a better changeup than the one Joe Mays used
to baffle the Angels in Game 1, ranks among the all-time Angel
nemeses. In his career against the Angels, Radke is 11-4 with a 1.72
earned-run average overall and 6-1 with a 1.38 ERA in Anaheim.</TE>

<HD>Showalter Takes On Texas-Sized Task With Rangers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former New York Yankee and Arizona Diamondback manager Buck
Showalter, a candidate for several current openings, was hired Friday
by the Texas Rangers.</LD>
<LD>   Showalter takes over a team that finished last in the American
League West the past three seasons. Before that, the Rangers won
their only three division titles in 1996, '98 and '99.</LD>
<LD>   In seven seasons as a major league manager, Showalter has a
562-505 record. He was with the New York Yankees from 1992-95 and was
Arizona's first manager from 1998-2000. Each team went to the World
Series the year after he left.</LD>
<TE>   "Once you've been tried and tested, there's a great confidence you
get from being able to handle the heat," Showalter said.</TE>
<TE>   Ranger owner Tom Hicks and General Manager John Hart considered
Showalter their top candidate from the outset of their search, which
started when Jerry Narron was fired two days after the season.</TE>
<TE>   Showalter also spoke with the Chicago Cubs and New York Mets about
their managerial openings this month. The Milwaukee Brewers and Tampa
Devil Rays had expressed interest in him as well.</TE>
<TE>   Since being fired by the Diamondbacks in 2000, Showalter, 46, has
worked as an ESPN analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Showalter will be the Rangers' 16th manager, taking over a club
that struggled all season--even with All-Star shortstop Alex
Rodriguez, who hit .300 and led the majors with 57 homers and 142
RBIs, and an opening-day payroll of $105 million, the third-highest
in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A former business partner of Chicago Cub outfielder Sammy Sosa is
facing charges that he conspired to sell illegal drugs and launder
money, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   William A. Chase, 61, was arrested Thursday by Drug Enforcement
Administration officers after he allegedly picked up 1,500 Ecstasy
tablets from Charmaine Livingston, 40, of Lauderhill, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Chase was released Friday on $50,000 bond and did not comment as
he left federal court in Fort Lauderdale. Livingston was also
arrested on drug charges and was in federal custody Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A man who ran onto the field at Comiskey Park with his son and
attacked a Kansas City Royal coach was indicted on three counts of
aggravated battery and one of mob action.</TE>
<TE>   William Ligue Jr., 34, was charged with attacking Tom Gamboa on
Sept. 19 and causing the coach to lose some of his hearing. Ligue is
being held on $200,000 bond. Ligue's 15-year-old son faces juvenile
charges of aggravated battery and mob action for attacking Gamboa and
an off-duty state trooper who was working as a security guard.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Phillie catcher Mike Lieberthal will have surgery
Tuesday after hurting his right knee when he caught his shoe while
getting out of a golf cart. Lieberthal has a small tear of the
cartilage and is expected to be ready for spring training, Phillie
General Manager Ed Wade said.... The Phillies hired former Boston Red
Sox manager Joe Kerrigan as the team's new pitching coach.... New
York Yankee first base coach Lee Mazzilli was interviewed by the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays, seeking a replacement for fired Manager Hal
McRae. Willie Randolph will be interviewed Monday.</TE>

<LD>Chino Don Lugo High has selected David Greenwood to replace Eric
Highstreet as its boys' basketball coach. The decision is pending
approval by the Chino Valley Unified School District at its meeting
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "He brings a wealth of experience to the program," Athletic
Director Joe Marcos said. "I think when word got out that he was
applying, not too many other people submitted applications."</LD>
<LD>   Greenwood, 45, was a two-time All-American and four-year starter
at UCLA in the late 1970s. He played in the NBA for 12 seasons and
was a member of the Detroit Pistons' championship team in 1990.</LD>
<TE>   He has a proven coaching record at the high school level, leading
his alma mater, L.A. Verbum Dei, to state Division IV titles in
1997-98 and '98-'99. The Eagles were 23-5 in '97-'98 and 31-7 in
'98-'99.</TE>
<TE>   Don Lugo finished 4-23 last season, including an 0-10 mark in the
Baseline League. Highstreet resigned from the position in early
September after the administration approached him about working with
another coach.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration felt they needed a big-name coach who could
keep the talent within the community from leaving and also draw
talent in from outside the area," Highstreet said.</TE>

volleyball team, has committed to play at Long Beach State.</TE>

<HD>A Game of Hit and Miss</HD>
<DH>Football: Top-flight quarterback Matt Engle of El Segundo
gets last laugh--and victory--in friendly rivalry with Lawrence
Jackson, Inglewood's highly-touted defensive end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SONDHEIMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whenever the No. 1 pass rusher in Southern California, Lawrence
Jackson of Inglewood High, goes against the No. 1 passer, Matt Engle
of El Segundo, it's almost like watching a Tom and Jerry cartoon.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to get you," Jackson says.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't catch me," Engle says.</LD>
<TE>   For two seasons, Engle has been one of the few quarterbacks to
avoid becoming a Jackson sack victim.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to get you," Jackson says.</TE>
<TE>   "No you're not," Engle says.</TE>
<TE>   It has reached the point where Jackson's coaches were overheard
telling him, "You've sacked everybody in California except this guy."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who is 6 feet 5, 235 pounds and mentions eating chicken
strips and quarterbacks in the same breath, said of Engle, "He'd
rather throw the ball out of bounds than get sacked. He just won't go
down."</TE>
<TE>   The two have become buddies, talking and joking around whenever
they see each other away from football. But it was all business
Friday night in a renewal of their cat-and-mouse game, with El
Segundo (5-0) defeating Inglewood (3-2), 38-36, in a wild nonleague
game that featured four lead changes in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Engle and the Eagles were kept off the scoreboard in the first
half, when he completed only three of 14 passes for 17 yards and the
Sentinels held a 6-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The second half was an entirely different matter. Engle threw for
five touchdowns, including a 27-yard pass to Ryan McDonald with five
seconds left that was the game winner.</TE>
<TE>   The winning score came as Engle drove his team 73 yards after
Inglewood's Brian Flowers scored on a four-yard run with 43 seconds
left.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Engle completed 21 of 42 passes for 323 yards with no
interceptions. He was sacked once--and it wasn't by Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Engle came into Friday's game as the top-ranked passer in Southern
California, having completed 78.6% of his passes for 1,449 yards and
18 touchdowns. Jackson entered with 60 career sacks and a stack of
college recruiting letters that could fill several lockers.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen a better [defensive end]," Inglewood Coach Kevin
Moore said. "He can play the run, he can play the pass. He's big,
strong and fast. I put 'special' in front of his name."</TE>
<TE>   Engle can probably imagine himself one day sitting on the couch,
watching an NFL game and seeing Jackson make a sack, then telling
everyone, "He couldn't sack me."</TE>
<TE>   Engle was reminding his offensive linemen this week about
Jackson's obsession with sacking him.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them how bad he wants to get me and they know," Engle
said.</TE>
<TE>   Engle is another in a long line of underrated and underestimated
small quarterbacks. He's 6-0, 185 pounds, a three-year starter and
had a streak of 230 passes without an interception. He has a 4.0
grade-point average and reads defenses better than some coaches. He's
the son of long-time El Camino College offensive line coach Gene
Engle.</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo runs a West Coast offense with multiple sets and quick
passes designed to keep defenses off balance.</TE>
<TE>   "We practice it so much that reading linebackers is pretty easy,"
Engle said.</TE>
<TE>   Engle has been receiving lots of interest from NCAA Division I-AA
schools, but the big Division I schools still can't get over their
height concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I feel is if a guy is 6-foot but can win you a
championship, I'd rather take that guy than someone who's 6-5, looks
good but doesn't win," he said. "I wish colleges would give me a
chance because if I get that chance, I'll prove I can play."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has demonstrated for three years that he's a pass rusher
with a college future. He lists, in no particular order, Washington,
Tennessee, Miami, USC and Penn State as schools he's definitely
considering.</TE>
<TE>   As a defensive end, he compares sacking a quarterback to the
excitement of a dunk in basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "I get hyped after a sack, but I don't show it," he said. "It's my
job. I love it. It pumps me up and it pumps the team up."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes Jackson talks a little too much, but there is a growing
maturity in the way he plays. He's facing double teams designed to
slow him down and isn't losing his composure.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, to be honest, I understand it's not going to be a
statistically great year because of what teams are planning to do,"
he said. "That's forcing my teammates to step up and make plays. If I
get somebody else to make plays, then everything else is going to
work."</TE>
<TE>   Engle has been known to buy his offensive linemen doughnuts as
motivation to protect him from pass rushers. The spotlight was on El
Segundo's two tackles, Steve Urrutia and Shane Russell. This week, he
was promising a bonus to keep Jackson away.</TE>
<TE>   "They're getting second helpings," Engle said.</TE>

<HD>Arcadia Beats Rancho Cucamonga, 23-13</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Senior quarterback Brian Ziska ran for touchdowns of two and three
yards and the Arcadia defense came up with two safeties in a 23-13
nonleague victory Friday night over Rancho Cucamonga at Arcadia.</LD>
<LD>   Arcadia (5-0,) ranked No. 2 in the Southern Section Division III
poll, also got 94 yards and a three-yard touchdown run from Michael
Howe in 22 carries.</LD>
<LD>   While Ziska, who completed nine of 22 passes for 92 yards, and
Howe accounted for the offense, the Apaches' opportunistic defense
and special teams also contributed.</LD>
<TE>   Arcadia, which won its opening game, 2-0, over La Canada St.
Francis, had two safeties against its Division II opponent, the first
to take a 9-7 halftime lead. Rancho Cucamonga quarterback Justin
Zellhauer was tackled in the end zone by Arcadia's Justin North and
Samson Jagoras with nine seconds left in the second quarter. The
second one pushed their lead to 17-13 when Reese Phillips sacked
Zellhauer early in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "That helps the momentum," Arcadia Coach Jon Dimalante said.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Cucamonga (2-2-1) forced the Apaches to punt after six
plays on their next possession, but fumbled the return. The ball was
recovered by Arcadia's Hansen Sheih at the Cougars' three-yard line.
Ziska ran the ball in on the next play to give Arcadia its final
margin of victory with 8:40 left.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Cucamonga drove 74 yards in 13 plays on its ensuing
possession, but running back Josh Sayles fumbled at the one-yard
line.</TE>
<TE>   Sayles finished with 108 yards in 25 carries, including touchdown
runs of 28 and 12 yards.</TE>

<LD>Gary White caught a game-winning 35-yard touchdown pass from Ryan
Clark with 35 seconds left, then intercepted a pass at the goal line
with no time remaining as Jefferson upset Gardena, 26-21, in a
nonleague game Friday afternoon at Jefferson.</LD>
<LD>   White leaped between two defenders to make a juggling catch in the
end zone for his fifth touchdown reception of the season. He caught
three passes for 84 yards.</LD>
<LD>   "The play was called 80 fade," said White, a 6-foot-2, 180-pound
senior who is being recruited by a number of colleges, including
Michigan State, Fresno State and Kansas. "They came out showing
man-to-man [coverage], but they snuck the safety over at the last
second. I saw that the ball was thrown to the inside, so I had to go
there. I had to tip the ball away from the first guy, then I grabbed
it on the way down."</LD>
<TE>   Gardena (3-2) took a 21-20 lead with 1:45 remaining when
quarterback LaFerrell Payne rolled left on a fake extra-point kick
attempt and threw to Steve Phillips for a two-point conversion. That
followed a 20-yard touchdown pass from Payne to De'Andre Hughes, who
caught six passes for 75 yards and also rushed for 85 yards in 14
carries.</TE>
<TE>   Payne completed 13 of 25 passes for 186 yards and three
touchdowns, including a 12-yard touchdown to Cedric Winton and a
37-yard strike to Fred Earles in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Lee pulled the Democrats (3-2) within 13-7 on a 50-yard
touchdown run with 5:06 left in the first half. Jefferson took a
14-13 lead on Ryan Clark's four-yard quarterback keeper and Ricardo
Camarena's extra-point with 10:55 left, then increased the lead to
20-13 on Clark's two-yard sneak with 4:23 left.</TE>
<TE>   "No disrespect to anybody, but Gary White is one of the best
receivers in the City," said Doi Johnson, Jefferson's first-year
coach. "He deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as [Taft's]
Steve Smith. He's that good."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Galluzzo</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos 34, Carson 26--Brandon Tripp caught three touchdown
passes and the Griffins turned three Colt turnovers into 21 points in
securing the nonleague victory at Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Tripp caught scoring passes of five and three yards from Justin
Elway in the first half and grabbed a 13-yarder from Jeff Kline to
give Los Alamitos (4-0-1), the Times' No. 5-ranked team, a 27-14
lead. Kline added a one-yard touchdown run to build the lead to 20
points before Carson (3-2) fought back in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Tripp, a 6-foot-2 senior receiver, had five catches for 43 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Myles, who had 233 yards rushing, scored on a 11-yard run
to cut the lead to 34-20 with 10:11 remaining. The Colts appeared to
have scored again on a long fumble return by Chester Tala but a
clipping penalty nullified the touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Myles ripped off a 45-yard run to get Carson into Griffin
territory and then finished the drive with an 18-yard scoring pass
from Beau Davis with 3:52 left.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos kept its cool and got three first downs to clinch the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Senior running back Ryan Bagley of Los Alamitos ran for a
season-high 186 yards in 23 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills Taft 55, San Fernando 34--Litrele Jones, filling in
for injured running back Ian Bell, rushed for 215 yards and three
touchdowns to lift the Toreadors (5-0) to a nonleague victory at
Taft.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Cary Dove connected with Steve Smith on an 18-yard
touchdown pass early in the third quarter to extend the lead to
34-14.</TE>
<TE>   San Fernando (2-3) scored 20 points in the next 6:30 and tied the
score, 34-34, with 4:57 to play in the third quarter when Matthew
Nevarez connected with Carlos Velasquez on a 35-yard touchdown pass
play.</TE>
<TE>   Jones scored on a 56-yard run on the ensuing possession and added
touchdown runs of five and 48 yards to put the game out of reach.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who sat out two games with a sprained left ankle, caught
seven passes for 122 yards, including touchdown receptions of 20 and
18 yards. Dove completed 19 of 29 passes for 259 yards and three
touchdowns.</TE>

<DH>Prep football: Long Beach Poly confronts Concord De La
Salle and its national-record 129-game win streak today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beating Concord De La Salle High the last 10 years has been sort of
like protecting the ozone layer--everyone has their own ideas how to
do it, but no one has been able to deliver.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Rollinson thought his Santa Ana Mater Dei team had found a
way to end De La Salle's national-record winning streak two years
ago. But the Monarchs fell short in the final minute when their
kicker pulled a short field goal wide, and the Spartans won, 31-28.</LD>
<LD>   "At that point, I go, 'That guy has better rosary beads than me,'
" Rollinson said of De La Salle's Bob Ladouceur, his Catholic school
counterpart.</LD>
<TE>   De La Salle manhandled Mater Dei by a combined score of 135-55
during the four-game series between the Northern and Southern
California powers. Yet, the Monarchs came closer than any other team
to beating the Spartans in what has blossomed into a 129-game winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you take any solace in it?" Rollinson said, repeating a
question. "To me, it's a loss."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rollinson is among the few coaches capable of providing
insight about De La Salle to Long Beach Poly Coach Raul Lara, whose
Jackrabbits (4-0) will attempt to defeat the Spartans (4-0) at 2 p.m.
today at California's Memorial Stadium in Berkeley. Fox Sports 2 will
broadcast the game at 7.</TE>
<TE>   De La Salle defeated Poly, 29-15, last year in Long Beach. And no
one has to tell Lara where his team fell short. The Jackrabbits
dropped potential touchdown passes and failed to make tackles.</TE>
<TE>   "It just let me know how crucial it is to execute when you play
against the best," Lara said this week. "With a team that great, you
have to execute every play."</TE>
<TE>   Victor Galli thinks there's a lot more to knocking off De La Salle
than execution. And he should know. Galli played on the first Spartan
team to go undefeated, in 1982, and coached De La Salle's freshman
and junior varsity teams for five seasons before being hired by rival
Pittsburg High, where he is in his first year as head coach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an impossible thing to do," Galli said of beating De La
Salle. "What they do is not rocket science."</TE>
<TE>   Galli and several others with knowledge of the Spartans formed
this checklist to beat De La Salle:</TE>
<TE>   * Apply pressure by taking an early lead.</TE>
<TE>   De La Salle rarely plays from behind--the Spartans haven't trailed
this season--and could get rattled if an opponent went ahead by more
than a touchdown in the early going. Said Rollinson: "They're not in
adverse situations that often. It's the one thing you can count on
that they haven't experienced."</TE>
<TE>   One De La Salle player came into the locker room crying several
years ago after dropping a potential touchdown pass before halftime
of a tight game the Spartans led. Typically, De La Salle has the game
in hand by the end of the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Their track record has been that they jump on you early and they
go on cruise control from there," said Honolulu St. Louis Coach
Delbert Tengan, whose team trailed, 21-0, before scoring in its 31-21
loss to De La Salle three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Adjust to De La Salle's adjustments.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches often think they know how to exploit the Spartans'
weaknesses after watching tape or scouting them in person. And while
their plan may work for a series or two, the Spartans always seem to
find a way to nullify the advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like a chess match," Galli said. "You have to know
what you're going to do and anticipate how they will adjust to it."</TE>
<TE>   * Minimize mistakes and capitalize on De La Salle's.</TE>
<TE>   The Spartans have lost four fumbles and had a pass intercepted
this season but have still outscored their opponents, 125-48. "They
make mistakes," said Tengan, "but you better pounce on them. Poly has
to capitalize. And when you get a guy open, you have to get him that
ball."</TE>
<TE>   Poly receiver Derrick Jones got open three times last year against
De La Salle. And the Poly quarterback got him the ball on each
occasion--only to watch Jones drop potential touchdown passes in the
first, second and fourth quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "When things go bad [against De La Salle] you see the air get
deflated out of people," Galli said. "That's when teams go flat."</TE>
<TE>   * Prepare for unheralded players.</TE>
<TE>   Poly defensive back Freddie Parish said the Jackrabbits had never
heard of Spartan running back Maurice Drew before last year's game.
Poly had geared up to stop Alijah Bradley, the De La Salle tailback
who had gained 206 yards against Mater Dei two weeks earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Drew scored all four of De La Salle's touchdowns against Poly.</TE>
<TE>   "They always come up with a wrinkle you haven't seen," said
Oakland Skyline Coach John Beam, whose last victory over the Spartans
came in 1984. "That's one thing that sets them apart."</TE>
<TE>   Two players to watch are running backs Jackie Bates and Gino
Ottoboni, Drew's backups this season.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, coming up with a plan to beat De La Salle and carrying
it out are different things.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people have gone in with the right plan but haven't been
able to execute it," Tengan said. "I didn't feel like we had to play
over our heads to beat them. We just needed to play better than we
did."</TE>

<LD>Two turnovers in the first quarter that resulted in two touchdowns
helped San Clemente, No. 17 in The Times' rankings, beat No. 22 Santa
Ana Foothill, 30-20, in a nonleague game Friday night at San Clemente
High.</LD>
<LD>   The turnovers turned into 13 points, seven coming on Foothill's
first possession, when San Clemente lineman Chris Wilson recovered a
bad snap in the end zone.</LD>
<LD>   After Todd Rusinkovich recovered a muffed punt return at the
Foothill 42-yard line, Cheyne Verhagen scored from four yards for a
16-0 lead with 33 seconds left in the quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Between those touchdowns, San Clemente special teams also
contributed as Travis Webster returned a punt 31 yards to the
Foothill 25 and Chris Miller kicked a 42-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "The main theme tonight is that turnovers lose football games,"
said Foothill Coach Doug Case, whose team dropped to 4-1. San
Clemente improved to 4-1.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente played without starting quarterback Beau Budde, who
is out with a broken foot, but backup Cole Bergquist completed 15 of
21 passes for 143 yards with no interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Bergquist also scored on a quarterback sneak late in the half to
give the Tritons a 23-13 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill played without its running back, Mike Liti, who suffered
a bruised shoulder in last week's victory over Orange El Modena. The
Knights gained only nine yards rushing, with Glenn Ardrey scoring
twice on one-yard runs.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill's Don Poole completed 19 of 33 passes for 311 yards with
two interceptions. Quincy Lever caught 13 passes for 217 yards and a
17-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   Moreno Valley Canyon Springs 7, Murrieta Valley 7--No doubt both
sides will watch films of this one and mull over the what ifs after
playing to a standoff in a nonleague game at Moreno Valley High.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon Springs (4-0-1), ranked No. 23, hung on to a 7-0 lead for
most of the contest, after a bad snap in the first quarter by the
Murrieta Valley punt team gave the Cougars the ball at the
Nighthawks' 17-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   It took six plays and surviving its own fumble for Canyon Springs
to score on a one-yard run by quarterback Josh Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   Murrieta Valley (4-0-1) got the equalizer with 3:43 left in the
game when two Nighthawk linemen blocked a Cougar punt and defensive
back Calvin Jones returned the ball 40 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew special teams needed to do something," Jones said,
"because our team offense was executing but not getting the job
done."</TE>
<TE>   Paul McLeod</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita 37, Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills 7--Ashton White
rushed for 145 yards and a touchdown in 30 carries and Santa
Margarita's defense held Trabuco Hills to only 90 yards in the second
half to blow open a tight nonleague game at Trabuco Hills High.</TE>
<TE>   Sixth-ranked Santa Margarita (5-0) led, 13-7, at halftime but
intercepted the first two pass attempts by Trabuco Hills' Brian White
in the second half and turned both into touchdowns to take a 30-7
lead.</TE>
<TE>   White, who had only four passes intercepted going into the game,
also had one picked off in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   He completed nine of 21 passes for 110 yards but was only three of
five for 28 yards in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita kicker Will Johnson had field goals of 47, 34 and
27 yards, tying school records for most field goals in a game and for
longest field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita's Case Colaw completed five of nine passes for 104
yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Esperanza 45, Fontana Miller 22--The No. 13 Aztecs used a
balanced attack to put together five 80-yard scoring drives and
routed one-dimensional Miller at Placentia Valencia High.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Rick Taloa completed 14 of 20 passes for 286 yards and
connected with Brandon Weiner on a 69-yard scoring pass play in the
first quarter to pull Esperanza (5-0) to within 9-7.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Eric Lyman gained 135 yards in 16 carries and scored
on a six-yard run in the second quarter to help the Aztecs take a
24-15 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Kirschner gained 141 yards in 19 carries and scored three
second-half touchdowns on runs of five, one and 33 yards for
Esperanza.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Kyle Jacobo of Miller (2-3) carried 27 times for 166
yards and scored on a 10-yard run in the first half; however, he
completed only two of eight passes for 46 yards with two
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Alai</TE>
<TE>   Culver City 30, Beverly Hills 26--Armon De'Launey ran 15 yards for
the go-ahead touchdown late in the third quarter and Ron Langer
kicked a 31-yard field goal early in the fourth in a nonleague game
at Culver City.</TE>
<TE>   The Centaurs continued their turnaround from a 3-6 season in 2001
by ending a seven-game losing streak to the Normans.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Alex Cueva completed 12 of 21 passes for 199 yards and
two touchdowns for Culver City (5-0).</TE>
<TE>   Kyle McCall ran for 158 yards and four touchdowns in 25 carries
for Beverly Hills (3-2).</TE>
<TE>   After throwing 18 touchdown passes over the first four games,
including at least four in each game, Norman quarterback Ollie Linter
failed to throw a touchdown pass, completing 15 of 32 passes for 179
yards.</TE>

<LD>Two weeks before the Breeders' Cup, Keeneland is hosting a Breeders'
Cup-quality race today.</LD>
<LD>   The best 3-year-old turf fillies in the country--and a talented
European shipper--will get together in the $500,000 Queen Elizabeth
II Challenge Cup at 1 1/8 miles.</LD>
<LD>   Certain to be run on a soggy course after consecutive days of rain
in Lexington, the Queen Elizabeth drew nine entrants, topped by
Megahertz and Little Treasure from California, Wonder Again from New
York and Zenda from Europe.</LD>
<TE>   Trained by Bobby Frankel for owner Michael Bello, Megahertz won
her first five starts in the U.S. at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park
before finishing second in the Del Mar Oaks on Aug. 24. Alex Solis
will ride the English-bred from the outside post.</TE>
<TE>   Little Treasure is two of two since coming to this country for a
partnership that includes Sid Port. Trained by Laura De Seroux, she
won the San Clemente at Del Mar and the Pucker Up at Arlington Park.
Kent Desormeaux has the call.</TE>
<TE>   After losing the first three starts of her life, Wonder Again has
won four in a row on the turf for trainer Jim Toner and
owner-breeders John and Joan Phillips. Edgar Prado will ride the
daughter of Silver Hawk.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Juddmonte Farms and trained by John Gosden, Zenda is a
Group I winner in France who will be racing on Lasix for the first
time.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the field, from the inside out, includes Riskaverse,
Showlady, Distant Valley, Alozaina and Lush Soldier.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Rolly Polly, who is a stakes winner at the
distance, heads a full field of 12 in today's feature at Santa Anita,
the $100,000 Sen. Ken Maddy Handicap at about 6 1/2 furlongs on the
turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Scoop Of Ice. The 8-year-old gelding has won three of
his last four starts and will try for his 12th career victory in
today's eighth at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Thunder Twice. The 5-year-old gelding, who will be a
longshot in today's 10th at Santa Anita, is winless is 38.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Komistar and Albatros in
the second, singling Glitteringmischief in the third and using The
Griff, R Meadow Luck and La Bandera in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/20. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $22.80/$104.40. Total money bet: $136.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With the exception of a Game 7, of course, it is a mistake to suggest
that any game in a seven-game series is more important than any
other.</LD>
<LD>   If they are all must wins, it would also be a mistake to suggest
that tonight's Game 4 in the American League championship series
didn't shadow the Angels into Friday night's Game 3.</LD>
<LD>   After all, can they really know what to expect from rookie John
Lackey, making his first start in 16 days tonight?</LD>
<TE>   Can they expect to give Lackey much of a cushion considering he is
being opposed by the Minnesota Twins' Brad Radke, against whom
neither the Angels nor their Rally Monkey ever have much of a chance?</TE>
<TE>   There are no definitive answers, and Jarrod Washburn went to work
in Game 3 knowing it. He knew, he would say after it was over, after
he had come up big again in a game that, yes, was the biggest yet in
this improbable postseason, that there's an element of "uncertainty"
to Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of confidence in John," Washburn said. "We know
he's a tough kid. We also know how good a pitcher Radke is and how
tough he's been on us. We all thought tonight's game was very
important for us to win."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won it, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   They won it on a Troy Glaus home run, breaking a 1-1 tie in the
eighth inning. They won it with Francisco Rodriguez and Troy Percival
retiring the last six Twins in order, and they won it because
Washburn pitched six shutout innings and ultimately gave up only that
one run in seven, giving up just six hits.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels will now send Lackey out with a 2-1 lead in the series,
and maybe that will deflate the pressure a little.</TE>
<TE>   For Washburn, in the continuation of his breakthrough season, with
a possibility now that his next start could be in Game 1 of the World
Series, bring it on.</TE>
<TE>   At 28, in his first full major league season, he has long since
established his stature as the staff ace, and if it comes down, as it
did Friday night, to pitching two games in one, pitching Game 3 for
Jarrod Washburn and John Lackey, well....</TE>
<TE>   "Cool," he said, when all the cameras and notebooks had
disappeared. "I love it. I love being the guy who's expected to win.
I love the pressure. To me it's a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   A lot of fun? Protecting a 1-0 lead? Locked in a tense duel with
Eric Milton?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, sure," Washburn said, smiling, "I'd prefer a six- or
seven-run lead, but a pitching duel is always a lot of fun if you
come out on top. I'll probably remember this game the rest of my
life."</TE>
<TE>   So may a crowd of 44,234, pounding those red sticks, making more
noise than the Twins' bats, but what's new?</TE>
<TE>   Washburn has dominated the Twins in three starts this year,
allowing seven runs in 27 innings, a 2.33 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   The lineup they started against him Friday night had a composite
average against him of .198, with 19 strikeouts in 91 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn struck out seven more, walked none, and took Garret
Anderson's second inning home run into the seventh inning before a
leadoff single by Dustan Mohr and a two-out double to left by Jacque
Jones tied the score and ended Jones' hitless streak at 18 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," said Washburn, "Jacque Jones is a great player. People
were saying maybe they should take him out of the lineup, maybe he
shouldn't be playing, but I give him credit. I threw a fastball that
had too much of the plate and he took advantage of it. I'm
disappointed I made that one mistake, but I feel good about the way I
pitched.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a good fastball, good slider, and probably threw a few more
changeups than I usually do. The key was that I had good location."</TE>
<TE>   He also said he could have gone on, but the Angels have to keep in
mind what's ahead. He still might have to start Game 6 on three days'
rest, still might have to start a Game 7. He has pitched 225 innings
this year, allowing only six earned runs in 19 innings of three
postseason starts, and that total is 31 2/3 more innings than his
previous career high.</TE>
<TE>   For all the advice he has received from Kevin Appier and Aaron
Sele about adjusting his work schedule between starts to improve his
late-season stamina, the innings are piling up.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Washburn, who broke down physically in August of
last year, said he still feels as if it's April.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel there's any getting tired now," he said. "If there
is, the adrenaline takes over, but I feel great.</TE>
<TE>   "I also feel we're going to win every time we give it to our
bullpen in a tight game. Like I said, I was disappointed with the
mistake I made to Jones, but I was happy turning it over the bullpen.
Of course, I sort of had the feeling it might go 15 or 16 innings."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus helped assure that it didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn was in the clubhouse, an ice bag on his shoulder,
watching on television.</TE>
<TE>   "I was jumping up and down, screaming 'get out of here,' " he said
referring to the flight of the Glaus drive.</TE>
<TE>   It is doubtful his screams were heard above those of the crowd,
but he had already delivered his part of the statement, providing the
foundation that will make it a bit easier for Lackey when he duels
Radke, a pitcher who is 11-4 with a 1.72 ERA against the Angels, 6-1
at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Another big game in a series of big games--Game 3 having been just
a little bigger than most.</TE>

<LD>Jim Furyk made nothing but pars and birdies for a third straight
round Friday and took the lead in the Invensys Classic at Las Vegas,
continuing his domination of a tournament he has won three times.</LD>
<LD>   Furyk, bidding for a fourth Las Vegas win in eight years, shot an
eight-under-par 64 at the TPC at Summerlin to get to 20-under and
take a one-stroke lead over Jeff Sluman. Furyk birdied four straight
holes on his front nine, avoiding any bogeys for the third day in a
row. Charles Howell III had a 66 and Stuart Appleby shot a 64 and
were tied for third at 17-under 198.</LD>
<LD>   John Daly completed his week early by shooting an 84 that left him
at 16-over and in last place. Daly started the day with a triple
bogey on the first hole and took a quadruple bogey eight on No. 11.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carin Koch chipped in for a birdie on the first hole and went on
to a five-under 67 that gave her a 15-under total of 129 and a
four-stroke lead over Cristie Kerr at Magnolia Grove Golf Club's
Crossings Course on the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail at Mobile, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Catriona Matthew (66) and Emilee Klein (68) were at 10 under and
defending champion Se Ri Pak had a 70 and was another stroke back.
Annika Sorenstam is at seven-under for the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Allen Doyle had a run of four straight birdies in an eight-under
64 and held a one-stroke lead over defending champion Sammy Rachels
and Bruce Fleisher after the first round of the Napa Valley
Championship at Napa, Calif. Tom Kite and Kermit Zarley, who made a
hole-in-one on the 191-yard seventh, were tied at 66.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Former No. 1 tennis player Martina Hingis of Switzerland, who will
fall out of the top 10 next week for the first time in six years,
will be out for at least the rest of the year, missing the
season-ending WTA championships at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   For Hingis, who returned in August after ankle surgery in May, it
will be an indefinite break. In a news conference Friday in Zurich to
make the announcement, Hingis was not even sure whether she would
return for the Australian Open in January. Hingis, 22, has had
mediocre results since coming back to the tour shortly before the
U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hampered by a thigh strain, Lindsay Davenport lost to Kim
Clijsters, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, in the quarterfinals of the Porsche Grand
Prix at Filderstadt, Germany. Davenport, the defending champion, hurt
her left leg in the second set and looked as though she had trouble
moving. Clijsters' semifinal opponent will be Amelie Mauresmo, who
beat Tatiana Panova, 6-3, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Davis Cup player James Blake lost to fourth-seeded Carlos
Moya, 7-6 (4), 3-6, 6-1, in the quarterfinals of the CA Trophy indoor
tournament at Vienna, Austria.... Top-seeded Marat Safin was upset by
Gustavo Kuerten, 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (3), in the quarterfinals of the Lyon
Grand Prix at Lyon, France.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   A convicted killer was sentenced to seven to 10 years in prison
and another defendant was given one year for attacking Boston Celtic
star Paul Pierce in a nightclub two years ago. Both men were
acquitted Monday of trying to kill Pierce but were convicted of
assault and battery charges.</TE>
<TE>   William Ragland also was convicted of assault and battery with a
dangerous weapon, a knife, and received the longer sentence. He'll
serve it after completing 21 to 25 years he now is serving for
unrelated convictions. Trevor Watson, given the one-year sentence,
also had 1 1/2 years suspended.</TE>

<TE>   OneWorld of Seattle improved its record to 7-0 in challenger
racing at the America's Cup, defeating Italy's Prada today by 1
minute, 11 seconds at Auckland, New Zealand. Alinghi of Switzerland
remained in first place in the challenger standings after a 25-second
win over Victory Challenge of Sweden. OneWorld, the only yacht
without a loss, previously had a point deducted from its total.</TE>

<TE>   NASCAR Winston Cup points leader Tony Stewart was awarded the pole
for the UAW-GM Quality 500 when rain washed out qualifying at
Concord, N.C. The field for Sunday's race at Lowe's Motor Speedway

<HD>A Wish List Like Never Before</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We are seeing it, if not entirely believing it. The Angels--scratch
that: the anti-Angels--come through with another dramatic victory
Friday night and edge perilously close to that dreaded time again:
the brink of the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   The best thing you can say about this team is that it has failed,
utterly and completely, in upholding the Angel Way to Play Baseball.
Fundamental chapters--How to Fall Apart After a Questionable
Managerial Decision, How to Fail to Get the Final Out, How to
Choke--are being blithely ignored.</LD>
<LD>   With every unlikely, unexpected October victory, these Angels chip
away at a hoary 40-year tradition uglier than the fake rock formation
behind the Edison Field outfield fence. They are doing it in prime
time, with a nation, no longer distracted by the New York Yankees and
the Arizona Diamondbacks, curiously tuning in. And they are doing it,
quite conspicuously, in the wake of another disappointing Dodger
season, with an ex-Dodger as manager and three ex-Dodgers on the
coaching staff, with a predominantly home-grown roster playing
textbook hit-behind-the-runner baseball, the way the Dodgers did
decades ago.</LD>
<TE>   It's still early; in truth, these Angels, up two games to one on
the Minnesota Twins in a seven-game series, are no further along than
the 1979, '82 and '86 clubs that fell short in the American League
championship series. But once they are finished, whenever they
finish, what will the local landscape resemble?</TE>
<TE>   Will the Angels have taken a chunk of valuable territory, of
precious fan base, from the Dodgers, still the dominant team in the
area, even after 14 years of resting on their laurels?</TE>
<TE>   Or will the dust from this little exercise be swept aside and
quickly forgotten as soon the Angels stumble through their first
slump of 2003?</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Angel fans, veteran sufferers who shake their heads at
the Thunder Stick-clapping Rally-Monkey-come-latelys, believe nothing
lasting will change until and unless the Angels:</TE>
<TE>   1. Reach the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   2. Contend again in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   3. Field a winning, competitive team on a consistent basis.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Howmann of Mission Viejo has been an Angel fan for more than
30 years. He was sitting in the Anaheim Stadium left-field stands on
Oct. 12, 1986, which gave him a good view of Dave Henderson's
playoff-turning home run.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as Henderson hit it, Howmann said he knew that the Angels
"were going to lose the next two games" and the series to Boston. "I
guess that comes from being a long-term Angel fan."</TE>
<TE>   He also realized that, for his psychological and physical
well-being, it was time to emotionally divest.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a tough fall there," Howmann said. "After that, I
basically decided to be an Angel fan, but I wasn't going to get so
worked up about whether they won or lost. And that's worked really
well.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I always track them, because I've been an Angel fan for
30 years or so. But I don't get emotionally involved anymore. I'd be
insane. If they win, it's great. If they lose, well, that's what they
do."</TE>
<TE>   Howmann believes the Angels' current playoff run will change the
local baseball dynamic for a couple months next year. "Then after
that," he says, "it comes down to if they can keep winning. As long
as they keep winning, the status will change. But they have to win.</TE>
<TE>   "Now if they go to the World Series and win the World Series.... "</TE>
<TE>   Howmann stopped and corrected himself.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I shouldn't even say that. But if they do, it would last
longer. It would last through the year."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Bunch of Long Beach describes himself as a fan of both the
Angels and the Dodgers, estimating he watched each team play at least
60 times on television this season. He believes nothing less than the
Angels winning the AL pennant will change the long-standing notion
that the Southland is Dodger country.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely depends on if they win this series," he said.
"Because with success comes credibility. The Angels, right now, have
never gotten the championship. The Dodgers have the many World Series
behind them, so they have that credibility. And they have that kind
of sustained following because they've proven to be a successful
winner while the Angels have had that huge monkey since '86 that they
finally got off their backs.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't think it's going to amount to a whole lot if they
don't get beyond the ALCS."</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, the Angels are fighting simply to reclaim Orange
County from the Dodgers. The Dodgers have a considerable following in
Orange County, which provides more than 10% of the club's
season-ticket base. And when the Dodgers play the Angels in an
interleague game at Edison Field, fan allegiance in the stands is
often tilted toward the visitors from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Where we were sitting, in the outfield seats, it was certainly
Dodgers, by a 3-1 or 4-1 margin," Bunch said. "Along with the fights
to prove it. It was literally like going to see the Angels and
finding it's a Dodger game."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Mead, the Angels' vice president of communications, maintains
that the Angels, as an organization, have never competed with the
Dodgers: "We've never sat in staff meetings and [said], 'The Dodgers
do this, the Dodgers do that, woe be us.' But the fact of the matter
is, aside from their success as an organization, the Dodgers brought
baseball to the West Coast. So to think that we're just going to
unseat that is somewhat naive.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go up to the Bay Area, the Oakland A's have been to six
World Series, from the '70s through 2002. It's still a Giants town.
Think about it. The A's have arguably had more success than the
Giants have had up there.</TE>
<TE>   "So I don't know if there's squatter's rights or whatever, but I
think our responsibility is to not worry about other people. We had a
great decade in the '80s--I think we gained that 'upper-division'
credibility. We saw some of it slide away in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably one of the most satisfying feelings for the organization
is now, by winning our first postseason series and defeating the
Yankees, there's a credibility associated that you know is going to
carry into 2003."</TE>
<TE>   The key, Mead acknowledged, is what the Angels do with 2003.
Consider how the Angels have followed their first three appearances
in the playoffs:</TE>
<TE>   1980: 65-95, sixth place.</TE>
<TE>   1983: 70-92, tied for fifth.</TE>
<TE>   1987: 75-87, tied for sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious that in the short term, everybody's going to be 'the
Angel fan,' " Mead said. "You know, [Angel Manager Mike Scioscia]
always uses that term, 'perennial contender.' He believes in that. We
will convert people as we become a perennial contender."</TE>
<TE>   So this is what this Angel postseason run is about: Missionary
work.</TE>
<TE>   Guy Gruppie of Arcadia describes himself as "lifelong Dodger fan"
who never cared for the Angels, even while growing up in Yorba Linda.
"No one has been more skeptical about the Angels than me," he said.
"[Even] when they won their division in '79, '82 and '86, I was
skeptical. I didn't take a liking to the team--there was no emotional
attachment to the team, even though I grew up in Orange County.
Largely because it was a team assembled through free agency.</TE>
<TE>   "But this team is different. And I have to admit that I followed
their progress late in the year and I've come to the realization that
they're a special team. They're a team built through the farm system
the way the Dodgers used to build their success. And coupled with the
dramatic changes in the Dodgers, from players to ownership to the
[Mike] Piazza trade, and the fact that the Dodgers have had a long
period of no appearances in the postseason, I have more interest in
the Angels than I ever have.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts me to say it, but it's true: I think there's the
potential, especially if the Angels get in the World Series, that the
traditional balance of power is going to be challenged here. I think
the Dodgers need to be cognizant of that and they need to be
aggressive, even given their budget constraints, to make sure they
have a better team on the field next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Or they may find themselves in the unenviable position as the
second-class team in town."</TE>
<TE>   This is what's at stake in the weeks and months ahead. As the
Angels are just discovering, they have everything to play for.</TE>

<KH>Diane Pucin/ AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES</KH>
<HD>Romero Can Only Hope That This Fame Is Fleeting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J.C. Romero dressed carefully. He shook out the creases in each pant
leg, tucked in the black tank top. He put on his jacket slowly,
buttoned each button, seven of them, carefully. He shook his watch
out of a sock and snapped the clasps. He put on shaded glasses, even
though it was 9 p.m. and plenty dark out.</LD>
<LD>   Then Romero turned away from his locker, making a deliberate
pirouette, taking his time again. He looked up. "I guess I'm famous
now, huh?" Romero asked.</LD>
<LD>   When you are a relief pitcher and when you give up a home run in
the bottom of the eighth inning of an American League championship
series game that was tied, 1-1, in a series that was tied, 1-1, then,
yes, you are famous.</LD>
<TE>   Romero, built solid as the rock pile beyond center field at Edison
Field and nicknamed "The Rock" by his teammates because he loves the
pro wrestler by the same name, said it was simple. "I threw a pitch
and Troy hit it out. Now it's over and I've forgotten it. Same thing
tomorrow, I want to be there," Romero said.</TE>
<TE>   The pitch was hit long and hard by Troy Glaus. It was the winning
run in a 2-1 victory that put the Angels ahead, 2-1, in the
best-of-seven series.</TE>
<TE>   And it was quite a story, how Romero got to the eighth inning,
staring at Glaus, score tied after two fierce left-handed
starters--Jarrod Washburn and Eric Milton--had given batters so very
little to hit.</TE>
<TE>   Milton had left a second-inning fastball right down the middle to
Garret Anderson. "Garret doesn't miss those, especially against me,"
Milton said. Washburn didn't give up a run until the top of the
seventh, when a two-out double by Jacque Jones scored Dustan Mohr.</TE>
<TE>   So now Twin Manager Ron Gardenhire went to his bullpen in the
bottom of the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander LaTroy Hawkins started the inning. He walked Bengie
Molina. After Benji Gil sacrificed pinch-runner Chone Figgins to
second, David Eckstein had an infield single, a line drive that was
nearly caught by second basemen Luis Rivas but bounced off his glove.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher No. 2 was Johan Santana, a left-hander who came in to face
Darin Erstad. Santana did his job. Erstad, on a 2-1 pitch, slapped
the ball into the ground toward second. Figgins was thrown out at
home.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher No. 3 was right-hander Mike Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "By now," said Twin catcher A.J. Pierzynski, "it seemed like we
were changing pitchers with every batter. I was getting dizzy. But it
was working. We were getting things done. The momentum was turning
our way."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson walked Tim Salmon to load the bases with Eckstein at third
and Erstad at second. There were two outs and in came Romero.</TE>
<TE>   All season Romero has been a rock for the Twins. As the set-up
man, Romero was 9-2 with a 1.89 earned-run average in 81 games.
Right-handed batters hit .211 against Romero, left-handers .216. He'd
given up only three home runs all year and when Anderson drove a
2-and-1 pitch deep to right field, but not quite over the wall, "I
think," Milton said, "we felt like we had things changed our way."</TE>
<TE>   But the game is funny that way.</TE>
<TE>   "The eighth inning belongs to J.C.," Eddie Guardado said.
Guardado, Minnesota's closer, had spoken to Romero earlier, had
consoled his teammate and told him to just forget about what
happened. "You see how close we came to Percival in the ninth inning,
a couple of great catches or this might be different. Or one pitch
J.C. could have back, different, you know?"</TE>
<TE>   While Romero rested in the top of the eighth, the Angels' emerging
star, Francisco Rodriguez, relieved Washburn. The 20-year-old struck
out the first two batters he faced and got the third, All-Star Torii
Hunter, to fly out weakly to left.</TE>
<TE>   Romero was ready to match Rodriguez. He was tough, he was pumped,
he was eager to face Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   "I made all the moves I thought I had to to try and get through
the seventh," Gardenhire said, "and for J.C. to pitch the eighth.
J.C. gets righties, lefties out. Look at the numbers. That will tell
you. He just got a pitch up there and the guy hit a home run."</TE>
<TE>   Before he got the pitch up, Romero got behind, 3-and-1. "And the
next pitch," Pierzynski said, "wasn't that bad. It wasn't perfect. I
mean, come on, it's a big guy swinging a big bat.... It wasn't a bad
pitch. Just a little bit up."</TE>
<TE>   Said Romero: "When Glaus hit it, I didn't think it was gone. It
was. So let's go get them tomorrow, all right? We done?"</TE>
<TE>   Before Romero had come to talk, Guardado said, "This is exciting,
man. Isn't this exciting? One pitch, one swing to decide a game? Man,
that's what we're here for. So tomorrow we bounce back and make it
2-2 and I'll take J.C. in the eighth inning against Glaus again."</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire said, "I don't think we did too much wrong there,
really."</TE>
<TE>   But when in these predicaments, the Angel bullpen has stopped the
scoring. The Twin bullpen, not quite. In this series, the Angel
relievers haven't given up a run. The Twins have.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to get behind the Angels late," Gardenhire said.
"You have to do everything you can to stop them from scoring a run
because you know they've got some great pitchers. We feel the same
way about our bullpen."</TE>
<TE>   Feeling is fine. Doing is better.</TE>

<HD>Griffin Dies in Car Crash; 3 Others Hurt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defender Gray Griffin, captain of the United States under-17 national
team that took part in last year's FIFA Under-17 World Championship
in Trinidad and Tobago, was killed and three other Furman University
players were injured Friday in an early morning car crash in
Spartanburg County, S.C.</LD>
<LD>   According to highway patrol officers, Griffin, 18, was driving
southbound on Interstate 85 at about 2:50 a.m. when his sports
utility vehicle swerved to the left and overturned. The vehicle was
then struck by an oncoming tractor-trailer rig.</LD>
<LD>   Injured in the accident were Chefik Simo, who suffered a broken
pelvis and is listed in stable condition, and Josh Villalobos and
Sean Murray, who suffered less serious injuries.</LD>
<TE>   "This has been a devastating blow to our team," Furman Coach Doug
Allison told the Associated Press. "You just can't imagine something
like this would happen. It is a life gone too soon."</TE>
<TE>   Simo, 18, and Villalobos, 16, also played for the U.S. under-17
team and are part of the U.S. under-20 and under-18 national teams,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "To lose one of our own under such tragic circumstances affects
each and every one of us, and our thoughts and prayers are with each
player's family at this difficult time," Robert Contiguglia, the
president of U.S. Soccer, said Friday in a statement released by the
federation.</TE>
<TE>   Twellman Sidelined</TE>
<TE>   The New England Revolution, which needs only a tie today against
the Columbus Crew to secure a place in Major League Soccer's Oct. 20
championship game against the Galaxy in Foxboro, Mass., will be
without striker Taylor Twellman, who has sprained his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   Twellman, the top goal scorer in MLS during the regular season, is
likely to be replaced by Alex Pineda Chacon, last year's MLS
league-leading scorer.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnia Ties Germany</TE>
<TE>   German nerves, calmed somewhat by the country's second-place
finish at the World Cup, were set jangling again Friday when Coach
Rudi Voeller's team was held to a 1-1 tie by Bosnia in Sarajevo.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnia held the lead for more than half an hour, with Elvir Baljic
scoring in the 21st minute after German defender Carsten Ramelow had
failed to clear the ball properly. Another miscue by Germany came 14
minutes later when Torsten Frings fired a penalty kick over the
crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnia's Hasan Salihamdidzic and Germany's Christian Woerns were
ejected four minutes into the second half, after which the Germans
picked up the pace and finally tied the score on Carsten Jancker's
goal in the 56th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Gold for North Korea</TE>
<TE>   North Korea won the gold medal at the Asian Games women's
tournament Friday when it shut out Vietnam, 4-0, with Jin Pyol Hui
scoring twice in the first half in Busan, South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "We are delighted with the gold medal," said Coach Ri Song Gun.
"It is our first since 1990. We are grateful for the support we have
had from the South Koreans."</TE>
<TE>   China, the tournament favorite, was sidetracked early by a 0-0 tie
with North Korea and a 2-2 tie with Japan. It won the silver medal
instead after beating South Korea, 4-0, Friday. Japan took the bronze
with a 2-0 victory over Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   Liverpool on the Move</TE>
<TE>   Liverpool, the English Premier League team that has called Anfield
its home since 1892, will move to a new stadium nearby in time for
the 2005-2006 season, Rick Parry, the club's chief executive, said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Gorosito Named Coach</TE>
<TE>   Former Argentina national team midfielder Nestor Gorosito, 38, has
been named coach of Nueva Chicago, struggling in 18th place in the
Argentine league. He replaced Francisco Ferraro, who resigned two
weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Libyan Soccer Fan</TE>
<TE>   Al Saadi Kadafi, son of Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi, Friday
agreed to buy a one-third share of the Italian second-division team
Triestina for $4 million.</TE>

<KH>TWIN NOTES/ AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES</KH>
<HD>Radke Kept Contract, Ignored Contraction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid; Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Radke considered leaving before the ax fell.</LD>
<LD>   With the Twins on Bud Selig's list for elimination last winter,
Radke could have exercised an escape clause in his four-year,
$36-million contract, forfeiting the last three years of the deal and
becoming a free agent.</LD>
<LD>   The move was tempting because of the turmoil, but Radke stayed and
hoped for the best. The right-hander, scheduled to start Game 4 of
the American League championship series today at Edison Field, said
things couldn't have worked out better.</LD>
<TE>   "There was a point that I thought about it, but as it turned out,
I'm glad I stayed," Radke said. "Just the way these guys, the younger
guys on the team now, have grown up and become quality major league
players.</TE>
<TE>   "The way everything has come together has been great for the whole
organization. This is really what you hope for."</TE>
<TE>   Radke, on the disabled list twice this season because of a groin
injury, was 9-5 with a 4.72 earned-run average in 21 starts, the
fewest in his eight-year career. After pitching at least 213 innings
the previous six seasons, Radke said he's benefiting from the reduced
workload.</TE>
<TE>   "I've thrown a lot of innings in the past, and in September I
usually get pretty tired," he said. "This year I feel pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Radke was 2-0 with a 1.54 ERA in Minnesota's AL division series
victory over the Oakland Athletics. He has dominated the Angels,
going 11-4 with a 1.72 ERA overall, and 6-1 with a 1.38 ERA at Edison
Field. Angel right fielder Tim Salmon is batting .217 (10 for 46)
with a homer and 13 strikeouts against Radke.</TE>
<TE>   For those reasons and others, Manager Ron Gardenhire is pleased
Radke stayed with the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   "What Brad wanted was for this organization to be competitive
again," Gardenhire said. "He saw that we were going about it the
right way, getting some great young players, putting them together,
making some nice trades, picking up some people.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, I was concerned he might think about leaving, but I really
didn't think Brad wanted to go anywhere. He loves Minnesota. He just
wants to win, like everyone else. Now that we're doing that, he's
pretty happy."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Reid</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As Kirby Puckett stood behind the batting cage in Edison Field,
watching the Twins hit before Friday night's game, his mind wandered
back to May 8, 1984, when he made his major league debut in what was
then known as Anaheim Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Puckett had four hits, scored three runs and stole two bases
against the Angels that night, the start of a Hall of Fame career in
which he led the Twins to World Series championships in 1987 and
1991. The day might not have turned out so well, though, had Puckett
not run into a trusting cabdriver at Los Angeles International
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   After an all-day flight from Maine, Puckett arrived at the airport
and found no Twins' representative there to greet him or drive him to
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an $85 fare to Anaheim, and I didn't have the money to pay
for it," said Puckett, who made more than $43 million in his career.
"But the cabbie saw all my bats and equipment and knew I played
baseball, so he still took me. When I got to the stadium, our
traveling secretary [Mike Robertson] came out and paid for it."</TE>
<TE>   It was money well spent. Puckett hit .318 with 207 home runs, 414
doubles and 1,085 runs batted in during his 12-year career with the
Twins and is now the team's executive vice president.</TE>

<HD>Twins Preaching Patience at the Plate</HD>
<DH>Minnesota: They shake off suggestion that left-handers are
a problem, but they are rethinking their approach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Twins aren't hitting much in the American League
championship series, struggling against the Angels and searching for
answers.</LD>
<LD>   The Twins continued to accentuate the positive after their
situation got worse Friday night in a 2-1 loss in Game 3 before
44,234 red-clad fans at Edison Field, focusing on a few things they
did well in another frustrating performance.</LD>
<LD>   Inspirational speeches, though, won't help the Twins against an
Angel pitching staff that's setting the tone and feeling comfortable
at home. The Twins are getting restless, and it may be time to put
everything under review.</LD>
<TE>   "Sometimes you can hit and do your job, and sometimes you can't,
but we have to start doing better [at the plate]," second baseman
Luis Rivas said. "They're pitching great, they've got good pitchers,
and we're just not getting hits at the right time.</TE>
<TE>   "We're an aggressive team, and we're always going to keep
swinging. But maybe we need to be a little more patient at home
plate. Maybe we need to try to get some more walks. We just have to
try to hit good pitches."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels aren't making it easy.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins are batting .212 in the series after going six for 35 in
Game 3, getting their hits and run against left-handed starter Jarrod
Washburn. Setup man Francisco Rodriguez and closer Troy Percival were
perfect in the eighth and ninth, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a great bullpen to go with their starters, so there's
not really one guy you want to see come in," right fielder Dustan
Mohr said. "We're trying to get that big hit, but they're good. Their
people made pitches and plays when we had opportunities to score.
That's what's happening."</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Angels' success is surprising.</TE>
<TE>   The staff had the league's second-lowest earned-run average,
finishing a hundredth of a point behind the Oakland Athletics. The
Twins figured they knew what they would be facing, but the
competition has been even better than expected.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just real good," center fielder Torii Hunter. "Washburn
doesn't give you too many pitches to hit, and then that bullpen comes
in. The young kid [Rodriguez] has got some really good stuff, which
we've all seen, then Percival comes in. He's pretty much lights out
against us; they're just all doing a good job.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to get just one hit to get a guy into scoring position.
We really needed to do that, but we didn't. But our pitchers are also
doing a good job."</TE>
<TE>   Angel hitters are having problems too, batting only .227 through
the first three games. However, the Angels are leading, 2-1, in the
best-of-seven series, easing their frustration with victory.</TE>
<TE>   That's what the Twins need now, Minnesota Manager Ron Gardenhire
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, you'd like to break out and score, but they didn't do that
either," the first-year manager said. "Neither team is busting out.
In all honesty, when you're facing great pitching, it's really hard
to have break-out innings."</TE>
<TE>   Especially when the Twins are facing a left-hander.</TE>
<TE>   They were 23-29 against left-handers during the regular season,
batting 30 points lower (.252 to .282) than against right-handers.
Beginning play Friday, the Minnesota starting lineup was 18 for 91
(.198) with 19 strikeouts against Washburn. The Twins scoff at
speculation that they're intimidated by left-handers, but the
statistics indicate there's a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, maybe we got it into the back of our heads that there was a
lefty out there tonight, and you know the story about us hitting
lefties," closer Eddie Guardado said. "We're also a really aggressive
team. You're going to swing at pitches that are out of the strike
zone when you're aggressive. You're going to swing at pitchers'
pitches, which is what we do.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just got to relax a little bit more. We were just too
anxious. When pitchers give you pitches to hit you've got to hit
them, so we've got to start relaxing a little bit right now. We still
have time, but we're down, so we've got to just relax and hit like we
know we can."</TE>
<TE>   If only the Angels would cooperate.</TE>

<TE>   WHEN UCLA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Bruin freshman Tyler Ebell ran for 203 yards in three quarters
last week and earned his first start. But under defensive coordinator
Nick Aliotti, Oregon makes shutting down the run a priority. So Bruin
quarterback Cory Paus must prove early that he can connect with
receivers being covered man-to-man and force the Ducks to back off
the line of scrimmage. Paus, a senior coming off a career-best game,
has a history of playing well against Oregon and should have success
against the undersized, inexperienced Duck secondary. A successful
passing game should open up running room for Ebell.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN OREGON HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks will take a tip from Colorado, which beat UCLA by
pounding off tackle. Onterrio Smith is considered the best running
back in the Pac-10 and has rushed for more than 100 yards in every
game this season. He will take plenty of shots at a defense that is
missing tackle Rodney Leisle because of injury. Also, end Dave Ball
must sit out the first half because he was ejected for fighting last
week. Oregon can pass too. Quarterback Jason Fife has 10 touchdown
passes and only one interception. Defenses have been successful
focusing on dangerous receiver Keenan Howry. Samie Parker has
benefited from the attention on Howry, leading the Ducks with 22
catches and four touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO UCLA VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   The depleted Bruin defensive line must contain Duck tailback
Onterrio Smith, who is averaging 4.7 yards a carry.</TE>
<TE>   2. Quarterback Cory Paus must not aggravate his bruised right
shoulder and must exploit inexperienced Duck cornerbacks by hitting
Craig Bragg and Tab Perry deep.</TE>
<TE>   3. If history holds, the outcome will be determined in the fourth
quarter. The Bruins must make plays down the stretch.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Keenan Howry appeared to be a cinch to break every Oregon receiving
record.</LD>
<LD>   Then the season started.</LD>
<LD>   The senior from Los Alamitos was hampered early by a hamstring
injury and has caught only 12 passes for 174 yards and a touchdown, a
far cry from the last two years, when he averaged 52 catches, 731
yards and seven touchdowns.</LD>
<TE>   Samie Parker is the Ducks' leading receiver with 22 catches and
four touchdowns. Even tight end George Wrighster has more catches,
14, than Howry, who until this week was publicized on a Manhattan
billboard.</TE>
<TE>   "Howry doesn't look like he's playing as hard as he used to play,"
Bruin cornerback Ricky Manning said. "I don't know why, that's just
what I saw on film. Maybe he's used to being the man. It's his senior
year and he's not producing. But he'll be ready against us."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA has held Howry to fewer than 50 yards receiving each of the
last two years. As a freshman, however, he caught six passes for 123
yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "We know he's a good player," UCLA Coach Bob Toledo said. "He'll
have his opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toledo was criticized for going for it twice on fourth down last
week against Oregon State. UCLA failed both times, once near the goal
line in the second quarter while trying to overcome a deficit and
once at midfield while protecting a lead in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Ducks, opponents are 0 for 10 on fourth downs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Cory Paus moved into second place in all-time UCLA
passing yardage and probably will vault into second on the
completions list today, behind Cade McNown in both categories. Many
players downplay records, but the oft-maligned Paus is gratified.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels nice to be mentioned in that company," he said. "As long
as the next kid doesn't come in and pass me up like it's not a big
deal, I'll be there for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "For having an up-and-down career, it feels good that some
positive things came out of it. If I was [horrible], I wouldn't be on
those lists."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The nine 2001 inductees to the UCLA Hall of Fame will be
introduced at halftime. The inductees are Denny Cline (volleyball),
Bob Day (track), Cobi Jones (soccer), Shane Mack (baseball), Don
MacLean (basketball), Ted Narleski (football), Anita Ortega
(basketball), Duffy Waldorf (golf) and Russell Webb (swimming)....
The first 10,000 fans wearing blue will receive a UCLA baseball cap.</TE>

<TE>   WHEN USC HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Is this the game the Trojans finally throw deep? Quarterback
Carson Palmer passed 50 times last week, the majority short routes.
Wide receiver Kareem Kelly got back into the swing with a team-best
eight receptions, but totaled only 66 yards. Sultan McCullough will
start at tailback and Malaefou MacKenzie, who has been the Trojans'
best catch-and-run receiver, will play some at fullback. Linebacker
Marcus Daniels and end Tully Banta-Cain lead a Cal defense that
features a fast and physical secondary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN CALIFORNIA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jeff Tedford installed the same offense he ran as
coordinator at Oregon, and quarterback Kyle Boller is reaping the
benefit. Running back Joe Igber has gained 537 yards and is averaging
4.4 yards a carry. Geoff McArthur, who played at Palisades High, has
a team-best 30 receptions for 359 yards. Cal has scored 25 of 26
times it has been inside the 20. A high ankle sprain might keep USC
safety Troy Polamalu out of the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO USC VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Control Kyle Boller. After getting beat up the last three
seasons, Cal's senior quarterback bulked up and is thriving in Jeff
Tedford's offense. Boller, who played at Newhall Hart High, has
passed for 1,478 yards and 16 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   2. Establish a running game. Sultan McCullough rushed for 38 yards
in the Trojans' first scoring drive last week against Washington
State before USC all but abandoned its rushing attack.</TE>
<TE>   3. Convert extra-point and field-goal attempts. USC's Ryan Killeen
missed 47- and 52-yard field-goal attempts and a critical extra point
last week, a day after Trojan coaches switched holders. Killeen
worked with Tom Malone all week and kicked reliably in practice.</TE>
<TE>   4. Avoid penalties. USC was penalized a season-high 10 times for a
season-high 103 yards against Washington State.</TE>

<LD>Quarterback Kyle Boller left for Northern California after a
brilliant career at Newhall Hart High.</LD>
<LD>   After three frustrating seasons, he returns today as the key
performer for the Golden Bears and is improving his professional
stock each week.</LD>
<LD>   Boller, 6 feet 4 and 225 pounds, has passed for 1,478 yards and 16
touchdowns with four interceptions. Last week, he passed for five
touchdowns and averaged 20.5 yards per completion in California's
34-27 victory over then-No. 12 Washington, the Golden Bears' first
victory in their last 20 games against the Huskies.</LD>
<TE>   "It was the best game I've experienced in my college career," said
Boller, who has thrown 52 touchdown passes, two behind all-time Cal
leader Pat Barnes.</TE>
<TE>   Boller credits new Coach Jeff Tedford for improving his mechanics
and supplying him with an effective offensive system. He also
appreciates an offensive line that has given up only seven sacks.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of things [Tedford] pointed out, I never really noticed,"
Boller said. "I got into a lot of bad habits getting hit as many
times as I got hit the last three years."</TE>
<TE>   Boller, a freshman when he became the Golden Bears' starter in the
1999 Pacific 10 Conference opener, said he would redshirt his first
season if he could do it over again.</TE>
<TE>   "You probably should redshirt, not only football-wise but because
of school, being away from home, those kinds of things," Boller said.
"When you're a freshman quarterback, everything is on your shoulders.
It's tough being a freshman quarterback in the Pac-10."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former All-Pro cornerback Willie Buchanon was looking forward to
sitting in Coliseum seats located in the upper rows behind the end
zone and watching his son, William, start again at left cornerback
for USC.</TE>
<TE>   "I like sitting up there because I can see everything developing,"
Buchanon said.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon, however, has another engagement today.</TE>
<TE>   The former All-American at San Diego State will have his jersey
retired tonight during the Aztecs' game against Utah.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great honor for him," William said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC leads Cal, 55-29-5, in the series, which dates to 1915.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Bears, however, have won four of the last five games.</TE>
<TE>   USC won last year, 55-14, the largest margin of victory by the
Trojans since a 62-7 victory over Hawaii in 1999.</TE>
