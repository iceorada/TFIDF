<HD>Legal Woes in Aftermath of Beatle's Death</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>George Harrison's widow, Olivia Arias Harrison, has filed a civil
suit against her former brother-in-law, Carl Roles, and his current
wife, Carol, for allegedly stealing Harrison memorabilia and
attempting to sell it the day after the former Beatle's death.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge issued a temporary
restraining order to prevent Roles from selling the property.</LD>
<LD>   According to the suit, Roles called an unnamed reporter in Arizona
on Nov. 30, trying to hawk 10 boxes of photographs (including one
featuring Harrison with former President Gerald Ford), records and
clothing that he had taken from a house that Harrison owned in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Roles allegedly told the reporter that "there was a lot of money
to be made from memorabilia related to George Harrison, given his
recent death."</TE>
<TE>   But the reporter told Gavin de Becker, a security expert who works
for Harrison's estate. He, in turn, notified the FBI. An undercover
agent, posing as a memorabilia collector, met with the Roleses, while
de Becker watched from another room.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Roles admitted during the meeting that he had taken the boxes
of items, one of which was labeled "GH $tuff," but he and his wife
refused to return the belongings to Harrison's family, according to
the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Roles had access to the items when he was married to Olivia
Harrison's sister, Linda Arias. The couple, who later divorced, lived
rent-free at the property owned by the Harrisons on the condition
they would take care of it.</TE>
<TE>   The house was destroyed by a mudslide around 1980. Roles said he
had taken the belongings at that time, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Chapman, an attorney for the executors of Harrison's
estate, said the value of the memorabilia is unknown because  "we
don't know everything he has. We've only seen a very little bit of
it. He tells us that he has a least 10 boxes' worth."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Harrisons said that the family is "extremely
pleased" with the restraining order and that it wishes "to do
everything they can to preserve Harrison's property and his memory."</TE>
<TE>   The Roleses could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, which seeks damages and a permanent injunction, is
scheduled for court early next month.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Is Back</TE>
<TE>   Just when you thought Monica Lewinsky had lost interest in the
media (after all, she is a successful purse designer), she takes the
podium this afternoon at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Pasadena before a
roomful of TV critics and reporters to discuss the making of a new
HBO documentary on (what else?) her White House experience. "Monica
in Black and White," which debuts March 3 on HBO, was taped live at
Cooper Union in New York City and features audience questions along
with news footage. The film's producer/director team, Randy Barbato
and Fenton Bailey, is also known for documentaries on Tammy Faye
Bakker ("The Eyes of Tammy Faye"), male hustlers in Los Angeles ("101
Rent Boys"), the porn industry ("Pornography: The Secret History of
Civilization") and Ellen DeGeneres ("The Real Ellen Story").</TE>
<TE>   The former White House intern, whose affair with former President
Bill Clinton made her a household name, is set to talk to the TV
Critics Assn. at the group's semiannual gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani also is scheduled to appear to
discuss an upcoming HBO documentary, ''In Memoriam: September 11,
2001, New York City."</TE>
<TE>   Trouble Backstage</TE>
<TE>   Things got dicey backstage at the Muhammad Ali 60th Birthday
Celebration at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood on Saturday between
"Ali" co-star Jamie Foxx and Mariah Carey's older brother Morgan.
According to our spies, just moments before Carey was scheduled to
perform "Happy Birthday" onstage for Ali, Foxx, who was commenting
about his performance notes, used the word "breakdown," prompting
laughter from people nearby. (Last summer, Carey was hospitalized
after suffering an emotional and physical breakdown.) Morgan
overheard the laughter and told Foxx: "That's not funny." Then Morgan
and Foxx started cursing each other. Security separated them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm back from college for winter break, and as if that's not
punishment enough, my dad asks me to write his dopey column for him
again while he goes off to the auto show.</LD>
<LD>   "Lazy people need days off, too," he tells me.</LD>
<LD>   "What do I get paid?" I ask.</LD>
<TE>   "Breakfast, lunch and tuition," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, he goes off to the auto show like this with his friend
Paul. My dad says that Paul's heart has four doors and a sunroof and
that if he doesn't go to the auto show, winter settles into Paul's
heart like a heavy snow.</TE>
<TE>   "And the new Z is out," his friend Paul says.</TE>
<TE>   "And the Mini Cooper, too," says my dad.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's she?" says my mom.</TE>
<TE>   "See ya," says my dad, and off to the auto show they go.</TE>
<TE>   It's always the same with them. They go off to the auto show, Dad
and Paul, sort of quiet and stuff because the Christmas bills are
coming in, and they have no money or any hopes of ever having money.</TE>
<TE>   At the auto show, they sit in every single car they can find, even
the American ones. Pontiacs and stuff. I swear. Buicks even.</TE>
<TE>   "It's excellent exercise," he tells my mom later.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, right," says my mom.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the thing I've discovered about men. In college, they do as
little as possible. Then they joke about it. Then they get older, and
they still do as little as possible. Then they joke about it. It's
like a pattern with men.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom, someday can we discuss men?" I asked her one night, and she
laughed for like an hour, then poured herself like this humongous
glass of Chardonnay.</TE>
<TE>   "What would you like to know, honey?" she finally asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the basics," I said, and she laughed for an hour more.</TE>
<TE>   Then a couple of nights later, I asked my dad about men. We were
up watching Letterman, and I just flat-out asked him.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Dad," I asked. "What's with men anyway?" Like that.</TE>
<TE>   And he says "You really want to know?"</TE>
<TE>   And I say, "Sure. Knowledge is power, after all."</TE>
<TE>   So he goes into this long, ridiculous explanation about men being
really complex creatures with huge appetites and how they constantly
evolve and stuff, which is why women have such a hard time
understanding men, on account of they are constantly evolving.</TE>
<TE>   "With men, you can tell our age by our addictions," he explained.
"Plus we belch a lot."</TE>
<TE>   "Know what, Dad?" I said when he was done.</TE>
<TE>   'What?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I really understand men now," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrific," he said, then fell asleep on the couch.</TE>
<TE>   It's been really great being back from college. My little sister
runs around all day singing Enrique Iglesias songs and e-mailing
Mickey Mouse.</TE>
<TE>   My brother, I don't know where he came from, maybe Mars or
someplace in Nevada. He's into snowboarding now. Mars must have lots
of mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Mom and Dad. Oh, my God. There was this one day, I
think it was Christmas, where my dad comes jabbering into the
kitchen, going on and on to my mom about some touchdown he just saw
on TV, real excited as if it'd never happened before.</TE>
<TE>   My Dad: "Yada yada yada! Yada yada yada! Blah blah blah!"</TE>
<TE>   My Mom: "Um, don't you think ... "</TE>
<TE>   My Dad: (interrupting) "Yada yada yada! Yada yada! Yada ... "</TE>
<TE>   My Mom: "Will you just shut up for one second! Just for one lousy
second!"</TE>
<TE>   That was Christmas Day. She told him to shut up for one lousy
second.</TE>
<TE>   I think it's great how they can work out their disagreements right
away like that.</TE>
<TE>   Mom explained that if Dad comes blabbering into the kitchen like
Red Buttons then he deserves what he gets, even if it is a major
holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "Sweetheart, someday you'll understand," she told me.</TE>
<TE>   I think the reason men and women sometimes don't get along is that
when men are ready to communicate, women are always on the phone. And
when women are ready to communicate, men are always watching some
ballgame. It's like international relations, only you live together.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll bet Donna Reed never told Jimmy Stewart to shut up," my dad
mumbled as he went back to his game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll bet she did," said my mom.</TE>
<TE>   Since I've been back, it's been really crazy around here. I mean,
I live in a dorm, so I'm used to crazy people. But not this many.</TE>
<TE>   Dad keeps telling Mom that if the Chicago Bears make it to the
Super Bowl, he and my brother are going to New Orleans no matter
what, even though we have no money or any real prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll rely on the kindness of strangers," he tells my brother.
"And cheap bar food."</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go to New Orleans, too," my little sister says.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the spirit," says my dad, and then he teaches her the
Super Bowl Shuffle, which apparently was some popular dance back in
1792.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, my God.</TE>
<TE>   Last night, I helped my mom with the dishes. She only had to ask
me twice, which is like a record in our family.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom," I asked, "do they get better with age?"</TE>
<TE>   "Who?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Men," I said.</TE>
<TE>   She laughed for like an hour.</TE>

<LD>Elvis had one; so did Babe Ruth and Pablo Picasso. In 1940, Frank
Lloyd Wright redesigned his daughter's and had it painted his
signature color,  Taliesin red. In the early 1980s, special editions
were created for Gucci, Cartier and Givenchy. James Bond preferred
them, as did many U.S. presidents. In fact, the most famous model may
be the 1961 open-top that had been specially designed for John and
Jackie Kennedy; they liked it so much they took it to Dallas on that
fateful day in 1963.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Lincoln Continental has met its demise. Among the many
cutbacks recently announced by the Ford Motor Co. was the
discontinuation of several models, including the Continental. For
more than 10 years it has struggled to regain a foothold in a luxury
market ruled by Mercedes, BMW and Lexus, where its once-formidable
dimensions have been dwarfed by ever-inflating SUVs and tricked-out
pickup trucks.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, it has remained an icon, the automotive symbol of a
certain kind of sedate luxury. Less flashy than the Cadillac, it
served as shorthand for the announcement of life attainment--of
business success or social elevation, of a settling into a life of
tennis clubs and golf vacations, of winters in Miami Beach or Palm
Springs, of cigars and fedoras and Harry Winston and charge accounts
at Saks.</LD>
<TE>   During the '60s and '70s, it was considered glamorous, the ride of
rock stars and movie directors; even in the early '80s it had a
certain cachet. But even as other objects of desire became less
traditional and more youthful, the Continental found itself the
vehicular equivalent of a Lifetime Achievement Award, the car of
choice for men and women of a certain age,</TE>
<TE>   And that's exactly why it's being retired.</TE>
<TE>   Because Americans no longer accept age, much less the concept of a
certain one. We want to write our autobiographies at age 27, cash out
our stocks at 35 and want our Lifetime Achievement Awards by 40,
thank you very much. The baby boomers have graciously decided that 50
is the new 40, which makes 60 the new 50, and if 50 is really 40
well, there's really no mathematical possibility of getting older in
the traditional sense of the term. There is only the early 40s and,
one assumes, death.</TE>
<TE>   In this new ageless American landscape there is simply No Parking
for old folks' cars. And that is what the Lincoln Continental has
become. One sees them pulling up to the valet at Lawrys or Dan
Tana's, nosing around the lot at the Tam O' Shanter, full of the last
generation to believe in beauty parlors, Thousand Island dressing and
the reality of being old.</TE>
<TE>   We want none of that. We want a car that says we're rich and young
and ambitious and sexy, adventuresome and stable and unique even if
we're, say, only two of those things--even if we are, say, none of
those things.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, the Continental did not lose ground for what might
be considered sensible reasons--its size, its appetite, its general
unwieldiness.</TE>
<TE>   No, no, Americans are just fine with elephantine gas-guzzlers; we
just want them to look as if we're heading out to the Sierra or
recently arrived from the veld. The curse was its image. No one
drives a Lincoln Continental on the veld.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Ford tried to streamline the Lincoln in the hopes of
making it appear more youthful, more fun, but so many mid-size cars
have gone luxe, there was no place for a trimmed-down version. And
you can't really mess with an icon.</TE>
<TE>   The car was designed in 1938 at the behest of Edsel Ford, who
wanted something swell and "continental"-looking to drive when he
went to Florida for winter holidays, something befitting the head of
a fast-growing, innovative company, something the neighbors would
stare at and secretly covet. He got what he wanted, and for 60 years,
it has remained just that. For all the tinkering and futzing, the
Lincoln Continental hasn't changed all that much.</TE>
<TE>   But we have.</TE>

<HD>With Shift to L.A., Feminist Majority Builds on Momentum</HD>
<DH>Organization looks ahead to greater influence on public
attitudes and national policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The leaders of the Feminist Majority Foundation have decided to stop
fudging the issue of the new address in their future. The building
that will house the foundation and its newly acquired Ms. magazine is
on Beverly Boulevard between Olympic and Pico boulevards, and there's
just no West L.A. about it.</LD>
<LD>   "We've decided to say it loud and proud," says foundation board
Chairwoman Peg Yorkin. "We're moving to Beverly Hills."</LD>
<LD>   At first glance, Beverly Hills seems an unlikely spot for a
building that one foundation official calls "a new international
center of feminist research and activism." Beverly Hills is known for
many things, but being a hotbed of the women's movement is not one of
them. Yet in a way, in a very Angeleno way, it is quite fitting.
Beverly Hills remains an address that symbolizes success, social
validation. And in the past year or so the Feminist Majority has
experienced both.</LD>
<TE>   For 15 years, the group has labored successfully in many
areas--protecting abortion clinics from potentially violent
protesters, increasing the number of women in elected office and law
enforcement, and reaching out to university students. But two of
their highest-profile campaigns have been for the legalization of
mifepristone, the pharmaceutical abortion alternative known as
RU-486, and ending the atrocious treatment of Afghan women by the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two years ago, the FDA approved mifepristone. And in
recent months, the specter of the shrouded and silent Afghan women
has become a symbol of the inhumanity of our newest enemy. The
foundation played a key role in persuading the Clinton administration
to refuse to recognize the Taliban as an official government, but
their efforts to increase political pressure and provide humanitarian
aid were, for the most part, ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Then the World Trade Center fell and suddenly, after seven years
of trying to make the government and the country aware of the dangers
the situation in Afghanistan posed, foundation President  Eleanor
Smeal suddenly found herself a sought-after expert, explaining the
history and policies of the Taliban to everyone from local
newscasters to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.</TE>
<TE>   In subsequent weeks, as the Justice Department struggled to
contain the anthrax crisis, the government once again sought the
foundation's advice. For years, abortion clinics and Planned
Parenthood centers had been receiving threatening letters containing
white powder.  They had developed emergency plans and protocol, which
they now offered the government officials.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, in a November news conference, declared
such clinic attacks "domestic terrorism." Since then, the FBI has
also begun referring to assaults and threats against abortion clinics
as domestic terrorism; the secretary of state has said women's rights
are a human rights issue and even President Bush decried both the
treatment of Afghan women and terrorist attacks against abortion
clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Then, at the end of last year, the foundation announced that not
only had it acquired the 30-year-old Ms., but that it was moving the
magazine from New York to Los Angeles. With the magazine comes Gloria
Steinem. By gaining her, the foundation--and Los Angeles--now have
two of the movement's biggest players. Smeal is widely recognized as
its most dynamic and effective lobbyist, and Steinem remains its most
familiar and respected leader.</TE>
<TE>   Popular culture has also mirrored the group's increasing
visibility. "The Shroud of Silence," a documentary about Afghanistan
partially funded by the foundation, began appearing on television in
past months; films and plays dealing with life under the Taliban soon
followed. On NBC's "The West Wing," feminists ruled for a whole
episode in which press secretary C.J. Cregg argued--with speeches
that could have been written by Smeal--against the funding of a
military base in a country that oppresses women. Perhaps not since
the Supreme Court upheld Roe vs. Wade in 1973 has the women's
movement had such a presence and impact on American policy.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've ever affected foreign policy before," said
Yorkin. "But if we had not prevented the U.S. from recognizing the
Taliban, think of how much worse this all would be."</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the Feminist Majority is a Washington-based
organization, and the staff in the D.C. office is twice as big--28 to
L.A.'s 12--but the L.A. office has been much higher-profile, mainly
because the foundation has learned how to work the town. When early
efforts to draw attention to the plight of Afghan women foundered,
Yorkin and foundation Executive Vice President Katherine Spillar
convinced then-board member Mavis Leno to spearhead the campaign.
With an initial million-dollar donation, and occasional guest
appearances by husband Jay, Leno got more attention for the cause in
a few months than the organization had gotten in years.</TE>
<TE>   "We have learned the power of the entertainment media," said
Spillar. "They will cover things mainstream papers might not, and
they reach so many more people."</TE>
<TE>   No one understands this better than Yorkin, a former movie and
theater producer, who has long put her money where her mouth is.
During the '80s, she tried, with mixed results, to establish a
mid-sized theatrical community in the city where work by women might
have an easier time getting produced. When she met Smeal in 1987, she
turned her attention to politics.</TE>
<TE>   Five years after co-founding what was then called the Fund for the
Feminist Majority, she gave the group $10 million, much of it
earmarked to push mifepristone. It remains the largest single
donation to a feminist organization.</TE>
<TE>   It was Yorkin and Spillar who convinced the Beltway-oriented Smeal
that there had to be an L.A. office for the new group, and one with
teeth. Too many politicos, Yorkin said, "think of California as the
ultimate gold coast--a base for fund-raising and that's it."</TE>
<TE>   "Peg was adamant," Smeal said. "She said we can't just fund-raise,
we have to have programs."</TE>
<TE>   It made as much systemic sense as it did geographic. Smeal, a
former president of the National Organization for Women, wanted to
create an organization that was light on its feet, that would attach
itself to a broad range of women's concerns and had the ability to
shift its attentions as women's needs shifted.</TE>
<TE>   "Women's groups have become more specialized around issues and
geography," said Steinem. "One of the reasons we thought [the
magazine and the foundation] was such a perfect fit is that both the
group and the magazine are more oriented to the news, to what needs
to be done now."</TE>
<TE>   According to longtime activist Robin Morgan, the Feminist Majority
has been able to successfully do what many other women's
organizations have not: capture the interest of young women while not
losing support from the baby boomers. The biggest strength of the
group, she said, is its grass-roots activism and its broad-based
goals. "We need NOW to be what it is," she said, "but we also need a
fluid, dynamic organization with political sophistication."</TE>
<TE>   But that fluidity can sometimes work against social movements,
which often coalesce with a specific goal and then disperse when that
goal is met or defeated. By moving from renter to property owner, the
foundation hopes to claim some ground permanently, which many think
should be one of the goals of the post-millennial movement.</TE>
<TE>   It's also important, Morgan said, for organizations like the
Feminist Majority Foundation to acknowledge their influence, to
remind people that, as with the situation in Afghanistan, they were
right in their condemnations.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to get them classified as terrorists for years," said
Smeal of the Taliban. "We kept saying you cannot have this kind of
social instability without international repercussions. They targeted
these women because they were Westernized as much as because they
were women."</TE>
<TE>   People need to be aware of that, said Morgan. "If women are
canaries in the coal mine then it would be nice if we listened to
them once in a while," she said. "And we need to learn to claim our
victories. There's still an idea that 'nice women don't brag.' But
too often the substance of a win gets separated from who initiated
it. We need to say: 'We did this, and here's what we're going to do
next.'"</TE>
<TE>   Yorkin and Spillar too are enjoying their new street cred, even
though they realize the public attention span is short, and
politicians' attention spans even shorter.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping that it will bolster recognition of the need for
women's rights internationally," said Spillar. "And that people will
realize that feminism is everywhere. Despite a concerted effort by
some to denigrate and discredit it, it's very widespread."</TE>
<TE>   The two women were sitting in the conference room of the West
Coast office. On the wall just behind them hang sketches for the
remodeling of the new building, which is underway. It looks quite
modern, in the way sketches do, and much more spacious than their
current quarters. In addition to the magazine offices, there will be
room for an extensive library and archives from the women's movement;
a large auditorium that will be used for a new visiting scholars
program and lecture series; a training center for the group's campus
and law enforcement programs; and room for general feminist assembly.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the specifics of the move, the women's faces fall
into the pre-emptive weariness that the image of boxes and moving
vans tend to conjure.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be there by June," said Yorkin. "Don't know how, but we
will."</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a very busy time," said Spillar, "but there's a lot
more to do."</TE>
<TE>   Ask them what exactly and they'll tell you, in a concise way that
is taught by years of having a lot to say and never enough time to
say it: campaign finance reform that would allow candidates to draw a
salary while running for office using PAC money.</TE>
<TE>   "Most men who run are personally funded somehow," said Spillar.
"Their law firm or corporation continues to pay them because they
bring in publicity. But women are often teachers or activists and so
they have to quit their jobs to run. So they don't run." They would
also like to establish a 50/50 law, by which half of all elected
bodies would have to be women. "They have that in India," said
Yorkin. "India, for heaven's sake."</TE>
<TE>   But first, they intend to continue to push for aid to women living
in Afghanistan and the Pakistan refugee camps. "The words are there,
but the money isn't yet," said Smeal. "We need to make a commitment
to a democratic government [there]--I keep hearing the term 'warlord'
and I don't know what this means. It's a term from the 15th century.
These women are still poor and uneducated and most of them haven't
taken off the burka. They are terrorized. They do not trust what is
going to happen next."</TE>
<TE>   They also plan to keep reminding the U.S. government that
Afghanistan is not the only country in which women are oppressed in
the name of religion--Saudi Arabian women, for instance, suffer from
the same sort of restrictions. "We need to develop a feminist foreign
policy," said Smeal. "That's something we'll be working on in the
near future. A comprehensive foreign policy."</TE>
<TE>   The most important thing the women hope to do now, with their 15
minutes of fame, with the new building and the new magazine, with the
enduring commitment and goals, is to show the world once and for all
that the equal treatment of women is essential for any modern
society.</TE>
<TE>   "Women are not a side issue," said Smeal. "And most of what we
tend to call 'soft' issues--education, health care, environmental
concerns--are really the hard issues. They are what civilization is
based on. And we cannot have women living in the 15th or the 17th
century while the rest of the world moves into the 21st. Societies
that attempt to do this are not 'conservative,' they are abusive and
destructive. We need to know that. And fight it wherever we see it."</TE>

<LD>Did you know that horses, donkeys and zebras all come from the same
family of animals called "equines"? They share many of the same
characteristics, including diet, manes and an odd number of toes on
each hoof. See what else you know by answering true or false to the
following statements.</LD>
<LD>   Equine Pop Quiz</LD>
<LD>   1. Zebras can be found in the wild in most parts of the world.</LD>
<TE>   2. When you shave the hair off a zebra, it still has black and
white stripes.</TE>
<TE>   3. The hoofs on equines are made of bone.</TE>
<TE>   4. Donkeys do not travel as fast as horses and zebras.</TE>
<TE>   5. Horses have poor vision.</TE>
<TE>   Answers: 1. False. Zebras are native to Africa. 2. False. The skin
of a zebra is completely black. Its stripes come from its black and
white hair. 3. False. The hoofs on horses, donkeys and zebras are
actually keratin, the same thing that your hair and nails are made
of. 4. True. Donkeys are stockier and smaller than other equines. 5.
False. Horses can see almost 360 degrees. And they have excellent
night vision that is nearly as good as that of dogs and owls.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrate the start of the Year of the Horse during the zoo's
annual Lunar New Year event on Feb. 2 and 3. Meet miniature horse
Reisha, donkey Odie and zebras Kibuli and Maadili. There will also be

<HD>Saga Builds on Flamboyant Details of a Jazz Age Murder
Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DICK LOCHTE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Craig Holden's "The Jazz Bird" (Simon &amp; Schuster, $25, 317 pages) is
a work of fiction based on an infamous Cincinnati murder trial of the
1920s, in which world-class bootlegger ($80-million gross) George
Remus, a disbarred lawyer accused of killing his socialite wife,
argued in his own defense.</LD>
<LD>   Adding to public interest, the prosecutor was Charles P. Taft II,
the youngest son of the former president and then-chief justice of
the Supreme Court. In an acknowledgement, the author notes that while
the book deals with real people and events, "I invented freely...."
This may be an understatement.</LD>
<LD>   Historian Carl Sifankis, in the "Encyclopedia of American Crime,"
states that the Remus trial is usually cited as a "farcical" example
of justice, in which the accused was allowed to defend himself on a
plea of insanity. There's nothing remotely farcical about Holden's
version.</LD>
<TE>   Using the trial as a starting place, he has created a striking,
meticulously evoked Jazz Age saga that holds its own with the prose
of F. Scott Fitzgerald and John O'Hara. At its heart is the question
of why Remus killed his wife. We're given a simplistic reason
upfront: She was unfaithful while he was in prison.</TE>
<TE>   As Holden would have it, there is a considerably more complex
sequence of events leading to the crime that he carefully unfolds,
layer by layer.</TE>
<TE>   Simultaneously, he reconstructs to his own design an assortment of
memorable characters. Chief among them are the flamboyant,
Gatsby-esque Remus; the well-born Charlie Taft, whose marriage is
shaken by his growing obsession with the victim; and, most stunning
of all, Remus' wife, Imogene, the aristocratic and quixotic flapper
whose penchant for the music of the day earned her the sobriquet "the
Jazz Bird."</TE>
<TE>   The novel is quite a departure from Holden's previous gritty
contemporary thrillers, "The River Sorrow," "The Last Sanctuary" and
"The Four Corners of Night," save for one key aspect: the care with
which he crafts his characters. That elevates novels set in any
decade.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone to Watch Over Me" (Morrow, $24, 230 pages), Book Three in
Jill Churchill's new series featuring self-described "sleuthing
siblings" Lily and Robert Brewster, takes us to upstate New York in
the Depression '30s. Churchill, a pen name selected by Janice Young
Brooks with the idea that her novels would be shelved next to Agatha
Christie's, did a fair job of updating and Americanizing Dame Agatha
with her previous series, the award-winning mysteries featuring Jane
Jeffry, a Chicago single mother who solves crimes in a Miss
Marple-like manner.</TE>
<TE>   That series' punny titles include "Grime and Punishment" and my
favorite, "Silence of the Hams." With titles based on pop songs of
the period ("Anything Goes," "In the Still of the Night"), the new
series seems to be something of a departure from the Christies. Not
in its characters: Lily and Robert, born to wealth but impoverished
by the Great Depression and unqualified for labor, were any
available, have been forced to leave their beloved Manhattan for the
rural rigors of the upstate village of Voorburg-on-the-Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   They're there at the behest and the bequest of a wealthy uncle
who's left them the temporary usufruct of an estate that will become
theirs in a decade, provided they find some way of earning a buck in
the meantime.</TE>
<TE>   They, the estate's pleasant but tight-fisted guardian, a lawyer
named Prinney, his busy-making wife and the other townspeople,
eccentric and mundane, all might comfortably be relocated to Marple's
St. Mary Mead.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing I've read in Christie comes close to the mood of
darkness and near-despair that Churchill captures in her description
of the Depression's devastating effect on small-town America.</TE>
<TE>   There's a particularly harrowing episode in which the editor of
the Voorburg newspaper (part of the Brewsters' inheritance) travels
to D.C. for a story on the unemployed World War I veterans gathered
to demand the government fulfill a pledge allowing them to borrow
against their federal insurance policies. He's there when, in a
less-than-magnificent moment in this nation's history, President
Hoover sends in the Army, under Gen. Douglas MacArthur, to disperse
the crowd, which the soldiers do with glee, burning tents and using
bayonets on men, women and children.</TE>
<TE>   It's a riveting, grim sidebar that threatens to overwhelm the
double-murder mystery that Lily and Robert are trying to solve at
home. On the other hand, it provides the novel with a substance and
depth not usually associated with cozy mysteries.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to smaller publishers such as Crippen &amp; Landru, the mystery
short story, which for a time seemed to be sharing the fate of the
eight-track cassette, has been given a slightly longer lease on life.</TE>
<TE>   The publisher recently released two notable trade
paperbacks--Edward D. Hoch's "The Old Spies Club" (240 pages, $17)
and Max Allan Collins' "Kisses of Death: A Nathan Heller Casebook"
(207 pages, $17). "Spies" features British agent Jeffery Rand and his
Scottish-Egyptian wife, Leila Gaad, an archeologist, in 15 stories
that Hoch, a Mystery Writers of America grandmaster, penned for
Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. "Waiting for Mrs. Ryder" is tricky
and satisfying enough to stand out among a particularly high-grade
collection in the course of which we can follow Rand into marriage
and retirement.</TE>
<TE>   In "Kisses," Chicago private eye Heller (who also has a Hollywood
office), hops from city to city and decade to decade in seven
high-quality hard-boiled stories that involve him in real unsolved
crimes (i.e., the murder of Thelma Todd and the unexplained death of
major league baseball midget Eddie Gaedel).</TE>
<TE>   The tales co-star such celebrities as Marilyn Monroe, Bill Veeck
and Elliott Ness, himself the subject of four Collins novels,
according to the collection's helpful bibliographic checklist of this
prolific author.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Lochte, the author of the prize-winning novel "Sleeping Dog"
and its sequel, "Laughing Dog" (Poisoned Pen Press), reviews
mysteries every other Wednesday.</TE>

<DH>'Outsider music' may be off-beat and bumbling, but it
strikes a chord with listeners who like its originality and honesty.</DH>

<LD>The 60 Canadian schoolchildren fumbled their way through Beach Boys
and David Bowie songs, singing out of tune and drumming off beat. It
was music only a parent could love, and that's exactly who it was
intended for when the Langley Schools Music Project was recorded in
an echo-y gymnasium 26 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   But today this novelty recording has not only been reissued
commercially, it has gone through four pressings since its October
release--the latest musical obscurity to bubble up to the outer edges
of the mainstream in what has come to be known as "outsider music."</LD>
<LD>   "It's like your homework project winning the Nobel Prize," said
Hans Fenger, who was 29 and new to teaching when he started recording
his students on a two-track tape machine in 1976. "To me, I just made
music with kids. We had a good time, but I never thought of it
outside the immediate realm that it was in."</LD>
<TE>   Most outsider musicians don't think beyond the immediate realm.
Their music is so far afield of convention that they know its chances
for mass popularity are next to nil--even its most successful artists
are only moderately so by mainstream commercial standards.</TE>
<TE>   Prized for its bumbling imperfection, naive originality and
unflinching honesty, outsider music isn't for everyone, yet every few
years a recording is discovered by someone with music industry
connections. What was once an odd and little-known piece of music is
picked up for distribution, played on free-form radio and sold in
record stores. While the first impulse in listening to it is often to
laugh, it has a quality that keeps listeners coming back and, in the
process, often wins the artists a cult-like following.</TE>
<TE>   The Langley Schools Music Project is merely the latest in a string
of unlikely acts that have enjoyed outsider success in the last
decade. Acts such as the Del Rubio Triplets (a trio of gray-haired
go-go gals from San Pedro who toured nursing homes, strumming their
guitars and sing-speaking hits by Devo and the Rolling Stones) and
the Shaggs (three sisters whose father forced them to form a band in
1967). Barely able to tune their instruments, let alone play them,
the Shaggs' drumming sounded "like a peg-leg stumbling through a
field of bald Uniroyals," rock critic Lester Bangs once wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Sound unlistenable? It is to the average music fan. But one man's
trash being another's treasure, outsider music is gaining a growing
cadre of listeners who view it as a welcome alternative to the
perfectly produced confections that dominate today's music charts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an antidote to what people are hearing on the radio. Here's
something that's real. It's flawed, but it's genuine," said Irwin
Chusid, host of the Incorrect Music program on WFMU, a New Jersey
public radio station that champions outsider music, and author of
"Songs in the Key of Z" (A Cappella, 2000) and a Web site
(keyofz.com)on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean you'll be hearing it on commercial radio anytime
soon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine the Langley Schools being on KROQ or MTV,''
said Jon Dolan, an associate editor at Spin magazine, although it has
been on NPR. "Kitsch things can make it into the mainstream, but it's
usually through more obscure channels."</TE>
<TE>   Outsider music has come to encompass everything from singing
puppets to something called song-poems, making a clean definition
difficult. As one fan put it, it's all in the listening. There isn't
a formula so much as a quality to the music. Generally speaking, the
artists are ordinary people singing earnestly about what really
matters to them.</TE>
<TE>   Chusid says Langley has become a gateway to outsider music for
many. Because the artists are children and because they are singing
well-known songs by the Carpenters, Barry Manilow and other pop
stars, Langley is far easier to listen to and less off-putting than
other outsider artists, many of whom live on society's fringe. People
like Wesley Willis--a 320-pound schizophrenic Chicago street artist
who pens songs with titles like "They Threw Me Out of Church" and
"I'm Sorry That I Got Fat"--and Frances Baskerville, a Texas psychic
who sings her predictions.</TE>
<TE>   The term "outsider music" was first used by Chusid in an article
he wrote in 1996 for Pulse, a music magazine, but its genesis derives
from "outsider art." That term originally described artwork by
psychiatric patients but now includes works by a variety of other
untrained, intuitive artists. The Langley Schools Music Project first
came to Chusid's attention when a listener sent him a tape a few
years ago. He had heard hundreds of other school recordings--marching
bands with squawking clarinets, off-key choral ensembles--but was so
impressed with Langley that he chased down Fenger and arranged a
record deal.</TE>
<TE>   There is usually something uncomfortable and off about outsider
music, whether it's the incongruity of a 9-year-old girl singing
about romantic love and loss on the Langley record, or the melodic
ineptitude, technical folly and mundane subject matter of the Shaggs
performing songs about their parents and their pet cat Foot Foot. But
there is also an originality and inventiveness and singularity of
vision that can be absent in commercially successful music--music
that may be written and performed by an artist but is influenced by
dozens of additional people in the process.</TE>
<TE>   "Artistically, there's always been, since punk, the assumption
that inspired amateurism is more meaningful than any kind of
professionalism," said Dolan of Spin. "After you've tired yourself
out listening to the Ramones and Wire and Replacements, it bleeds
over into fetishizing disability." Dolan says that with outsider
music, fans "have to go further and further away to find things that
seem obscure" once an artist has been discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Milstein doesn't disagree. An outsider music fan, he said:
"People who are listening carefully and for whom music is important,
they need to find new things constantly. I'm not saying that makes
people like us better, but definitely ... more prone to having to
work hard to seek out [music] from down beneath the surface.</TE>
<TE>   "We're so used to music where everything fits right," added
Milstein, who runs the American Song-Poem Music Archives Web site
(www.aspma.com). "There's a hegemony of rhythm and harmony in the
music that we hear, and there's nothing wrong with that, but it
shouldn't be thought of as the only correct solution to making
music."</TE>
<TE>   Milstein is a collector and historian of song-poems--songs that
are written by amateurs but performed by professional musicians who
"sight-sing," improvising a melody on first read and recording it in
a single take.</TE>
<TE>   Song-poems are just beginning to gain attention among outsider
music fans. There is an extensive Web site devoted to the subject,
and several compilation CDs. A documentary film and a book on the
subject are also in the works. Whereas collectors used to be able to
find song-poem records in abundance at thrift stores, they are now
being traded on EBay at collectors' prices--records that used to cost
15 cents now fetch $15.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of companies still make song-poems, but the genre's
heyday was the '60s and '70s, when hundreds of companies advertised
in magazines, soliciting songs from amateur poets who paid a few
hundred dollars to have their music shopped to record labels and
music publishers. Hundreds of thousands of songs were recorded this
way, though few made it anywhere within earshot of a record exec.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the big songwriters of the day like Bacharach and Mancini
had a heck of a time getting a hit, so you can imagine what the odds
are of any of these people coming up with [one]," said Gene Merlino,
a professional studio singer who worked with Frank Sinatra, Elvis
Presley and other top performers and who also sang song-poems on the
side.</TE>
<TE>   Such highly unfavorable odds didn't stop people from submitting
some extremely strange songs--on subjects from tooth rot to midwifery
and everything in between. Merlino, who lives in Camarillo, estimates
he sang about 10,000 song-poems during the 35 years he was in the
business--decidedly unpoetic and inadvertently humorous ditties with
titles like "We Are the Men Counting Sheep" and "Be My Shark."</TE>
<TE>   The term song-poem is a bit of an oxymoron since many were
anything but poetic, penned with little sense of meter or linguistic
grace. "Most of the time they were really bad. The trick was trying
to get through these things sometimes without dying of laughter from
the material," said Merlino, who was once instructed by a writer to
hack and cough his way through the recording of "The Smoking Song."</TE>
<TE>   "What's interesting about song-poems is that they are unlike
anything else that exists in the music industry," said Jamie Meltzer,
a San Francisco filmmaker who recently finished the song-poem
documentary "Off the Charts." "They're just songs written by ordinary
people expressing what they feel they have to express, whether it's a
good song or not."</TE>
<TE>   Another story from the realm of outsider music that has captured
the attention of filmmakers is that of the Shaggs, whose music
languished for decades before making an impression.</TE>
<TE>   Dot Semprini was 19 when her dad, thinking his daughters could be
bigger than the Beatles, signed up her and her sisters for weekly
music lessons. The Shaggs only made it as far as the local town hall
in Fremont, N.H., where they played weekly gigs and were frequently
jeered and pelted with soda cans. Undeterred by negative audience
reaction, the girls' father paid a studio to record "Philosophy of
the World" in 1969 and "Shaggs' Own Thing" in 1972, records that
figured prominently in no one's record collection except their
family's until the early '80s.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Terry Adams, of the band NRBQ, contacted Semprini to
ask if he could re-release them. Semprini, who wrote and sang most of
the Shaggs' songs, found the group's master tapes buried in an old
army trunk upstairs in her house. "Philosophy of the World" was
re-released in 1980 and again in 1988. Rolling Stone has since named
it one of the 100 most influential alternative records of all time.</TE>
<TE>   Semprini, who says she "is still surprised if somebody likes it,"
now receives almost daily fan mail. And the Shaggs' story is in
development at Artisan Pictures, the same film company that released
"The Blair Witch Project."</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of the Shaggs and other outsider groups invites the
question: How much of the enthusiasm for outsider music is genuine
appreciation, and how much is just a cheap laugh?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very complex equation," said Milstein, "but I think the
irony level needs to be tempered considerably because it's insulting
to the people who were involved if they're treated as a joke or just
as fodder for cheap fraternity house follies."</TE>
<TE>   That is especially true if the artist is psychologically troubled.
Works of genius often walk the line between sanity and craziness, as
artists such as Daniel Johnston can attest.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston, a 30-something manic depressive who lives at home with
his parents in Austin, Texas, is widely heralded as a pop genius, a
la the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson. His career is almost a metaphor for
his illness. At its high point, he was signed to Atlantic Records. At
its lowest, he was confined to a mental institution. His songs, which
he first recorded into a hand-held tape recorder and handed out to
pretty girls on the street and sold to local record stores in the
early '80s, have been performed by Sonic Youth, Yo La Tengo and
numerous other indie rock luminaries. From there, they fell into the
hands of deejays at noncommercial college and public radio stations
around the country, including some of the more left-leaning ones in
L.A. such as KXLU, which began playing them.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the re-releases of outsider music that catch on typically
sell in the tens--not hundreds--of thousands, enough to recoup costs
for the record label but far from what's required to chart. Even the
Langley Schools Music Project, which is considered a great success,
has sold only 25,000 copies--not enough to make anyone rich but
enough to funnel a few dollars back to the school.</TE>
<TE>   And, while it is gaining in popularity, outsider music can never
be mainstream, said Chusid, the DJ responsible for giving Langley a
larger audience. "By its very definition," he said, "it's outsider,
it's marginal."</TE>

<HD>The Pretzel: Twisted Villain or Misunderstood Snack?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of a pretzel's attempted asphyxiation of President Bush,
snack food industry officials have rushed to defend the beleaguered
baked treat.</LD>
<LD>   Less than 24 hours after Secret Service agents wrestled the
deranged pretzel to the ground, Ann Wilkes of the Virginia-based
Snack Food Assn. told reporters: "We're grateful the president is OK,
but pretzels are not usually singled out as being a choking hazard.
Any solid food can be dangerous."</LD>
<LD>   Wilkes noted that her group hosted its annual Pretzel Seminar in
November and nobody detected any hints of violence from the
1,400-year-old snack. The seminar, which is described as "an
opportunity for salted snack producers to exchange technical and
marketing information," usually features speakers from the Salt
Institute or similar organizations.</LD>
<TE>   At the most recent gathering, pretzel makers heard a
presentation by Penn State University's food sciences department on
"crystallization problems in pretzels."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows if the pretzel that attacked President Bush was
afflicted with crystallization. But evidence is mounting that
Sunday's incident isn't the first time a pretzel has stalked the
president.</TE>
<TE>   On May 22, a Los Angeles fifth-grader who was touring the White
House found a pretzel inside the residence and had the presence of
mind to pocket it, according to an article in The Times' Travel
section. Colin Hansen, who now attends a private school in Los Feliz,
still has the snack in a plastic bag in his refrigerator, but so far
the FBI hasn't sought his pretzel for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   However, late-night talk-show hosts immediately recognized the
twisty treat as a national security threat. David Letterman noted
that Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge "issued an all-points bulletin
for Mr. Salty."</TE>
<TE>   And comic Argus Hamilton lamented the fact that "Dick Cheney is
now just a pretzel away from the presidency."</TE>
<TE>   Friends of the accused snack expressed shock at its alleged role
in Sunday's attack. "He's just a mixture of wheat flour, yeast and
salt, bathed in sodium hydroxide," said Mr. Peanut. "I can't believe
he would go postal. Sure, he was a bit of a loner, but never this
twisted."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, British commentators suggested
that the pretzel incident would boost President Bush's popularity.</TE>
<TE>   The Daily Telegraph wrote: "This is exactly the sort of accident
that befalls Homer Simpson, night after night, in 'The Simpsons'
cartoon series [with the exception that Homer is more likely to choke
on a doughnut than a pretzel]. What is so comforting is that here is
a president who finds himself conducting an international war against
terrorism, with great competence, but who still finds the time to
while away his Sunday evenings in front of the box, watching football
and munching pretzels. He has shown himself, once again, to be
completely in tune with the tastes and instincts of the people he
leads."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm working on my long-term financial plan.</LD>
<LD>   Successful long-term financial planning is part science and part
luck.</LD>
<LD>   This is especially true in my case, because my long-term financial
plan involves winning the Lotto.</LD>
<TE>   Although I haven't refined everything yet, here is what my general
approach is going to be when my portfolio comes in.</TE>
<TE>   The very first thing I'm going to do is hire security guards to
keep well-wishers away. I don't need a whole bunch of people coming
to the door and being happy for me.</TE>
<TE>   Next, I'll change my phone number.</TE>
<TE>   And this isn't to get rid of con men and get-rich-quick types and
assorted pests. These folks can be taken care of with one little
three-letter word--dog. No, the individuals I most want to avoid are
friends.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that I have anything against these people. It's just that
once my long-term financial plan kicks in, what would we talk about?
And even if we could find something in common, how are the Kennedys
and the Du Ponts going to feel about rubbing elbows with the help?</TE>
<TE>   You know, as long as I'm at it, I think I'll probably get all new
relatives, too. I mean, let's face it, all the past slights and
arguments and hurt feelings are never going to be resolved. So why
not just start fresh with a brand spanking new extended family.</TE>
<TE>   Another thing I've given a lot of thought to is whether or not to
take my money in yearly payments or in a lump sum. This is a tough
call.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, I'm horrible at managing money. On the other
hand, I'm Smith Barney compared with the state. So I don't know.</TE>
<TE>   As for investing, I've ruled out stocks and bonds. You invest in
these types of things and you're lucky to make 10% a year.</TE>
<TE>   You invest money with some guys I know from the old neighborhood,
though, and they'll get you a 30% or 40% return--a week. Sure,
there's some risk involved, but nowhere near that assumed by their
clients.</TE>
<TE>   I also intend to be a philanthropist. But I'm not going to donate
to the same old mainstream groups--you know, hospitals, colleges, the
needy. Instead, I'm going to seek out and support causes that have
been ignored for far too long.</TE>
<TE>   For example, I'm definitely throwing some money to that
organization that's working to eradicate the heartbreak of love
handles. And those people who are working to find a cure for
unattractiveness, I'm cutting them a check too.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, I'll be nonpartisan, although I will enthusiastically
back all candidates who favor giving police the authority to shoot
out the tires of anyone who doesn't clear the snow from the top of
his or her car.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is one thing I am absolutely determined to not let
happen.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not going to let the money change me.</TE>

<HD>The Key on the Collar</HD>
<DH>Part 3 The story so far: Several people have befriended the
lost dog with a mysterious key on his collar, but he can't stay. He
has to move on.</DH>

<LD>The day grew hot, and the dog became very thirsty. He thought he
smelled water and ran toward it. He searched for the water under some
weeds. Ouch! He stuck his nose in a thistle. The dog shook his head
but couldn't get the thistle out of his nose.</LD>
<LD>   Slowly, he walked on. His nose throbbed. By sundown, he reached
the other side of the forest. He stopped when he saw the house with
blue shutters.</LD>
<LD>   The front door opened, and a little girl stepped outside.</LD>
<TE>   "Don't go far, Polly," a voice called from inside the house.</TE>
<TE>   Polly saw the dog with a thistle stuck on his nose.</TE>
<TE>   "You poor thing," she said. "Come with me."</TE>
<TE>   The dog followed her to an old shed. "This is my magic castle,"
she said. "I can fix anything here." Then she whispered, "Of course,
I'm just pretending."</TE>
<TE>   They went inside. "Sit here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm going to say the magic words, and you will be just fine."
She closed her eyes and wiggled her nose.</TE>
<TE>   "Witches, itches, broom and bristle, take away the hurting
thistle."</TE>
<TE>   She pulled it out. That felt so much better. He shook himself and
stood up.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that on your collar?" she asked and then gasped. "Oh, my,
I think it's my missing key! If it is, you are my missing magic dog!"</TE>
<TE>   Quickly she removed the dog's collar and ran to the door. She
tried it in the lock, but it didn't work. Nothing happened.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, dear, I guess it isn't my key, after all. Now you will have
to leave. Only the one who has my missing magic key may stay with
me." Then she whispered again. "You can stay if you want to and be my
dog just the way you are. I don't care about the magic part."</TE>
<TE>   But the dog wanted to go. He trotted outside. Night was coming. It
was growing darker. He was really lost!</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Which way will the dog go?</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Van Steenwyk's dog, Freckles, loved to go on hiking
trips with his family. He wore his own backpack and carried his own
food. This story will be on The Times' Web site at

<HD>In Schoenberg, an Exuberant Parisii Quartet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though not officially a part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's
ongoing Schoenberg Prism series, the Parisii Quartet's program of
Schoenberg, Berg and Webern at LACMA's Bing Theatre Monday night was,
in its way, more absorbing than many of the higher-profile downtown
Prism concerts.</LD>
<LD>   Here, in the company of his two star students, Schoenberg could
play the role of exuberant patriarch instead of the formidable, even
forbidding, heir to Beethoven and Brahms. And with the help of some
remarkable playing by the Parisian foursome, the listener could be
immersed in this special sound world without distractions or side
trips.</LD>
<LD>   If you used your imagination, this program could bear a striking,
self-contained resemblance to the typical everyday string-quartet
lineup. The buoyant, tone-row-derived, yet classically organized
textures of Schoenberg's String Quartet No. 3 was the equivalent of
an opening piece by Mozart or Haydn, with the concentrated outbursts
and mystical pianissimos of Webern's Five Movements, Opus 5, serving
as the "radical" 20th century pre-intermission feature and Berg's
impassioned Lyric Suite as the Romantic main course.</LD>
<TE>   The quartet made its most moving impression in the Webern, giving
the first movement a charged-up lift while producing magically still,
deeply felt muted harmonies and flutterings later on, reaching down
to the spiritual depths of the piece. With an assured, flowing
approach, they made cogent structural sense of
Schoenberg--notwithstanding a broken string that interrupted the
performance 21/2 minutes into the first movement. And they found an
unexpected rustic quality in the rhythms of the Lyric Suite's second
movement, integrating the piece's rapidly shifting moods seamlessly.</TE>

<HD>A Band (or Two) of Brothers</HD>
<DH>First came Tierra. Then came Tierra. Now the Salases, still
bickering decades later, will reunite the Chicano rock group for one
night.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sign at the rear entrance to Ordonez Mexican Restaurant in
Montebello posts an odd warning: "Profanity will not be tolerated."</LD>
<LD>   Seems unnecessary, considering the family atmosphere in the place.
Yet during a long, recent lunch hour, it would have taken more than a
sign to enforce the rule at one table.</LD>
<LD>   That's where the Salas brothers sat, face to face across the chips
and guacamole, revisiting old wounds in their long musical
partnership like a bickering married couple. Before the cheese
enchiladas had a chance to get cold, the simmering sibling rivalry
between the veteran Chicano rockers had boiled over once again.</LD>
<TE>   "I was always the leader of the band," asserted Rudy, 53.</TE>
<TE>   "Because he called himself the leader," snapped Steve, 50.</TE>
<TE>   OK, let's just say the Salas brothers co-founded Tierra, one of
the most successful of the Chicano rock bands from East Los Angeles
from the '60s and '70s. Like other young activists of the day, they
infused their music with an overtly political identity combined with
a cool party spirit that blended Mexican melodies with R&amp;B, helping
define the so-called Eastside Sound.</TE>
<TE>   The band, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, had
only a brief flirtation with national fame, with its biggest hit,
"Together," peaking at No. 18 on the national singles chart in 1980.
But Tierra is still remembered as the East L.A. band that realized
everybody's dream, the Chicanos who made it to Carnegie Hall.</TE>
<TE>   To celebrate the era, Tierra is scheduled to perform Friday in a
onetime reunion concert at the Conga Room. If the Salas brothers
don't kill each other first, that is. Like that time in El Paso,
years ago when they tried to throw each other off a hotel balcony.
They ended up drunk and contrite, sitting on the floor of an elevator
with a bottle of tequila between them, arms around each other,
saying, "I love you, man."</TE>
<TE>   Reconciliations never lasted long. Steve, who walked off stage in
a huff more than once, actually left the band on three occasions for
brief periods over the years, as Rudy recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't leave," Steve retorts. "My own brother fired me."</TE>
<TE>   About five years ago, Steve quit for good, and the brothers
finally stopped talking to each other, for the most part. Same old
thing. Disputes about music and money and management.</TE>
<TE>   "He could never accept the fact that I'm his equal," says Steve.
"As far as he's concerned, I'm still his little brother."</TE>
<TE>   So Steve formed his own band.</TE>
<TE>   "There's two Tierras now," he gloats.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only one Tierra," corrects Rudy, "and one terrorist group
out there."</TE>
<TE>   Who's going to play on Friday, then?</TE>
<TE>   Ah, there's the rub.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the Conga Room booked Steve's band for a three-night
stand. But then the club heard from Rudy's wife, claiming Steve
didn't have the real Tierra. Her husband did.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah," replied Steve. "Who's to say his Tierra is more real
than mine?"</TE>
<TE>   That's when the heavy negotiations started.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Vargas, the club's booking manager, got between the two
brothers on conference calls. The profanity rule didn't apply,
apparently.</TE>
<TE>   "I was ready to cancel the whole thing altogether because it just
got a little too sticky," says Vargas. "And the theatrics and the
drama was already draining me."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas proposed a compromise: Neither brother's band would play.
Instead, they would both put together a Tierra reunion band with as
many of the members as possible from the glory days, the hit years
which also included "La-La Means I Love You" and "Memories" from
1981.</TE>
<TE>   Fine, they said. Then they started arguing about the lineup. At
one point, Steve hung up the phone and backed out of the concert,
with just two weeks to go. But he soon apologized.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want to do is get through this thing," says Rudy, digging
through the guacamole. "This is the most agonizing gig I've ever had
to do."</TE>
<TE>   "Likewise," says Steve.</TE>
<TE>   Public fights between the Salas brothers are nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   They've been playing together since before their teens, singing
mariachi songs at parties and neighborhood events. They started their
professional careers--and had their first onstage fight--with the
Percussions, later renamed the Jaguars.</TE>
<TE>   "One time my brother punched me in the stomach because I didn't
want to sing a song," Steve told David Reyes and Tom Waldman, authors
of "Land of a Thousand Dances," a 1998 history of L.A. Chicano rock.
"I started crying and ran off the stage."</TE>
<TE>   Song and politics were always part of the Salas household in
Lincoln Heights, recall the brothers, who attended Lincoln High
School and participated in student walkouts to protest barrio school
conditions. In 1970, two years before starting Tierra in their
parents' garage, the brothers marched in the Chicano moratorium in
East L.A., an antiwar demonstration that turned into a violent street
riot.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, write Reyes and Waldman, the riot brought national
notoriety to East L.A., and drew the attention of record executives
who had ignored the area's percolating music scene for years.
Tierra's first self-titled album, released in 1973 on Twentieth
Century, contains the complex composition "Barrio Suite," still
considered a Chicano classic.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was, the record didn't sell. And neither did Tierra's
1975 follow-up album, "Stranded."</TE>
<TE>   "We had already made a pact, me and my brother, that we were going
to be a musical force in this business, but in a Chicano way,"
recalls Steve. "Not compromising at all."</TE>
<TE>   Tierra stopped recording for a spell, but the band remained
popular, playing steadily at the Pasta House nightclub in East L.A.
With $10,000 from a Schlitz beer endorsement, they gradually put
together a new album on their own.</TE>
<TE>   The major labels "all took a very emphatic pass," on the record,
says Steve. At first, Rudy recalls, he had to peddle the record out
of his white Econoline van, pressing 500 at a time and selling them
on consignment to neighborhood retailers. Then radio play got so hot
they couldn't keep up with demand.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the late Neil Bogart, the maverick music executive behind
Donna Summer and KISS, offered Tierra $100,000 for rights to "City
Nights," re-released in 1980 on Bogart's Boardwalk Records. Tierra's
triumph at Carnegie Hall came the following year.</TE>
<TE>   "All of our lives everybody would say, 'Yeah, you guys are good,
but this is like the barrio. You're not going to be able to compete
with the big boys in the real show cities,'" recalls Steve about that
New York show. "Well, we were so energized, so juiced. 'Yeah, now
tell us we can't make it!'"</TE>
<TE>   Though the brothers never had another hit, Tierra has stayed
together in one form or another for more than a quarter century.</TE>
<TE>   "I ate, slept and drank Tierra ever since I started the band,"
says Rudy, whose group recently recorded a bilingual album titled
"Two Worlds/Dos Mundos" for Thump Records. "Tierra outlasted my first
marriage and I was married 24 years.... I'm very proud that the band
has gone on, even with this [fraternal] conflict, and flourished."</TE>
<TE>   After three hours at the restaurant, the brothers had not settled
any differences. But they both promised to set aside the conflicts
and put on a good show Friday, for old time's sake.</TE>
<TE>   Tierra fans still wonder: Whatever happened to them?</TE>
<TE>   "I guess we lost sight that we both needed each other," concludes
Steve.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tierra plays Friday at the Conga Room, 5364 Wilshire Blvd., L.A.
10 p.m. $18 and $40. (323) 938-1696.</TE>

<HD>WB Adds a Good Mystery With 'Glory Days'</HD>
<DH>The new, well-acted series chronicles spooky events on a
Pacific Northwest island, each week the site of a different whodunit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spooky, mysterious, well-acted "Glory Days" is a nice midseason
addition to the WB schedule, introducing Mike Dolan (Eddie Cahill) as
a 25-year-old greeted by anger, suspicion and turbulence upon
returning to his hometown four years after loosely depicting its
residents in a best-selling mystery novel connected to his father's
supposedly accidental death.</LD>
<LD>   Keep your eye here on "supposedly."</LD>
<LD>   The town, actually an island in the Pacific Northwest, is Glory;
the title of Mike's book is "Glory Days." Yet there is nothing
glorious about the murder case that involves him after he witnesses a
man shoved from a ferry into the water by an anonymous assailant.
Although you won't be chewing on your nails, the premiere features
some twisty suspense and a seductively murky ambience.</LD>
<TE>   This series, from Kevin Williamson ("Dawson Creek"), delivers a
different mystery each week. Tonight's has Mike trying to persuade
his alienated former chum, Rudy Dunlop (Jay R. Ferguson), now the
local sheriff, that the ferry passenger's death was not accidental.
Rudy will have none of it, still steamed over being portrayed in
Mike's book as a gay doofus. At least the doofus part fits.</TE>
<TE>   Just as angry over the book are Mike's mother, Mitzi (Frances
Fisher), and older sister, Sara (Amy Stewart), who reluctantly hires
him as a reporter on the local paper she inherited from her father.
His strongest ally is his little sister, Sam (Emily VanCamp), their
sweet, tender moments together becoming the hour's highlight.</TE>
<TE>   Another friend is local coroner Ellie Sparks (Poppy Montgomery, so
outstanding as Marilyn Monroe in "Blonde"), and surfacing less
frequently in the premiere is sultry diner owner Hazel Walker. She
seems destined for greater prominence because the actress playing her
(Theresa Russell) is too capable and well known to squander as a
footnote. Besides, Hazel was deemed a murderer in Mike's book, making
her initial ambivalence toward him all the more interesting. Get the
drift?</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as tonight's episode rolls on, what about that body on
the slab?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Glory Days" premieres tonight at 9 on the WB. The network has
rated it TV-PG-LV (may be unsuitable for young children, with special
advisories for coarse language and violence).</TE>

<HD>King, CNN Near Deal on Contract Extension</HD>
<DH>Sources say the network talk-show host's 4-year pact
includes a pay raise, but dismissed reports his salary will approach
that of 'Today's' Katie Couric.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>CNN is close to signing a new four-year deal with its top-rated talk
host, Larry King, but insiders on Tuesday dismissed news reports of a
payout that would have him earning close to the record $15 million to
$16 million annually that NBC just agreed to pay "Today" co-anchor
Katie Couric.</LD>
<LD>   People familiar with the situation said King is getting a raise,
which will likely give him a salary of some $6 million to $7 million
annually. That figure is roughly the total value of his current pay
package, when perks and items such as stock options are added on,
these people said. Those extras will add an undetermined amount to
the salary portion of his new deal, but they don't double it, unless
the stock does exceedingly well, the knowledgeable people said.</LD>
<LD>   CNN said only that "we expect to sign him soon." The office of
King's agent, Jim Wiatt, president and co-chief executive officer at
the William Morris Agency, referred calls to King's CNN publicist,
who said, "They're close to a deal." She said King wouldn't comment.</LD>
<TE>   King has a year or so to go on his current contract, but in the
last few months he's judiciously timed conspicuous lunches with
rivals of CNN, such as Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes.</TE>
<TE>   CNN in the last year has been attempting to remake itself in the
face of intense competition, particularly from Fox News Channel, and
can't afford to lose King, who is one of its most recognizable faces
and whose talk show is the mainstay of its night lineup.</TE>
<TE>   One perk that King won't get is unrestricted use of a private jet
for his commutes between his home base in Los Angeles and the
Washington and New York studios where he frequently works, something
he had been seeking. One insider familiar with the deal said his new
contract will likely give him access to a chartered plane twice a
month.</TE>

<HD>Closer to the 'Real World'</HD>
<DH>The MTV unscripted series in Chicago includes reaction to
Sept. 11, a local protest and increased security.</DH>

<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>"I came into the house on uncertain grounds, and I leave on uncertain
grounds," Kyle writes in a letter, oblivious to the cameraman peering
over his shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   That scene on the final day of shooting here wasn't the only
uncertain moment. Shooting "The Real World" in Chicago this past
summer and fall was a lesson in uncertainty:</LD>
<LD>   * There were protests surrounding the shooting of the MTV reality
series, in part caused by opposition to the Wicker Park
neighborhood's overall gentrification.</LD>
<TE>   * There were reactions to the very real events of the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11 that were caught on tape and promise to provide a
different kind of drama that hasn't been seen in the series' 11
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   * Finally, there is the uncertainty that staged, unscripted TV in
general, with declining ratings, is going through a glut in the genre
and the real events of Sept. 11 overshadow TV's make-believe reality.</TE>
<TE>   Not that any of this is on Kyle's mind as he writes a letter to a
fellow housemate--with whom he shared a brief fling. It is one of six
letters that he is working on--one for each of the cast members.</TE>
<TE>   As he writes, several of the 33 cameras that are situated
throughout the loft are capturing his moves on this, the last full
day of taping.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times there's just things I want to put on paper to give
to people," Kyle, a 22-year-old Chicago native, explains later. "And
I needed to write those letters as closure. I had a lot of things I
needed to say and wrap up with each one of my roommates."</TE>
<TE>   With the cameras constantly whirring, little is ever private on
"The Real World," which had its season premiere Tuesday and continues
into June.</TE>
<TE>   From Winter to Summer Start</TE>
<TE>   It was MTV's decision to allow the producers to do a season in the
summer (the series usually films during the latter part of winter)
that opened the door for Chicago to be picked as the site.</TE>
<TE>   "I think after our third season people started asking, 'When are
you going to go to Chicago?'" says executive producer Jon Murray.
"And we were stubborn about it because we really wanted to come to
Chicago when the weather was nice. And finally MTV gave us this
chance to shoot a season over the summer. I'm glad we waited because
I really think this city does become the eighth roommate. It is
spectacular looking."</TE>
<TE>   But not all of Chicago was welcoming. Some of the housemates'
neighbors chose the series shoot as a rallying point for their cause.</TE>
<TE>   "The protests seemed to be directly related to something that was
specifically happening in this neighborhood," Murray explains, "which
was there were a small group of artists who were concerned about
gentrification.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I wasn't surprised because I've learned not to be
surprised at anything. But ultimately, luckily, where the cast
certainly had a week or two there where they were certainly bothered
by it, and at times felt a little unsafe, ultimately in some ways it
made them bond with each other."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the protests and a double slaying that occurred nearby,
security was tightened at the loft.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning it was the safety issue, and we really dealt
with that accordingly, like having a security guard here," says
Anthony Dominici, who produced the Chicago filming. "There were some
hard times," says 22-year-old housemate Cara. "Now I can look at it
retrospectively and I can say it was great, it was fun. I think if
you'd asked me [a few months ago], I would have been like, 'Get me
out of here!'"</TE>
<TE>   Kyle, in defense of his city, says, "It's important to establish
that it's not how the city reacted. It's a very vocal, very small
group within this section of the city. Chicago did not reject us. A
band of people in the area that we live in tried to ... when we went
to other areas in the city we were embraced, people were
enthusiastic, people were very accommodating."</TE>
<TE>   But Tonya, a 22-year-old from Walla Walla, Wash., notes: "I think
with everything that happened with Sept. 11, those protests seemed so
trivial."</TE>
<TE>   Television Set Brought Into House</TE>
<TE>   They were especially trivial after the uncertainty brought about
by the events of Sept. 11. Murray says he broke with the show's
tradition and brought a television into the house in order to allow
roommates to keep up on what was happening to the country after the
attacks on New York and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really the first time this generation has had an event like
that, that made them think about their mortality, made them realize
that their world is not maybe as controllable as they thought it
was," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "They were getting calls. Kyle's sister and ex-girlfriend were
both in New York, and he's getting calls from them, hysterical calls
about what they had seen because they were down there near ground
zero. And Cara's brother works at the Capitol. So it was relating to
them directly."</TE>
<TE>   Housemate Theo, 20, of Riverside adds: "Being taped on Sept. 11
was really the most time I never at all paid attention to the camera.
It was more so trying to imagine what people were going through. We
see so much stuff on TV. You would be there watching it, [but] it was
like it wasn't real.... "</TE>
<TE>   Viewers will see Theo and the other housemates as they deal with
their emotions on Sept. 11 and other issues--even if the way those
feelings come across will be manipulated somewhat via cameras,
editing and other storytelling techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Many with the cast and crew of "The Real World" believe the
series' concept remains viable, even if it seems that most other
staged, unscripted series, including CBS' "Survivor," are losing
their popularity with TV viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a documentary on seven people's lives at a certain time,"
producer Dominici says. "I think that's the very simple and most
basic form of all the reality shows."</TE>

<HD>So Not Fun, It's Not Funny</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The entertainment folk who call, write and occasionally even share a
meal with me have almost unanimously sung the same sad refrain
lately, as if they were a trained chorus instead of a loose
collection of mucky-mucks.</LD>
<LD>   What they keep saying, in a nutshell, amounts to this appraisal of
their business: "It's not fun anymore."</LD>
<LD>   This comes as something of a revelation only because there was a
day, believe it or not, when the TV industry was not the exclusive
playground of multinational conglomerates, when mom-and-pop
operations existed, entrepreneurs cashed in fabulously on pluck, luck
and initiative and people actually had fun--recognizing that they
worked in a candy store, not in a widget factory.</LD>
<TE>   Nothing symbolized this more than the NATPE convention, a great
bazaar of TV programming that often gaudily showcased the business'
hucksterism but also its playful, don't-take-yourself-too-seriously
side. The Times' Howard Rosenberg labeled the experience "a
gargantuan cocktail party abounding in food, booze, TV chatter and
high-powered salesmanship."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's appropriate, then, given the industry's present
malaise, that this year even NATPE's annual buffet will have a
decidedly dour flavor. The convention, which once stood for National
Assn. of Television Program Executives but these days goes by solely
its acronym, will go on as scheduled next week in Las Vegas. The
idea, as always, is for TV station executives to meet with program
distributors, stocking up on shows to fill those hours that aren't
provided by a network.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of the luxurious booths that once populated the convention
floor, however, this year's NATPE will be a scaled-down affair. Many
major program suppliers will display their wares in hotel rooms as a
cost-cutting move. TV station managers are staying away in droves,
because of both the economy and corporate consolidation of television
ownership, which has robbed stations of local authority to buy
programming.</TE>
<TE>   Scheduling choiceshave been centralized, with group owners making
decisions for dozens of stations. As for weekend mornings or late
night, where an entrepreneur with a dream might try to launch a new
program, those hours are stocked with infomercials--again in
deference to the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to be a dinosaur to remember when it wasn't quite
that way. Only a few years ago, you could find companies like
Paramount, Viacom and King World on the floor lavishly schmoozing
with potential buyers. Now, those three entities are all owned by
Viacom, and studio sales pitches will be made in hotel hallways.</TE>
<TE>   NATPE's real stars, meanwhile, have always been the little guys,
people hoping to make a few bucks with a fishing, cooking or sports
memorabilia show. It was the blue-collar element of the TV industry,
which inspired more creative come-ons, elaborate stunts and a good
deal of exposed female flesh to reel in male station managers.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to such scrappy upstarts, NATPE assumed a carnival-like
atmosphere. There were armadillo races, staged wrestling matches,
even one company that paid to have a program's logo printed on toilet
paper rolls throughout the convention center.</TE>
<TE>   The convention also provided a source of gossip that could yield
dividends for months, given that the venue was usually Vegas or New
Orleans or some other city that invited all kinds of inappropriate
behavior. Everyone has a favorite story, but it's hard to top the
year in which undercover police busted several salesmen for Lorimar
(now part of Warner Bros.) at a well-known Houston gentlemen's club
for allegedly touching the entertainers. Word spread quickly, largely
because the club was packed with other conventioneers.</TE>
<TE>   This year, it's hard to imagine anyone will have much to gossip
about, given how miserable everyone claims to be.</TE>
<TE>   NATPE organizers have done their best to put a brave face on their
predicament, citing the influx of international broadcasters
attending the event; nevertheless, given the reshaping of the U.S. TV
industry, it's hard to imagine the convention enduring in anything
approaching its recent form. One company informally polled U.S. TV
stations and found that fewer than one in six would be sending
representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, no one needs to hold any bake sales for the high-paid
folks who work in entertainment. Moreover, though they obviously
couldn't control the lousy economy, studios currently pleading
poverty have only themselves to blame for past excesses that helped
make NATPE a financial albatross. No one forced Sony, for example, to
hire chef Wolfgang Puck, as it did a few years ago, to cater its
sprawling booth.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the sense of joylessness industry veterans describe also
translates into a lack of fun in television programming itself--a
desire to avoid risks and stay on the beaten path, in what has
amounted to a corporate takeover of every aspect of the process.</TE>
<TE>   "There continues to be an overreliance on testing," producer Tom
Werner lamented, during a panel last week, regarding the networks'
emphasis on research in deciding what shows to pick. He added that in
contrast to executives passionately championing projects, "group
decisions lead to safe alternatives."</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the same group of TV reporters, network executives
struck a somewhat more hopeful tone. NBC West Coast President Scott
Sassa, for example, pointed to the industry's yeoman work in the
immediate aftermath of the events of Sept. 11 and suggested that
those who labor in television "should realize how lucky we are to
work in such an awesome and influential medium."</TE>
<TE>   Although that's certainly a noble sentiment, it's one you'll be
hard-pressed to find anyone to echo at what promises to be a dreary,
armadillo-free NATPE.</TE>

<LD>   The Osbourne Family Is Coming to MTV</LD>
<LD>   Hoping to turn the notion of "family sitcom" on its ear, MTV will
premiere "The Osbournes" on March 5, a hybrid reality-comedy show
starring the formerly scary heavy metal legend Ozzy Osbourne, his
wife, Sharon, and their two teenage children, Kelly and Jack.</LD>
<TE>   In the show, the Osbournes play themselves--a somewhat
dysfunctional family living in a sprawling Hollywood home with the
multi-tattooed Osbourne as the patriarch, offering advice and counsel
to his children.</TE>
<TE>   Fans Campaign for 'Once and Again'</TE>
<TE>   Die-hard fans have begun a last-ditch Internet campaign on behalf
of "Once and Again," the ABC series that continues to struggle in the
ratings in its third season.</TE>
<TE>   ABC has reduced the number of episodes ordered this season from 23
to 17 and declined to discuss the program's prospects for renewal
during a question-and-answer session with reporters Sunday. One fan
Web site says the show is "in imminent danger of cancellation."</TE>
<TE>   Fans are circulating online petitions and organizing
letter-writing to ABC executives; still, such efforts have rarely
proven successful, and despite critical acclaim--including an Emmy
two years ago for star Sela Ward--"Once and Again" has drawn just 6.4
million viewers on average this season, ranking 91st among prime-time
series on the broadcast networks.</TE>
<TE>   POP MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Gorillaz Leads Brit Awards Nominations</TE>
<TE>   The "virtual" hip-hop group Gorillaz received six nominations in
the 2002 Brit Awards, including best British group and best British
album--even though its one English member, Blur's singer Damon
Albarn, is outnumbered by the group's American contingent, including
Dan "The Automator" Nakamura and former Talking Heads Tina Weymouth
and Chris Frantz.</TE>
<TE>   Other multiple nominees include Dido, Robbie Williams and Kylie
Minogue with four each, and Travis, Craig David and So Solid Crew
with three each.</TE>
<TE>   The best British album field is Dido's "No Angel," "Gorillaz,"
Craig David's "Born to Do It," Radiohead's "Kid A" and Travis' "The
Invisible Band," while U.S. acts Destiny's Child, Limp Bizkit, R.E.M.
and the Strokes compete with French group Daft Punk for best
international album.</TE>
<TE>   The awards, Britain's counterpart to the Grammys, will be
presented Feb. 20 at London's Earl's Court.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Matthews Band Plays Staples in May</TE>
<TE>   The Dave Matthews Band's spring tour will begin April 4 in
Washington, D.C., and will include shows May 13 at Coors Amphitheatre
near San Diego, May 15 at Staples Center and May 16 at Verizon
Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets will be available to fan association members through a
lottery system starting at midnight Friday and continuing through
noon on Jan. 28 at the Web site www.warehouse.davematthewsband.com.
Tickets for the 33-date tour of arenas in the U.S. and Canada will go
on sale to the general public in February.</TE>

on the film "A Beautiful Mind." The award honors the best film
adaptation of a book.</TE>
<TE>   The Scripter Award, given annually by the Friends of the USC
Libraries, will be presented March 16 at USC's Edward L. Doheny Jr.
Memorial Library.</TE>

promotion by Clear Channel Radio that will make him senior vice
president of programming for Premiere Radio Networks, a Clear Channel
division that syndicates more than 100 programs and services to
stations across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Hall joined KFI as news director in 1989 and became program
director the following year.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Bertolucci, who has been heading Clear Channel's AM

<LD>In the beginning, the child--unschooled and vulnerable--absorbs
knowledge from the parent. Gradually, the youngster catches up to,
then overtakes the parent. And, finally, in a twist as cruel as it is
beautiful, the child obliterates the parent by taking his or her
place.</LD>
<LD>   This cycle revolves through Donald Margulies' "Collected Stories,"
a Pulitzer Prize finalist that reaches the small screen tonight as
the second in a KCET-produced series of adapted dramas (9 p.m. on PBS
stations KCET and KVCR).</LD>
<LD>   Though Margulies' characters are not parent and child, per se,
their parallels to those roles are obvious. Ruth Steiner (played by
Linda Lavin) is a well-known writer and instructor; Lisa Morrison
(Samantha Mathis) is a graduate student who has moved to New York to
learn from her. Over time, the imperious but motherly Ruth becomes
mentor to the coltish young writer. Then the younger woman publishes
a novel inspired by a deeply personal experience that Ruth thought
she was telling Lisa in confidence. In the heated discussion that
follows, the issue of "ownership" of one's "stories" applies as
readily to the parent-child/teacher-student dynamic as to the more
obvious topic of ethics.</LD>
<TE>   "Collected Stories" was commissioned by Costa Mesa's South Coast
Repertory and premiered there in 1996. The TV version features the
cast from a 1999 Geffen Playhouse production, directed--as in
Westwood--by Gil Cates, from a teleplay by Margulies.</TE>
<TE>   On film, the story is opened up ever so slightly, so that we
witness Ruth growing older by the second as she scans Lisa's hurtful
manuscript, while across town at a reading, Lisa delivers excerpts
aloud to her rapt new fans.</TE>
<TE>   And the vicious cycle completes one revolution.</TE>

<KH>SUNDANCE FESTIVAL</KH>
<HD>It's Thrilling to Be Here, Really</HD>
<DH>Whether you're newcomer Agnes Bruckner or veteran Robin
Williams, the excitement of having your film screened is palpable.</DH>

<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>They still come to Sundance, the performers do, even in a year like
this one, a year when the festival faces an unusual danger: being
overshadowed in its hometown.</LD>
<LD>   For in less than a month, about 32 Winter Olympic events, one
third of the total, will take place in town or nearby, and the signs,
physical and psychological, are everywhere. Taped notices on local
bathroom walls are as likely to be offers of Olympic tickets as
fliers for films, the banner headline in the Park Record on the
festival's opening night read "Workers Brace for February Commute,"
and KPCW, the town's radio station, frequently reminds listeners that
"next month, Park City takes the world's stage."</LD>
<LD>   That overshadowing takes monumental form right in front of the
hotel that is the festival's headquarters, where the enormous giant
slalom run, complete with empty stands and a silent scoreboard, looms
over the building, for all intents and purposes a relic of some lost
yet terrifying civilization like the ones imagined by fantasy writer
H.P. Lovecraft.</LD>
<TE>   None of this, however, matters much to actors who are here with
their films, whether beginners such as Agnes Bruckner or world famous
such as Robin Williams. Bruckner, all of 16, is a gifted young
actress whose heartfelt performance made the coming-of-age drama
"Blue Car" (unaccountably not in the competition) one of the
festival's first successes, complete with a sale to Miramax.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God, I've been just so emotional, it's been so exciting
I've been crying all day," says Bruckner, who lives with her family
in Burbank and is understandably elated. "For me, everything has just
built up to this moment. I'm finally here, I've finally arrived."</TE>
<TE>   With four Oscar nominations as an actor (and a victory for "Good
Will Hunting"), Williams couldn't be more established, but he is
almost as excited to be here: "I have seen the mountain," he says in
one of his infinite accents. "It was good." And in some ways his new
film, "One Hour Photo," written and directed by music video auteur
Mark Romanek, represents as important a milestone in his career as
Bruckner's does in hers.</TE>
<TE>   Williams plays Sy Parrish, a photo booth operator at a local
SavMart who becomes terrifyingly obsessed with a particular family.
Not only does Sy have grotesque nightmares in which blood spurts from
his eyes, he ends up acting in such a savage, sadistic way that
Williams himself said, "This is a bizarre, creepy movie," when he
came out to take a bow and answer questions at the premiere.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," he added in his trademark style, "I have to come out and
make people laugh, be an emotional sorbet."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, whose interview mode ranges from the thoughtful to the
wildly funny, is well aware that this kind of a role--perhaps his
first chilly part since a cameo in Kenneth Branagh's 1991 "Dead
Again"--is not what's expected from him after a spate of warmly
sentimental films. His agent pursued the script "as a wild shot; I
wasn't even on a list, no one's going to send this to me off the
bat." He had lunch with Romanek, "who thought it was one of those
token meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "When I said I wanted to do it, he went, 'No!' I think it really
shocked him."</TE>
<TE>   If people are going to be shocked at Williams in a non-Patch Adams
mode, they are going to have to get used to it. The actor has at
least two similar films coming out: "Death to Smoochie," directed by
Danny DeVito ("he's the darkest guy around; when I asked if he wanted
me to lighten up he said 'No, no'") and "Insomnia," co-starring Al
Pacino  and directed by "Memento's" Christopher Nolan.</TE>
<TE>   Though he's looked at things such as interview tapes with serial
killer Jeffrey Dahmer to prepare for these roles, Williams is not the
kind of actor who takes his parts home with him. "Once you have a
family, the method stuff goes away very quickly. I did it on one
movie, and it scared my kids. You can't say"--a lightening voice
change here-- "'I'm going to my study. Don't mind the noises of an
animal being sacrificed.'"</TE>
<TE>   Though he joked at the premiere that he did "One Hour Photo"
because "'Mister Rogers on Ice' was already taken," it was a
combination of factors that led to this spate of darker material,
starting with Williams' feeling that "for me the job is to play as
many different characters as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Williams is also aware that critics and audiences have not
invariably applauded his choice of roles. "I know it's out there,
there's been negative response to certain films. People will come up
to you and say, 'If you ever make another movie like that, I'll hurt
you.' This is interesting feedback. Does it make me deny the validity
of what I've done? No. Does it make me want to look for other things?
Yes.</TE>
<TE>   "Going too much one way is not good. 'Goebbels: The Musical,' that
I don't want to do, but the moment you start limiting yourself, it's
bad news. I want to change the perception."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest factor in Williams' shift was a birthday.
"Once I hit 50," he jokes, changing his voice, "I'm looking for
characters. The romantic parts are over. Mr. Pitt, he gonna take it
now." More seriously, he says that at 50 "you hit this phase where
you look at stuff. The time is changing, you're on the clock now,
it's like, 'This is it.' You want to maximize what you do."</TE>
<TE>   One result of that is a determination "not to rush off and do
things. If I have to wait for something, I'll wait. There have been
times when I rushed into things. Sometimes it was pure greed,
sometimes it was 'we'll make it better.' I don't believe 'we'll fix
it' anymore. Don't ever go that way."</TE>
<TE>   If Williams was gratified at the response "One Hour Photo" got,
Bruckner, so unfamiliar with Sundance she "brought this suitcase full
of all these fancy clothes because I thought it was going to be a
red-carpet type of place" was even more so about "Blue Car." "People
are clapping at the screenings. One night I got this ovation and when
I got to the mike I was so blown away I was speechless," she says.
"One of my friends is here with me and she started bawling, telling
me how proud she is of me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unlike young actresses such as Claire Danes and Natalie Portman
who've been at it most of their lives, Bruckner started taking acting
lessons only "three or four years ago" at the suggestion of her
mother, Nina Bruckner. At first, she says, "it was 'my mom put me
into this,' then it was 'my mom and I are in this together,' now it's
'I'm doing this.' I just grew to love acting; I can't imagine not
doing it."</TE>
<TE>   "My mom has been my hero, my everything," Bruckner says with her
usual emotion. "She always told me you have to be very, very strong
to survive in this business, that 90% of the time you're going to be
denied. She's been there by my side when I didn't get parts, she'd
say, 'Agnes, we didn't get this job, but we'll get the next one.'"</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, the parts started arriving, from a year-and-a-half
stint on "The Bold and the Beautiful" to supporting parts in last
year's "The Glass House" and Barbet Schroeder's forthcoming "Fool
Proof," starring Sandra Bullock. But Bruckner's starring role in
"Blue Car," strongly written and directed by Karen Moncrieff, where
she plays a high school student from a broken home who pursues poetry
seriously on the suggestion of a male teacher, is the biggest thing
she's ever done and clearly a breakthrough performance.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a lot of drama going on in my life, personal things I
brought with me," says Bruckner, whose own parents separated a year
and a half ago. . "I brought all this emotion with me, and it just
worked, it just clicked."</TE>
<TE>   It's not only her success at Sundance that Bruckner can't quite
believe, it's her whole career. She especially remembers the day she
signed with Paradigm Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sitting at the end of this long conference table and all
these agents were looking at me. They said, 'We're going to sign you,
you're going to be a star.' And I'm thinking 'Oh my God.' Since then,
since I got the role on 'The Bold and the Beautiful,' I've been
practicing what I'm going to say on the Jay Leno show."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe now she'll get the chance.</TE>

<LD>The entertainment world has begun the annual ritual of patting its
denizens on the back, generating sizable audiences last week for the
People's Choice and American Music awards, based on viewing estimates
issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   The AMAs finished just a hair below last year, while CBS' People's
Choice Awards improved by 4% compared to 2001, ending a two-year
ratings slide. That should be encouraging for upcoming award
telecasts, after CBS' American Film Institute Awards drew dismal
ratings earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   CBS regained the top spot overall thanks to the finale of
"Survivor: Africa," which dominated everything but "Friends" over its
two hours; still, viewing dropped 25% versus the previous "Survivor,"
and further erosion at that rate could shorten the franchise's
longevity.</LD>
<TE>   Sports played a role in last week's standings, as ABC shifted a
playoff football game into prime time, boosting the network's
Saturday performance and providing a boon to ABC Family, which
carried the U.S. Figure Skating Championships and set a cable ratings
record for the sport.</TE>

<HD>They Hope to Reap Where They Sowed Their Dreams</HD>
<DH>'The Slaughter Rule,' about the gritty sport of six-man
football, marks a homecoming of sorts for twin filmmakers Alex and
Andrew Smith.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The first things you notice about identical twins Alex and Andrew
Smith are the few differences that they do have.</LD>
<LD>   Alex is the taller one, standing about 2 1/2 inches above 6-foot-1
Andrew, and Alex is huskier, too, by about 15 pounds on the scale.
And Andrew, with his glasses, gives the appearance of the
brainy-looking one.</LD>
<LD>   And then there's the fact that the 34-year-old brothers, who grew
up near Missoula, Mont., now live on opposite ends of the
continent--Alex in Los Angeles and Andrew in New York.</LD>
<TE>   But one thing the Smith brothers share equally is their passion
for filmmaking, and their appearance here this week at the Sundance
Film Festival marks a homecoming, for it was here many years back
that their dreams of writing and directing movies found sustenance.
At 18, Alex and Andrew first worked at Sundance as volunteer ticket
takers, catching the festival screenings of independent films
whenever time allowed. For the next decade, they would return every
winter to this mountain resort town to perform other jobs for
Sundance, working in the box office, answering phones or managing
theater venues, while getting to know some of the up-and-coming
filmmakers.Now, they have returned with their first feature-length
film, which they began to write in 1992 and spent years developing.
The film, called "The Slaughter Rule," is a searing drama set in the
brutal dead of winter on the plains of Montana. The story revolves
around a high school quarterback who is cut from the team and a
down-on-his-luck former coach who persuades him to play again, only
this time in that gritty slice of small-town Americana known as
six-man high school football.</TE>
<TE>   The movie, which is in the festival's dramatic competition, stars
veteran character actor David Morse ("The Green Mile") in what some
at Sundance are saying is one of his finest performances, and young
Ryan Gosling, who electrified this film festival last year playing a
Jewish youth who becomes a neo-Nazi in "The Believer," a film that
won the audience award.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers say Morse's character, Gideon Ferguson, is based on a
man they knew who coached basketball when they were growing up in
rural Montana. He was an odd, lonely figure with a shaky reputation
in town who would check the list of those high school players cut
from the team and then recruit them to his team in a local men's
league.  And there were also unfounded rumors of molestation.</TE>
<TE>   "We were cut as freshmen from our high school team and were
recruited on a men's league team by this strange guy in Missoula,"
Alex recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew said the man would call the cut players and say, "I got a
team I put together." He would sell newspapers at bars around closing
time to make a living.</TE>
<TE>   The dark rumors about the coach became a "rural myth," they
recalled, never proven, only the stuff of local gossip.</TE>
<TE>   "There was never anything untoward that happened," Alex said. "He
was a guy who was kind of bruised up by life and kind of a lonely guy
whose only joy was coaching this time. But we both almost bought into
the rumors."</TE>
<TE>   Then a strange thing happened. In college, Alex called up Andrew
one day and said he was writing a short story about this coach they
used to know and was surprised to discover that his brother had been
working on a short script about the man.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there was a little bit of personal shame that was
involved," Andrew said. "Later on, a sense of like, we didn't give
this guy a fair shake. We didn't out him or dis him or anything, but
we just sort of went with the prevailing myth in the town."</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Morse approaches Gosling's character, Roy Chutney,
while hawking his newspapers late at night. Knowing Roy has been cut
from the high school team, the coach invites him to play quarterback
on a six-man team he is forming. "I hail from West Texas," Gideon
tells Roy. "Six-man is a religion down there."</TE>
<TE>   Morse and the filmmakers attended real six-man games to get an
insight into how much more demanding it is--with players performing
on offense and defense--than regular 11-man games. The reason they
play with only six players on a side is because the rural areas are
so sparsely populated. Morse called a state championship game he
watched "one of the most exciting football games I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   "You watch these kids, like in the film, they have to do
everything," Morse said. "Defense and offense. They don't get a
break. They have to be tough to play this game."</TE>
<TE>   (The film's title comes from a term used in six-man games that
says if the opposing team is up by 45 points, the game automatically
ends no matter how much time remains).</TE>
<TE>   Using real-life players, the filmmakers shot scenes in Great Falls
and the surrounding communities of Augusta, Brady, Broadview,
Centerville, Geraldine, Heart Butte, Highwood and Power. There is one
memorable sequence, filmed with residents of the Blackfeet Indian
Reservation, where real-life homecoming queens dressed in gowns
accompany the players onto the field as elders bang out drums and
sing Indian tribal songs. Alex and Andrew say they captured it just
the way it really happens with the girls wearing their actual
dresses.</TE>
<TE>   In one scene charged with electricity, Gideon invites Roy up to
his room to bandage a cut hand Roy has injured in a fight. In the
ensuing sequences, Gideon unburdens himself about his life, including
the fact that he had been in a boat with another football player who
had drowned.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what it was like working with two first-time directors,
Morse replied: "I got to know them over the five years it took to
make this thing, at least since they asked me to do it. There is a
very calm dynamic between the two of them.... You never get a sense
of any desperation or making decisions out of fear, maybe because
they have each other to bounce things off, they're not quite so
alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I think directing can sometimes be the loneliest job in the
world. Everybody is turning to you for the answer and you haven't got
a clue. Sometimes you've got to make things up to keep things moving.
But I think because they had each other, they could always get into a
huddle and figure things out."</TE>
<TE>   Alex and Andrew admit they fight like brothers when writing
scripts but made a conscious effort to hide their tempers on the set.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we couldn't fight on set because the energy on the set is
kind of a tenuous thing and everyone is watching you," Alex said. "We
also didn't want the actors to play mom against dad, like 'You said I
could do this.'"</TE>
<TE>   Raised on a non-working ranch about 20 miles outside Missoula, the
twins said they inherited a love of writing from their parents. Their
late father, David, taught at the University of Montana and their
stepfather, William Kittredge, once ran the creative writing program
there. Their mother, Annick Smith, is a writer and filmmaker who has
directed documentaries.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of writers live in Montana," Alex said. "You've got space,
you get left alone and there's a writing community, so we grew up
sort of immersed in that community."</TE>
<TE>   But it was Sundance that introduced them into the world of
independent filmmaking. It was, in effect, their own film school.</TE>
<TE>   "We were like sponges," Alex recalled. "We went to everything we
could, every seminar, every screening. Especially at the [Sundance]
lab. There were all these incredible filmmakers who we had access
to."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, they sat down and began writing their script but
underwent a long odyssey. They first sought a director to make it,
but he wanted to change it into his vision of a football movie and
they couldn't stomach that approach.</TE>
<TE>   In graduate school--Alex went to the University of Texas, Andrew
to the University of Iowa--they would work during their free time on
punching up the script.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, they submitted the script several times to the
Sundance screenwriting and directing labs and were rejected. The
brothers said they think they had closer scrutiny because the labs
didn't want to cut them any slack.</TE>
<TE>   They eventually got the financial backing they needed to make the
movie their way. The movie was produced by independent producer
Michael Robinson ("Trueblood") and by Gregory (producer) and Gavin
(executive producer) O'Connor, whose most acclaimed work is
"Tumbleweeds."</TE>
<TE>   As for the Smith brothers, they are currently writing "The
Faithful," a Civil War ghost story, for Disney Pictures and hope to
finish another film they want to direct about a town in Montana in
the 1920s where Communism was in vogue.</TE>
<TE>   Now that they are back at Sundance, the brothers can take
satisfaction that their years of work have finally paid dividends.</TE>
<TE>   As morning snow flurries dusted the streets as festival moviegoers
lined up for a screening on Main Street, Andrew looked out the window
of a restaurant and remarked: "It feels like coming home."</TE>

<LD>The address is Arizona but the crowd is heavily Californian at the
nation's biggest auction of collector cars, sports cars, hot rods and
American muscle cars.</LD>
<LD>   Called simply Barrett-Jackson, the four-day event in Scottsdale
draws upward of 150,000 enthusiasts and this year offers everything
from a 1926 Packard roadster to the original factory prototype of
Irvine car builder Steve Saleen's 550-horsepower S7 super car.</LD>
<LD>   When the event kicks off tonight with a black-tie party for 5,600
registered bidders and sellers, one of them will be Beverly Hills car
collector David Sydorick, who calls Barrett-Jackson "an annual winter
pilgrimage to Arizona and the sunshine." Originally specializing in
high-priced classic cars from the pre-World War II era, the
31-year-old auction now offers more contemporary vehicles. This
year's catalog is a feast of American metal from the '30s through the
'80s and includes a collection of NASCAR memorabilia.</LD>
<TE>   "It's difficult these days to sell million-dollar cars and easier
to sell $100,000 cars," Sydorick said, a nod to the a recession can
have on even the very wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   But Barrett-Jackson isn't just about wealth. It draws a mixed
crowd, and many of the cars sold go for prices that aren't far
removed from what the local used-car dealer might charge.</TE>
<TE>   "Finding those bargains is one of the reasons you go," said Bob
Johnson, a Georgia car collector who turned his hobby into a business
a decade ago and now scours the auction circuit seeking vehicles to
sell from his 18,000-square-foot showroom in Gainesville, just
northeast of Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Bargain-basement deals are getting rare, though.</TE>
<TE>   Barrett-Jackson charges sellers as much as $1,000 to put a car on
the block, Johnson said. That, along with auctioneer's fees that can
be as much as 8% of the winning bid, have pushed up prices in recent
years--a critical point because sales at Barrett-Jackson often become
the benchmark for collector-car pricing.</TE>
<TE>   "But they get the buyers with the money, and they get the best
cars, and that's why the buyers keep coming back," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Auction President Craig Jackson said this year's auction will have
more than 800 cars and more than 4,000 registered bidders, who pay
$200 each for the privilege. Last year, with a record 850 cars on the
block, Barrett-Jackson reported that 702 were sold for a total of
$26.7 million, including commissions and fees. That's an average of
just more than $38,000 per vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the generally high quality of cars offered at
Barrett-Jackson, one draw is that many are offered with no seller's
reserve--meaning there's no minimum bid.</TE>
<TE>   "That's important to a lot of guys," said Sydorick, whose last
purchase at the auction was a 1953 Chevrolet pickup truck he bought
in 1999 for a friend. "It's the way you can sometimes get a deal."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said that although spectators and bidders come to
Barrett-Jackson from all over, including Asia and Europe, "the vast
majority of registered bidders are from California. There's just such
a huge car culture there," plus the proximity.</TE>
<TE>   Car auctions that feature lots of exotic metal and wealthy bidders
tend to attract spectators who come just for the excitement and the
chance to see and be seen. "They come for the atmosphere and to see
the cars and people and to go to the parties, and some of them come
back as bidders. Most of the registered bidders started out as
spectators," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Last June, the company began a second U.S. auction at the Petersen
Automotive Museum in Los Angeles to take advantage of the area's
concentration of auto collectors. Jackson said it will be an annual
event. Barrett-Jackson also stages a vintage race car auction every
other year in Monaco in conjunction with the Historic Grand Prix
street race there.</TE>
<TE>   But Scottsdale is the centerpiece. The auction grounds occupy
almost 150 acres of desert--two-thirds of it parking for spectators
who come for one or more of the four consecutive days of 9 a.m.-to-10
p.m. auction activity.</TE>
<TE>   The main auction tent is a behemoth, 1,000 feet long and 140 feet
wide.</TE>
<TE>   Cars to be auctioned in the main tent first are on display in a
quartet of smaller tents--each covering 40,000 square feet--and the
whole complex is surrounded by tents, kiosks and stands erected by
some 500 vendors.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson won't say how much it costs to stage the auction, except
that "it's in the millions." The company employs a permanent staff of
30, and the payroll swells to 300 during auction week, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, the Georgia collector, said he's part of the growing
crowd that shows up the week before to hit several smaller auctions
that have sprung up to take advantage of the Barrett-Jackson crowds.
In all, there are five collector-car auctions in the Scottsdale area
over the course of the week.</TE>
<TE>   But the party atmosphere that makes the week so much fun for so
many also can take its toll.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said he took in $140,000 from cars he sold at Scottsdale
auctions, including the Barrett-Jackson last year. But he spent
$160,000 adding to his collection.</TE>
<TE>   "I always buy more than I sell, that's the stupidity of this
hobby. That open bar they have there kind of dulls your senses," he
said with a chuckle. "Those boys aren't stupid. They give away $100
worth of liquor and get $1,000 worth of commissions."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Johnson says he wouldn't think of missing a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the Super Bowl, the World Series, the Indy 500 of car
auctions," he drawled.</TE>

<HD>Cars as Marketing Tools: What a Concept!</HD>
<DH>Design* Manufacturers with an eye on the bottom line now
want a little pragmatism built into their dream cars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concept cars, once little more than physical manifestations of
designers' wildest fantasies, have taken on considerably more
significance in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   They continue to be explorations of shape and style, technology
and function. But as the auto industry grows ever more competitive
and profit margins get thinner and thinner, designers are being told
to aim for reality.</LD>
<LD>   So concepts now double as marketing tools, and although what you
see on display at an auto show isn't exactly what makes it into
production, they often provide clues about what car makers plan for
future production.</LD>
<TE>   The Chrysler Crossfire roadster unveiled as a 2004 production
model at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show this year, for instance,
was a concept at the Detroit show last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of concepts has changed since the '80s," said San
Diego-based auto industry consultant Gordon Wangers. "The idea now is
that they don't build them unless they have a pretty good chance of
making the starting team."</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, concepts are used to generate publicity. Within
months of introducing a concept of an updated version of Britain's
iconic Mini Cooper in 1999, BMW--which acquired the brand with its
1994 purchase of Rover Group--had visitors lining up to gawk at car
shows and car magazines screaming for it to be built.</TE>
<TE>   The new Mini hits showrooms this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Another version of that story could be building after the
introduction of the Lincoln Continental Concept earlier this month at
the Los Angeles show.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. last week announced that as part of its financial
turnaround plan it will end production of the current Continental,
which has sold poorly.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Ford, realizing that the average Lincoln customer
was more than 60 years old, cut the brand loose, moved its
headquarters to Southern California and told top managers to soak up
some Southland attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln got a new design team and a new charter: As the only
American brand in Ford's Premier Automotive Group, Lincoln must
become the symbol of American luxury.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln design chief Gerry McGovern said the Continental Concept
is a study in thematic elements that probably will wind up in a new
Lincoln flagship in the not-too-distant future.</TE>
<TE>   Whether that flagship will resurrect the venerable Continental
name is unclear. But it certainly will resurrect some classic
Continental themes. The concept drips with them, including the slab
sides and center opening that graced the Lincolns of the 1960s era.</TE>
<TE>   Concepts also provide strong clues about where the industry is
headed in terms of new types of vehicles, said George Peterson,
president of AutoPacific Inc. consultants in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the late 1980s and '90s, concept versions of pickup
trucks and sport-utility vehicles abounded--and trucks have been the
growth engine of the U.S. market for the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Tastes now are changing, and although sleek sports cars and coupes
still capture attention, the most commonly seen concepts examine ways
to combine car-quality ride and handling with the storage capacity,
commanding road view and all-weather capabilities of a pickup or SUV.</TE>
<TE>   In the accompanying photos, Highway 1 takes a peek at key concepts
unveiled at the Detroit and Los Angeles shows.</TE>

<HD>Mini's Pricing Makes Car a Bargain BMW</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the new Mini Cooper hits showrooms in the U.S. later this year,
it will be the least expensive car from BMW Group in decades.</LD>
<LD>   Except for the pedal cars and radio-controlled models turned out
by the company's lifestyles unit, vehicles from Bayerische Moteren
Werke start in the high $20,000s and move up rapidly from there.</LD>
<LD>   Mini pricing released last week starts at $16,850 for the basic
four-passenger, 115-horsepower model--the equivalent of a modest down
payment on a stripped BMW 7-Series luxury sedan.</LD>
<TE>   The turbocharged, high-performance Mini Cooper S, with almost 42%
more horsepower than the basic Mini, a sportier interior, bigger
tires and wheels and a more sophisticated suspension, will start at
$19,850.</TE>
<TE>   The prices might sound a little steep for a boxy subcompact, but
consider that it seats four with plenty of room (it is a tall little
box), goes like a bat out of you-know-where and scoots around corners
like a go-kart on steroids, and you start to get the idea.</TE>
<TE>   You could ditch plans to buy the smallest of the BMW 3-Series
coupes, get a Mini Cooper instead and still have $11,000 left for
options, a couple of house payments and a trip to Europe to see where
they are made. Even a Mini Cooper S would leave you plenty of
change--almost $8,000.</TE>
<TE>   If you simply must spend more in order to hold up your head at the
country club, there are about 30 options that can be ordered
separately, as well as a trio of option packages that bundle a number
of related goodies at a discount.</TE>
<TE>   The self-explanatory sport package and a luxury-oriented premium
package are priced at $1,250 each. A cold-weather kit (heated mirrors
and similar stuff) is $500.</TE>
<TE>   Mini is a separate brand of BMW Group, and the cars will be sold
through a separate dealership network in the U.S. So far, 70 dealers
have been appointed, eight of them in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The company says it expects to sell 20,000 Minis in the U.S. in
the first full year of sales.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. version is a revival of the British commuter car that has
been popular in Europe since it was introduced in 1959 but not sold
here since 1967.</TE>

<HD>Ford Ties With Toyota for Brand Leadership in Southland,
Data Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. has had more problems than prizes lately, but whatever
its corporate woes, Ford products--particularly trucks--remain a
favorite in import-crazy Southern California, according to sales
reports filed last year with J.D. Power &amp; Associates by 187 area
new-car dealers.</LD>
<LD>   Data compiled by the Agoura Hills market consulting firm show Ford
tied with Toyota for brand leadership in Southern California, each
with 21% of the market, unchanged from 2000. General Motors Corp. was
third with a 17% share, up from 16%; Honda was fourth with 12%, up
from 11%; and Chrysler was fifth at 8%, down from a 9% share.</LD>
<LD>   Nissan, which was late to the party with new models, finished
sixth, as its share of the Southland market fell to 4% from 8%.</LD>
<TE>   Ford led the truck category with its F-150 outselling all other
pickups, according to the Power data; Chevrolet's Silverado 1500
pickup captured second place, the Ford Ranger took third, followed by
Toyota's Tacoma in fourth place and Tundra in fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Ford also led the sport-utility category with the Expedition in
first place and the Explorer in second. Chevy took third with the
Tahoe, Toyota's 4Runner was the fourth best-selling SUV and the Jeep
Grand Cherokee was fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Honda Accord was the best-selling passenger car. The Civic was
second, Toyota's Camry and Corolla took the next two slots, and
Ford's Focus finished fifth.</TE>

<HD>Gas Going Up, but Not Enough to Alter Habits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As you drive by gas stations today, you can't help but notice the
price of gasoline. Among all the items offered for sale in our
economy, nothing generally commands a bigger sign for advertising its
price than gas. Not the price of a house. Not the price of
toothpaste. Not even the price of a car.</LD>
<LD>   You can spot the price of a gallon of gas from 50 yards.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to get away from it. Gas prices are supposed to be
important, determining how much of our disposable income we dole out
for transportation and how much economic power foreign suppliers hold
over the United States. It's a politically charged statistic,
connected by history to the monopolistic corruption imposed on
Americans more than a century ago by the Standard Oil trust.</LD>
<TE>   All these factors explain a lot about why the price of gasoline
seems to be on the minds of so many motorists, not to mention the
news media, government regulators and economists. And, once again,
the price of gasoline is going up.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago you could find gasoline for less than $1 a gallon,
but now prices have popped back over the key psychological level of
$1.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect it to rise between now and spring," said David
Costello, an Energy Department economist. "There is lots of room for
the price of gasoline to go up, if you think 20 cents a gallon is a
lot."</TE>
<TE>   To some, it is.</TE>
<TE>   "If I bought a sport-utility vehicle when gas was $1 per gallon
and now it goes to $1.50 per gallon, I worry," said Michael Flynn,
director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of
Automotive Transportation. "It bothers me. Toothpaste, you don't buy
as often, and the price fluctuations you don't notice as much."</TE>
<TE>   Because of its recent no-interest financing promotions, a lot of
people bought General Motors sport-utility vehicles and trucks, Flynn
said. "Those people are going to be very upset when gasoline gets
back to the levels of last summer, when gas was $1.70 per gallon."</TE>
<TE>   But the price of gasoline is so cheap by any historical standard
that consumers should dismiss a 20-cent-a-gallon increase. Indeed,
they should easily absorb a $2 or $3 or $4 price rise.</TE>
<TE>   It would take $5-a-gallon gas to radically change consumer
behavior, given the historical relationships price of gasoline,
average household income and the fuel efficiency of the vehicles we
drive, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline prices, adjusted for inflation, peaked in 1981 and
generally have been going down ever since. And most people are better
able to afford gasoline than ever before. Average family income has
been growing, so people have more income to spend on gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, gasoline sold for $1.38 a gallon and per-capita personal
income was $11,280, according to data from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis and the Energy Information Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Now, gasoline sells, on average, for $1.11 a gallon nationally and
per-capita income is $28,546. The drop in the ratio of gasoline price
to family income means that a gallon of gas imposes less than a third
of the burden on our income today than it did in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Offsetting that is the growth in vehicle usage. People drive more
every year, by a margin of about 2% to 3% annually, according to
Costello.</TE>
<TE>   And consumers have shifted their buying to heavier, less
fuel-efficient trucks and sport-utility vehicles. Between 1987 and
2001, average vehicle fuel economy declined nearly 8% to 20.4 miles
per gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, most experts agree that American households are
spending a smaller percentage of their income on gasoline than at any
time since the 1980s. And it would take a substantial jump in
gasoline costs--perhaps to between $3 and $6 a gallon--to get back to
where we were then.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said he would concur with such an assessment.</TE>
<TE>   So, it is not surprising that although consumers grumble about
relatively small increases in the cost of gasoline, they continue to
disregard the cost when investing in new vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no real incentive for people to buy fuel economy," said
David Cole, president of the auto research center at Altarum Corp., a
nonprofit organization in Michigan. "If you go from 30 mpg to 40 mpg
in a vehicle, it saves just 30 cents per day, based on 12,000 miles
of driving per year."</TE>
<TE>   Even after last year's electricity crisis in California, consumers
are quickly resuming their normal outlook on energy, Cole said.
Concerns about scarcity have faded. And save for environmentalists,
there are few political or economic forces that advocate for energy
efficiency, Cole noted.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than the cost of gasoline, the availability of gasoline
seems to be the most important consideration for consumers, a
condition that has been reinforced steadily over the last 20 years as
the real price of gasoline has dropped.</TE>

<HD>Making the Perfect Kitchen</HD>
<DH>Or, the Trouble With Glancey</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What price perfection? For those of us in the United States, $40, or
in Canada, $60. That's what Clarkson Potter is charging for the book
"Living and Eating," a "recipe for a simple, perfect lifestyle" by
British authors John Pawson and Annie Bell.</LD>
<LD>   Pawson is a modern architect known in London for his designs of
minimalist restaurants with Far Eastern themes. Bell is a food writer
with the Independent newspaper. As the book's many photographs
reveal, they are attractive people. Pawson has a beautiful home and
Bell produces exquisite-looking food. In this new book they endeavor
to impart their style to us.</LD>
<LD>   Traditionally, the best way to "read" a cookbook is by cooking a
dish or two and seeing how they turn out. But in my case, the quest
for style came before food. Perhaps it was a New Year's impulse.
Maybe it was a case of deep-seated longing. But just once, just for a
moment, I wanted a shot at perfection.</LD>
<TE>   Pawson and Bell begin their book by exhorting us to clear the
clutter: "Get rid of everything which is unnecessary and distracting
and you are left with what actually matters," they say. In the book,
only a fruit bowl adorns the Italian stone counter of John Pawson's
kitchen. As I surveyed my kitchen, I was sure that the fruit bowl was
in there somewhere. But that is not to say the things obscuring it
did not matter, I argued to myself.</TE>
<TE>   As I scanned the room, I ran through a defensive mental inventory
of my clutter. The stock pot matters, I thought. It lives on the
stove. Next to the stove, the chopping board matters. So do mustard
pots filled with spoons and spatulas, a scale that also holds
pot-holders and dish-towels, the salt dish, pepper grinder, a 1970s
tray from Habitat with an African motif, knife blocks and a fat jar.</TE>
<TE>   Over on the main run of counter surrounding the kitchen sink,
there was a certain jumble, yes, but you just had to know the system.
To the right of the sink go keys, pocket junk, parking tickets,
newspapers and bicycle helmet. Aha! There was the fruit bowl, under
the newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Above it, the window ledge was lined with milk bottles holding
salvia cuttings, bags of poppy seeds, half of a perfectly useable
nutmeg, some spare change, some safety pins, some wildflower seeds
collected on a seaside walk in Pt. Reyes and some ripening--whoops,
rotten--cherry tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Next to the sink, there was the chipped pink flower pot with the
sponges, the bottle of dishwashing liquid, the hand soap, the
moisturizer and, often as not, a bottle of Ironite plant food. Not
pretty, maybe, but if you wanted clean dishes, moisturized hands and
green plants, they all mattered.</TE>
<TE>   Within the sink, the main basin was empty and shone. There's
perfection for you, I thought. A plastic compost bucket with
vegetable trimmings resided in the smaller basin. It was lidded. The
top was wiped. It didn't smell.</TE>
<TE>   But it couldn't be accused of design merit. I turned to page 28
and looked under "Waste Disposal." Garbage disposals are noisy, the
authors complain. "There is something unnatural about these
conveniences--perhaps it is the nature of the waste they ingest. A
conscientious country dweller would simply trail out to the compost
heap."</TE>
<TE>   Hmm, I thought. Do country folks in Britain really "trail out to
the compost heap" every time they have a potato peel, orange rind or
coffee grind? Here in downtown Los Angeles, we need buckets in our
sinks and go out to the heap when a) it's light outside and b) the
bucket's full.</TE>
<TE>   But it was not the moment to get bogged down with cultural
differences involving the disposal of lettuce bottoms and apple
cores. My eye moved on with the clutter inventory. To the left of the
bucket, there was another basic necessity: the dish-drainer, where
the cast-iron frying pan lives when it's not being used, along with a
coffee mug, a coffee pot and most of my knives.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as the counter took another sharp left out into the room,
expanding into something of a breakfast bar-cum-work station, there
was the jug used to measure out bird seed. Total necessity. Two
watering cans, one for filling the dog bowl, the other to, well, keep
it company. The gym bag went there because it held a wet bathing suit
that would fester if I put it anywhere else and forgot to remove the
suit. The dog food dish was there because it was half full of kibble
left behind by a thin terrier, then put out of reach of a waddling
Lab. The muddy tennis balls belonged to the Lab.</TE>
<TE>   This, I insisted to myself, was not a messy kitchen. Granted, the
muddy tennis balls shouldn't be on the counter. I put them in their
rightful home, the bread drawer, and stood back to regard my favorite
room.</TE>
<TE>   It still was not perfection.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-four hours later, it was closer. The dog's dishes were
emptied, washed and stashed away. Their water bowl was put outside.
So were the dogs. Parker, the black Labrador retriever, Glancey, the
shaggy terrier, and Clunk, the Irish wolfhound-German shepherd mix,
were staring balefully in through the French door, their panting
smearing the glass. Parker wanted her ball, Glancey wanted his food,
Clunk wanted in.</TE>
<TE>   Tough. Unlike John Pawson's kitchen, my kitchen floor is not
Italian stone that matches my counter. It's some wood-effect stuff
put in by the previous owner that I tried to upgrade with a lick of
deck paint. But today, this painted floor might as well have been
marble. It was clean and the mop and buckets had been put away. The
dogs could forget it. From this day forward, they were yard dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Their staring and panting bothered me so much, I hung a piece of
fabric over the door, which darkened the room. Parker started to
scratch. I deafened myself to it and squinted through the gloom at my
pared-down kitchen to consider how far I was still from a simple
perfect life.</TE>
<TE>   My plates were not beige to match the walls. They didn't even
match each other. The stockpot was still on the stove. I had a big
double-door fridge when Pawson liked two miniature ones that can be
hidden by sleek cabinetry. My kitchen would never look like a marble
showroom, not least because the counters are turquoise and made of
warping Linoleum.</TE>
<TE>   But more could be done. So the dish rack was stashed beneath the
sink, along with the sponges. To make room for this, I moved all the
cleaners into the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   Pulling the dish rack in and out made washing up pretty involved.
By Monday, I had begun eating take-out. All my washing-up energy went
into feeding the dogs, cleaning up and stowing away their bowls and
hustling the confused and mournful animals back outside.</TE>
<TE>   As I left for work, I shot a glance back into my newly perfect
kitchen and thought, "Boy is the cleaning lady going to be
surprised."</TE>
<TE>   That night, it was clear that she had, indeed, been taken aback.
Unable to find the cleaners in their new simply perfect home in the
bathroom, she had not cleaned.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday, Parker would not go outside after eating, Clunk would
not eat and was chewing the balcony. Glancey was in such a sulk that
he refused to come in. They had had enough. It was them or
perfection.</TE>
<TE>   I chose them.</TE>
<TE>   That night, the dogs were back inside, their bowls were
everywhere, the gym bag was on the counter, along with tennis balls,
leashes, keys and pocket detritus. The fruit bowl was put in the
dining room, and fruit stashed in a cupboard to be kept safe from
mice drawn inside by bird seed and dog food.</TE>
<TE>   If it wasn't possible to cook in a perfect kitchen, there was
still hope for some perfect food. I turned to the recipes. I know
Bell's work from the time we were both at the Independent in London,
and I am an enthusiastic fan. There are few better cooks or food
writers in the U.K.</TE>
<TE>   Here were some typically well-chosen, unpretentious, good things:
quiche, beet soup, croque-monsieurs, roast chicken, steak with
Roquefort. But I already know how to make all these things, as do
most even reasonably competent cooks I know. (Those who don't should
invest in a book by Julia Child, not an architect.)</TE>
<TE>   Stranger yet, Bell's trusted and sensible voice wasn't there.
Instead, these simple foods were offered in the richly ridiculous
tones of a didactic fop. "A well-crafted quiche is sufficiently
soignee to pass as an appetizer in miniature as well as making a
great lunch."</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing how to fix a mean Bloody Mary is an essential social
skill."</TE>
<TE>   "The morning after a May Ball, when dinner is a distant memory,
the sky is streaked with the illuminated greys and blues of dawn, and
you are starving in an unnatural way is the time to appreciate a
kedgeree."</TE>
<TE>   And my favorite: "There was a time when it was deemed good manners
to peel your guests' quail's eggs, and then society got real."</TE>
<TE>   At this line, I realized that the quest for perfection was not for
me. I have never had quail egg issues. On good days, I can find my
keys, I already make a respectable Bloody Mary, I have never been to
a May ball and I prefer kedgeree after a good night's sleep.</TE>
<TE>   But, reader, note well: The bid for perfection did produce one
important tidbit. "Wedgewood makes the most restrained off-white
china."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Duck always seems like a complicated thing to cook, but duck breasts
are easy and they make a great winter dinner. They're available in
the freezer section of most supermarkets .</LD>
<LD>   I recently seared spiced duck breasts medium-rare (I think they're
best that way), then thinly sliced and fanned them out over a bed of
spaghetti squash. To make the squash, pierce the squash's skin in
several places with a sharp knife, then place it on a rimmed baking
sheet. Bake it at 350 degrees until tender when pierced with a fork,
45 to 60 minutes. Cut it in half, scrape out the seeds, then scrape
the flesh into strands with a fork.</LD>
<LD>   The chutney yields more than you'll need for this meal, so serve
the rest with pork, ham, lamb or other poultry. It also makes a
tasty, low-fat sandwich spread.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seared Spiced Duck Breasts</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   4 boneless duck breast halves (1 pound), skinned, trimmed of
visible fat</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   Combine the pepper flakes, cinnamon, coriander and salt in a small
dish. Sprinkle half the mix on top of the duck breasts, dividing
evenly. Gently pat the seasoning in place with your hands.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil and butter in a large nonstick skillet over
medium-high heat. When hot, place the breasts, seasoned side down, in
the skillet. Sprinkle the remaining seasoning over the unseasoned
side of the breasts. Cook, uncovered, turning only once, until the
underside is browned, about 3 minutes total for rare, about 5 minutes
total for medium. (The meat becomes tough when well done.)</TE>
<TE>   Transfer the duck to a warm platter. Cover with foil; let rest 5
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   To serve, cut each breast across the grain on a slight angle.
Place each on the cooked spaghetti squash, fanning out the slices.
Drizzle with any pan juices. Top the duck breasts with about 2
tablespoons of Warm Cranberry Apple Chutney. Serve hot, passing any
remaining warm chutney separately.</TE>

<LD>La Espanola Meats is the house that pork built.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty years ago, Juana and Frank Faraone bought a tiny Spanish
deli in Lomita. Juana, a native of Valencia, Spain, and an
enthusiastic cook, started making Spanish-style sausages. She went
back to Spain and traveled around the country swapping recipes with
small-town butchers, and her product line expanded. Over the years,
Juana and her American-born husband brought their two daughters into
the business.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, La Espanola moved into a USDA-inspected meat-processing
plant built to its specifications in nearby Harbor City. In less than
two decades it had gone from a local shop taking in $40,000 a year to
a $2-million business supplying restaurants and Spanish-food lovers
around the country. A lot of that comes from cheeses, wines and other
imports, but Spain's love affair with the pig is the foundation.</LD>
<TE>   This is obvious the moment you step into the shop, from the hams
hanging in the corner and the big deli counter selling nearly two
dozen kinds of sausage, most of them deep crimson with Spanish red
pepper (pimenton). You can also find dry-cured pork loin (lomo
embuchado), ham hocks (lacon codillo) and even bones (huesos de
jamon) for sale.</TE>
<TE>   The meat plant, which occupies most of the building, features
specialized Spanish pork-handling equipment. One odd-looking device
is a sort of workshop bench jig designed for holding a whole aged ham
at any angle you choose for convenience in boning out the meat.</TE>
<TE>   The most impressive item is the computer-controlled meat mixer,
which looks like a muscle-bound stainless-steel cement mixer--it can
hold 400 pounds of sausage meat. When it's turned on, a lid
automatically seals the top so mixing can take place in a partial
vacuum, to compact the meat by keeping pockets of air from forming in
the mix.</TE>
<TE>   Next to it is the stuffing machine. Just transfer a couple of
hundred pounds of sausage meat into it, fit sausage casings over the
nozzles and press a button, and the casings start to fill. The
sausages are transferred to a work table by hand. "Eventually," jests
Alex Motameri, the Faraones' son-in-law, "we'll probably get a
machine to do that too."</TE>
<TE>   La Espanola makes two kinds of blood sausage (morcilla), one with
rice in it and one flavored with onions. Blood sausage has to be
cooked as soon as the casings are filled to solidify it, so the plant
has a room-sized industrial oven exclusively for cooking rack upon
rack of morcilla.</TE>
<TE>   Some sausages, such as chorizo fresco (a meaty link sausage, not
much like the loose-textured Mexican chorizo we're familiar with in
Southern California), butifarrita (a mild white sausage like
weisswurst) and longaniza (a cousin to Italian hot sausage), go to a
cold locker because they're sold fresh. But most are aged, in three
aging rooms with elaborate Spanish-built equipment to regulate the
temperature, humidity and air movement.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, there are three salami-like aged sausages: Pamplona
(pork), cantimpalo (pork and beef, cumin and cayenne) and salchichon
de Vich (pork and beef, black pepper). (Cantimpalitos, though, are
cocktail-sized sausages with a slightly smoky flavor.)</TE>
<TE>   Most of the sausages called chorizos are aged too, but not as long
as the salami type. Chorizo de Bilbao is a cooking sausage flavored
with cumin and oregano as well as the usual garlic and pimenton.
Chorizo Riojano is a more garlicky cousin, chorizo Vela is a leaner
variety, and Juana Faraone describes chorizo Sarta as her bid for the
organic market--it contains no artificial preservatives. Then there's
chorizo Soria (chunks of pork loin and uncured bacon, like a sort of
spicy, unsmoked ham), chorizo blanco (the same without the pimenton)
and chorizo Leon (flavored with a smoked pimenton).</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there are two long, skinny aged sausages, chorizo
chistorra (flavored with sweet pimenton) and fuet (garlic and
nutmeg), and sobrasada Mallorquina, which has an almost spreadable
pate-like texture.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's ham. Until recently, the USDA prohibited the
importation of jamon serrano, so La Espanola has long cured its own
hams and aged them 18 months. The USDA now permits two brands of
jamon serrano to be imported (Spain still does not have a
USDA-licensed butchering facility, so the pigs are actually raised in
Spain and then shipped elsewhere in Europe to be butchered; the hams
are returned to Spain for aging), and La Espanola imports one of
them, Redondo Iglesias.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturdays, a member of the staff at La Espanola cooks up a big
batch of paella in the two-handled pan of the same name (the shop
sells paella pans in 11 sizes, all the way from single-serving to one
big enough to cook paella for 50). "We started doing this to
introduce people to our products," says Juana Faraone.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's become so popular," says Frank, "some people call up and
make reservations for it."</TE>

<LD>   Bilbao and morcilla sausage are available at Spanish markets.</LD>
<TE>   1 ham hock</TE>
<TE>   2 1/4 pounds dried fava beans</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound bilbao sausage, sliced about 1/2-inch thick</TE>
<TE>   3 cloves garlic</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound pancetta, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup Spanish extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon saffron</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound morcilla sausage, sliced about 1/2-inch thick</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The night before, place the ham hock in a large pot and cover with
lukewarm water. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Place the favas and
a dash of salt in another pot and cover them with cold water. Let
them stand overnight.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, drain the favas, place them in a Dutch oven or large
pot and add the ham hock, bilbao, garlic, bay leaf, pancetta, onion
and olive oil. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil over medium
heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and partially cover the pot. As the
favas cook, check them occasionally to make sure they're always
covered with water; you can add 1/4 cup of cold water 2 or 3 times to
make sure they don't break out of their skins. Stir occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, toast the saffron in a dry skillet over low heat, 2 to
3 minutes. Crumble and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   After the favas have cooked 45 minutes, add the saffron and
morcilla and continue simmering until the favas are tender, another
45 to 60 minutes. Add salt to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Remove 1 cup of beans from the pot and puree them in a blender or
food processor; return them to the pot. This will help thicken the
broth. Remove the ham hock and cut the meat off the bone. Cut the
meat into chunks and return it to the soup; discard the bone and fat.
Continue cooking the soup for a few more minutes, stirring once or
twice. Let rest 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</TE>

<LD>   Look for the cantimpalitos, bilbao and butifarrita sausages at
Spanish markets, where you'll also find pimenton (Spanish paprika),
saffron, Spanish rice and canned Spanish red peppers.</LD>
<TE>   1/4 cup Spanish extra virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound medium shrimp</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound calamari, cleaned and cut into rings</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound cantimpalitos cocktail sausages</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound bilbao sausage</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound butifarrita sausage</TE>
<TE>   6 small chicken drumsticks (about 3/4 pound)</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound pork loin, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 tomato, chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 green onions, diced</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons pimenton</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons saffron</TE>
<TE>   2 cups Spanish paella rice</TE>
<TE>   4 cups water</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon salt</TE>
<TE>   12 mussels</TE>
<TE>   12 clams</TE>
<TE>   1 cup fresh or frozen green beans, thawed if frozen, cut into
1-inch pieces</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup frozen green peas, thawed</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sliced Spanish sweet red peppers (pimientos morrones)</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a paella pan or very large skillet over high heat
until it starts smoking. Cook the shrimp and calamari until the
shrimp turns slightly pink and the calamari turns slightly white on
both sides, 2 minutes.Make sure you do not overcook the seafood.
Remove the seafood and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Add the sausages, chicken and pork and cook over medium-high heat
8 to 10 minutes. Remove the meats and sausage from the pan and set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the tomato, green onions and garlic in the paella pan over
medium heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes, then add the pimenton,
saffron and rice and stir well. Add the water,salt and meats to the
pan. Add the mussels and clams. As soon as the shells begin to
open--about 3 minutes for the mussels and 10 minutes for the
clams--remove them and put them in another pot, covered.</TE>
<TE>   Cover and cook until the water is absorbed and the rice is al
dente, 20 to 25 minutes. After 10 minutes of cooking, add the
calamari, shrimp, clams, mussels, green beans, peas and peppers. Stir
well. You may have to add a little water as the rice cooks.</TE>

<HD>Poi, Howdy! Introducing the Taro</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People always seem surprised to find that taro, the root vegetable
from which the gluey Hawaiian porridge poi is made, isn't only
Polynesian. In ancient times it was cultivated throughout the Old
World from China, where it's called yu, to the Mediterranean, where
the Greeks and Romans knew it as colocasia. In fact, taro is still a
regular part of the diet in much of Asia and the Caribbean, though
the potato has muscled in on its territory pretty heavily in the last
500 years.</LD>
<LD>   It just seems hard to imagine why this unimpressive lump--think of
a doughy, insipid, sweetish potato with flaky, bark-like skin and
roots sticking out of it--could be so popular. Well, for one thing,
it's quite at home in the tropics, while the potato isn't, but maybe
the main reason is that it just had a head start on other vegetables.
Some botanists think taro might have been the first vegetable ever
intentionally cultivated, and that rice was originally just a weed
that grew in taro patches.</LD>
<TE>   Certainly it doesn't hurt that just about every part of the plant
is edible, from the "roots" (technically they're corms or underground
stems, like gladiolus bulbs) to the flowers. The leaves are actually
more flavorful than the corms, but they have to be boiled twice to
get rid of their bitterness. Sometimes cultivators grow taro plants
in the dark in order to produce the delicacy of blanched taro leaves,
in a sort of parallel to the European white asparagus and Belgian
endive.</TE>
<TE>   You might have seen a taro plant without realizing it, because
some species of taro are grown as ornamentals. Each of their
yard-long stalks bears a big, broad leaf that gives taro its popular
or garden-variety name, elephant's ear.</TE>

<LD>Sonoko Sakai's article ("Faithful to the Core," Jan. 9) reminded me
of when I was living in Hong Kong, watching some of the older Chinese
men take such great pains to peel their oranges so that the peels
came out looking like works of art. It was always interesting to see
many of these men, who were itinerants living in total poverty, yet
still having the awareness to admire the qualities of food--the
beauty and the taste that food can offer.</LD>

<HD>A French Cubist Toast</HD>

<LD>Usually French toast is made with large pieces of bread, sometimes
cut thick and sometimes cut thin. But with this variation--the bread
is cut into cubes--you can eat as many or as few bites as you like.
That--and the use of nonfat egg substitute and nonfat milk--helps
keep the calories down, without making it seem like a diet dish.</LD>
<LD>   I especially like the browned part of French toast. With the
cubes, all sides brown nicely as they cook in a skillet. Then, they
puff up and finish cooking in the oven, and the centers of the cubes
remain moist and custard-like.</LD>
<LD>   Sprinkle on some powdered sugar and a little cinnamon, and have
some fruit such as bananas on the side. You can also serve the French
Toast Cubes with your favorite jam, jelly or maple syrup.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1 (1-pound) loaf French bread</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups nonfat egg substitute</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups nonfat milk</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>

<TE>   Cinnamon, for topping</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Remove the outer crust from the
French bread with a serrated knife. Cut the bread crosswise into
1-inch slices. Cut each slice into 6 cubes.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the egg substitute, milk, vanilla and granulated sugar in
a shallow glass baking dish. Place the bread cubes, a few at a time,
into the egg batter and turn to coat all sides. Let the bread stand
in the egg mixture about 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Spray a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Heat the
skillet over medium-low heat until hot. Lift the bread cubes out of
the egg mixture, letting the excess drip back into the dish. Working
in batches, place the cubes in the skillet so they are not touching
and cook, turning to brown all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove the
cubes to a large shallow baking pan.</TE>
<TE>   When all the bread has been browned, bake until the cubes are
puffed and the center is cooked through, about 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Serve the bread cubes warm, sprinkled with powdered sugar and
cinnamon to taste. Garnish with a few slices of banana or other
fruits of your choice.</TE>

<HD>Brussels Ponders: When Is a Lump a Vegetable?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Wire</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lumpy sauces have been the bane of cooks for centuries. Now they're
bedeviling bureaucrats as well. Make that Euro-crats. As reported in
the Times of London, there is a heated debate going on in Brussels
over just how lumpy a sauce can be before it must be classified as a
vegetable.</LD>
<LD>   The idea of European Union functionaries sitting around arguing
about this may seem like something out of "Yes, Minister," but for
food manufacturers, the potential consequences are enormous. Almost
$80 million is at stake.</LD>
<LD>   That's because imported vegetables are taxed at a much higher rate
than most other food goods. The tariff on sauces is 20%; on
vegetables it can go as high as 288%. The goal is to protect farmers,
but the unintended consequence is a room full of gray-suited
bureaucrats debating whether the EU's "lump limit" should be raised.</LD>
<TE>   Right now the limit is 20% by weight. Or, as stated in Regulation
288/97: "The expression 'sauce' does not cover a preparation of
vegetables, fruit or other edible plants if the percentage of those
ingredients passing through a metal wire sieve with an aperture of 5
millimeters is, after rinsing in water of a temperature of 20
Celsius, less than 80% by weight calculated on the original
preparation."</TE>
<TE>   So on one hand, you've got farmers worried that imported
vegetables might be sneaking in under the guise of overly rusticated
sauces, undercutting their market share. On the other is the lumpy
gravy lobby--Le Comite des Industries des Mayonnaises et Sauces
Condimentaires de l'Union Europeenne. The paper quoted one
manufacturer: "Most people can tell the difference between tinned
carrots and a gourmet pasta sauce."</TE>

<HD>SPAIN AND THE PIG</HD>
<DH>How does Spain love pork? Every way--fresh or cured, from
head to hoof, in sausages or jamon. It's a grand passion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEIDI PICKMAN / Special to The Times</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SEVILLE, Spain</DL>
<LD>If you ask Spaniards what their favorite food is, the answer will
probably have something to do with a pig--fresh or cured, roasted
whole or ground into sausage. The Spanish affection for pork knows no
limits.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the answer could be even simpler: jamon, the Spanish
equivalent of prosciutto. These dark crimson, explosively flavorful
hams are the crown jewel, the pot of gold at the end of the Spanish
culinary rainbow. No wedding is complete without jamon, no holiday is
celebrated without jamon, and a tapas bar without it wouldn't deserve
the name.</LD>
<LD>   Jamon is omnipresent in Spain. And as the most beloved food in a
cuisine that increasingly is becoming the focus of the world's
attention, it almost inevitably will become so elsewhere as well.</LD>
<TE>   In Spain, the violin-shaped pork legs hang everywhere, in
restaurants, small bars, grocery stores, markets and the pantries of
people like my friend Paca. Her family has a small meat-processing
factory where they cure hams, make sausages and prepare other kinds
of cold cuts to sell to regional butchers. If you ask for a ham
sandwich at her house, she goes into her pantry with a knife, slices
off a few pieces of meat from her jamon, slaps them on a sliced roll
and hands you your sandwich. (Though the trimmings of jamon may be
used for cooking, the meat itself is almost always served unadorned.)</TE>
<TE>   At the meat-processing factory the jamones are cleaned and placed
in a vat of salt for one day per kilogram of weight. Then they are
hung to cure in a room that is controlled for temperature and
humidity.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly when a jamon is ready is difficult for an outsider to
tell. All jamones are sold, the producers say, "at the right time." I
have tried and tried to find out what "the right time" means but
received only another equally vague answer--the color of the meat has
to be the right shade of dark red and the fat a bright white. I
suppose that with years of experience you learn the definitions of
"the right time," dark red and bright white.</TE>
<TE>   One thing even a beginner can understand: When jamon is "just
right," it melts in your mouth like butter.</TE>
<TE>   The usual jamon serrano, made from the white-footed pig, is
delicious, but if you really want to impress a Spaniard, serve the
kind made from the black-footed pig--the famed pata negra or Iberico.
Jamon Iberico is so revered that many Spanish families make a day's
outing out of a shopping trip to Jabugo in the southwest of Spain or
to Guijuelo in the central northwest, two villages famous for their
excellent jamon Iberico.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish raise two types of pigs popularly known as white and
black pigs. The black-footed Ibericos, a breed native to the Iberian
Peninsula, are fed acorns instead of common farm food such as corn or
wheat. While ordinary jamon serrano is aged for a period of eight to
12 months, jamon Iberico is hung for anywhere between 20 and 27
months.</TE>
<TE>   All of this gives the jamon Iberico a more intense flavor than
serrano, but because it is produced in such small quantities, it is
also costly. Whole jamon Iberico hams typically cost around $400, and
special hams can run as high as $1,000. Whole jamon serrano hams go
for less than $200.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, because of trade restrictions, it is against the
law to import jamon Iberico into the United States. Jamon serrano,
though, was approved for import in December 1997 and is now readily
available.</TE>
<TE>   Jamon is far from being the only part of the pig that Spaniards
eat. While in the United States we tend to think of pork as bacon,
ribs, roasts, chops and ham, the Spanish say, "El cochino esta bueno
hasta las andares"--the pig is good right down to its hoofs.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, in Spanish cooking, the only parts of the pig that aren't
used are the hoofs and teeth; everything else serves a purpose.
Spaniards find uses for the stomach, intestines, blood, lungs, heart,
kidneys, ears, tongue, liver, throat, fat, cheeks, feet and skin.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the intestines are cleaned and used as casings for
sausages and other cured meats, such as morcon (cured shoulder butt)
and cana de lomo (cured pork loin, considered second only to jamon).</TE>
<TE>   Paca swears that her mother, Pastora, makes the best asadura in
Andalucia. She cuts one pound of a pig's lung or heart into small
pieces and boils them. Then she fries four garlic cloves and some
diced onion in olive oil and adds the lungs for a minute to get the
flavor of the garlic. Then she puts everything in a pot with a glass
of wine and some saffron and covers the pot to simmer until tender.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, that may be a bit intense for those not brought up in a
country that worships the pig as much as the Spanish do. In this (as
well as most other things), it's better to start with jamon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two good places to buy Spanish products are La Espanola Meats Inc.
in Harbor City (see accompanying story) and the Web site
www.tienda.com.</TE>

<LD>   My friend Pastora Ruano may make a delicious asadura or callos,
but I prefer a more "common" cut of meat. Another one of her
specialties is this delicious dish, typical of her village, Colomera
(near Granada, southeast Spain) that is known for its almond trees.
In Spain, they use a clay flameproof casserole dish instead of a
skillet.</LD>
<TE>   1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   5 to 6 cloves garlic</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 (2-inch-thick) slice French baguette, cut into cubes</TE>
<TE>   1/3 pound blanched whole almonds</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Water, if needed</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds pork shoulder, cut into cubes</TE>
<TE>   1 cup white wine</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground saffron</TE>
<TE>   Flour, if needed</TE>
<TE>   Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add
the garlic, onion, bread  and almonds. Cook until golden brown,
stirring often to avoid burning, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from
the skillet.</TE>
<TE>   Place the almond mixture in a blender, add a dash of salt and 1/2
to 1 cup of water, if necessary, to facilitate blending. Blend until
smooth. The mixture should pour well, but not be too liquid. Set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the remaining 1/2 cup of oil in a skillet over medium-high
heat. Add the pork and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 6 to 8
minutes. Add the wine, 1 teaspoon of salt, the pepper and saffron.
Bring to a boil and add the almond mixture. Simmer until the meat is
tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   If the sauce seems too thin, mix a teaspoon of flour with a
teaspoon of cold water in a small bowl until smooth and add to the
skillet to thicken the sauce.</TE>

<LD>"The '97 Shafer Cabernet 'Hillside Select.' It's complex but
balanced; it has nice harmony. Winemakers tend to like wines that are
still fairly young--we have production palates. So I see the
ageability of the wine, and I think it's going to continue to
improve. Elias Fernandez is a great winemaker, and is a friend, and
it's always nice to taste a friend's wine. We had it with a lamb stew
the other night, and it was really lovely."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nothing satisfies more than an old-fashioned pot roast. For a family
of four, I cook a 4-pound boneless beef chuck roast and have plenty
left over for this hearty Eastern European-style soup.</LD>
<LD>   Here's my favorite pot roast recipe. Rub the roast all over with a
tablespoon each of dried thyme, crushed rosemary, paprika and coarse
salt. Sprinkle it liberally with pepper, and let the roast sit at
room temperature while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.</LD>
<LD>   Thinly slice 3 large onions and chop 6 cloves of garlic. Heat 2
tablespoons of oil in a Dutch oven and brown the meat on all sides.
Remove the meat and add 1/2 cup of water to the pan, scrape up any
brown bits using a wooden spatula, then return the meat to the pan.
Top the meat with the onions and garlic, cover and braise for 11/2
hours in a 350-degree oven. Turn the meat over and braise 1 hour
longer. Turn the meat once more and cook until fork tender, about 30
minutes. Slice and serve over mashed potatoes topped with some of the
braised onions and broth. Add some glazed baby carrots to make this
meal a cool-weather treat.</LD>

<LD>DEAR SOS: I'm trying to make a light cream sauce for pasta that is
flavorful but healthful. I start with a few vegetables and a
reduction of white wine, then add milk rather than cream. Usually the
milk separates. I assume it is the acid in the wine that causes the
separation. I assume cream works because of the extra fat. Any
suggestions?</LD>
<LD>   BRYAN GROS</LD>
<LD>   Oakland</LD>
<TE>   DEAR BRYAN: Yes, we have suggestions. Never assume, would be the
first one. For the sauce we recommend using ricotta cheese in the
wine reduction, and not much wine, by the way. For liquid, use the
pasta water. As the pasta cooks, it releases starch into the water;
using this water in your sauce will thicken the sauce as it cooks
down. Cook the vegetables separately, then add them to the finished
sauce, or toss them on the pasta before pouring the sauce on the
pasta.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: My husband loves pineapple upside-down cake. His mother
used to make it for him from scratch. I have a ton of cookbooks, but
I cannot find a recipe in any of them. Is it possible to get an
authentic recipe? It would mean a lot to be able to make this for
him.</LD>

<TE>   Pineapple Upside-Down Cake</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   1 (81/4-ounce) can sliced pineapple in syrup</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons butter, divided, 1 tablespoon softened</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   4 maraschino cherries, drained</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup granulated sugar</TE>
<TE>   3/4 teaspoon baking powder</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon allspice</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon grated orange zest</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup milk</TE>
<TE>   1 egg</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Drain the pineapple, reserving 2
tablespoons of syrup.</TE>
<TE>   Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a 6-inch oven-proof skillet. Add
the brown sugar and stir until dissolved. Remove from the heat. Place
the pineapple slices on top of the sugar mixture. Fill the center of
each pineapple with 1 cherry.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt and
allspice in a bowl. Blend the orange zest with the milk in a separate
bowl. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon soft butter, egg and the
reserved 2 tablespoons of syrup. Beat until blended. Add the flour
mixture and stir to make a batter.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the batter over the pineapple in the skillet, being careful
not to disturb the slices. Bake until the cake springs back when
lightly touched, 45 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes. Loosen the edges
from the sides of the pan and invert the cake onto a platter.</TE>

<HD>Red Wine of the Season: Zinfandel, What Else?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES E. OLKEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>January is Zinfandel time for me. The year's end, from Thanksgiving
to New Year's Eve, is devoted to festive eating and the Cabernet
Sauvignons, Pinot Noirs, Chardonnays and Champagnes that naturally
accompany it. But once that ball falls in Times Square, my attention
turns to more rustic foods. That's when Zinfandel becomes my red wine
of choice. Gone are the roast beef and rack of lamb, and in their
stead come sausages, pork chops with red cabbage and spaghetti with
red sauce.</LD>
<LD>   Zinfandel has a special affinity for these kinds of food, and, to
my taste, no other red wine in California comes close. There is
something about the ripe, berryish flavor of Zin, with its slightly
piquant edge, that makes it a far better mate for the sweet flavors
of those foods than the richer but drier flavors of Cabernet
Sauvignons, Pinot Noirs and most Syrahs and Merlots. I will admit
that a good Chianti also works well, but only a few California
Sangioveses resemble Chianti yet.</LD>
<TE>   Yet not every Zinfandel is right for the job. Over the last
decade, most red Zins have become riper and richer, sweeter and
deeper, but at the cost of brightness and vitality. They are dramatic
but not as food-friendly as their predecessors. I think wines of such
exaggerated ripeness go better with cheese and walnuts than with
main-course dishes. For traditional pasta in marinara or Bolognese
sauce, I still look for a fruity, medium-full-bodied Zinfandel.</TE>
<TE>   January also means Zinfandel for the people who attend the biggest
annual wine tasting in the United States. On Jan. 26, 10,000 members
of ZAP (Zinfandel Advocates &amp; Producers) gather in San Francisco to
taste the new Zinfandels of almost 300 producers. It is my favorite
wine event of the year, because I get to rub elbows with the throngs
in attendance, meet as many winemakers as possible and taste at least
a fair share of wines that will come to market over the next several
months. To learn more about ZAP, visit www. zinfandel.org.</TE>
<TE>   $* 2000 Beaulieu Vineyard, Napa Valley, $12. The Napa Valley is
not known for Zinfandel, but many fine versions of the grape are
grown in what is becoming exclusively Cabernet Sauvignon territory.
This ripe, jammy, fairly concentrated wine has plenty of youthful
brightness on its side and a streak of firming tannins. Its balance
and energy allow it to work with tomatoey pasta sauces and barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   1999 Burgess Cellars, Napa Valley, $20. A typical Burgess
Zinfandel is tight, demands some aging and is structured more like a
young Cabernet than a Zinfandel. In this vintage, though, Burgess has
opened the wine up to let its plump, berrylike fruitiness show
through without losing the underlying balance and polish that has
made the wine a fine choice over the years.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1999 August Briggs, Napa Valley, $30. This is another Napa
Valley Zinfandel that has emerged from my recent blind tastings. It's
pricey, but worth it. The expansive, complex aromas of sweet
blackberries, vanilla and creme brulee compare well with the best
Pinot Noirs for richness, and its compelling, impeccably balanced
flavors have the depth and careful construction to last for years.
This is no spaghetti wine--it should be set aside for more elegant
dinners that might include sweeter or tangier flavors.</TE>
<TE>   $* 2000 Joel Gott, California, $13. This wine may not come from
Napa Valley but the Napa connection runs deep. Gott's father,
winemaker Cary Gott, worked in Napa for years, and Joel's wife,
Sarah, has just been appointed winemaker at Joseph Phelps. This wine,
however, does not follow the more structured Napa model. It's open
and rounded in a way that fully displays its ripe, plump fruit. This
is a tasty, "drink-it-by-the-glassful" Zin with no airs or
pretensions.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1999 Grgich Hills Cellar, 55% Sonoma County/45% Napa County,
$23. The classic ripe blackberry flavors of Zinfandel show up in this
wine's insistently fruity aromas and flavors, and oak adds its own
creamy, vanilla-like richness without ever getting in the way of the
fruit. The wine is wonderfully well-balanced, with the poise and
polish to serve alongside pork roasts as well as the delightfully
bright fruit to accompany red-sauced pastas.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1999 Robert Mondavi Winery, Napa Valley, $20. This
well-proportioned marriage of ripe blackberries, raspberries and
creamy oak deserves raves for its fine balance and very deep fruit.
It is medium-full in body and relatively supple in feel for a young
wine, and just the right touch of tannin in the finish gives it
firmness. It invites current drinking but can age for several years.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1999 Pezzi-King "Estate Bottled," Dry Creek Valley, $25. Both
of Pezzi-King's recent Zinfandels (look also for the one-star
bottling from the Maple Vineyard) are very ripe and high in alcohol.
I make no bones about not liking most wines made in this style, but
this one is an exception. It somehow manages to find plenty of real
Zinfandel berry and spice fruit, and it was a perfect partner to a
slow-cooked pork roast brushed with Port and honey and dusted with
medium-hot curry powder.</TE>
<TE>   $ Non-Vintage Rosenblum Cellars "Vintners Cuvee XXIII,"
California, $9. This is the lightest and brightest of the new
Rosenblum offerings (look also for the fruit-filled two-star
"RustRidge Vineyard," $24, the deep and very ripe two-star "Annette's
Reserve Cuvee," $27, and the super-ripe, dessert-wine styled two-star
"St. Peter's Church," $40). The Vintner's Cuvee stands out not only
among Rosenblum's Zins because of its light, clean, open flavors. It
hearkens back to the era when Zinfandel was a simple quaffer for
simple pastas and pizzas. There is no sin in that, especially at this
incredibly inviting price.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Symbols</TE>
<TE>   ***A world-class wine, superb by any measure, the top 1% to 2% of
all wines tasted.</TE>
<TE>   **An exceptional wine, well worth the effort to find, 10% to 12%
of wines tasted.</TE>
<TE>   *An admirable wine, tasty, focused, attractive, about 25% of wines
tasted.</TE>
<TE>   No Rating: The best are quite pleasant and can be good buys when
moderately priced.</TE>
<TE>   $ Good value for the money.</TE>
<TE>   Below average quality, to be avoided.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1995, Anne Bunch wrote a little book called "Cooking With Garlic."
At that time, Bunch, who lives in the Santa Ynez Valley, was cooking
at a restaurant in Los Olivos called the Side Street Cafe. Customers
flocked there for her versatile and imaginative dishes and raved
about her desserts, including a luscious coconut cake filled with
pastry cream and mascarpone cheese, frosted with whipped cream and
coated with coconut. That recipe appeared in a Times Food section
story about Bunch in 1996 and was voted one of the 10 best recipes
printed during the year.</LD>
<LD>   "Cooking With Garlic" is now out of print, but the coconut cake
has survived. It is reprinted in Bunch's latest book, "A Muse Came to
Dinner," along with a new group of recipes as thoughtfully composed
as those in the prior book.</LD>
<LD>   Bunch now cooks for the deli at New Frontiers Natural Foods in
Solvang. Some of the recipes in "Muse" cater to vegans and people
with special dietary needs; however, it is not a diet or vegetarian
cookbook. The dessert chapter--one turns there immediately, thinking
of the cake--starts with fudge brownies and includes a rich apple
cranberry upside-down cake, raspberry hazelnut bars that take three
sticks of butter and a triple chocolate cake, along with wheat- and
dairy-free desserts.</LD>
<TE>   Meat, poultry and fish appear in the main dishes, but Bunch's
alternatives include a butternut squash and caramelized onion torte
with an almond crust; a mushroom and goat cheese strudel; and a
broccoli, mushroom and cheese quiche baked in a puff pastry crust.</TE>
<TE>   The word "muse," meaning a guiding spirit, fits the book because
Bunch has laced it with inspirational passages that apply to cooking
as well as to personal challenges. The introduction is called "The
Meditation of Cooking." Missy Collier of New Frontiers did the
graphics and contributed some recipes, including cheesecake brownies.
Betty Seaman was the illustrator. Photos of Bunch, her collaborators
and recipes from the book, including a roasted beet and baby spinach
salad, a cucumber feta salad and blackened salmon, are on the back
cover.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "A Muse Came to Dinner" can be ordered by mail. The price is
$29.70, which includes California state tax, shipping and handling.
Make checks payable to New Frontiers and send to 1984 Old Mission
Drive, Suite A-7, Solvang, CA 93463.</TE>

<LD>The second vintage from longtime Spago sommelier Michael Bonaccorsi
boasts a light, lyrical Pinot Noir nose and ripe sweet fruit overlain
with notes of spice and berries. The grapes come from older vines in
the Santa Maria Valley, which contributes body and finesse to this
cashmere-weight red. It's a luxury wine at a good price. Only 325
cases were made, so pick some up sooner rather than later.</LD>

<HD>Bush Hears Local Voices--When It Suits His Agenda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No sooner had George W. Bush taken office last year than he promised
a fresh approach to the West. No more high-handed Washington decrees
on public lands. The administration would listen to local
sensibilities.</LD>
<LD>   It was a smoke screen, of course. What he had in mind was wild
land development: energy extraction and mining in the Rocky
Mountains, timber harvesting in the Northwest, roads into wilderness.</LD>
<LD>   The way he proceeded was as a pied piper of local populism. He
understood that the reigning civic and economic interests in states
such as Idaho and Wyoming and Utah saw the West the same as he did:
Money in the ground. Let's get it, boys.</LD>
<TE>   Public lands protections that had been years in the making were
blocked and upended. Anything for the locals.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Bush's natural resources development policy has moved farther
west--to the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Guess what? The president's tune has changed.</TE>
<TE>   No more tenderhearted concern for local sentiment. Unlike go-go
developers in Idaho, Californians want to preserve what they have
left. So no point in listening to them.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the administration tiptoed to the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals arguing that California no longer has the right to
object to oil drilling on three dozen old and undeveloped leases in
federal waters off the state's midsection. There were no town hall
meetings, no press announcements, no photo ops, just a legal brief
dropped off at the clerk's office.</TE>
<TE>   Does Bush really intend to pursue drilling off the coast of
California? I don't know. He's quiet on the subject. But it is plain
that his administration's court filing is a move to keep the door
open. And those who have underestimated his willingness to fight on
industry's side of development have been surprised before.</TE>
<TE>   At the least, the court filing confirms the view that the
president and his administration are not interested in local views,
only in the views of those who favor development.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to oil drilling, the administration apparently
respects local voices only when they agree with the administration
and the oil industry," said Drew Caputo, attorney for the Natural
Resources Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, conservationists screamed bloody murder when Bush said
that local residents should be entrusted with the future of our
national wild lands. I joined the choir. Americans collectively hold
deed to these national forests, parks, waters and monuments. They are
not provincial assets belonging just to the people of Idaho and
Wyoming. And not to Californians either.</TE>
<TE>   Public land usage is a question for the ages now. There's not
enough left of our clean, open spaces to continue the dead-end game
of "balancing" interests between preservation and development. No
longer can we divide these lands and waters, giving half to
development and half to preservation. Each time we make that choice,
the piece that's preserved gets smaller. And it's small enough now.</TE>
<TE>   To view matters through local eyes is to cede Alaska to the
interests of Alaskans--which would mean gold mining in Denali
National Park and immediate oil drilling in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, among other things. Our remaining roadless forests
do not belong, section by section, to our neighbors in Idaho or
Montana. The tourist-hungry city of West Yellowstone should not
decide whether to reopen the adjacent national park to the screaming
mania of snowmobiles.</TE>
<TE>   No, I'm not arguing that we should heed local voices when they are
for conservation but not when they are for development. Californians,
with their behemoth gas guzzlers, cannot singularly decide that oil
drilling must go elsewhere for the sake of their scenic views any
more than Alaskans should decide the fate of our final frontier.</TE>
<TE>   The future of these lands and waters raises righteous questions
that all Americans must confront. These places are our endowment.
What are we to do with them? What will we do without them?</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has delivered his answer. Lately, he has been
saying it more quietly.</TE>
<TE>   But just because there is no announcement in Washington and no
press conference on the courthouse steps, just because there is no
roundtable of interested parties or presidential fly-by to see the
coast, the stakes remain just as high, just as permanent.</TE>

<HD>No Special Counsel on Enron</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAMUEL DASH</AU>
<BD>Samuel Dash, a professor of law at Georgetown
University Law Center, was chief counsel to the Senate Watergate
Committee and ethics counsel to the independent counsel investigation
on Whitewater.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fast developing Enron story has now reached Washington scandal
status.</LD>
<LD>   Adding to the frenzy, some Democratic leaders sound as though they
regret the demise of the independent counsel legislation, something
most of them applauded when it happened in 1999. If that legislation
had not expired, these critics would have been able to demand that
the Bush administration request an independent counsel and then make
political hay when the administration refused. This would have been
reminiscent of the Republican onslaught against Atty. Gen. Janet Reno
for refusing to request an independent counsel to investigate charges
of campaign financing misdeeds in the 1996 Clinton campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the critics can only call for the Justice Department to
appoint a special counsel. Yet on the basis of the facts known so
far, this would be wrongheaded and inconsistent, nothing more than a
return to the familiar partisan political game of "gotcha!"</LD>
<TE>   Enron's collapse may indeed justify investigations by Congress,
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department,
all of which are underway.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general and his chief of staff have properly recused
themselves because of political contributions made by Enron, and a
special Justice task force has been created to conduct the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   There appears to be no reason that the professional prosecutors on
this task force cannot be trusted to be objective and thorough.</TE>
<TE>   Then what was the necessity for past independent counsels, which
Congress legislated after the Watergate scandal?</TE>
<TE>   That legislation never was intended to replace the Justice
Department as the official law enforcement arm of the federal
government; Congress could not constitutionally do this. Rather, the
independent counsel legislation was aimed at the rare circumstance in
which an attorney general would be faced with a serious conflict of
interest in having to investigate substantial and credible criminal
charges against the president or a high Cabinet official.</TE>
<TE>   In Watergate, exactly such a conflict existed for Atty. Gen.
Elliot L. Richardson when criminal charges were pending against
President Nixon's top staff and former Cabinet members, charges that
implicated the president. At the time, Richardson appointed a
regulatory special prosecutor, Harvard law professor Archibald Cox.
Only after Nixon fired Cox did the Senate Watergate Committee
conclude that new legislation was needed.</TE>
<TE>   I believe this legislation worked well from 1978 to the mid-1980s.
It was used sparingly and had the confidence of the public. But
beginning with the Iran-Contra investigation and through the numerous
investigations involving the Clinton administration, it was overused.
It became publicly and politically unpopular and so was not reenacted
by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   So far, nothing made public about Enron would have justified the
appointment of an independent counsel. There are no charges that
President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney or any member of the
Cabinet had complicity in Enron's financial failure. Yes, Enron
Chairman Kenneth L. Lay was a major financial supporter of Bush and
thus had access to the president and Cabinet members. But such access
has always been an inherent feature of the American political system.
With no evidence of improper favors, it is at most an impropriety.
The remedy is campaign financing reform.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has disclosed that in October, just as Enron
was going under, Lay contacted Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and
Commerce Secretary Don Evans and may have asked for help in
protecting Enron's credit rating. But it seems that no such help was
given. Apparently, the administration did nothing to prevent the
company's financial failure and the resulting losses to shareholders
and employees. It is not clear what the administration could have
done, even in October. But if anyone in the administration had
intervened to save Enron, the critics would now be making even more
serious allegations. The investigations should go forward without a
supplemental independent investigator. With regard to possible
criminal charges, the Justice task force should conduct an aggressive
investigation. The accounting practices used to falsely report huge
profits, misleading investors and employees, need to be exposed and
those responsible made accountable.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional and SEC investigations must thoroughly examine
the role of corporate directors, auditors and large accounting firms
to determine whether outside audits are truly independent.</TE>
<TE>   Tragic as it is to so many investors and employees, Enron's
failure could serve as a wake-up call for American politics and
business.</TE>

<HD>A Freer Hand for Colombia</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In seemingly endless negotiations reminiscent of the 1968 Paris
argument about a suitable shape for the Vietnam peace-talk table, the
Colombian government and leftist FARC guerrillas have spent three
years talking about what topics should be on the table during their
own peace talks.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Colombia's president warned that unless the rebels
started to negotiate in good faith, the peace process would end and
he would send troops into a zone controlled by the guerrillas, who
are known as much for protecting cocaine fields as for their violence
against soldiers and civilians. On Monday, five hours before the
deadline set by President Andres Pastrana, the two parties reached an
agreement. Now they need to realize that Colombians have lost
patience with blather and inaction. The negotiators must come up with
a precise timetable for a cease-fire by Sunday, when the
demilitarized zone that was ceded to the rebels expires.</LD>
<LD>   United Nations special envoy James Lemoyne, the ambassadors from
10 countries and the Catholic Church deserve recognition for their
effort to rescue a process that was on the lip of disaster. Now
Colombia's government and the rebels each have clear
responsibilities.</LD>
<TE>   Pastrana's timing has been smart. When he issued last week's
ultimatum, public opinion already had abandoned the guerrillas. The
people are fed up with the championing of drug lords and kidnapping.
Whatever sympathy the rebels had in European circles disappeared when
three IRA terrorists were caught leaving Colombia after a visit to
the rebels in August. Then, in December, the rebels turned down a
cancer-stricken child's plea to see his kidnapped father. The child
died.</TE>
<TE>   Now Pastrana is in a good position to ask the always-supportive
United States for more help in building a credible peace process, in
part by lifting restrictions on government use of the weaponry that
comes with the U.S. anti-drug aid package. This should push the
rebels toward peace. It no longer makes sense to limit those weapons,
or information gathered by U.S. intelligence, to operations against
narcotics.</TE>
<TE>   Such aid, however, should hinge on Pastrana committing to
instilling in the army respect for human rights, and he needs to
promptly break once and for all the army's ugly ties to paramilitary
troops as ruthless as the guerrillas they fight. For their part, the
rebels must stop their massive and lucrative kidnapping business and
free the soldiers and civilians they now hold. They must also stop
attacking cities, towns and villages.</TE>
<TE>   FARC would be politically wise to show results before the
presidential elections in May. Whatever credibility it had has faded,
and the next president is likely to be less patient than Pastrana.</TE>

<LD>President Bush faces a test today  that pits his stated concern for
the welfare of Afghan and other Third World women and children
against a demand by abortion opponents. He will decide whether to
release the money Congress appropriated late last year to support
health care and family planning in Afghanistan and dozens of other
poor countries--or, in a misguided nod to anti-abortion groups,
cancel it altogether.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Bush asked Congress for $25 million to support the
United Nations Population Fund, known by the acronym UNFPA. The fund
is the world's largest source of population control help to
developing countries, providing some $5 billion in aid since it
started in 1969. That money goes to voluntary family planning,
HIV/AIDS prevention, efforts to cut infant and maternal mortality and
universal primary education. In recognition of just how critical this
work is, Congress overwhelmingly supported the president's request,
upping the UNFPA appropriation to $34 million from $25 million.</LD>
<TE>   But Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.), a dogged foe of abortion,
has asked Bush to reverse himself and block that money. Smith insists
that the U.N. agency supports family planning activities in China and
that China still enforces its one-child-per-couple policy with
mandatory abortions and sterilizations. As such, Smith argues, U.S.
funding to  UNFPA would violate a 1986 congressional ban on sending
taxpayer dollars to any organization that the president determines
supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's charges are unfounded. All activities specifically
supported by the U.N. agency, including those in China, are
completely voluntary, and the UNFPA says it does not underwrite
abortion services anywhere in the world. That's why Bush's secretary
of State, Colin L. Powell, testified in support of the agency before
Congress a year ago and why the State Department granted the
organization $600,000 last November to provide emergency help to
Afghan women.</TE>
<TE>   Millions in Afghanistan, Africa and parts of Asia teeter on the
edge of desperation. One more pregnancy, one more child could easily
push these families into starvation. The U.N. agency estimates that
the $34 million could prevent 77,000 child and infant deaths, 60,000
maternal infections or injuries, 4,700 maternal deaths and 2 million
unwanted pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after taking office last year, Bush reimposed the
so-called global gag rule, banning international family planning
groups that receive U.S. money from performing or discussing
abortion, even if they did so using money from other sources. As he
announced the gag rule, Bush insisted that he still supported
international family planning. Today he can prove it.</TE>

<LD>Like most leaders, Russian President Vladimir V. Putin knows what a
thorn in the side a free press can be. What he apparently has yet to
learn is that democracy cannot exist absent the pain of public
scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, appearing on National Public Radio during his visit to
the United States, Putin, a former colonel in the KGB spy agency,
amazed some listeners by acknowledging the importance of a free press
to his country's efforts to democratize. But last week's supposed
bankruptcy and forced liquidation of TV6, the only Russian television
network that consistently broadcasts criticism of Putin, demonstrate
once again Moscow's fitful stumbling toward that goal, a decade after
the Soviet Union's breakup.</LD>
<LD>   Most observers shook their heads in disgust when a Russian court
upheld a ruling that TV6 is out of money. TV6 is the one network that
takes risks--such as a recent broadcast in which people complained
that a three-day blackout had darkened every part of their mountain
town except the resort where Putin  skis.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration has joined proponents of democracy within
Russia in protesting the campaign against TV6, whose finances appear
to be far stronger than the court's action suggests and whose
journalists are fighting to keep the network alive. Meanwhile, the
two business tycoons who run the network--and are fierce critics of
Putin--have gone into exile to escape what they call politically
inspired criminal charges against them. They aren't the only media
figures who feel persecuted. Last month a military court in
Vladivostok sentenced a military journalist to four years in prison
for espionage. The reporter's supporters say his real "crime" was
disclosing environmental abuses by the navy, including its dumping of
radioactive waste at sea.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday Putin said he would consider pardoning the journalist.
That's a good sign. So was Putin's visit to the United States last
year. Given Moscow's history of repression, murder of Russians and
control of all the levers of power, it was remarkable to hear him
speaking openly on American radio, even taking unscripted questions
from the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Russia still has far to go in developing an independent judiciary
and truly free elections. Its human rights record in Chechnya is
appalling. Yet an impressive number of Russians continue to speak out
and push their government in the right direction. Also encouraging is
the people's optimism about the future. Until Putin embraces press
freedom with some semblance of the openness he showed on American
radio, however, his nation's steps toward democracy will lead
nowhere.</TE>

<LD>Re "Shake-Ups Launched at 4 Schools," Jan. 11: As a 40-year English
teacher with the LAUSD, I have to agree with [union representative]
Sharon Noland of Sun Valley when she says, "I've done nothing wrong."
When I retire, I will have noted only two things that improved my
workplace: the reduced class size in ninth- and 11th-grade English
classes and the introduction of the photocopy machine.</LD>
<LD>   There are a lot of good teachers in badly performing schools who
would shine more brightly if they were provided with the class size
and teaching conditions that allowed them to do their jobs. Until
education officials stop "starting afresh" and do something right to
improve those conditions, no progress will be made among our schools.</LD>

<TE>   I was dismayed to read about the status of some of the worst
schools in L.A. Unified. As a graduate of Sun Valley Junior High in
1969, it really hurts to read about the deplorable state of the
school.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't have to be this way. I can quickly think of an
extensive number of friends and family members who graduated from Sun
Valley who eventually went on to attain bachelor's, master's and
doctoral degrees from universities like Stanford, USC and the UC
system, myself included.</TE>
<TE>   We are physicians, general managers and vice presidents of large
international companies, professional scientists, movie makers and
social workers. We all came from relatively modest homes and families
in the Sun Valley area. There is no acceptable reason why the next
generation of graduates, and the ones after that, should not be able
to attain similar success rates in their scholastic opportunities. I
urge the LAUSD and the community not to let the school sink any
deeper into despair.</TE>
<TE>   All of the students deserve a decent opportunity to achieve: We
were afforded that in the 1960s; it is the least we can do for the
students of the 2000s.</TE>

<LD>Re "Wave of U.S. Immigration Likely to Survive Sept. 11," Jan. 11:</LD>
<LD>   That the "largest sustained wave of immigration in U.S. history"
seems likely to continue is a frightening prospect. Our population of
285 million is nearly twice the maximum sustainable carrying capacity
level estimated by ecologists. We already consume a hugely
disproportionate share of the world's resources and contribute an
equally disproportionate share of environmental pollution.</LD>
<LD>   With high levels of immigration we are projected to reach 1
billion people by the year 2100, barring an environmental meltdown
before then. This will be disastrous not just to us but to a world
that can little support a tripling of U.S. numbers. We should be
closing our borders not out of fear or ungenerosity but for
ecological survival. Simultaneously we should be expanding our
overseas family planning and social development aid in order to
improve the lot of the billions who will necessarily live out their
lives where they are born.</LD>

<LD>It was sad to read about the school for astrologers getting
accreditation ("Now, a Down-to-Earth Approach to the Stars," Jan.
13). Astrology is pure bunk, with absolutely no validity whatsoever.
No one can predict the future, and the positions of the stars have
nothing to do with our personality traits. Many scientific studies
have proven that it doesn't work.</LD>
<LD>   It is scary to think our leaders would rely on such pseudoscience
to make decisions about the whole world. These deluded folk at the
Astrology Institute are only teaching a method of ripping off the

<LD>Re "The Context of Terror Can't Be Ignored," Opinion, Jan. 13:</LD>
<LD>   Ignored in Milton Viorst's analysis is the fact that for the 19
years prior to 1967 the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip were in the
control of Jordan and Egypt, respectively. During this time, there
was no movement by the Palestinians or anyone else to create a state
of their own. In fact, Jordan annexed the West Bank as its own
territory.</LD>
<LD>   If the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were the problem, what was the
problem between 1948 and 1967? Why was it the united stand by all of
the Arab countries that they would never recognize Israel, never
negotiate with Israel and never have peace with Israel? This stand
was repeated in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973. The failure of the
Palestinians to grapple with these issues--perpetuating the fiction
of victimhood--not Bush's policies, helps to perpetuate the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</LD>
<TE>   Bruce G. Goren</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Viorst deserves to be highly commended for putting the facts in
their correct perspective. For the U.S. mediation to succeed it has
to be evenhanded and not completely biased to one side. The people of
Palestine are simple, honest people who are being robbed of their
land every day. They have been deprived of every aspect of humanity
and have been pushed to the brink. They have a right to live in peace
and freedom like everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Peltekian</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Viorst's attempt to blame Israel for the actions of Islamic
terrorists is as pathetic as it is convoluted. Viorst seeks to
soft-pedal the horror of terrorism by cloaking it in euphemisms. To
him, butchering innocent children is just Yasser Arafat's way of
"shaking up Israel." And I guess Sept. 11 was just Bin Laden's way of
shaking up the U.S. It's the president's strength, not his weakness,
to know who the bad guys are. It's our good fortune that he acts
accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Geoffrey Neigher</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Viorst said it all, and very clearly, about the war between the
Israelis and the Palestinians and Bush's indifference to this
situation. Bush, seeing everything in black and white, makes me want
to paper the Oval Office with this article. But I wouldn't bet on it
being read. I feel the danger of being a helpless bystander while our
country continues to side with one of the antagonists in this
never-ending conflict that has already cost us so much.</TE>

<LD>I applaud the MTA's plan to reduce congestion and parking problems by
encouraging alternatives to driving a mile or two to transit parking
lots ("MTA to Add Electric Scooters, Bicycles to Its Fleet," Jan.
12). The advocates of using inexpensive, regular bicycles have it
right.</LD>
<LD>   The $3,000 Segway "human transporter" is a high-tech toy, useless
as a transportation device, since it has no capacity for carrying
anything. A bicycle with a basket or luggage carrier, as I use for
local errands, is far preferable. Electric bicycles make sense for
hill dwellers. Now, if only schools and parents would encourage kids
to ride bikes instead of being driven to local schools.</LD>

term, I was arrested in Congress for shouting out my opposition to
''Star Wars.'' The charge of ''disturbing the peace'' included
several hours in jail and a $100 fine. Now, almost 20 years later, I
see Greenpeace, for its act of civil disobedience against ''Star
Wars,'' has paid a $150,000 fine and promised not to do it again.</LD>

John D. Dingell's encounter with the security screeners at Reagan
National Airport brought to mind a similar encounter of mine. When I
passed through a security gate, my surgically placed metallic hip
implant set off the alarms. I advised the gate attendant of my
then-recent surgery, to which he replied with the now-familiar,
"Please take it out, put it in the basket and walk through the gate
again."</LD>

<LD>Re "Officials Defend Not Sounding Alarm on Enron," Jan. 14: Treasury
Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans should be
allowed to state under oath that they did not tell the president of
Enron's pending bankruptcy. This was Dubya's moneybag--past, present
and future--and they didn't think it important enough to inform him?</LD>
<LD>   That is not credible. The last presidential election was ugly. The
next one should be worse.</LD>
<LD>   Glenn Yokum</LD>
<TE>   Barstow</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If O'Neill and Evans had come out and warned the public about the
trouble of Enron, who would still buy Enron stock? Wouldn't O'Neill
and Evans be accused of driving down Enron's stock?</TE>
<TE>   Ringo Li</TE>
<TE>   South Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill's contention that "I don't go across the street and tell
the president every time somebody calls me" is about the weakest
defense I've heard in my life. One of the largest corporations in the
world is saying it is in trouble and needs help from the U.S.
government and O'Neill doesn't even call President Bush?</TE>
<TE>   [Enron Corp. Chairman] Kenneth Lay is a close friend of the Bush
family and O'Neill doesn't call Bush? Is it possible Bush might have
been watching "Fox News Sunday" on Sunday and not a football game
when he choked on that pretzel?</TE>
<TE>   Dave Gunall</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill describes the theft of thousands of hard-working, loyal
workers' jobs and retirement funds by a small handful of
far-wealthier men as "part of the genius of capitalism." If
despicable corporate behavior such as Enron-gate continues to be
ignored and condoned (only after being exposed, of course) by our
highest government officials, aren't we being told that crime does
indeed pay? If you're running a corporation, that is.</TE>
<TE>   Why do we have thousands upon thousands of petty, two-bit
criminals behind bars, many for doing drugs that only harmed
themselves, while people like Lay and his higher rungs get awarded
"genius" status when they've just ruined thousands of lives and made
off with their loot? O'Neill's callous remark, further evidence of
the true pro-business/anti-worker nature of our suddenly beloved
president who appointed him, offers us another shining, some would
say genius, example of "compassionate conservatism."</TE>
<TE>   Victor H. Knowles</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration attempted to distance itself from the
Enron disaster by turning a deaf ear to requests for help from high
Enron officials. The fear was that any government involvement would
appear to be integral to the cozy relationship between Enron and Bush
administration officials. Had this relationship not existed, prompt
government action (as was done in the cases of Chrysler, Lockheed and
Long-Term Capital Management) might have staved off an Enron
bankruptcy and thereby mitigated the consequences to Enron employees
and investors.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Enron Way: Anything but 'Simple, Straightforward,' "
Commentary, Jan. 13: I think there's a perfectly straightforward and
simple answer to this mess. Freeze every bank account belonging to
the Enron executives who sold all their stock at tremendous profit.
Then pay back the employees who weren't allowed to cash their stocks
and who lost their pensions and 401(k)s from this money.</TE>
<TE>   Then, give the Enron executives and the Andersen auditors
("Auditor Says It Destroyed Enron Records," Jan. 11) what they
deserve--nice long prison sentences. Simple.</TE>

<HD>Creativity Prized in 'Reggio'-Style Preschools</HD>
<DH>In the Italian educational philosophy, there are no set
lessons. Instead, children's interests and talents guide the day's
work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At tiny tables, in tiny chairs, the pupils do the talking at Stephen
S. Wise Temple Nursery School and the teachers take the notes.</LD>
<LD>   There, in cheery classrooms high atop Mulholland Drive on Los
Angeles' Westside, students' words are recorded, transcribed,
laminated and displayed--evidence of activities at school but also
indicators of how the children are developing and proof for them that
what they say has worth.</LD>
<LD>   It is an approach that tests teachers' creativity and their
sensitivity to their students. And it comes from Italy.</LD>
<TE>   Ever since a 1991 Newsweek article named Reggio Emilia's municipal
nursery schools as the best preschools in the world, that affluent
northern Italian town has been visited by thousands of educators
looking to copy the "Reggio" approach.</TE>
<TE>   The co-director of Wise preschool toured the Italian campus four
years ago and then began incorporating "Reggio" at the $6,500-a-year
preschool of 245 students, who are ages 3 to 5 and mostly from Jewish
families.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the approach that touches not just my mind but my heart
and my creative juices," said Dafna Presnell, Wise's co-director.</TE>
<TE>   Several other Southern California schools also claim to have
adopted, and adapted, the philosophy, where beautiful surroundings
are prized, children's words are revered, groups do the work and the
day is designed to be unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   Developed when Italy lay ravaged by World War II, the curriculum
of Reggio Emilia's public preschools is described by educators as
"negotiated" or "emergent." Children's interests and talents guide
each day's work and often prompt projects that can last weeks or
months.</TE>
<TE>   For example, when students at Wise were studying Thanksgiving,
they seemed very attentive in their drawings to the number of buttons
on Pilgrims' clothing. That gave their teacher the idea to
incorporate buttons--along with zippers, clasps, snaps and other
fasteners--into a math lesson. In another class, two students'
insistence at snack time on eating dessert first prompted a lesson on
nutrition.</TE>
<TE>   Children who attend the preschools in Italy "understand how groups
work, and they come out of these schools with a disposition to learn
and a curiosity about the world," said Ben Mardell, a researcher on a
Harvard University team that has recently published a book examining
Reggio Emilia's schools.</TE>
<TE>   Reggio schools in the United States tend to cater to an affluent
crowd. The cachet of all things Italian--in toys, strollers and
schooling--appeals to some yuppie parents.</TE>
<TE>   Some American schools are more faithful to the Italian philosophy
than others, says Alise Shafer, director of Evergreen Community
School in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a philosophy, so it can't be learned in a day or a
year or even five years," said Shafer, who has been using the Reggio
approach at her preschool for 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   American visitors often marvel at the uncluttered elegance of
Reggio Emilia's classrooms, flooded with natural light and decorated
with flowers. American teachers often return to their own schools,
plunk a few daisies in a blue vase and boast they are a Reggio
school. The Italians dismiss these as "blue-vase schools."</TE>
<TE>   "The classrooms are gorgeous ... and on your first trip, it's
really hard to see past that," said Shafer, who has visited Reggio
Emilia four times and will close her school for a week in May to take
her staff there. "People tend to just see the environment, so they go
out and buy a few light tables, a couple of mirrors and plants and
say, 'We're doing the Reggio approach.' "</TE>
<TE>   Although flowers and vases can be found at both Wise and
Evergreen, the preschools have advanced beyond Reggio's most
superficial hallmarks. Both schools place unusually high value on
students' observations and ideas. Evergreen teachers use digital
video cameras to record children's conversations; after school they
are used to evaluate reasoning and identify interests that might
guide future activities. Wise's teachers also document their
students' words, which are reviewed by the school's directors and
posted with the children's artwork on the walls.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking for essential ideas and creativity in thinking and
the depth of the thinking," said Barbara Joffe, Wise's other
director. "It's not about what is actually said but what it
represents."</TE>
<TE>   So if a group of students decides the Pilgrims landed in Los
Angeles, that becomes the reality, at least for a while. And if a boy
describes a "leeb," when he means a leaf, that's "writed" down too.</TE>
<TE>   At Evergreen, several students' curiosity about gravity prompted
the formation of "The Gravity Committee" to discuss why objects fall
to the ground and stay there. And what was the dominant theory after
three months of daily, transcribed discussion in Shafer's office?
Pinpricks in the sky deliver this force to every household.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is never to teach children the facts," Shafer said. "The
goal is for them to engage in high-level thinking, so it doesn't
really matter where it ends up."</TE>
<TE>   To anyone who thinks that sounds ridiculously permissive, Wise's
Presnell points out that the children aren't even in kindergarten
yet. As they move on to elementary schools, they will learn the
Pilgrims found Massachusetts, with all its leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Parents are encouraged to visit the classrooms. For them, the
documentation on display fills out a child's answer to the
dinner-table question, "What did you do at school today?"</TE>
<TE>   "We get such a sense of what is going on in the classroom," said
Stephanie Sukert, who has had three daughters attend Wise's
preschool. "You can see everything that they've been doing."</TE>

<HD>Stanley Unwin, 90; Comedian Gained Fame by Talking Nonsense</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanley Unwin, 90, a comedian who turned talking nonsense into an art
form of sorts, died of undisclosed causes Saturday at a hospital in
Daventry, England.</LD>
<LD>   Unwin, who played the chancellor in the 1968 film "Chitty Chitty
Bang Bang," was a former BBC engineer who became affectionately known
as "Professor" Unwin after achieving fame on BBC radio in the 1940s
and '50s and later on television.</LD>
<LD>   He created his own blend of malapropisms and nonsense by telling
bedtime stories to his children. But his inspiration came from his
mother. She once tripped while walking down the street and
confusingly told her son that she had "falloloped over and grozed"
her knee.</LD>
<TE>   Unwin made a good living coining such verbal nonsense. Of Colonel
Sanders, he once observed: "He was the fry chicky-flame with tasty
jaws savoury-seeky herby blend."</TE>

<HD>Judge Says HMO Cannot Be Forced to Issue Drug</HD>
<DH>Court: In the second such setback in a year, regulators are
told they can't force Blue Shield to OK a weight-loss drug sought by
a patient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES HEALTH WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state judge in Sacramento ruled Tuesday that HMO regulators cannot
force Blue Shield of California to provide a weight-loss drug to an
obese member.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Joe S. Gray issued a preliminary injunction
that prevents the state from penalizing the HMO for not covering the
drug Xenical. The state had proposed to fine Blue Shield $270,000 for
refusing to participate in an independent medical review that later
determined that the patient should receive the medicine.</LD>
<LD>   Gray's ruling marks the second time in less than a year that a
court has rebuked the state for ordering a health maintenance
organization to provide prescription drugs. In the first case, in
July, another Sacramento judge said the state could not require
Kaiser Permanente to cover Viagra or other sexual-dysfunction drugs.</LD>
<TE>   The state is appealing the Viagra decision. Officials said Tuesday
that they had not decided yet whether to back down, push for a full
trial or seek an expedited appeal in the Xenical case.</TE>
<TE>   If the state had succeeded in ordering Blue Shield to pay for
Xenical, the HMO's contracts with employers would have been in
jeopardy, said Blue Shield spokesman Tom Epstein. The member's HMO
policy specifically excludes coverage for weight-loss drugs, Epstein
said.</TE>
<TE>   "If a state agency can come in and rewrite a valid contract that
they've already approved, that will create great uncertainty and is
unfair to insurers and will result in higher premiums," he said. "In
the long run, that's bad for most consumers."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Blue Shield decided to pay for Xenical for its Southern
California member before filing its lawsuit. The HMO will continue
paying for the drug despite the ruling, Epstein said, because the
case is likely to continue.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Managed Health Care claimed that a
November 2000 regulation mandates coverage for "all medically
necessary outpatient prescription drugs," which would include Xenical
in this case. The woman's doctor said the drug was necessary, as did
an independent reviewer.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's director, Daniel Zingale, said he was particularly
disappointed that Blue Shield refused to participate in that
independent medical review, which is a core component of the state's
managed-care reform. The review process allows HMO members to appeal
treatment denials to a medical expert not affiliated with the
insurer.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any regret for siding with the patient in this
case," Zingale said.</TE>
<TE>   But Zingale said he understands the fiscal concerns raised by
HMOs.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to strike a balance that does require HMOs to provide
truly medically necessary drugs, particularly life-preserving drugs,
but at the same time does not break the bank," he said. "There's a
reasonable disagreement about how to strike that balance."</TE>
<TE>   Blue Shield said it would like to work with the state to avoid
future confrontations.</TE>
<TE>   "We would be delighted to sit down and talk to the department
about how to best handle cases like this and to assure that our
members are getting the treatment they deserve," Epstein said.</TE>

<HD>Expatriates Still Friendly Despite India-Pakistan Rift</HD>
<DH>Culture: In heavily Asian Bay Area suburbs, many immigrants
from the rival nations are socially integrated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HAYWARD, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Every day around noon, Brij Dhir leaves his personal injury law
office here and heads next door for a cup of cardamom spiced tea with
his friend, restaurant owner Mohammad Shahbaz.</LD>
<LD>   Dhir is a native of India and a Hindu. Shahbaz, who owns three Bay
Area South Asian restaurants, is originally from Pakistan and is
Muslim. Both men retain strong cultural and political attachments to
their respective homelands.</LD>
<LD>   Both acknowledge that they are deeply troubled by the recent
tensions between India and Pakistan that have nuclear-capable armies
poised in a potentially deadly standoff over the disputed territory
of Kashmir. But so far, the threat of war hasn't interrupted their
Hayward tea ritual.</LD>
<TE>   Likewise, Shahbaz said Indian customers continue to throng to his
Pakwan restaurants, known for their spicy curries and Punjabi
specialties. And Shahbaz, who plays a recorded recitation from the
Koran every morning to bless the working day, said he still shops for
lentils and dry pulses in the Indian-owned grocery a few doors away
in the Haymont Plaza Shopping Center, a strip mall. To get there, he
walks past an Indian-owned shop that sells Hindu statues.</TE>
<TE>   Few communities are more sensitive to tensions in South Asia than
the Bay Area cities of Fremont, Hayward and Union City--home to one
of the largest concentrations of Indians, Pakistanis, Fijian Indian
and Afghan populations in North America.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2000 census, Fremont recorded one of the largest increases
of Asians in the country, jumping 150% to 81,000, including a large
percentage of South Asians. Hayward and Union City added 23,571
people who identified themselves as Asians.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont has an eight-screen movieplex for films in Hindi and Urdu.
South Asian restaurants, temples and mosques are proliferating along
Mission Boulevard, which connects the communities sandwiched between
Oakland and San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike India and Pakistan, which were separated by the
partition of British India in 1947, these communities tend to be much
more socially integrated despite their religious and geopolitical
differences. In some respects, in fact, the American communities have
re-created the atmosphere of coexistence last seen in pre-1947 India.</TE>
<TE>   Hindu restaurants, for example, often offer halal, meat prepared
by Muslim butchers according to Islamic rites. Pakistani films and
newspapers are available in many Indian shops.</TE>
<TE>   To Agha Saeed, president of the American Muslim Alliance in
Newark, Calif., a small suburb next to Fremont, the interdependence
of the South Asian community has created a sense of accommodation
that allows people to ignore all but the most serious of conflicts
between their homelands.</TE>
<TE>   "People have learned to live with and disregard the average level
of conflict," said Saeed, a native of Pakistan who teaches political
science at UC Berkeley and Cal State Hayward. Thus, even in the
gravest of crises, he said, most people are able to go about their
daily dealings with their South Asian counterparts with little
thought to politics.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in two Indian places to check out videos," Saeed said this
week. "The crisis did not enter my mind. But at a conscious political
level, I am aware that there is a potential conflict with
incomprehensible consequences."</TE>
<TE>   But Saeed said the current crisis is the worst since the two
countries last went to war in 1971. "This is going one step farther,"
he said. "The tension is much higher."</TE>
<TE>   Asim Mughal, a Pakistani-American Web site editor who lives in
Sunnyvale, north of San Jose, said Saeed paints too rosy a picture.</TE>
<TE>   "This apparent environment of tolerance," Mughal said during a
discussion in the Muslim Alliance office, "does not mean that there
are not differences. I know people who will not go to Indian shops."
Mughal, who works for the paknews.com Internet news service, said he
is one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Grocer Gajjan Singh Bal, owner of the Haymont Produce Shop, said
he worries that more tension could drive his regular Pakistani
customers away.</TE>
<TE>   "So far it has not been much of an issue," said Bal, whose family
immigrated to California in 1973, settling first in Fresno, "but we
continue to worry about the effect. The Pakistani restaurants are
among my biggest customers. The other day I became concerned when I
hadn't seen one of my Pakistani customers for several days. But
eventually he came in."</TE>
<TE>   Bal, who is Sikh, said his steadiest clientele are Sikhs, Hindus,
Fijian Indians, Pakistanis and Afghans who come to buy ghee (Indian
clarified butter), yogurt sodas and Golden Temple Flour, which are
not available in other stores.</TE>
<TE>   Varsha Patel, owner of the Sagar Emporium and Bridal Shop in the
Haymont Plaza, said she has experienced some decline in business from
her Pakistani customers. "I think they just stopped coming out," said
Patel, a Hindu who grew up in India and moved here 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But she said that although she has lost some customers, she has
been able to maintain her "incontestable friendships" with Pakistani
neighbors and friends.</TE>
<TE>   College-age people appear to be the least affected by the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Rizwan Khalid, 20, and Mazhar Ali, 22, are Pakistani students at
San Jose State University, part of a large contingent of South Asian
students who refer to each other using the neutral term "desi," which
means "from the homeland" and can apply to either Indian or
Pakistani.</TE>
<TE>   Khalid and Ali were in one of the Pakwan restaurants this week,
feasting on platters of Punjabi-style tandoori chicken.</TE>
<TE>   "Except for a little joking, we don't see any changes in our
friendships with Indians because of this situation," Khalid said.
"Somebody might joke: 'India is kicking your butt.' That's the extent
of it."</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us realize that it is just the two governments having
problems," he said. "It doesn't affect us at all. Frankly, I don't
even care if India gets all of Kashmir, as long as people's rights
are observed."</TE>

<HD>Candidate Jones Says Davis Is Stonewalling in Lottery Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI and MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Gov. Gray Davis prepared to join two of his three GOP rivals on
the broadcast airwaves, Secretary of State and gubernatorial hopeful
Bill Jones accused him of helping perpetuate a state lottery system
in which tickets were sold after all major prizes had been awarded.</LD>
<LD>   Lottery officials last month acknowledged that in 11 of the more
than 100 Scratchers games held in the last five years, tickets were
sold after all the big prizes were claimed. At the same time that
they admitted that practice, officials apologized and offered a
$1-million makeup drawing for all former Scratchers players.</LD>
<LD>   Although the system began under Davis' predecessor, Republican
Pete Wilson, Jones charged that the Davis administration has
stonewalled a legal challenge to the practice that was filed last
summer and is dragging its feet on releasing critical documents to
the public.</LD>
<TE>   "We have witnessed in this administration repeated and rampant
abuses of power, rooted in arrogance and blind political ambition,"
Jones, a Republican, said at a Culver City news conference. "This
lottery story is yet another example."</TE>
<TE>   It was Jones' second recent foray into the lottery topic.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign scoffed at the tactic, which the governor's
aides attributed in part to Jones' desire to keep himself in the news
at a time when he has not raised enough money to buy advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of thing is becoming routine for Bill Jones," spokesman
Roger Salazar said. "I think he's grasping at issues to keep his name
in the paper, and I don't think it's very becoming of a gubernatorial
candidate."</TE>
<TE>   As they fended off Jones' criticism Tuesday, Davis and his
campaign were preparing to launch the first television advertising of
his reelection effort, with a statewide spot slated to begin airing
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the governor, a Democrat seeking a second term, aired a
radio ad discussing efforts to address the state's electricity
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign officials declined Tuesday to discuss the content
of the ad, which was filmed earlier this week, or any other details
of the advertising effort. An announcement was scheduled for today.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan began broadcasting TV
spots last week, and recently extended the run of a biographical
advertisement airing across most of the state. On Monday, businessman
Bill Simon Jr. began airing a radio spot; people in the broadcast
industry said he paid $300,000 for a two-week run.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who trails the other candidates in money raised and cash on
hand, hopes to join them on the airwaves by the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' prior news conference on the lottery imbroglio, in Burbank
on Jan. 3, drew half a dozen television cameras and a scrum of
reporters barking questions. Tuesday, he did not pull in such a
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The site was the parking lot in front of Bill's Liquor, a
convenience shop selling lottery tickets on Culver Boulevard. As
Jones strained to be heard over the rumble of traffic, locals pulled
into the lot and walked past the sole television camera at the news
conference to buy groceries inside.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said that on Jan. 3, he had filed a request under the
state's public records act for all audits of the lottery and all
communication between the lottery and the governor's office about the
case. The governor's office, he complained, has yet to produce the
paperwork, taking an optional extra 10-day extension.</TE>
<TE>   Jones also called for legislative hearings, and criticized Davis
for allowing state attorneys to argue that California government is
not restricted by laws requiring truth in advertising. Those
contentions led a judge last week to dismiss a lawsuit challenging
the lottery.</TE>

<HD>EPA to Review Disputed Smog Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a victory for clean-air advocates in the San Joaquin Valley, the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to review disputed
anti-smog strategies in one of the nation's smoggiest regions.</LD>
<LD>   Under a legal agreement announced Tuesday, the EPA has decided to
revisit a series of measures in the valley intended to reduce haze
and smog, but that environmentalists charge are too lax.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a good day for the San Joaquin Valley," said Bruce
Nilles, attorney for Earthjustice, a San Francisco-based legal arm of
the environmental movement. "We are pleased with this settlement
because it is an important step to ensure that another generation of
valley residents will not be forced to breathe life-threatening
pollution," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement signals greater scrutiny of the haze that enshrouds
the valley and the adequacy of steps to reduce it. The valley has
been the locus of a growing dispute over smog cleanup in California
as other parts of the state, including Los Angeles, post rapid gains
against air pollution while progress in the fast-growing valley
continues to languish.</TE>
<TE>   Sequoia National Park, immediately downwind of the valley, ranks
as the nation's smoggiest national park. The valley, which has missed
key cleanup targets, now is saddled with smog that rivals Los Angeles
and Houston for worst-in-the-nation status. In October, the EPA
officially reclassified the valley as severely polluted.</TE>
<TE>   Yet environmental groups challenged the EPA and San Joaquin Valley
Air Pollution Control District for failing to act more aggressively
against smog. A coalition of medical, community and environmental
groups sued the EPA in November to force the agency to act on seven
cleanup strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Under a legal settlement, which is yet to be approved in U.S.
District Court, the EPA agreed to act on a comprehensive plan to
reduce smoke and dust in the valley that critics say is too weak.
Despite a Clean Air Act requirement, the region has never had a
federally approved plan to clean up emissions that contribute to
microscopic particles that cloud the valley sky.</TE>
<TE>   "We now are going to have to deal with the San Joaquin Valley's
air plan in very short order," said Nina Spiegelman, associate
counsel for EPA's California office.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the EPA agreed to review six rules dealing with turbines,
pumps and boilers used in oil fields and other equipment. Although
some of those rules are in force, they are not included in
California's official clean-air plan and therefore they cannot be
enforced by citizens or the federal government, Nilles said. The EPA
must complete its review of those matters by Aug. 23.
Environmentalists hope that some of the rules will be replaced by
stronger measures.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the beginning of a long process. We must continue our
vigilance over the government to make sure it continues making
progress toward cleaning our dirty air," said Leo Avila, president of
the board of Latino Issues Forum.</TE>

<HD>Candy Recalled After Choking Deaths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that a Buena Park firm
is recalling several brands of conjac jelly candy because the product
presents a choking hazard.</LD>
<LD>   The action by Walong Marketing Inc. is the latest recall of this
type of candy, which has been linked to six choking deaths of
children in the U.S., the latest a 2-year-old in New Jersey around
the New Year's holiday, the FDA said.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA said none of the brands Walong was recalling--Kimbo, Asian
Taste, Jin Jin and Shin Hsiang Jen Foods--have been linked to the
deaths. The agency did not say how many of these candies were being
recalled or whether Walong was taking the action voluntarily. Walong
did not return telephone calls Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   This type of candy, which is popular in Asia, is sold under dozens
of brand names, such as Jelly Yum and Fruit Poppers.</TE>
<TE>   The brightly colored gel candies come in small plastic cups, often
with a piece of fruit in them. The candy doesn't readily dissolve in
the mouth, and the gel, which contains conjac, also known as yam
flour. is so sticky that rescue workers have reported being unable to
dislodge it from the throats of choking children.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the FDA issued warnings about the dangers of conjac
jelly candy after two California children and a third in Washington
state had died from them. Several markets pulled the candy off their
shelves, but some small companies have continued selling it.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Millions of fed-up cell phone users think about dumping their
carriers every year but then abandon the thought--largely because
switching carriers also means changing their mobile phone numbers.</LD>
<LD>   It's a frustrating obstacle that was supposed to have been
eliminated 2 1/2 years ago under a 1996 federal mandate requiring
cell phone companies to allow customers to keep their phone numbers
regardless of which carrier they used.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's largest mobile service providers have fought the
requirement for years and won a series of delays from the Federal
Communications Commission. Now Verizon Wireless and its brethren are
quietly moving to quash the mandate.</LD>
<TE>   In a petition filed in July with the FCC, Verizon Wireless asked
federal regulators to scrap the "local number portability"
requirement. After months of debate, federal regulators are expected
to make a decision on the issue in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The impending decision has sparked a flurry of activity, drawing
supporters and opponents into a war of words and prompting a flood of
lobbying at the FCC.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups also have gotten involved, labeling Verizon's
petition the ultimate insult from an industry rife with customer
complaints over spotty service coverage, overloaded networks, billing
errors and all manner of fine-print "gotchas."</TE>
<TE>   Helen Mickiewicz, the California Public Utility Commission's
deputy general counsel, is one of many state officials vehemently
opposed to any move to vacate or further delay the number portability
mandate.</TE>
<TE>   Removing the requirement "would permanently limit the amount of
competition in the market," Mickiewicz said. "The FCC has to be
convinced that there would be a price to pay for granting this
[waiver], whether it's heat from the states, Congress, the public, or
any combination of those."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates point out that traditional phone companies
already have complied with a similar local number portability rule
that required costly changes to their networks.</TE>
<TE>   Once wireline and wireless companies can swap numbers, regulators
say, customers can more readily "cut the cord" and replace their home
phone with a mobile device.</TE>
<TE>   But cell phone companies counter that the idea of portability
should be scrapped because customers aren't demanding it. They argue
that implementing portability, which involves retooling the software
of each carrier's computerized call-routing system, would be
expensive and technically complicated.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost to be able to move numbers from one carrier to the other
is significant, and it would be significant for the customer too,"
said John Scott, deputy general counsel for Verizon Wireless. "Our
argument is that it's not necessary to promote competition."</TE>
<TE>   Under current rules, U.S. mobile phone carriers must have their
networks ready to swap numbers by Nov. 24. AT&amp;T Wireless Services
Inc., Sprint PCS, Cingular Wireless, the wireless industry's main
trade group and other companies also want the mandate revoked.</TE>
<TE>   Many smaller mobile phone companies, who hope to steal customers
from their bigger rivals, are not behind the Verizon petition. Some
of them, including Leap Wireless International Inc., have been openly
critical of the industry's technical and cost arguments.</TE>
<TE>   "These are all red herrings," said Dan Pegg, an executive at San
Diego-based Leap Wireless.</TE>
<TE>   "The only people who think it can't be done [and shouldn't be
done] are the people who will find it to their economic disadvantage
to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Leap and others opposed to revoking the mandate say the real
reason behind the effort is that the status quo helps the big
companies hold on to dissatisfied customers. They say it's harder for
unhappy consumers to "vote with their feet" and change carriers if
their mobile numbers are held hostage.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia attorney Kevin Weinstein is one of the many mobile
phone users who would switch providers in an instant--and gladly pay
a contract termination fee--if he could take his phone numbers with
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not happy with the carrier that I have, but I have four phone
numbers that were selected by me, are easy to remember and that I
would lose if I switched," he said. "So I'm married to my carrier ...
I'm trapped unless those numbers become portable."</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Wireless, the nation's largest provider with nearly 30
million customers, says that the U.S. cell phone market is fiercely
competitive, prices are dropping steadily and that more than 20
million customers change companies every year despite having to
surrender their phone numbers in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Many cell phone companies, including Verizon, lose 2% to 4% of
their subscribers every month--or between 30% and 40% a year,
according to Telephia Inc., a wireless industry research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Those customers are making the switch despite the number issue,
the need to pay a penalty for breaking service contracts and the fact
that moving to a new carrier forces customers to buy a new phone
because of technological differences.</TE>
<TE>   "That's an extremely high churn rate compared to other
industries," said John Dee Fair, Telephia's vice president of
research and development.</TE>
<TE>   The Telephia survey shows that turnover rate could be an even
greater problem for cellular carriers if customers were allowed to
keep their phone numbers. In December, 40% of the survey customers
who didn't change carriers said they mainly stayed put to keep their
cell phone number--up from 29% six months earlier.</TE>

<HD>Health Plans to Pay Bonuses for Quality</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Pact by six state insurers is further sign of
disenchantment with HMO system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six of California's largest health insurers said Tuesday they will
begin paying bonuses to doctors for providing superior treatment,
giving further evidence that the current system of fixed HMO payments
for patient care rapidly is coming unglued.</LD>
<LD>   The health plans--Aetna Inc., Blue Cross of California, Blue
Shield of California, Cigna Corp., Health Net Inc. and PacifiCare
Health Systems Inc.--said they would agree on a set of standards for
measuring quality care, publish report cards on doctors' performance
and reward medical groups with bonuses of 5% to 10% for meeting or
exceeding the standards.</LD>
<LD>   Additional details were scarce Tuesday; the groups said they are
just assembling a task force to work out the details and they hoped
to have the programs underway within a year.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman said some of the funds for the bonuses probably will
come from increases in health insurance premiums, which could be
controversial at a time when premiums already are going up 10% to 15%
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Some were quick to call the move a smoke screen designed by the
unpopular managed-care industry to score some public relations points
and show that it can resuscitate a failing system.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that 100% of physician pay is capitated--a lump
sum regardless of how sick the patient is--so 100% of the financial
incentive for doctors today is to provide less treatment," said
health-care consumer advocate Jamie Court. "Now, there's going to be
a 5% to 10% bonus for providing higher-quality health care?
Fundamentally, it's a mirage. If they really wanted to change the
quality of care patients received, they would pay doctors more for
treating the sicker patients. They are refusing to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Lee, president and chief executive of the Pacific Business
Group on Health, which represents employers, defended the plan,
saying, "Costs are escalating, and spending has to support better
performance."</TE>
<TE>   Steve McDermott, CEO of Hill Physicians Medical Group in Northern
California, whose 2,500 doctors work with several health maintenance
organizations under the capitation system, said the program was
necessary because "we have concluded that neither a fee-for-service
model or capitation rewards [better] performance or quality. There
are no long-term performance incentives. Until recently we've had
very few financial results. There's something wrong with that."</TE>
<TE>   Under capitated payments, which recently have been fought by
several doctors groups and hospitals, providers are paid a lump sum
per patient, regardless of whether the patient needs a variety of
medical procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Detractors say the payments are too low, have bankrupted medical
groups and left hospitals struggling to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say capitation works fine and only poorly run and
inefficient medical groups suffer under them.</TE>
<TE>   Lee said consumers would benefit by being able to see the report
cards and choose the medical groups with the best grades.</TE>
<TE>   The report cards and the standards they will be based on have not
been developed, but they will be heavily weighted at first toward
patient satisfaction with the medical experience.</TE>
<TE>   "The illnesses and screening covered will include diabetes,
asthma, breast cancer screening, childhood immunizations, coronary
artery disease," Lee said. "By satisfaction, we don't just mean 'Are
you happy?' [but] 'Did the doctor explain drugs and procedures in a
way you can understand? Did you have ready access to specialty
care?'"</TE>
<TE>   One of the most important considerations is the source of the
bonus money. Some physicians groups said the bonuses will be
meaningless unless money is created to finance them rather than taken
away from other areas of health care.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman at the news conference where the initiative was
announced said about $100million annually would go into the fund and
some of it would come from premium increases.</TE>

<HD>Hemp Imports Run Afoul of DEA Rule</HD>
<DH>Trade: Canadian supplier, claiming the ban violates NAFTA
provision, threatens to sue the U.S. government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The hemp industry is taking on the establishment, seeking to prevent
the U.S. government from crushing the small, but rapidly growing,
hemp food and beverages industry.</LD>
<LD>   Canadian hemp supplier Kenex Ltd. on Monday signaled its intent to
sue the U.S. government for $20million under provisions of the North
American Free Trade Agreement. Kenex claims that a ban on foods that
contain hemp, instituted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in
October, violated its rights under NAFTA.</LD>
<LD>   Kenex and several other food companies also have filed suit
against the DEA in federal appeals court, seeking to overturn the
rule.</LD>
<TE>   Hemp oil and seeds increasingly have been used in processed foods
in the U.S., showing up in everything from corn chips to beer to
salad dressing and cereal. Hemp seeds are considered beneficial
because of their high protein content and because they are rich in
essential fatty acids and vitamins.</TE>
<TE>   Like poppy seeds, these products until recently were considered
exempt under the Controlled Substances Act of 1971.</TE>
<TE>   However, under a new rule issued by the DEA that takes effect next
month, these foods are considered illegal. The agency claims all hemp
products contain minute traces of tetrahydrocannabinols (THC), the
hallucinogenic substance found in cannabis.</TE>
<TE>   Hemp can still be used under the new rule in products consumers
don't ingest, such as shampoo, soap, clothing, lotion and birdseed.</TE>
<TE>   Kenex contends the rule is discriminatory to Canadian producers,
who provide the bulk of hemp products to the U.S. because Americans
are banned from growing the plant.</TE>
<TE>   "Our company has invested a significant amount of money in Canada
and the U.S. to develop these markets for the past three years, and
it has been one stumbling block after another," said Jean Laprise,
Kenex president. "They're squashing an emerging industry."</TE>
<TE>   The Kenex case adds more heat to a debate over the provision of
NAFTA that allows private investors to sue governments for taking
actions that restrict trade. Since NAFTA was enacted, 15 such cases
have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   Critics argue the provision gives companies too much power and
undermines the ability of governments to protect their citizens.</TE>
<TE>   But Laprise says it's necessary to protect companies' rights when
the law is discriminatory.</TE>
<TE>   DEA officials refuse to comment on the issue because of the
pending litigation. But DEA Administrator Asa Hutchinson put forward
the agency's position recently when he said that "many Americans do
not know that hemp and marijuana are both parts of the same plant and
that hemp cannot be produced without producing marijuana."</TE>
<TE>   The DEA says consumers have until Feb. 6 to dispose of these items
or be subject to penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Although hemp and marijuana come from the plant species, cannabis,
the variety grown for industrial hemp contains much lower amounts of
THC, a point the DEA acknowledges.</TE>
<TE>   The burning issue for the DEA is: When can cannabis legally be
sold as hemp, and when is it still a drug?</TE>
<TE>   Hemp oil and seeds can't make people high, but they do contain
minuscule amounts of THC, much as poppy seeds contain trace amounts
of opium.</TE>
<TE>   "The leaves and flowers on industrial hemp, when you smoke them,
it gives you a headache," said John Roulac, president of Nutiva in
Sebastopol, Calif., which makes snack bars and chips out of hemp. "If
you smoke more, you just get a bigger headache."</TE>
<TE>   If there weren't a cloud hanging over the industry from this
regulation, manufacturers say, it would grow exponentially over the
next several years as demand for functional foods grows.</TE>
<TE>   However, confusion over the new rule, and high-profile seizures of
hemp-containing products such as birdseed, should keep many companies
from using the controversial ingredient, Roulac said.</TE>
<TE>   Many, however, say they plan to continue to sell their products.</TE>
<TE>   Food companies that use hemp ingredients hope that the industry
and government can come up with guidelines that will allow the
industry to grow as it was expected to before the rule was published.</TE>
<TE>   Without them, they say, the DEA's ambiguous standards will make
that difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "Their whole intention is to just put a cloud on the marketplace
so it disintegrates and goes away on its own," said David Bronner of
Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps in Escondido, which has helped fund the
industry's litigation. We [as an industry] are going to proceed and
continue selling it."</TE>

<HD>Trying to Add Another Chapter to Studio's Story</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: A sale of MGM wouldn't be the first, but it
would give the buyer an extensive film library. The price may be
keeping suitors away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES and CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the third time in 16 years, gaming mogul Kirk Kerkorian is
betting he can hit the jackpot by finding a buyer for the once-fabled
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio.</LD>
<LD>   Kerkorian is known to be seeking a tax-free, stock merger with a
large media conglomerate that would leave him a major shareholder in
the acquirer, while keeping MGM alive as a going concern.</LD>
<LD>   After a story in The Times on Tuesday about MGM soliciting bids
through investment bank Goldman Sachs, the company's shares jumped
$2.39 to $22.27 on the New York Stock Exchange. But no MGM deal is
imminent, sources said Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The 84-year-old reclusive billionaire, who owned MGM twice before
and today controls it with about 80% of the stock, is trying to cash
in on a growing demand for the company's deep library of more than
4,000 movie titles, which include the James Bond and Pink Panther
movies, classics such as "The Graduate" and "Rain Man," and recent
hits such as "Legally Blonde." That demand for movies is being fueled
by a proliferation of DVD sales, which have become a major cash cow
for studios, plus a growth in cable channels and the emergence of new
technologies to distribute entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   But the $7-billion sale price Kerkorian purportedly wants is
causing even the biggest players in entertainment, including Walt
Disney Co. and Viacom Inc., to wince.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone would love to have the company because of the library,
but the price is too prohibitive," said the head of one major media
company. A high-level executive at another company that has long
lusted after the MGM library concurred: "It's too expensive."</TE>
<TE>   So far, none of the big entertainment firms solicited by MGM,
including AOL Time Warner Inc. and Vivendi Universal, has formally
bid because of the price.</TE>
<TE>   MGM officials wouldn't comment specifically on any prospective
deal, but released a statement Tuesday saying that no agreement has
been reached and there are no assurances one will be. MGM reiterated
they are evaluating various business combinations, as they have for
the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're continuing to move ahead with our business agenda as usual
in movies, TV and home entertainment. We're greenlighting pictures
and new television shows," said MGM Vice Chairman Chris McGurk. He
said MGM is actively developing a "Legally Blonde" TV show with ABC,
and began shooting the 20th installment in the James Bond film series
Monday, for November release.</TE>
<TE>   With a personal net worth of some $5.3 billion, Kerkorian is
considered a savvy trader who usually ends up with a hefty profit in
his deals. He is the dominant player in Las Vegas, controlling such
hotel casinos as the MGM Grand, the Mirage and the Bellagio.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Difficulty in Being Stand-Alone Studio</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Kerkorian's personal goals, the prospective deal for MGM
shows that it is nearly impossible for a company that just makes
movies to go it alone today in the volatile, risky entertainment
business dominated by a handful of diversified giants.</TE>
<TE>   Other stand-alone studios such as DreamWorks SKG face the same
dilemma. Nearly every major media company now weaves its studio
operation into an array of distribution assets that includes cable
channels, TV networks and Internet businesses.</TE>
<TE>   MGM management has publicly acknowledged that one reason it wants
to become a larger, more diversified company is to be less dependent
on box-office revenue to make its money.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Alex Yemenidjian, MGM chairman and longtime Kerkorian
protege, the company has sought deals with other firms, such as
paying Cablevision Systems $825 million for a 20% stake in four cable
channels, including Bravo.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Gerard Klauer &amp; Mattison
said it appears Kerkorian has come to the realization that "he could
not build an entertainment conglomerate one film at a time."</TE>
<TE>   In a report Tuesday, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jill Krutick
called MGM a "ripe takeover target" and said all of the major
entertainment companies could benefit from MGM's film library because
of the popularity of DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   Once Hollywood's golden studio, MGM hasn't been a major force for
decades. It once boasted "more stars than there are in the heavens"
when its stable included Judy Garland, Clark Gable, Gene Kelly and
Greta Garbo. And its name is associated with such classics as "The
Wizard of Oz," "Singin' in the Rain" and "Gone With the Wind."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mixed Box-Office Record in 2001</TE>
<TE>   For the last 15 years, MGM has operated mostly in chaos under four
owners, twice under Kerkorian. Kerkorian originally bought the studio
in 1969, selling it to mogul Ted Turner in 1986 for $1.25 billion.
But Kerkorian bought it back from a cash-strapped Turner for $480
million and got various MGM assets, including the name and United
Artists' valuable film library. Turner kept about 3,000 film titles,
including "Gone With the Wind" and "The Wizard of Oz," now owned by
AOL Time Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Kerkorian sold MGM for the second time in 1990 to Italian
businessman Giancarlo Parretti for $1.3 billion, who left the studio
a mess by selling off film rights. Lender Credit Lyonnais seized the
studio from Parretti a year later. Then Credit Lyonnais sold it for
$1.3 billion in 1996 to Kerkorian and Australian broadcaster Seven
Network, with Kerkorian buying out Seven two years later. Kerkorian
sold a minority stake to public investors in 1997, raising $180
million.</TE>
<TE>   Kerkorian's current investment in MGM is between $3 billion and $4
billion, including the 1996 acquisition, various cash infusions and
the cost of buying back some film rights sold by Parretti.</TE>
<TE>   The company's finances have improved from the early 1990s, thanks
to cost-cutting and such profitable films as the James Bond
franchise, "Hannibal" and "Legally Blonde."</TE>
<TE>   This year could be more problematic. One reason MGM decided to
delay the release of its $110-million, John Woo-directed World War II
drama "Windtalkers," starring Nicolas Cage, to this year was to avoid
having to record such a hefty production cost last year.</TE>
<TE>   The release of another expensive and troubled production,
"Rollerball," directed by John McTiernan, was moved from last year to
Feb. 8 when the studio recut the movie from an R-rating to a PG-13.
And although the Bond films usually are sure hits, the upcoming
production carries a hefty $125-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, MGM's box-office record in 2001 was mixed, with a market
share of just 5.5%, well behind the other major studios. Its two
biggest hits were "Hannibal," which grossed $165 million
domestically, and "Legally Blonde," which grossed $96.5 million but
cost $19 million to make.</TE>
<TE>   Among its disappointments were "AntiTrust," "What's the Worst That
Can Happen?," starring Danny DeVito and Martin Lawrence, and
"Bandits," starring Bruce Willis.</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to Monday's news that MGM was shopping itself, several
Wall Street money managers said they were skeptical any media company
would pay the price Kerkorian wants.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like a very rich multiple," said one hedge fund manager.
"Who in their right mind is going to pay that?"</TE>
<TE>   Yet, there are those who suggest that although companies may be
balking at the $7-billion price tag, the scarcity value of MGM's film
library--the second largest in Hollywood next to Warner Bros.'--is
something that potential bidders shouldn't easily dismiss.</TE>
<TE>   "The price is not unreasonable because there are no other
libraries of this size and scope available today," said Logsdon, who
estimates the library generates more than $300 million in cash flow
annually for MGM.</TE>

including ``Gone With the Wind'' and ``The Wizard of Oz,'' which he
uses to help build his cable empire.</TE>

Kerkorian for $1.3 billion. Within a year, lender Credit Lyonnais
seizes the studio when Parretti fails to make his payments.</TE>

<LD>Avon Products Inc., the world's largest direct seller of beauty
products, held to its previous guidance for 2002 earnings-per-share
growth, despite a hit it expects to take due to Argentina's economic
woes.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based company said it sees a negative impact of about
5 cents a share from Argentina's currency devaluation and economic
crisis.</LD>
<LD>   But the company said it expects the 2002 earnings impact from
Argentina to be offset by factors such as continued strength in its
other operations and stronger-than-planned currencies in other
markets, particularly Brazil and Mexico.</LD>

<LD>USA Education Inc., commonly known as Sallie Mae, agreed to buy

<HD>Harrah's 4th-Quarter Profit Tops Estimates</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harrah's Entertainment Inc., the No. 3 casino company, said its
fourth-quarter profit topped analyst estimates as its casinos in the
Midwest and the Eastern U.S. attracted gamblers reluctant to fly to
Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Las Vegas-based Harrah's said it earned 44 cents to 48 cents a
share in the fourth quarter, above the 35-cent average estimate of
analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call. A year ago the
company lost $1.41 a share because of charges related to its
investment in National Airlines Inc. and other events.</LD>
<LD>   Harrah's 25 casinos in 12 states include properties in markets
such as Atlantic City, N.J., and St. Louis that gamblers have driven
to since the September terrorist attacks as an alternative to flying
to Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   Gambling revenue in Las Vegas, which gets half its visitors by air
travel, has fallen since September.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding gains from the sale of some real estate and other items
Harrah's will report net income of 47 cents to 51 cents a share, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   Harrah's shares rose $1.12 to $39.23 on the NYSE. Harrah's
released its statement after the close of trading.</TE>

<HD>Judge Clears Proposed Settlement in Royalty Suit Against
Universal</HD>
<DH>Court: Class-action status expands number of potential
plaintiffs to about 300 artists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN W. O'NEILL and JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has given preliminary approval to
a $4.75-million settlement between Vivendi Universal's Universal
Music Group and what could be as many as 300 aging and deceased
recording artists who are owed royalties.</LD>
<LD>   An attorney for the lead plaintiff, torch singer Peggy Lee, said
it was the first class-action lawsuit to accuse a record company of
employing questionable accounting tactics to cheat artists of
royalties dating as far back as the 1940s.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement papers, signed Monday by Judge Victoria Gerrard
Chaney, characterize the agreement as "reasonable and fair."
Universal admitted no wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, the judge also formally declared the suit a class
action, expanding the number of potential plaintiffs to nearly 300
artists who recorded with the Decca label before Jan. 1, 1962.</TE>
<TE>   A final settlement could be reached by early May, after a
so-called fairness hearing is held to determine whether anyone
objects.</TE>
<TE>   Universal, the world's biggest record company, acquired Lee's
contract as a result of a series of mergers. Decca merged with MCA
Inc. in January 1966 and was in turn purchased by Seagram Co. in
1995. The music group was renamed Universal. Vivendi acquired Seagram
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys had little comment outside court. Language in the
proposed settlement prohibits each lawyer from discussing the case
with the media unless a lawyer for the other side is present or
approves a prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, who was signed to Decca between 1952 and 1956, contended that
Universal cheated her and other artists out of millions of dollars by
underreporting sales figures and overcharging for company services.
Each member of the class, Lee alleged, was owed $50,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   Lee and her lawyers, Cyrus V. Godfrey and David W. Axelrod, said
in their court papers that Universal's allegedly fraudulent
accounting practices included short-changing artists of earnings on
CD sales by paying royalties based on the price of vinyl records.
Many artists agreed to the vinyl-based royalties in the mid-1980s,
before compact discs had taken hold among consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the lawsuit alleged, the company was underpaying
royalties on record-club sales, and overcharged artists for album
packaging and other services.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed settlement comes at a time when record company
business practices are under heavy scrutiny. Such acts as Courtney
Love and the Dixie Chicks have alleged similar questionable
accounting practices and filed lawsuits that could turn a spotlight
on industry tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Royalty suits against Capitol Records by Lee, band leader Les
Brown and the heirs of Dinah Shore and Benny Goodman were settled in
1999. Terms of those settlements are confidential.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically excluded from the Lee settlement are artists who are
suing Decca individually over royalties, including country music star
Loretta Lynn and the estates of Bing Crosby and Buddy Holly.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Lee settlement papers, Universal will set up a
$4.75-million trust account to pay any musician in the class or their
heirs who agrees to join the legal action. Included in the class are
music greats, living and dead, such as Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong,
Billie Holiday, Patsy Cline, Ella Fitzgerald, the Andrews Sisters and
Bill Haley and the Comets, according to Godfrey.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers have until March 8 to notify potential plaintiffs so they
can decide whether to join the action, drop out, or object.</TE>
<TE>   Universal lawyer Steve T. Kang told the judge that the company
will begin "some real detective work" to locate the Decca artists.
Under terms of the proposed settlement, a $700,000 trust will be set
aside for those who can't immediately be located and contacted, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, who is 81 and in ill health since a stroke in 1998, was
unavailable for comment. Born Norma Deloris Engstrom in Jamestown,
N.D., Lee once worked milking cows and first sang on the radio at age
14. She gained fame during the 1940s as a singer with Benny Goodman's
band, and was known during her years with Decca and Capitol Records
as a sultry blond singer of jazzy torch songs.</TE>
<TE>   Her Decca catalog includes standards such as "Lover," "Black
Coffee," "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," "Mr. Wonderful" and "I've Grown
Accustomed to His Face."</TE>
<TE>   Lee also acted, playing the first dramatic lead in 1953's "The
Jazz Singer" and writing songs and providing the voices of several
characters in Disney's "Lady and the Tramp." She was paid $3,500 a
week for her work in the 1955 film, but in 1991 was awarded $3.83
million in videocassette profits.</TE>

<HD>Intel Reluctant to Say Worst Is Now Over</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Chip maker beats estimates despite sharp drop.
EBay's earnings growth bucks tech sector trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Key technology companies including chip maker Intel Corp. and online
auctioneer EBay Inc. turned in mixed year-end results Tuesday, but
many surpassed grim Wall Street forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, investors punished the stocks in after-hours trading.</LD>
<LD>   With the sole exception of EBay, tech firms reporting quarterly
results announced dramatically lower sales and net income than a year
earlier.</LD>
<TE>   But after two years of decline, some analysts were saying the
worst may be over.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at the bottom," said Eric Ross, an analyst at Thomas Weisel
Partners. "Things aren't going to get any worse, but we are going to
take a while to get out of here."</TE>
<TE>   Intel said its fourth-quarter net income tumbled 77% to
$504million, or 7 cents a share. The world's largest chip maker
posted a net income of $2.19billion, or 32 cents, in the same period
a year ago. Sales fell 20%, to $6.98billion from $8.7billion as
demand for personal computers fell.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding acquisition charges, the company earned $998million, or
15 cents, topping analysts' projections of 11 cents a share. A late
burst of holiday buying boosted demand for Intel's Pentium 4 chip.</TE>
<TE>   For all of 2001, Intel earned $1.3billion, down 88% from
$10.4billion in 2000. Revenue was $26.5billion, down 21% from the
$33.7billion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   However, Intel shares fell on modest projections for first-quarter
revenue and the company's reluctance to predict a rebound. Intel
expects revenue to be between $6.4billion and $7billion in the first
quarter of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "Economic indicators remain weak," Chief Financial Officer Andy
Bryant said during a conference call for investors. While the company
is ready for a recovery, "we cannot predict when that will happen."</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the sense of caution, Intel said it would cut capital
spending from a record $7.3 billion in 2001 to $5.5 billion this
year. It said most of that drop was enabled by a new wafer size that
makes manufacturing more efficient.</TE>
<TE>   The cutbacks dragged down shares of semiconductor equipment makers
such as Applied Materials in after-hours trading. Intel slipped to
$33.76 in after-hours trading after ending the regular session at
$34.68, down 16 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Even firms posting growing sales and profits, though, could not
please investors with high hopes.</TE>
<TE>   EBay beat analysts' estimates as fourth-quarter earnings grew
8.7%, to $25.9million, or 9 cents a share, on sales of $219.4million.</TE>
<TE>   Shares rose 87 cents to close at $64.03 in regular trading, but
plunged $3.38, or 5.3%, in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   "Expectations were very high for this company ... not for the
quarter, but for the outlook," said Shawn Milne, an analyst from
SoundView Technologies Group.</TE>
<TE>   EBay said it expects earnings, excluding one-time charges of 32
cents or 33 cents a share in the first half of 2002, with revenue
between $490million and $510million.</TE>
<TE>   For all of 2001, EBay earned $90.4 million, or 32 cents a share,
on revenue of $748.8 million. Those figures all rose from 2000, when
EBay made $48.3 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $431.4
million.</TE>
<TE>   The number of people who used the site during the fourth quarter
increased 88% from the period a year ago, EBay reported, bringing the
number of registered users to 42.4 million. EBay has not lost money
since the company went public in 1998 and has surpassed Wall Street
estimates for nine consecutive quarters.</TE>
<TE>   In other tech earnings:</TE>
<TE>   * Handspring Inc. reported a second-quarter loss of $19.8 million,
or 16 cents a share, on sales of $70.5 million, down 39% from $115.6
million a year ago. The company reported a loss of $15.2 million, or
15 cents a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 2 hand-held computer maker attributed the widening loss to
brisk sales of its lower-priced--and less profitable--devices.</TE>
<TE>   Before releasing its earnings, Handspring announced that MMO2, the
fifth-largest European mobile phone company, will distribute its
hand-held computers in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland.
But the company also announced delays in its Treo communicator, a
widely anticipated combination of organizer and mobile phone.</TE>
<TE>   Handspring shares closed up 8 cents at $7.78 on Nasdaq. In
after-hours trading, it slid 83 cents, or more than 10%, to $6.95.</TE>
<TE>   * Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. said profit fell to
$77million, or 30 cents a share, down from $81million in the same
period a year ago on revenue of $122.5million, down from
$140.4million a year ago. Shares for the Israeli Internet security
company dropped $5.74 to $38.68 after the company warned of more
sales weakness in the near term.</TE>
<TE>   * Hughes Electronics Corp., posted a fourth-quarter loss of $136.2
million. During the same time a year ago, the owner of DirecTV had
net income of $1.06 billion, which included a one-time gain of $1.13
billion. Sales increased 11% to $2.28 billion for the company, which
is being acquired by rival EchoStar Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes and rivals have been hurt by slowing subscriber growth and
increased costs to carry TV networks such as Walt Disney Co.'s ESPN.
Hughes' TV programming and other costs rose 16% to $898.8million.
EchoStar executives have said the planned $35-billion purchase of
Hughes will help the combined company negotiate better programming
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   * Juniper Networks Inc. reported a fourth-quarter loss of
$5.13million, or 2 cents a share, compared to net income of
$62.2million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue for the
company, which manufactures equipment to direct Internet traffic,
fell 49% to $151million from $295.4million. After taking a third of
the market with its faster Internet router, Juniper's sales and
earnings declined last year as customers cut spending and rival
Cisco, the No. 1 networking-equipment maker, increased the speed of
its router. Juniper shares fell 14 cent to $17.96 before the results
were announced.</TE>
<TE>   * DoubleClick Inc. said it had a fourth-quarter loss of $64
million, up from a loss of $104.8 million in the previous quarter.
Sales for the largest Internet advertising company fell to $96.1
million from $132.3 million a year ago. The company, which attributed
the decline in sales to the failure of many Internet companies,
eliminated 479 jobs and lowered operating costs by 18% in the fourth
quarter.</TE>

<HD>3Com to Trim 500 More From Its Work Force</HD>
<DH>Technology: Payroll of networking equipment maker will be
less than half the size it was at the start of last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>3Com Corp. is cutting 500 jobs, or about 8.5% of its work force, as
the maker of networking gear seeks to return to profitability by its
fiscal fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   3Com also said it's transferring some marketing, human resources
and finance employees and responsibilities to its Business Networks,
Business Connectivity and CommWorks operating units. 3Com, which had
about 5,900 workers before the latest cuts began, is eliminating
positions worldwide, said Brian Johnson, spokesman for the Santa
Clara, Calif.-based company.</LD>
<LD>   3Com, which has reported losses in seven straight quarters, last
year cut half its work force of 12,000 and shed product lines as
customers reduced spending amid a slumping U.S. economy. The company
is retrenching again in an attempt to fulfill a promise to investors
that its loss streak will end this year.</LD>
<TE>   "It basically was on the wall that this company would either have
to cut operating costs or increase sales" to reach its profitability
target, said Kaufman Bros. analyst Clifton Gray in New York, who
rates 3Com's shares an "accumulate." Gray doesn't own shares of 3Com.</TE>
<TE>   "Considering the state of the communications equipment industry
right now--very soft--it makes a lot of sense. I just wonder whether
this is going to be the last slash of their employees."</TE>
<TE>   3Com shares fell 1 cent to $6.10 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. They
have fallen 41% in the last year. In its fiscal second quarter, which
ended Nov. 30, sales fell 50% from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   On a conference call last month, Chief Financial Officer Michael
Rescoe said sales will fall in the third quarter from the second,
potentially by 5% to 10%, as customers slow orders late in the
calendar year.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue will be unchanged or "slightly up" in the fourth quarter
from the second, he said.</TE>
<TE>   3Com's fiscal year ends May 31. Johnson declined to specify the
types of positions that will be eliminated under the latest round of
staff cutbacks.</TE>

<HD>Argentina Sells Dollars to Aid Peso</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Argentina sought to stem the peso's slide Tuesday after the currency,
officially unchained from the U.S. dollar last week, lost more than
half of its value in three days.</LD>
<LD>   The central bank exchanged about $8.8 million for pesos in
transactions with private exchange houses and banks, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The sale of dollars from reserves suggests the government will
fail in its efforts to maintain a fixed exchange rate for as long as
five months and will be forced to let the currency float, investors
said.</LD>
<TE>   Argentina's international reserves total about $20 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The market knows the central bank doesn't have enough reserves to
go around pretending to defend the currency," said Emilio Botto, a
money manager at BNP Asset Management.</TE>
<TE>   The peso, which had been fixed for a decade at one-to-one with the
U.S. dollar before President Eduardo Duhalde devalued the currency
Jan. 6, fell to below 2 per dollar Tuesday at exchange houses as
Argentines lined up for hours to change money. The devaluation was
official in foreign exchange transactions Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde has said he wants to keep the peso's market rate in line
with an official 1.4 per dollar exchange rate in a bid to restore
confidence in the economy before letting the peso trade freely. But
late Tuesday afternoon the central bank offered dollars at a rate of
1.7 pesos, and ended up selling about $3 million, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina, in default on its massive debt load racked up from
years of heavy government spending, devalued the peso in an attempt
to make Argentine exports less expensive for foreign buyers. But the
move has savaged average consumers' purchasing power.</TE>

<HD>NYSE Moves to Delist Enron Stock</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp.'s fall Tuesday from the august New York Stock Exchange to
the lowest tier of securities trading--the unregulated "pink
sheets"--reflects deep skepticism about the energy-trading firm's
past and future, experts said.</LD>
<LD>   At this point, few financial institutions will allow their names
to appear in the same news report as Enron if they can help it. The
NYSE, in its announcement Tuesday that it is suspending trading in
Enron pending an official delisting, avoided pointed language.
Instead, the exchange chose to explain the move by citing the
likelihood of a "protracted" bankruptcy, and uncertainty "as to the
timing and outcome of this process as well as the ultimate effect on
the company's common shareholders."</LD>
<LD>   The NYSE's technical basis for suspending trading--the first step
toward booting the stock off the market--was that Enron's shares have
failed to close above $1 for more than a month. That is one of the
grounds for delisting under NYSE rules.</LD>
<TE>   But the exchange has plenty of leeway in allowing companies to
trade even after a descent into penny-stock territory, if market
officials see residual value for shareholders, and a benefit for the
NYSE itself.</TE>
<TE>   One example is Bethlehem Steel, which has traded below $1 on the
NYSE since the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
Oct. 15. The stock ended at 51 cents Tuesday. Also, Finova Group, a
finance firm that exited Chapter 11 last August, has spent the last
two months below $1.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE temporarily halted trading in Enron on Friday, and that
halt lasted through Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Enron said its stock now will trade in the so-called pink sheet
market under the symbol ENRNQ. It was quoted there Tuesday at 50
cents.</TE>
<TE>   Pink sheet stocks are traded between brokers; prices can be viewed
at www.pinksheets.com.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of bankrupt companies frequently turn out to be worthless
when the companies reorganize. Thus, many experts say most trading in
Enron shares will be sheer speculation. "It's just hoping that you
buy low and the stock shoots up for a day on some news," said Jon
Schotz, head of Santa Monica investment bank Saybrook Capital.
"You're gambling. Red or black."</TE>
<TE>   But Lawrence E. Harris, a professor of finance at the USC business
school, said good reasons may exist for the NYSE and other markets to
continue listing companies that have fallen on hard times.
Flexibility in selling stock to record losses for tax purposes can be
important for shareholders, he said. Also, exchanges may not want to
lose listings of bankrupt companies that will emerge, reorganized, as
solid operations with new common shares, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Harris also said bond holders and other creditors of bankrupt
firms, whose claims take precedence, sometimes allow stockholders to
retain valuable interests as an incentive to get companies out of
bankruptcy more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, however, is a different matter, especially because its
accounting irregularities may have been outright fraud and, at the
very least, are inconsistent with NYSE requirements for accurate
financial reporting, Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   "The NYSE does not want its list to be depreciated by a rogue
firm," he said.</TE>

<HD>FDA Reprimands 4 Drug Makers for Misleading Promotions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>AstraZeneca, Pharmacia Corp., Abbott Laboratories and ICN
Pharmaceuticals Inc. were reprimanded by the Food and Drug
Administration for misleading consumers and doctors in promoting
their drugs.</LD>
<LD>   The agency said the promotions downplayed risks and lacked
balance.</LD>
<LD>   For example, AstraZeneca's advertising for its Nolvadex breast
cancer treatment implied "greater efficacy than demonstrated by
substantial evidence," the FDA said.</LD>
<TE>   The FDA has been trying to enforce boundaries set under a 1997 law
that lifted some restrictions on drug advertising and let drug makers
pitch products in television commercials.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is polling doctors and consumers to see how the ads
influence behavior. Critics say the ads spur consumers to demand
drugs they don't need.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca's advertisements for Nolvadex fail to point out that
the drug may increase a patient's risk of developing uterine cancer,
the FDA said in a letter to the company. Nolvadex is the brand name
for tamoxifen, a 25-year-old breast cancer drug.</TE>
<TE>   ICN's journal advertisements for Efudex, which treats precancerous
lesions, are unbalanced because they downplay risks spelled out in
the cream's label, such as the potential for miscarriage when applied
during pregnancy, the FDA said.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacia's claims for Genotropin to treat stunted growth confuse
readers because they don't clearly note caveats including the drug's
approval for children only up to age 2, the FDA said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Pharmacia, which made the claim in a mailing to
doctors, said "the company takes these things very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   The FDA warning occurred because Pharmacia thought that if it
didn't mention the drug's name, the mailing would be considered
educational and the company could advertise without mentioning risks,
Pharmacia spokeswoman Caroline Bullock said.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA cited Abbott's Knoll division for promotional materials
distributed in the Detroit area that included "before" and "after"
pictures of individuals said to have lost weight using Knoll's
Meridia obesity drug.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at AstraZeneca, ICN and Abbott didn't return calls.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA also recently found fault with Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and Icos
Corp. for promotions of their experimental impotence treatment,
Cialis, and with Cephalon Inc. for promotion of its Provigil
narcolepsy drug.</TE>

<LD>Under a court order issued Tuesday, EchoStar Communications Corp.
will continue carrying Walt Disney Co.'s ABC Family channel on its
satellite TV service until March 11 to allow for a period of
third-party discovery and depositions in the contract dispute suit.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. District Court granted Disney's request for an injunction
last month to prevent EchoStar from dropping the channel on Dec. 31.
But Judge Gary Allen Fees approved the satellite company's request
for discovery, postponing a hearing scheduled for Thursday until
March 11.</LD>
<LD>   Disney had objected to discovery, preferring a hearing this week.
But the court said Disney's claim that the uncertainty was burdening
the channel was "unpersuasive."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>DirecTV's satellite television service must carry stations owned by
Paxson Communications Corp. in 31 markets, U.S. regulators said.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission said DirecTV, which is owned
by Hughes Electronics Corp., will have 60 days to begin airing the
stations. Otherwise, the satellite service will have 15 business days
to explain to Paxson why it refuses to carry any of the stations, the
agency said.</LD>
<LD>   Since Jan. 1, satellite TV providers have been required to carry
programming from all local broadcast stations in markets where they
carry at least one station.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Paxson, based in West Palm Beach, Fla., gained 33 cents
to close at $10.78 on the American Stock Exchange. Hughes rose 10
cents to $16.90 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Kmart Board Meets; Bankruptcy Seen as Option</HD>
<DH>Retail: Standard &amp; Poor's intends to remove the troubled
discounter from its index of 500 blue-chip U.S. firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp.'s board of directors met Tuesday to discuss financial
options, possibly even bankruptcy, as the stock of the discount
retailer closed near a 34-year low amid concern over its failing
efforts to compete against the low prices of rival Wal-Mart Stores
Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's second-largest discount retailer has said that it may
need additional financing from banks after months of weak sales,
especially over the crucial Christmas shopping season. Kmart, already
in the middle of a $2-billion restructuring, has said its business
plans for 2002 and 2003 are under review.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not surprised the board is meeting," said Kurt Barnard,
president of Barnard's Retail Consulting Group. "If they don't get
the credit, the only solution I can see is a Chapter 11
[bankruptcy]."</LD>
<TE>   Under Chapter 11 of the 1978 Bankruptcy Act, a company is allowed
to keep control of its operations as it reorganizes its finances and
satisfies its creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Ferry, a spokesman for Kmart, said he did not know whether
any action would be taken after the board meeting concludes.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart will be removed from Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500
blue-chip companies after the close of trading today because of "lack
of representation," S&amp;P said in a statement. The company will be
replaced on the S&amp;P 500 Index by Plum Creek Timber Co.</TE>
<TE>   Since the start of the year, Kmart stock has lost half its value.
Kmart, which dates back to 1897, has been losing market share to
rivals Wal-Mart and Target Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Kmart, which is expected to report a loss for its fiscal
2001 year, fell 39 cents to $2.45 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The stock started its decline in December when Moody's Investor
Services downgraded the Troy, Mich.-based retailer's debt to junk
status. Troubles were compounded when Prudential Securities retail
analyst Wayne Hood suggested the company may file for bankruptcy if
its fortunes do not improve.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Standard &amp; Poor's cut Kmart's senior credit and debt
ratings. S&amp;P, which also warned of further downgrades, cited worries
that the retailer's financial flexibility is eroding and its
suppliers are losing confidence.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, prices on Kmart's senior bonds, regardless of
maturity, "converged" near 55 cents on the dollar. The activity
suggests bankruptcy looks more probable because in bankruptcy,
maturity does not matter. Bondholders get paid off based on how high
they rank in a company's capital structure.</TE>

<HD>Markets Rise Amid Anxiety Over Earnings</HD>
<DH>Stocks: Analysts forecast more volatility as quarterly
reports are released. Intel, Applied Materials slide in after hours
trading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buyers returned to Wall Street on Tuesday, lured by cheaper stock
prices but still anxious about impending earnings reports.</LD>
<LD>   With a wave of fourth-quarter corporate profit results ahead,
investors were wary of taking many chances. Stocks gave up solid,
early gains and fluctuated sharply throughout the afternoon, though
major indexes closed up from their lows.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone is a little cautious. They don't need any surprises,"
said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &amp; Co.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 32.73 points, or 0.3%,
at 9,924.15 after swinging between a 94-point gain and 26-point loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow snapped a six-session losing streak during which it
dropped 368 points, or 3.6%. The blue chips hadn't seen such a string
since they fell for three sessions before the Sept. 11 attacks, and
then five more afterward.</TE>
<TE>   The broader market also finished higher after a day of wide
fluctuations. The Nasdaq composite index rose 10.17 points, or 0.5%,
to 2,000.91. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index advanced 0.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Advancers led decliners by a 3-2 ratio on the New York Stock
Exchange and by a slim 19-18 on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have predicted choppy trading for the remainder of the
month, saying individual earnings reports could move the market in
either direction.</TE>
<TE>   "As the market tries to digest each report, there is going to be
some volatility," said Brian Belski, fundamental market strategist
for US Bancorp Piper Jaffray.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks are also vulnerable to profit taking as investors evaluate
how far prices have risen since the lows after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though the market has come down recently, it's still on the
overvalued side," Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   The technology sector was mixed ahead of Intel's results Tuesday.
Intel fell 16 cents to $34.68 in regular trading, and competitor
Advanced Micro Devices slipped 46 cents to $19.15. But Microsoft rose
$1.08 to $69.55.</TE>
<TE>   After the market closed, Intel announced that fourth-quarter
profit fell 77% but beat analysts' expectations thanks to strong
holiday computer sales. Intel fell 92 cents during extended trading,
after the chip maker did not sound particularly upbeat about business
in the near term.</TE>
<TE>   Chip equipment maker Applied Materials, up 30 cents to $45.61 in
regular trading, plunged $2.96 after-hours, reflecting Intel's
warning that it will reduce capital spending this year, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in tech, Check Point Software Technologies fell $5.74 to
$38.68. The company said first-quarter sales may be little changed or
down from the fourth quarter, dashing optimism that revenue would
increase.</TE>
<TE>   Financial issues were strong after Wells Fargo posted a 5%
increase in fourth-quarter profit due to a mortgage refinancing boom
that offset sluggish loan demand among its business customers. Wells
Fargo soared $2.30 to $45.32, while Citigroup climbed 84 cents to
$49.72 and J.P. Morgan Chase rose 56 cents to $37.87.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers were mixed following a report from the Commerce
Department that retail sales experienced a smaller-than-expected
decline of 0.1% in December. Wal-Mart Stores, which enjoyed healthy
holiday sales, rose $1.11 to $56.87.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Gap fell 98 cents to $14.57 and Kmart sank 39 cents to $2.45
after Moody's Investors Service reduced its credit ratings for the
retailers. Standard &amp; Poor's said after Tuesday's session that it
will pull Kmart from the S&amp;P 500 after the close of trading today.
S&amp;P said the retailer no longer meets the requirements for membership
in the index. Plum Creek Timber will replace Kmart in the index.</TE>
<TE>   * Rent-to-own store operator Rent-A-Center saw its shares soar
more than 20%, climbing $6.47 to $37.46, after announcing it expects
to report fourth-quarter earnings above analysts' estimates. The
company raised its 2002 guidance, based on a rise in same-store
sales.</TE>

<HD>McDonald's in Talks on Games Scam Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>McDonald's Corp. has been in talks to settle a lawsuit filed against
the marketing firm whose employees allegedly hatched a scam involving
the fast food giant's promotional games, an attorney said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ralph Shapiro, an attorney representing Simon Worldwide Inc., said
talks with representatives of McDonald's had been going on for
several weeks. He said the talks are continuing in some aspects of
the case, while they have ended in other areas.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't comment any more than that," said Shapiro, a partner with
the Los Angeles law firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers.</LD>
<TE>   According to published reports, McDonald's has informed its
franchisees that it has ended talks with Los Angeles-based Simon
Worldwide. In an e-mail to the franchisees, McDonald's said issues
surfaced that precluded pursuing an out-of-court agreement, and that
it will proceed in its lawsuit against the promotions firm to recoup
losses.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's spokesman Walt Riker on Tuesday refused to comment on
the report, citing the ongoing litigation.</TE>
<TE>   In October, McDonald's sued Simon Worldwide Inc., its subsidiary
Simon Marketing, and Jerome Jacobson, the man allegedly at the center
of the game scandal, as well as other defendants.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's complaint claims Simon Marketing engaged in fraud,
breach of contract, breach of fiduciary obligations and civil
conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Marketing has sued McDonald's seeking to recover damages
resulting from McDonald's decision to sever their relationship.</TE>

<HD>Mexican Stocks Rise on Credit Upgrade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexican stocks jumped Tuesday as investors cheered the decision by
the Fitch credit rating agency to grant Mexico an investment-grade
rating.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico's IPC index of 35 stocks rose 184.92 points, or 2.9%, to
close at 6,573.19, while the peso gained against the dollar.</LD>
<LD>   Fitch upgraded Mexico's long-term debt rating to BBB-minus from
BB-plus, citing the country's fiscal discipline as evidenced by the
recent passage of the 2002 budget and a tax increase package.</LD>
<TE>   Mexico's Congress voted to impose new taxes on consumers and end
some corporate tax breaks and government subsidies, in a package
lawmakers estimate will generate about $7 billion, or about 1% of
gross domestic product, in additional funds.</TE>
<TE>   Bank shares were among the strongest stocks Tuesday. "This [rating
upgrade] is a big benefit for Mexican banks as it lowers their cost
of capital, which will make them make more money and help them grow,"
said Jason Mollin, Latin American banking analyst at Bear Stearns.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said investors are hoping that Mexico's equity market
will be given a further boost by a much-coveted rating upgrade from
Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>
<TE>   "This does open the door for a rating upgrade from Standard &amp;
Poor's," said Valentine Carril, Latin American strategist at
Santander Investment in New York. "Almost a 90% chance."</TE>
<TE>   However, S&amp;P said Tuesday it will wait until at least next month
before deciding whether to grant Mexico an investment-grade rating,
to allow time for government officials to come to New York at the end
of January to make their case.</TE>
<TE>   An S&amp;P upgrade would confirm Mexico's economic integration with
the rest of North America, analysts said. It also would be seen as
opening Mexico's capital markets further to foreign institutional
investors, some of whom can invest only in countries with
investment-grade ratings from all major rating agencies.</TE>

<HD>Pfizer to Offer Discount Card for Medicare Patients</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pfizer Inc. on Tuesday unveiled a card that allows low-income and
disabled Medicare patients to pay $15 for each prescription filled
with its medicines, reflecting far greater discounts than cards from
rival drug makers.</LD>
<LD>   Starting March 1, low-income seniors can save about $50 a
prescription, based on the $65 average cost for a 30-day supply of
most Pfizer medicines, said Peter Brandt, senior vice president of
the drug maker.</LD>
<LD>   The "share card" will cover all but one of the medicines made by
New York-based Pfizer, including blockbusters such as impotence
treatment Viagra, cholesterol fighter Lipitor and antidepressant
Zoloft. Arthritis treatment Celebrex will be excluded, as it is
co-marketed with Pharmacia Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Some 7 million of the 40 million Medicare patients will be
eligible for Pfizer's card, the company said. Medicare, a federal
insurance program that covers elderly and disabled Americans, does
not reimburse patients for drugs unless they are received in
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Although Pfizer's card offers larger potential discounts than its
rivals, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis officials said they offer other
"patient assistance" programs that provide free drugs to lower-income
patients of all ages who have no insurance coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Sasich, of consumer watchdog group Public Citizen, said he
was afraid the various discount cards would take the pressure off
Congress to authorize prescription drug coverage for Medicare
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Brandt said Pfizer is offering its fixed-rate card in the wake of
the Sept. 11 attacks, which diverted Congress from earlier plans to
add a prescription drug benefit for Medicare patients.</TE>

<HD>Drop in Retail Sales of 0.1% Is Smaller Than Expected</HD>
<DH>Economy: Wall Street anticipated a December decline of
1.4%. Treasury secretary sees report as a further sign of recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. retail sales dipped in December, but the decrease was smaller
than expected and shows the consumer may be in better shape than
Federal Reserve policymakers believe.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department said retail sales dipped 0.1% in December.</LD>
<LD>   Although it was a second straight decline, it was much less than
the 1.4% decline Wall Street analysts had been anticipating.</LD>
<TE>   Sales outside of the auto sector also were off by 0.1% in the
month.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill cited the Commerce Department
report as further evidence that the U.S. economy is recovering from
its first recession in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   He said the economy probably will return to a growth rate that is
lower than its potential pace of more than 3%.</TE>
<TE>   "We see signs that the economy is improving, but the signs don't
give a clear indication that our rate of improvement will be as
strong as we'd like it to be," O'Neill said in a speech Tuesday to
the National Retail Federation in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the report shows the consumer, although not exactly
spending freely, did not go into hibernation in the fourth quarter of
2001 after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "It tells us consumers are not tapped out," said Ken Mayland of
ClearView Economics, a Pepper Pike, Ohio, consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan on Friday expressed concerns about how
well household spending will hold up ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The December retail numbers did little to sway most analysts from
the expectation the Fed will cut rates again Jan. 30 at the end of
its two-day policy meeting, but some acknowledged it weakened the
case for such a move.</TE>
<TE>   David Orr, chief economist with Wachovia Securities in Charlotte,
N.C., said the report "should move the probability of a Fed rate cut
on Jan. 30 back closer to 50-50," though he still believed there
would be a rate reduction.</TE>
<TE>   Another retail reading released Tuesday also was upbeat. The
Redbook Retail Sales Average, released weekly by Instinet Research,
showed purchases at discount, chain and department stores were up
4.3% in the first week of January, compared with the same week in

<LD>Creditors of bankrupt Sabena approved a financing plan for a new,
slimmed-down airline that would save 6,000 jobs and spare Belgium the
embarrassment of having no national flag carrier.</LD>
<LD>   Bankers Etienne Davignon and Maurice Lippens said they had raised
the necessary $267million to keep the former Sabena subsidiary Delta
Air Transport flying. They also secured the vital approval of all
creditors of Sabena's former in-house banker, SIC, which also is in
bankruptcy court.</LD>

<HD>BellSouth to Pay $150,000 in SEC Case</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BellSouth Corp. agreed to pay $150,000 to settle a Securities and
Exchange Commission case charging the telecommunications company with
improper accounting and other questionable business practices at two
Latin American subsidiaries.</LD>
<LD>   The commission's complaint alleged that managers at BellSouth's
Venezuelan wireless subsidiary, Telcel, paid $10.8 million to six
foreign companies and recorded the money as payments for legitimate
business services when no services were provided.</LD>
<LD>   Atlanta-based BellSouth, which owns 78% of Telcel, has been unable
to determine what happened to the money.</LD>
<TE>   The company did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement. BellSouth
said it has tightened its internal controls and fired and disciplined
several employees.</TE>
<TE>   The other charge concerned a $60,000 payment to a lobbyist for
Telefonia Celular, BellSouth's wireless subsidiary in Nicaragua. The
company was hoping for a change in Nicaraguan law allowing it to take
a majority stake in Telefonia Celular.</TE>
<TE>   BellSouth shares rose 35 cents to close at $38.91 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AMR Corp. asked its American Airlines pilots union to waive a
contract provision limiting growth at its American Eagle unit as the
largest airline company tries to stem losses.</LD>
<LD>   The Allied Pilots Assn. pact restricts growth at American Eagle,
whose pilots are paid less than those at American Airlines, as long
as pilots at the main carrier remain laid off.</LD>
<LD>   The contract also lets American Airlines pilots scheduled to be
laid off take jobs at the commuter carrier.</LD>
<TE>   In other news, American Airlines added express lanes at some U.S.
airport security checkpoints in an attempt to attract more business
travelers.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers paying business and first-class fares can use express
lanes at airports in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego and Reno/Tahoe,
Nev., the airline said. Beginning next week, lanes will be added at
New York's John F. Kennedy airport and in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   AMR shares rose $1.24 to $25.79 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>SEC Charges 3 With Internet Stock Fraud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three San Diego-area men face charges of operating an Internet
"pump-and-dump" stock scheme that produced more than $4 million in
improper profits, the Securities and Exchange Commission said.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC said that James E. Franklin used the Web site Red Hot
Stocks from January 1997 into 1998 to tout stocks he and others had
bought low so they could sell high following bogus recommendations on
Red Hot.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC's civil suit seeks a court order to prevent Franklin, two
other men and four related businesses from engaging in further
alleged fraud as well as forfeiture of their profits plus penalties.</LD>
<TE>   "Statements in Red Hot's profiles were materially false or
misleading because, among other things, they contained unreasonable
price predictions" and failed to disclose that the defendants owned
stock in the profiled companies, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in San Diego, also
alleges that Samuel Wolanyk operated the Red Hot site and wrote some
of the stock picks while Dieter Raabe issued trading instructions for
stocks profiled on Red Hot that were held in a Canadian brokerage
account.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants and their lawyers could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Drop in Jobs Seen for L.A. County</HD>
<DH>Economy: Chapman University's forecast says manufacturing,
construction sectors will be among hardest hit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of solid job growth, Los Angeles County will see payrolls
decline in 2002 because of continued weakness in manufacturing and
other key industries, according to an economic forecast released
Tuesday by Chapman University.</LD>
<LD>   Chapman economists predict that the county will shed 22,000
payroll jobs--a decline of 0.5%--with losses to be felt across every
employment sector except government.</LD>
<LD>   Manufacturing and construction will be among the hardest hit
industries.</LD>
<TE>   L.A. County ended 2001 with an estimated net gain in payroll
employment of 1.1%, or 46,000 jobs, despite the general downturn in
the economy and the spike in joblessness after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Negative employment growth in 2002, coupled with higher mortgage
rates, is projected to dampen home-buying activity and slow the
increase in home values. The Chapman forecast predicts a sharp drop
in appreciation for resale single-family homes in L.A. County, to an
average of 1% in 2002 from 8.2% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, nearly half of California business leaders surveyed say
the attacks had a high or moderate effect on their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Those are some of the findings of a business-climate survey to be
released today by the California Business Roundtable and the
California Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The 12th annual survey, which polled 400 business leaders from
around the state, revealed that 21% said the economic fallout from
the terrorist attacks had a high effect on their companies; 26% said
the tragedy has had a moderate effect on their operations. A small
majority, 51%, said last fall's events have had a minimal effect on
their businesses, while 2% didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   The survey also indicated that California's energy crisis remains
a concern to the state's business owners. Three-quarters of those
surveyed said their energy costs are higher than two years ago, while
57% said those higher costs have had a high or moderate effect on
their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than half--42%--of California business leaders surveyed said
the state is headed in the right direction. Still, 55% said they
believe business conditions will improve within a couple of years,
and only 2% said they plan to relocate operations to another state.</TE>

low $4-billion range," compared with its previous forecast of $4.1
billion to $4.2 billion.</LD>
<LD>   In its wireless PCS Group, fourth-quarter earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are expected to fall
in the upper $300-million range, with a full-year total in the low
$1.5-billion range. Sprint previously had estimated that figure at
$1.6 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Sprint fell 27 cents to $19, and Sprint PCS fell 64
cents to $17.32, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Platinum Equity, a Los Angeles buyout firm, agreed to buy French
phone giant Alcatel's telecommunications services unit. Terms weren't
disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   The acquisition is Platinum's largest in Europe. The Alcatel
division, which advises and equips companies looking to set up
telephone networks, has 6,500 employees and 400,000 customers in
Europe, and had revenue of $1.3 billion last year.</LD>
<LD>   Platinum, headed by billionaire Tom Gores, already owns
NextiraOne, a company that provides similar services in the U.S.
After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, NextiraOne worked to restore
communications to clients in lower Manhattan.</LD>
<TE>   Together, NextiraOne and Alcatel's unit will have revenue of more
than $2.5 billion this year, the companies said.</TE>
<TE>   Alcatel's American depositary receipts rose 47 cents to $16.79 on
the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Tyco Expects to Miss Forecast as Demand Falls</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Company's warning overshadows first-quarter
report and sends shares down 8.3%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL LAYNE</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>EXETER, N.H.</DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd., a manufacturing conglomerate and the largest
maker of electronics connectors, said Tuesday that its fiscal
second-quarter earnings will be less than forecast because of falling
demand from telecommunications and computer- networking companies.</LD>
<LD>   The warning overshadowed Tyco's report of fiscal first-quarter
earnings and sent its shares down 8.3%.</LD>
<LD>   "During the quarter we received [electronics] orders, only to have
those orders be canceled on us a week later," Chief Executive Dennis
Kozlowski said. Sales at Tyco's electronics unit probably will drop
as much as 25% in the period, after declining 19% in the first
quarter, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The projected earnings shortfall rattled investors already
unnerved by concern that Tyco manipulates results to keep profit
rising, an allegation that Kozlowski has long disputed.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco, which also makes ADT burglar alarms, trash bags and medical
supplies, said it expects earnings of 80 cents to 82 cents a share in
the second quarter ending in March.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts on average were expecting 86 cents, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   For the first quarter ended Dec. 31, net income more than
quadrupled to $1.45 billion, or 73 cents a share, from $317.4
million, or 18 cents, a year earlier, mostly because of new
accounting rules for acquisitions and sales and earnings from the
purchase of the CIT Group finance unit in June. Sales of security and
health-care products rose.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding one-time items, Tyco said it would have earned $1.47
billion, or 74 cents a share, a penny higher than analysts' forecast.
Revenue rose 20% to $10.1 billion, despite a 19% drop in electronics
business revenue to $3.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a solid quarter but the company gave the bears plenty to
chew on," Michael Regan, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston
Corp., wrote in a note to clients.</TE>
<TE>   He has a "buy" rating on the shares and doesn't own the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Tyco, based in Bermuda and run from Exeter, N.H., fell
$4.35 in heavy trading to $48.05 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Rising profit and sales at its health-care, finance and security
and fire businesses will help meet a $3.70-a-share forecast for the
year, Kozlowski said.</TE>

<HD>Wells Fargo Profit Rises 5% Amid Mortgage Surge</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Report sends stock up sharply. The amount
borrowed from the bank for home loans is triple a year earlier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wells Fargo &amp; Co. said fourth-quarter profit rose 5% as lending to
home buyers jumped when mortgage rates declined to the lowest level
in 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   Net income at the fifth-largest U.S. bank rose to $1.18 billion,
or 69 cents a share, from $1.13 billion, or 65 cents, in the same
period last year. Revenue increased 9% to $5.8 billion. Shares of
Wells Fargo rose $2.30, or 5.3%, to $45.32 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Wells Fargo, which serves about 20 million households, has "done a
very strong job of staying with its bread-and-butter businesses,"
said James Ellman, who manages $250million in a financial services
company portfolio at Merrill Lynch Investment Management.</LD>
<TE>   The San Francisco company benefited from a rise in mortgage and
consumer borrowing after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates 11
times to spur the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Wells Fargo reduced earnings by a total of $28 million because of
Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy and the financial collapse of Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Wells Fargo lent $38 billion for mortgages in the quarter, more
than triple the amount in the year-earlier period. Net interest
income, or what the bank makes from lending, rose 23% to $3.45
billion from last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still in a relatively favorable interest rate environment,
which is driving mortgage gains," said Michael Holton, an analyst at
T. Rowe Price &amp; Associates, which owns 7.2 million Wells Fargo
shares.</TE>
<TE>   Loans the bank doesn't expect to be repaid rose to $1.64 billion,
up 37% from the year-ago quarter. Still, the amount was almost
unchanged from $1.62 billion in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Other financial institutions reporting earnings, excluding
one-time gains or charges unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   * Golden State Bancorp Inc. said profit rose 22% as customers
increased deposits and paid for more transactions at its California
Federal Bank. Net income at the San Francisco-based savings and loan
rose to $109.2 million, or 76 cents a share, from $89.3 million, or
63 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   * Mellon Financial Corp., owner of the Dreyfus mutual funds, said
profit more than tripled on a gain from the sale of its 132-year-old
retail banking operation. Net income at the Pittsburgh financial
company rose to $807 million, or $1.70 a share, from $255million, or
52 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   * Northern Trust Corp. reported net income fell 18% to $102.4
million, or 45 cents a share, from $125.5 million, or 54 cents a
share, a year earlier. The Chicago bank said it had $43.5 million in
outstanding Enron-related loans, of which $24.6 million was unsecured
and written off.</TE>
<TE>   * Washington Mutual Inc. reported profit rose 69% to a record
high, as lower interest rates spurred a boom in home loans. The
Seattle-based thrift earned $842 million, or 97 cents a share, in the
fourth quarter, compared with $497 million, or 62 cents a share, in
the 2000 quarter.</TE>

<HD>Agencies Get Reprieve on City Funding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles' Workforce Investment Board gave a reprieve Tuesday to a
group of nonprofit job-training agencies that faced a loss of city
funding, agreeing to study the matter further and decide within four
weeks whether to give the agencies more time to comply with new
quality standards.</LD>
<LD>   The organizations--CHARO Community Development Corp., Pacific
Asian Consortium in Employment, Casa de Hermandad and Advanced
Computing Institute--failed a two-year certification process designed
to improve the quality and consistency of service delivered by the
centers citywide.</LD>
<LD>   The WIB, a city-appointed private-sector board, chose to certify
the groups using a process for measuring quality improvement that is
favored by the private sector. Though 12 nonprofits passed, the four
that did not alleged that the process was inconsistently applied and
did not take their performance records into adequate consideration.</LD>
<TE>   The board's executive committee convened the special meeting in
response to a City Council action Friday that asked the board to
spare the long-standing community groups.</TE>
<TE>   CHARO, PACE and Casa de Hermandad stand to lose at least
$1.6million each in annual city funding if the decision not to
certify them stands.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Woo, president of Megatoys and chairman of the WIB and its
executive committee, said city staff and the WIB's certification
subcommittee will review the concerns and report back within four
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "The sentiment is leaning toward giving them some more time to
help them certify," Woo said, although he added that the board still
must examine more detailed information on how poorly the
organizations fared and whether they have performed strongly in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The groups had been scheduled to appeal the decision not to
certify them at a Thursday hearing in front of a city and WIB panel.
But that hearing now has been postponed and no new date has been set.</TE>

<HD>Schwab Posts Net Loss of $13 Million</HD>
<DH>Brokerages: Latest results meet analysts' estimate as
customer trading activity picks up from third quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leading online stock broker Charles Schwab &amp; Co. on Tuesday reported
its first quarterly loss in 14 years, but said its business is
picking up again after plummeting with Wall Street's bear market in
2001.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company reported a fourth-quarter net loss
of $13 million, or 1 cent a share, contrasted with a profit of $139
million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Schwab hadn't incurred a quarterly loss since the final three
months of 1987--a period that included a market crash.</LD>
<TE>   If not for one-time charges to pay for layoffs and other
cost-cutting moves in the fourth quarter, Schwab said it would have
earned $109 million, or 8 cents a share. That still would have been a
33% decline from the prior year's operating profit of $162 million,
or 11 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The recent quarter's results matched the consensus estimate of
analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call. Schwab shares eased
1 cent to $16.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has
rebounded from a low of $8.94 in September, but is far off its 2000
peak of $43.</TE>
<TE>   The brokerage firm's fourth-quarter revenue totaled $1.06 billion,
a 21% decline from $1.34 billion a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   For all of 2001, Schwab earned $199 million, or 14 cents a share,
a 72% drop from net income of $718 million, or 51 cents a share, in
2000. Operating revenue in 2001 plummeted 25% to $4.33 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fourth-quarter loss, Schwab executives said they saw
encouraging signs in business at the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   With customer trading activity picking up from the third quarter,
Schwab expects to rebound in 2002, said Christopher Dodds, the
company's chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   "With every day that goes by, we are increasingly optimistic that
the worst is behind us," he said. "We are not planning on reporting
another quarterly loss for another 14 or 15 years."</TE>
<TE>   The company's loss during the final three months of 2001 stemmed
from the final phase of an overhaul that shed 6,700 jobs, or 25% of
the firm's work force.</TE>
<TE>   No further firings are expected unless business deteriorates even
more, Dodds said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Schwab plans to build on its discount brokerage
business by offering more fee-generating investment advice and other
services aimed at more-affluent customers.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say the field of advice-givers has expanded
significantly in recent years, so Schwab faces tough competition.</TE>

<HD>Nextel Stock Continues Slide After 'Sell' Rating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News, Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of wireless communications giant Nextel Communications
continued to slide Tuesday after a rare Wall Street "sell" rating on
the stock.</LD>
<LD>   Nextel shares fell 49 cents to $7.87 on Nasdaq after diving $1.64
on Monday, when Lehman Bros. analyst John Bensche cut his rating on
Nextel to "sell" from "market perform," citing a "challenging"
near-term outlook for the industry.</LD>
<LD>   The share price is nearing the four-year closing low of $7.17
reached on Oct. 2. The stock had rallied as high as $12.25 in early
December.</LD>
<TE>   Another analyst, Jennifer Fritzsche at Wachovia Securities, cut
her rating on the wireless sector to "neutral" on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "In an effort to gain market share, we believe many carriers will
lose their pricing power," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Verizon Communications' wireless unit said it added
fewer-than-expected new subscribers in the fourth quarter, amid the
struggling economy.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Western Wireless said it added 19,000 subscribers in the
quarter, which Douglas Makin, analyst at Kaufman Bros., described as
a "disaster." Western Wireless shares, which traded for $28 at the
start of the year, have plummeted. They closed Tuesday at $17.41,
down 59 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say the slowdown in the industry probably will lead
to more consolidation.</TE>
<TE>   Among other wireless stocks, AT&amp;T Wireless inched up 33 cents to
$11.79, and Sprint PCS fell 64 cents to $17.32, both on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Hewitt Stung by More Than Upset Loss</HD>
<DH>Australian Open: Ousted top-seeded player seethes over
Martin's injury timeout late in match.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Icing the Aussie turned into Spanish sport at the Australian Open.
And by the time Alberto Martin stretched and slipped through the fine
line of the rule book, he created history, making top-seeded Lleyton
Hewitt of Australia vanish from the tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Hewitt might as well have been a point guard, albeit a tiny one,
standing at the free-throw line, suffering through a couple of
timeouts by the opposing team with one second remaining. This, of
course, is accepted and expected behavior in basketball.</LD>
<LD>   Tennis used to be different. Martin's timing was either amazingly
coincidental or exceedingly calculating when he called for a
three-minute injury timeout near the end of the fourth-set
tiebreaker. Hewitt, set to serve, trailed, 4-5, and then had plenty
of time to think about being two points from losing.</LD>
<TE>   Which is what happened. Hewitt made consecutive groundstroke
errors and Martin won, 1-6, 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (4), making it the first
time the Australian Open lost its No. 1-seeded player in the first
round in the Open era.</TE>
<TE>   Australian Davis Cup Coach Wally Masur used the word "dubious," to
describe Martin's actions. Immediately after the loss, Hewitt accused
Martin of gamesmanship. Hewitt also was realistic, knowing his
fitness was not close to optimum level after he came down with
chickenpox on Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a shocker what happened at 5-4," Hewitt said. "He
was really struggling at 4-4 when he was running around there and he
had to come up with a huge forehand lob at 4-4 in the tiebreaker on
his own serve.</TE>
<TE>   "So you can read into it what you like, but you never know if I
was going to get out of the situation, anyway. I still had to win
that set and get out of the break and then win another set as well,
but it would have definitely made my chances a lot easier, I think,
if we had played fair."</TE>
<TE>   Martin denied any unfair play.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't agree," he said. "I think the rules are the rules,
and he called the trainer, and maybe was having attention from the
trainer. I had cramps. I called the trainer also. So it is the same
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Not quite. Hewitt waited until a changeover to receive treatment
in the fourth set. "It's not the right thing to do at 30-30 in a
game," Hewitt said.</TE>
<TE>   The rule can be manipulated. Previously, players could not be
treated for cramps during a match, but the rule was changed in 1995,
according to the ITF.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I don't know how many referees and people we had
sitting on the side of the court. There was at least three or four
people who saw what happened out there, saw him play the whole
tiebreak fine, and then come up with that," Hewitt said. "Someone has
got to put their [guts] on the line, one of the refs or somebody,
otherwise people are going to take advantage of it, like he did
today."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time a player has been questioned over the
timing of medical treatment during a match at a Grand Slam. At
Wimbledon in 2000, Jeff Tarango accused Paul Goldstein of faking an
injury late in their second-round match, refusing to shake his hand
after he lost. Goldstein, who received treatment on changeovers, said
he did nothing unethical.</TE>
<TE>   Already, trainers seem to have become a constant presence on the
court. Players have been hit by a litany of injuries, including
13th-seeded Andy Roddick in his main-draw Australian Open debut
against Mariano Zabaleta of Argentina. Roddick was wrong-footed in
the second game of the fourth set and turned over on his ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick said adrenaline got him through the grueling 2-hour,
50-minute contest, winning, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3, 6-3. On the court, he told
the trainer he was feeling twinges and was advised not to sit down
too long on changeovers. Afterward, he received treatment on the
ankle, electrical stimulation and ice, for almost an hour late today.</TE>
<TE>   Ankle permitting, Roddick is scheduled to play Ivan Ljubicic of
Croatia in the second round Thursday. Roddick tested the ankle in
practice today.</TE>
<TE>   There were mixed results for two other young Americans on the
men's side today in the second round. After winning the opening two
sets, James Blake appeared to be running on empty in the fourth set
against Stefan Koubek of Austria. He responded in what was a
contentious fifth set but fell short as Koubek advanced, 4-6, 2-6,
6-4, 6-1, 6-2, in 2 hours 34 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Wild-card entrant Taylor Dent of Newport Beach seems to be fine
without a coach and reached the third round of a Grand Slam for the
first time. He defeated No. 31-seeded Andreas Vinciguerra of Sweden,
6-3, 6-4, 6-2, in 1 hour 22 minutes and has not lost a set in two
matches.</TE>

<HD>Scuffle Takes All the Fight Out of Clippers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Brand, Ekezie and Maggette argue in hotel
before 97-83 loss to Minnesota.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Clippers got it all wrong again on the road, starting with a
scuffle among teammates in the lobby of their downtown hotel Tuesday
after a morning workout at the Target Center.</LD>
<LD>   Elton Brand and Obinna Ekezie got into an argument and things
began to get physical when Corey Maggette interceded. Brand and
Maggette were college teammates at Duke. Hotel guests and a reporter
who covers the team witnessed the players fighting and arguing near a
bank of elevators.</LD>
<LD>   Matters were resolved by the time the Clippers took the court
against the Minnesota Timberwolves, a game they would lose, 97-83, in
front of a crowd of 18,101. But it was another in a string of
embarrassing off-court incidents for one of the league's rising
teams.</LD>
<TE>   In November, Lamar Odom was suspended for eight games for
violating the NBA's antidrug policy for the second time in eight
months. He said he "chose to experiment with marijuana."</TE>
<TE>   Sources recently have told The Times that in March he skipped a
counseling appointment and was suspended for five games. It had been
reported that he used marijuana then too.</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks later, Michael Olowokandi was arrested on suspicion
of cohabitant abuse in the wake of a late-night altercation with a
former girlfriend at his home. The Los Angeles County District
Attorney's office declined to press charges after the woman recanted
her original story.</TE>
<TE>   Brand was the only one of the three players available for comment
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a family and sometimes we argue and fight about things," he
said. "It's over. There's nothing to be said. We've put it behind
us."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry was a bit more expansive.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, I'll talk about it," he said. "We don't condone one bit
violence or embarrassing the franchise in any way. I'm more disgusted
with the people who were involved because they're all quality
people."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry went on to say it was "an isolated incident" and
acknowledged that he asked the players not to comment. The Clippers
are the NBA's youngest team, with an average age of 24.8 years on
opening night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unfortunate incident," Gentry said. "The people will be
dealt with accordingly. We're not going to let it embarrass the other
players or the franchise."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers seemed to have put the fight behind them Tuesday
night, taking a 26-25 lead after the first quarter. Minnesota then
put the Clippers away with a 13-0 run late in the second quarter,
taking a 60-40 lead by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Wally Szczerbiak scored 21 points and Kevin Garnett had 18 points,
12 rebounds and eight assists for the Midwest Division-leading
Timberwolves, who won their ninth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Darius Miles had 18 points and 10 rebounds and Brand had 17 points
and 13 rebounds for the Clippers, who finished their six-game trip
with a 1-5 record and fell below .500 at 19-20. They are 3-13 on the
road.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked like a tired team," said Odom, who had 11 points in 40
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   That certainly was true in the pivotal second quarter, but the
Clippers outscored the Timberwolves in every quarter but the second.
The Clippers trailed by as many as 27 points, but made a late run to
trim the deficit to 88-75 with less than three minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>   "During that 13-0 run, they had nine layups," Gentry said of the
Timberwolves, who are 17-2 on their home court. "We turned the ball
over on four of seven possessions. You're not going to beat a good
team if you turn the ball over and give them a chance to run down and
make layups."</TE>
<TE>   About the only development Tuesday that cheered Gentry was Miles'
strongest game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Matched up against his boyhood idol, Garnett, Miles went to the
basket with confidence on every possession and made eight of 13
shots. Miles, a 20-year-old forward, also kept Garnett on the
perimeter for the most part, forcing him into taking jump shots
rather than letting him slash to the basket.</TE>
<TE>   Miles made the crowd gasp and cheer when he leaped high to snare
what at first looked to be an errant lob pass from guard Jeff
McInnis. Miles controlled the ball by tapping it from one hand to the
other, then slamming it through the hoop.</TE>
<TE>   The basket cut the Clippers' deficit to 84-66 early in the fourth
quarter and helped ignite their late charge.</TE>
<TE>   "He made him take some shots he didn't want," Gentry said of
Miles' defensive play against Garnett, who had averaged more than 30
points in his last three games. "Darius attacked the rim and did some
things that I'm really proud of."</TE>

<HD>For Record Scores, All They Need Is Hope</HD>
<DH>Golf: Short courses, perfect conditions mean Durant's mark
of 36 under might not last more than one year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA QUINTA</DL>
<LD>Welcome to the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, where par comes to die. If
your idea of riveting golf is to watch the best pros in the game
slash and burn and lay to waste four poor, defenseless desert golf
courses, then you've come to the right place.</LD>
<LD>   What is the reason for such carnage? Curtis Strange said it's not
really a mystery.</LD>
<LD>   "First of all, the courses aren't tough," he said. "And they don't
have a lot of length to them. Plus, the greens aren't fast and they
don't mess up in the afternoon. Also, there's basically no wind and
no weather conditions. And so you get to play courses with not any
length, and you'll have guys hitting wedges all day long."</LD>
<TE>   Let's make a mental checklist.</TE>
<TE>   Easy courses: check.</TE>
<TE>   Short courses: check.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect greens: check.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect conditions: check.</TE>
<TE>   Big thing to pick up Sunday: check.</TE>
<TE>   So what's this going to mean for actual scoring, as far as putting
goes?</TE>
<TE>   "Pick your number," Dennis Paulson said. "The ball stops six feet
from the hole when it hits."</TE>
<TE>   And everybody knows what that means. Mark Calcavecchia calls it a
"birdie fest." It's the same every year. There will be more wedges
hit into more greens by more players than at any other tournament in
the country. An unending loop of short putts will follow.</TE>
<TE>   This always means that the scores are going to be low. Last year,
Joe Durant won the Hope with rounds of 65-61-67-66-65, which added up
to a record 36 under par. No one had gone so low in a PGA Tour event.
Durant broke Tom Kite's 1993 record of 35 under, set at the Hope, of
course.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Kelly, who won last week at Hawaii, is sure that lower
scoring will be in higher evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't say people can't shoot a score out here," Kelly said.
"Believe me, they'll find a way. That record can be broken and it
will be broken, maybe in a year or two."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the matter of the 59, matching the lowest score of
any round in PGA Tour competition, shot by David Duval in 1999, also
at the Hope.</TE>
<TE>   It should be noted that there seems to be a strange convergence of
coincidence today as the Hope begins its five-day, 90-hole trip
through birdie country. The host course is the Palmer Course at PGA
West--the same place where Duval shot his 59 and the home course
location for the record-setting scores of Kite and Durant. Durant
says he fully expects to shoot another 61 sometime this week.</TE>
<TE>   Said Durant: "I'll shoot 61 every day ... it just depends what
hole I'm on when I get there."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Durant says he almost got lost in what he was doing,
which is understandable when he recorded his 11-under 61 at Indian
Wells. Built in 1956, Indian Wells is making its 43rd appearance as a
venue in the Bob Hope tournament rotation. It's the shortest course
on the PGA Tour--6,478 yards--and its friendly features include four
par fours of fewer than 360 yards and four par fives that are
reachable in two, most noteworthy the 483-yard 14th.</TE>
<TE>   Tamarisk has history, but not a lot of trouble. Built in 1952 as
only the second 18-hole course in the desert (Thunderbird was first
in 1951), you start with a 482-yard par five and lots of perfect
greens and mostly flat fairways.</TE>
<TE>   Bermuda Dunes is a shade under 7,000 yards and more susceptible to
wind than its course peers, but it's also noted for good greens and
even better scores.</TE>
<TE>   All things being equal, the best way to succeed at the Hope is to
beat up Indian Wells when you get the chance, then see how low you
can go at the other three courses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just so short," Paulson said. "I have a tendency to hit
everything pretty hard, so I have to swing differently with the three
short courses we play. It kind of gets my swing messed up."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody with a messed-up swing is going to do well this week. In
fact, if you're not shooting five or six under every day, you're
probably losing ground to the field. "These guys are good," Paulson
said. "What can you say?"</TE>
<TE>   How about 37 under this year? Is that possible?</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing would surprise me any more with the scores," Strange
said.</TE>

<LD>If there was anyone between Tujunga and Tora Bora who didn't think it
was the worst trade in Dodger history, they now have to be
reexamining that opinion.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not referring to the Tuesday trade in which new General
Manager Dan Evans finally pulled the trigger, sending Speaker of the
House Gary Sheffield to the Atlanta Braves for outfielder Brian
Jordan and pitcher Odalis Perez.</LD>
<LD>   I'm referring to the 1998 trade in which Fox executive Chase Carey
undercut then-general manager Fred Claire by trading Mike Piazza and
Todd Zeile to the Florida Marlins for Sheffield and four others.</LD>
<TE>   The trade spawned almost four years of tumult and soaring payroll,
and now the Dodgers have nothing left from it in the way of
personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield was the fifth and last remaining player that the Dodgers
acquired in it, and the end of their rebellious relationship should
come as a surprise to no one but Carey.</TE>
<TE>   The TV executive simply ignored--or may not have been familiar
with--Sheffield's pattern of erratic and outspoken behavior with
three other teams when he usurped Claire's authority and made the
lamentable trade for Piazza, but the Dodgers could no longer ignore
Sheffield's almost annual verbal assaults on management.</TE>
<TE>   The time bomb had to go, and Evans seemed to do as well as he
could considering it is late winter and he was operating under
duress, trying to trade a player other teams knew he was probably
willing to trade for a used equipment bag.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan is a proven run producer and acknowledged clubhouse leader.</TE>
<TE>   Perez is a legitimate young pitching talent.</TE>
<TE>   Only one problem.</TE>
<TE>   If Sheffield, who greeted the New Year by calling Evans a liar
less than a year after he ripped club Chairman Bob Daly and several
teammates, finally talked his way out of Los Angeles, his replacement
wasn't and isn't exactly thinking Dodger blue.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Jordan, whose Atlanta roots extend to his years as a
defensive back with the NFL Falcons, was left blue at the thought of
it.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was shocked, angered and real disappointed to learn he
had been traded.</TE>
<TE>   He even accused General Manager John Schuerholz of stabbing him in
the back given that Schuerholz had elicited Jordan's help in lobbying
Terry Pendleton to return to the Braves as hitting coach and then
gave him no warning he might be traded.</TE>
<TE>   "Life's a bummer," Jordan said, "[but] the Dodgers have a great
organization and I'll go out there and do the best I can. I'll go out
there with the idea of making them better. They finished only six
games out [in the National League West] with a lot of injuries last
year. They can win, no doubt about it."</TE>
<TE>   Soon to turn 35, Jordan is a football-hardened pro who came back
from two shoulder operations last year to hit 25 homers and drive in
97 runs. He is guaranteed $17.5 million over the next two seasons and
can be counted on to give his best, but here are the Dodgers still
scuffling amid the long and dark Piazza shadow, having finally dumped
Sheffield for a player whose heart is likely to remain in Atlanta, a
right fielder not thrilled with the idea of switching to left, and
who can demand a trade after his first season with the Dodgers. In
addition, Jordan will be coming west with a young pitcher whose
development, even Jordan acknowledged, has been delayed by a lack of
focus.</TE>
<TE>   Could Evans have done better? Should he have done better?</TE>
<TE>   The missed opportunity probably came in December when Evans may
have wanted one player too many in negotiations with the Oakland
Athletics, failing to close a deal that would have brought him closer
Billy Koch and outfielder Jermaine Dye. He would eventually trade
Luke Prokopec to Toronto for reliever Paul Quantrill and infielder
Cesar Izturis, but when the A's deal died, the Sheffield market went
with it. Clubs that may have been interested were wary of the risk
Sheffield represented in the clubhouse and the likelihood he would
demand a contract renegotiation if traded.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, having long insisted that he would have to be
overwhelmed to trade Sheffield, Evans was at a point of having to get
what he could. He maintained Tuesday that he wasn't simply out to
dump Sheffield, that he wasn't totally motivated by Sheffield's most
recent diatribe, but it can be said with certainty that from Daly
down, the Dodgers were determined to avoid another season with his
explosive bat and personality.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that Evans--at a difficult time in an
impossible market--was able to consummate a trade that has the
potential to make the Dodgers better, even with Jordan's hesitancy
and the question of Perez's focus.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of another left-hander with the versatility to start
or relieve--Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox recently said Perez is coming
up to a breakthrough season--improves the Dodgers' pitching depth and
puts them in position to possibly trade a pitcher for the
still-needed closer or better operate by committee in that role.
Jordan doesn't have Sheffield's home run power, but he figures to
pick up a significant portion of the run production and brings
charisma and leadership to a clubhouse in which several players
harbored resentment over Sheffield's comments of last spring and
merely tolerated his mood swings.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Sheffield's talent and temperament have long been in
the eye of the beholder.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking from Atlanta, where he is trying to keep pace with the
improving New York Mets in the NL East, Schuerholz said no one in his
organization questioned the acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had any trepidation about [Sheffield] we wouldn't have gone
forward," he said. "Good players and good chemistry have always been
equally important to us. You can't win if one is absent. We measure
that every time we make a personnel move, and in this case we feel
that we've made a hell of a trade. We talked to Gary and he's very
happy about coming here. He's one of the most dynamic right-handed
power producers in the game. The world knows we've had trouble
scoring runs the last couple years, and this addresses that in
capital letters."</TE>
<TE>   For the Dodgers, the only certainty is that a controversial
chapter in the Mike Piazza ghost story has finally ended.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Speaking recently about Gary Sheffield and spring training, a Dodger
official used the word "punch."</LD>
<LD>   It was not about whether Sheffield would work more on punching the
ball to the opposite field.</LD>
<LD>   Nor was it about whether he would help clubhouse attendants mix
the Gatorade punch.</LD>
<TE>   It was about whether, once in the Vero Beach clubhouse, he would
finally punch someone.</TE>
<TE>   And if so, who?</TE>
<TE>   Let's see, he is jealous of Shawn Green, so he might punch him,
right? Nah, Sheff is not that openly confrontational.</TE>
<TE>   How about Eric Karros? He has quietly ripped Karros for three
years, so maybe this finally blows up? Nah. If Sheff was going to
fight Karros, he would have done it on those occasions when Karros
openly asked him if there was a problem.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he would try a left hook on Dan Evans, whom he called a
liar? Or maybe the target would be Chairman Bob Daly, whom he called
a bigger liar.</TE>
<TE>   It was decided that, given his personality, Sheffield probably
wouldn't punch anybody.</TE>
<TE>   But the fact that this was even being seriously speculated was the
knockout blow that eventually landed Sheffield in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers traded their best player Tuesday not because they
didn't value him, but because they couldn't trust him.</TE>
<TE>   They feel he quit on them last year after midseason, when he was
moved from third to fourth in the batting order so he could bat
behind Green and help him see better pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield thought the Dodgers were giving Green special treatment.
So even though the move worked wonders for Green and the Dodgers,
Sheffield pouted.</TE>
<TE>   Of Sheffield's 100 RBIs, only six came during September, a month
when he batted just .216.</TE>
<TE>   During that same month, he was thrown out of a critical game
against Arizona in the first inning for arguing a strike call ...
while his teammate was trying to score on a passed ball.</TE>
<TE>   One official estimated that 80% of the time, Sheffield played
hard. The other 20% of the time, he disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Five days a week, he would be the team's smartest and toughest
player. Two days a week, he would let fly balls drop at his feet.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents knew exactly what the Dodgers knew. Why do you think
Sheffield recorded so many dramatic assists? Players liked to run on
him because, despite his good arm, they were willing to take a chance
on his head.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers didn't get rid of Sheffield because he insulted his
bosses. They got rid of him because of actions that insulted his
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   While Green broke the club home run record shared by Sheffield and
Duke Snider, Sheffield fumed, saying it really didn't matter to him.</TE>
<TE>   The August night that Green hit three home runs, Sheffield quickly
jumped into the batter's box after the third homer, preventing
prolonged Dodger Stadium cheers.</TE>
<TE>   Their quiet feud reached a boiling point during one September game
in San Diego, when the two players nearly came to blows in the dugout
after Sheffield felt Green didn't run hard enough to help Sheffield
reach 100 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, it turns out, weren't big enough for both of them.</TE>
<TE>   In earlier years, the target of Sheffield's clubhouse rips was
Karros, even when the first baseman was sound and hitting at least 30
homers with 100 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield has a great judgment at the plate, but questionable
judgment everywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   He was a Dodger for three spring trainings. He disrupted two of
them.</TE>
<TE>   He ended a great season in 1999 by refusing to play on the final
day in Houston--even though the game was a factor in an Astro pennant
race--because he didn't want his</TE>
<TE>   .301 batting average to dip below</TE>
<TE>   .300.</TE>
<TE>   During his 31/2 years here, he was clearly the Dodgers' most
talented player. But also during that time, he publicly demanded
trades, threatened retirement, warned that he wouldn't play hard, and
insulted Dodger fans who never booed him as loudly as he booed them.</TE>
<TE>   And all this time, what did Sheffield really want? It wasn't love.
It wasn't respect.</TE>
<TE>   It was money.</TE>
<TE>   Every tirade can be traced back to the fact that Sheffield
realized he was the only star on this team who was not being grossly
overpaid, and he wanted his due.</TE>
<TE>   This winter's final straw, when he ripped Evans in Jason Reid's
story that appeared on New Year's Day?</TE>
<TE>   It didn't just come to him while watching a parade. He had been
worried ever since buddy Barry Bonds warned him that if he didn't
goad the Dodgers into removing the option on his contract, in three
years Sheffield would find himself a 36-year-old free agent with no
bidders besides his own team.</TE>
<TE>   Sort of like, well, Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers briefly thought last year that agent Scott Boras could
help. But when even Boras acknowledged that he could not control
Sheffield's hate for the organization and some of its players, the
Dodgers knew it was time to dump him.</TE>
<TE>   Did they get fair value from the Atlanta Braves? Of course not.
When Sheffield suitors are flooding your phone one day after
Sheffield rips your general manager, you know you will never get fair
value.</TE>
<TE>   For their best hitter, they acquired a football player and a
23-year-old left-hander who has already had Tommy John surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's not all bad.</TE>
<TE>   If Brian Jordan doesn't turn out to be another Charles Johnson--a
player angered by a trade that takes him from his pregnant wife--he
could fill about 70% of Sheffield's void.</TE>
<TE>   If Odalis Perez's presence allows the Dodgers to trade a starting
pitcher for a closer before opening day, that takes care of the other
30%.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is pretty.</TE>
<TE>   But none of this is as ugly as it could have been.</TE>

<HD>Sheffield Goes South</HD>
<DH>Outfielder Is Finally Traded, and Dodgers Get Jordan, Perez
From Braves</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA and JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers relieved themselves of the migraine that was Gary
Sheffield, trading the disgruntled slugger to the Atlanta Braves on
Tuesday for veteran outfielder Brian Jordan, promising young pitcher
Odalis Perez and a minor leaguer. Now they may have to hold their
breath, hoping they didn't exchange a throbbing headache for a dull
pain around the temples.</LD>
<LD>   Sheffield's departure ends a contentious 31/2-year relationship
with the Dodgers; the productive but outspoken left fielder blasted
team officials while trying to force a trade last February,
criticized the team for giving players of lesser ability more money
than him, grumbled about where he hit in the lineup and rang in the
New Year with another body blow to the front office, saying he did
not trust the general manager.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan, the centerpiece of the Braves' package, seems to be the
anti-Sheffield, described by Brave General Manager John Schuerholz as
"a classy guy, a man of high character, a great citizen of our
community and a wonderful person," and by Dodger GM Dan Evans as "a
terrific defensive player, a solid offensive player and a leader in
the clubhouse."</LD>
<TE>   But Jordan, who was informed of the trade in a phone call with
Schuerholz after working out in Atlanta's Turner Field on Tuesday,
was clearly not thrilled with a deal that will pull him away from his
Atlanta home and force him to move from his best position, right
field--Shawn Green's spot in Los Angeles--to left field or possibly
center.</TE>
<TE>   "I was laughing with [Atlanta Manager] Bobby Cox and chuckling
with [hitting instructor] Terry Pendleton and then, 'Bam!' It ruined
my whole night," Jordan, 34, said. "I couldn't even talk to
[Schuerholz]. I hung up on him. He stabbed me in the back. Life's a
bummer."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who is in the fourth year of a five-year, $40-million
contract, was upset because Schuerholz had recently asked him to help
convince former teammate Pendleton to accept a coaching job and
free-agent pitcher John Smoltz to re-sign with the Braves. "They used
me to make the team stronger, and then you're gone," he said. Jordan
also lives in Atlanta year-round and didn't want to uproot his
family, which includes his wife, Pam, and three children.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed," said Jordan, who batted .295 with 25 home runs
and 97 runs batted in last season. "It affects my family more than
anything. My agent had no clue. I had no clue. But I'm just going to
go out there and do the best I can."</TE>
<TE>   At least Jordan didn't fume at the Dodgers, and in a conference
call later Tuesday he said he had not given any thought to the
possibility of demanding a trade after the 2002 season, a right he
can exercise because he is in the middle of a multiyear contract.</TE>
<TE>   "My agent mentioned that to me, but I'm not worried about that,"
Jordan said. "Even though the timing of this is not good, and I had
no idea it was coming, the Dodgers are a good organization.... I have
a lot of respect for them and the players they have. They can win."</TE>
<TE>   But can they win without Sheffield? For all his problems away from
the field, Sheffield, who has two years left on a six-year,
$61-million deal, was a force on it. He batted .312 with 113 homers
and 310 RBIs the last three seasons, an average of 38 homers and 103
RBIs a year, and he provided considerable lineup protection to Green,
who batted .297 with 49 homers and 125 RBIs in 2001. Of Sheffield's
36 home runs last season, 24 tied the game or put the Dodgers ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who bats right-handed, has never hit more than 25 home
runs in any of his 10 big league seasons. A career .287 hitter, he
has topped 100 RBIs twice. He has a career .337 on-base percentage,
compared to Sheffield's .399.</TE>
<TE>   "Sheffield was a tremendous player last year and for as long as
he's been here; his presence in the lineup will definitely be
missed," Green said. "At the same time, our acquisitions will help
us. Jordan is a consistent outfielder who puts up numbers every year,
and Perez is one of the best left-handed prospects in the game."</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield's comments about the Dodgers giving lesser players more
money was directed in part at Green, who signed a six-year,
$84-million deal, and that created some friction between the two.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Tuesday about his relationship with Sheffield, Green said,
"That's kind of a tough question for me to answer. From spring
training last year through the end of the season ... there was just a
lot of difficult emotions Gary felt he was going through. I
definitely think Sheff is a good guy. I consider him a friend and
just wish him the best."</TE>
<TE>   Though Sheffield is one of baseball's highest-paid players, he
often complained about his contract and a lack of respect. After
Dodger Chairman Bob Daly refused to give Sheffield a "lifetime
contract" last spring, Sheffield turned spring training in Vero
Beach, Fla., into a media circus, ripping the team on an almost daily
basis.</TE>
<TE>   Agent Scott Boras helped mediate the conflict between Sheffield
and the Dodgers last March, and Sheffield maintained a relatively
even keel throughout the season, but the Dodgers' attempts to trade
Sheffield to Oakland for outfielder Jermaine Dye and closer Bill Koch
this winter--despite Evans' claims the team wasn't trying to trade
Sheffield--prompted another outburst on New Year's Day.</TE>
<TE>   "It becomes frustrating to the point where you ask yourself, 'Do I
really want to be with this organization?' " Sheffield said at the
time. "I don't want to be with an organization that constantly tells
me one thing and then does another. I'm not going to sugarcoat that
one bit. I deserve enough respect not to be told things like that."</TE>
<TE>   Evans denied speculation that Sheffield's recent comments were the
last straw in a decision to trade Sheffield.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't 'get rid' of Gary Sheffield; we were not trying to
eliminate him from the Dodgers," Evans said. "We were not going to
move Sheff unless a trade made sense, and we believe this one does."</TE>
<TE>   Did the fact Sheffield was clearly unhappy in Los Angeles
contribute to the decision to trade him?</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly played a role, but it was not the central issue in
the trade," Evans said. "We had been talking to Schuerholz for more
than a month, long before [Sheffield's] comments appeared."</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Long before Bob Daly, long before Dan Evans, there was a history
and things that were said to Gary when he came over from Florida [in
the Mike Piazza trade in 1998]," Boras said. "These things were part
of the issues that surfaced a year ago. For both sides, the
clean-slate element was needed, and for Gary, operating on very firm
footing with a new organization like Atlanta achieved all of his
objectives."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta was one of 12 teams Sheffield, by contract, could not be
traded to. Sheffield agreed to remove Atlanta from his block list in
exchange for the Braves dropping Sheffield's $11-million option in
2004. Sheffield, who is guaranteed $9.5 million in 2002 and $11
million in 2003, can become a free agent after 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield, who will join Andruw Jones and Chipper Jones in what
should be a potent outfield, also waived his right to demand a trade
after 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who exchanged heated words with Dodger Kevin Brown after
getting hit by a pitch in a Grapefruit League game last spring, was
mentioned in trade rumors with Sheffield in March of 2001, but the
Dodgers balked because Jordan was returning after having arthroscopic
surgery on both shoulders that off-season. The 6-foot-1, 205-pounder
recovered from a subpar 2000 season (.264, 17 homers, 77 RBIs) to
have an outstanding 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers don't expect Jordan, who is guaranteed $6 million in
2002, $9 million in 2003 and has a $10.5-million option in 2004, to
produce like Sheffield. But with improved seasons from Eric Karros,
Mark Grudzielanek and Adrian Beltre and continued production from
Green and catcher Paul Lo Duca, Evans and Manager Jim Tracy believe
the Dodgers will have enough offense to compete.</TE>
<TE>   "There were times I felt the team would sit around and wait for
things to happen from Gary," Tracy said. "Now, we're more
diversified, more athletic, in a lot more areas.</TE>
<TE>   "We did lose a very good offensive player, but we also gained a
good one."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also gained a pitcher with potential in Perez, a
23-year-old from the Dominican Republic who can start or relieve.
Perez sat out the 2000 season because of elbow surgery and went 7-8
with a 4.91 earned-run average in 24 games, 16 starts, for the Braves
in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "He can be an elite pitcher; he just needs an opportunity to pitch
every five days and not have anyone looking over his shoulder,"
Jordan said. "Sometimes he tries to be too perfect, but he has great
stuff and great potential."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also acquired right-handed pitcher Andy Brown, who was
3-4 with a 3.92 ERA for Class-A Jamestown last season. With a surplus
of left-handed pitchers and starting pitchers, the Dodgers may have
the kind of depth required to trade for a much-needed closer.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still areas we can improve in," Tracy said, "but we
have a strength to draw from and created some flexibility in order to
deal."</TE>

<HD>Adams Joins Phillies' Rotation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terry Adams, the unsung hero of the Dodgers' starting rotation last
season, joined the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday, signing a
contract that could be worth as little as $2.7 million over one year
and as much as $19.5 million over three years.</LD>
<LD>   Adams, 28, had never started a major league game until June, when
injuries to Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby put him in the rotation. He
wound up second on the team with 12 victories and a career-high 166
innings.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers, fearful last fall that Adams might command close to
$10 million per season, did not offer him a contract.</LD>
<TE>   The Phillies' contract is loaded with bonuses for games started
and innings pitched, protecting the team in case Adams was a one-year
wonder as a starter, but affording him the chance to cash in--and
guarantee the contract through 2004--if he was not.</TE>
<TE>   Adams essentially trades places with Omar Daal, whom the Dodgers
acquired from Philadelphia in November.</TE>
<TE>   Daal, 29, who won 13 games and had a 4.46 earned-run average last
year, will make $5 million this season. Adams, 12-8 with a 4.33 ERA
last year, can make no more than $4.8 million this season.</TE>
<TE>   Adams said he is excited about joining the Phillies and thanked
Dodger Manager Jim Tracy for the opportunity to start. He couldn't
say whether he would have pursued a similar contract with the
Dodgers, he said, because they never discussed any contract with him.</TE>
<TE>   "[The Dodgers] never talked to us about any deal whatsoever," he
said. "With as much as I did for them, and with all the injuries they
had, not to even try to negotiate disappointed me. I laid it on the
line for them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By acquiring Odalis Perez in Tuesday's trade for Gary Sheffield,
the Dodgers added leverage during negotiations with pitcher Kazuhisa
Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   Even without Ishii, the Dodgers could complete a starting rotation
with Brown, Andy Ashby, Hideo Nomo, Daal and Perez, with Eric Gagne
and Terry Mulholland also available.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers agreed last week to pay $11.3 million to the Yakult
Swallows for the right to negotiate with Ishii, who wants to play in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers get their money back if they do not sign Ishii, whose
rights would then revert to Yakult, his Japanese club.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers made their initial offer, for three years, to Ishii on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii's agent said he was unlikely to respond before next week and
suggested a sizable gap exists between the money the team is offering
and the money Ishii is seeking.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to find out if we're going to be able to find a middle
ground," agent Joe Urbon said. "I'm confident we will."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Shaikin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Danny Graves signed a one-year contract with the
Cincinnati Reds worth $3,525,000. Graves had a career-high 32 saves
last season for the Reds and was 6-5 with a 4.15 ERA.... Robert Fick
signed a $1.15-million, one-year contract with the Detroit Tigers.
Fick, an outfielder, catcher and first baseman, batted .272 with 19
home runs and 61 runs batted last season for the Tigers.... Detroit
pitchers Matt Anderson, Danny Patterson and Jeff Weaver, infielder
Shane Halter and outfielder Dmitri Young filed for salary
arbitration.... Pitcher Brian Meadows signed a minor league contract
with the Minnesota Twins. Meadows was 1-6 with a 6.97 ERA last season
for the Kansas City Royals.... Former catcher Mike Stanley was hired
by the Boston Red Sox as bench coach. Stanley, 38, played with Boston
in two stints between 1996-2000. He batted .270 with 187 homers and
702 RBIs with five teams in 15 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox signed Ryo Kumagai, a submarine-style right-hander, to
a minor league contract. Kumagai, 22, did not give up an earned run
in 47 innings last season as the closer for Tohoku Fukushi University
in Japan. In four college seasons, Kumagai had a 0.91 ERA. Tohoku
Fukushi is the school that produced Seattle Mariner closer Kazuhiro
Sasaki.... Former Dodger catcher Carlos Hernandez, a free agent,
signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies. Hernandez
played with the St. Louis Cardinals last year.</TE>

<HD>Gentry Plans to Shorten His Rotation</HD>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Clippers will have a different look Friday when they return to
Staples Center to play the Cleveland Cavaliers.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Alvin Gentry said he plans to limit the number of players in
that game and in those to follow. He has been playing 10 men for most
of the season.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers play four of their next five at home before starting
a seven-game trip that will take them to the All-Star break next
month. The Clippers' longest trip sends them to Memphis, Dallas, San
Antonio, Atlanta, Boston, New York and Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   "We can't play 10 guys and I'm not going to try to," Gentry said.
"Somebody's going to have to sit and not play. I'm trying to play too
many people right now. We're not getting enough consistency. We'll
meet as a coaching staff and we'll talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   The most likely candidate to sit is backup center Sean Rooks, who
played only 13 minutes Tuesday against Minnesota and missed three
shots. It's uncertain who the other player will be.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' road woes were a constant source of frustration for
them on their six-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm eager to get home," Gentry said after the Clippers went 1-5
against Philadelphia, Washington, New Jersey, Charlotte, Toronto and
Minnesota. "The road is tough. If we could have found a way to win
the Charlotte game [when they squandered an eight-point lead in the
final 1:25 and lost in overtime], we could have two wins. That's not
great. We have to continue on our next trip to find a way to put
together some good games on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not happy with a 1-5 record. We've got to go home and
figure out what we can do better.... We've got to get home and
regroup before we leave for the next trip."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry praised the Timberwolves, who are 28-9 and leading the
Midwest Division.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a heck of a team," he said. "They have a lot of weapons.
They have one great, great player and another one on the verge of
being a great player."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry was referring to Kevin Garnett and Wally Szczerbiak.</TE>
<TE>   "They put pressure on you at all positions," Gentry continued. "I
like their team. They're playing without Gary Trent and Terrell
Brandon and they're still very effective. When they get those guys
back, it will give them an even deeper bench."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If it was up to Mighty Duck captain Paul Kariya, he would not be
included among the players selected as reserves today for the NHL
All-Star game, which will be held at Staples Center on Feb. 2.</LD>
<LD>   "The way I've been playing, I don't deserve to go," said Kariya,
who has 17 goals this season, including a hat trick in the Ducks' 5-3
victory over Nashville on Monday. "We'll see how it goes."</LD>
<LD>   With 61,304 votes, Kariya finished sixth among wingers in
balloting for the North American starters who will face a World team.
Kariya, in his eighth season, has appeared in five of all-star games.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Bryan Murray believes Kariya's lack of goals should not keep
him out of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "If the coaches are watching the games, night in and night out ...
they'll pick him," Murray said. "Paul Kariya will probably end up
having 25 goals by the all-star break, at least I hope. But I think
people see his effort."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Jason York, who has sat out four games in a row because
of right-shoulder tendinitis, is questionable for tonight's game
against Buffalo. Winger Jeff Friesen, who aggravated an ankle injury
and did not play in the third period against Nashville, also is
questionable.</TE>

<TE>   The Ducks recalled left wing Timo Parssinen from Cincinnati of the
American Hockey League Parssinen has one point in six games with the
Ducks this season.</TE>

<LD>Because one bettor was able to pick the final six winners at Santa
Anita on Sunday, there is no hefty pick-six carry-over awaiting as
the Arcadia track begins another week of racing this afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   There is, however, a modest two-day carry-over of $27,458 at
Golden Gate Fields, and the Northern California track has some
competitive races today.</LD>
<LD>   A total of 62 horses are entered in the pick-six races and the
smallest field in the sequence is nine, in the third, fourth and
eighth races at Golden Gate.</LD>
<TE>   The third is a six-furlong sprint for $4,000 claimers who have not
won twice and the top contender is Bullet Buck, who has been first or
second in four of six races at Golden Gate. Handsome Son comes off a
solid third in his most recent effort and has the benefit of the
hot-riding and talented apprentice Kevin Krigger.</TE>
<TE>   Window B, who has won three of his last four, will make his first
start for trainer Jerry Hollendorfer in the fourth and is scheduled
to race coupled with Mining For Fun. The six-furlong race also
includes Chicago Joe, a speedster who was claimed for $40,000 last
month, and Gotta Go To Work, a tough-luck loser at 13-1 on Dec. 17 at
Golden Gate.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth and sixth are bad maiden claimers, the seventh is a turf
route for older fillies and mares. Gin Running, who often
disappointed down south, will try to win for only the second time and
will be ridden by Russell Baze. The mare to beat is Schnitzel, who
has won three times in six tries on the local turf but was
overmatched in her most recent race on Dec. 8.</TE>
<TE>   The card and the pick-six are completed by a six-furlong dash for
$12,500 claimers. In a race that should have a quick early pace,
Court Shenanigans could be the right horse. The late runner has three
seconds and a victory in his last four starts. In his last
appearance, he was second to the streaking First Stringer.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The seventh at Santa Anita is only a classified
allowance race on the turf, but it has almost a stakes-quality field.
Trainer Ron McAnally, who won the San Gorgonio on Sunday with Tout
Charmant, will try for another grass victory with the entry of
Kalatiara and Old Money. Bobby Frankel also entered a pair, Twin Set
and Rolly Polly.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Elvis Trujillo. The teenage apprentice has won with six
of his first 23 mounts at Santa Anita. He is scheduled to ride Free
Thoughts in today's third and Hezacatseye in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  The field in today's sixth at Golden Gate. The 14
original entrants are a combined 0 for 115.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A trifecta in the fourth using Blastoise on
top with Saying Grace, Dellavallade and Scattered Jewels in the two
hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/41. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $7.20/$264.40. Total money bet: $258.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Early in the season, Andy Murray took a firm stand when he stuck with
Felix Potvin, even though the Kings' No. 1 goaltender was having
problems stopping the puck.</LD>
<LD>   But after the Kings started 5-11-1-2, Murray decided to give
backup Jamie Storr a serious look at Minnesota on Nov. 18. The move
must have worked because since then, goaltending hasn't been an issue
and the Kings have gone 15-6-6 after Tuesday night's 2-0 victory over
Nashville.</LD>
<LD>   Potvin, who had a 1.90 goals-against average in his last 17
appearances before Tuesday, was in goal against the Predators for his
18th start in 21 games.</LD>
<TE>   With the Kings not scheduled for games in successive days until
after the Olympic break in late February, Murray's problem now is
getting more playing time for Storr, who has an impressive 1.68
goals-against average.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll certainly keep Jamie involved," Murray said. "I think he's
deserving of that. Both goalies have been getting the job done for
us, so it's a way to keep both guys sharp. So we will involve Jamie,
certainly. But I haven't put an exact schedule together."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   King captain Mattias Norstrom will carry the Olympic flame as part
of the Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Torch Relay today at 8 a.m. Norstrom,
who will play for Sweden in next month's Olympics, is scheduled to
run with the torch in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before Tuesday's game against the Predators, veteran winger Kelly
Buchberger was honored for playing in his 1,000 game last week at New
Jersey.</TE>

<LD>All you need to know is that if the playoffs were to begin today, the
Kings would be in them.</LD>
<LD>   With Calgary losing at home to the New York Islanders, the Kings
moved past the Flames for the eighth and final playoff spot in the
Western Conference with a well-earned 2-0 victory over Nashville on
Tuesday night in front of 15,702 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Right wing Steve Heinze scored a third-period goal and Craig
Johnson added an empty-net goal, but it was Felix Potvin who made
sure the Kings didn't blow their opportunity with a terrific game in
goal, making 24 saves to register his second shutout of the season
and second in 2002.</LD>
<TE>   Potvin, who blanked the Islanders on Jan. 5, is 9-3-1 in his last
13 starts.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who improved to 12-3-3 since Dec. 8, had trouble
offensively against Nashville, which has given up the fifth-most
goals in the conference and has lost five consecutive games on the
road.</TE>
<TE>   That shouldn't have been too much of a surprise for King Coach
Andy Murray, who said before the game that his team still has plenty
of room for improvement despite their success over the last five
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that we've got individual players that could play better
than they're playing," Murray said. "We could be more consistent on
our forechecking, we could be more consistent in our defensive zone
play. It's not everybody, but it's certain players that need to play
better.</TE>
<TE>   "We still think that we can get more out of our so-called top six
forwards--that there's more to be had than what we've had."</TE>
<TE>   On a night when Los Angeles' offense had a difficult time against
Nashville goaltender Tomas Vokoun, who got the call instead of No.1
goalie Mike Dunham, the Kings definitely needed Potvin on top of his
game at home, where they are 9-8-3-1 this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We've struggled at home, but the fans have been great," right
wing Kelly Buchberger said. "We have to start getting the job done
here like we have on the road."</TE>
<TE>   Winning on the road is something the Kings have done very well of
late. They are 9-3-4 over their last 16 games away from Staples
Center, including a recent 4-1 trip that saw them complete the NHL's
first sweep over New Jersey and the New York Rangers and Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   But in their first game since returning to Los Angeles, the Kings
appeared sluggish right from the opening faceoff Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   With Nashville playing its second game in as many nights after
losing to the Mighty Ducks in Anaheim on Monday, the Kings may have
wanted to jump on the Predators early, but they had trouble finding
the net. Several times the Kings appeared in great position to score
but were either off the mark or a little late with their shot.</TE>
<TE>   After being outshot, 8-7, in the first period, the Kings had to
rely on Potvin to keep the game scoreless in the second. Nashville
had 10 shots on goal compared to the Kings' four in the period, but
Potvin stepped up to make a couple of big-time saves on Vitali
Yachmenev and Bill Houlder over the final five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings finally were able to get the puck past Vokoun 4:16 into
the third period when Heinze scored his 15th goal of the season off a
great assist from Jason Allison.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were able to hold off the Predators the rest of the
game, thanks to their penalty-killing  unit, which entered the game
ranked No.1 in the league.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings killed four man-advantage situations for Nashville,
giving them 39 consecutive penalty kills.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings will play four of their next five games at home with
their only road game against the Ducks, and will return from the NHL
all-star break with four of five games at Staples Center before the
league's two-week Olympic break.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to take advantage of our home schedule, and we have to
play better at home," Murray said before Tuesday's game. "We have to
realize we need to keep our feet on the ground, battle every night
and try and get ourselves into the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Now it is up to the Kings to stay there.</TE>

<HD>Bryant Hits Top of Jackson's Meter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson saw more than his share of spectacular offensive
displays when he coached Michael Jordan with the Chicago Bulls.</LD>
<LD>   But Jackson said Tuesday that Kobe Bryant's 56-point performance
against the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night--accomplished in three
quarters--might be the best he has witnessed.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think I've ever seen anybody get 56 points in three
quarters, whether it's Michael or anybody," Jackson said. "So that
has to rank right up there at the top."</LD>
<TE>   Teammates were also impressed, especially because Bryant turned it
up in the first game after a trip that ended with consecutive losses
at Minnesota and Chicago. Bryant missed all six of his field-goal
attempts in overtime and also missed a free throw with 7.5 seconds
left in the extra period in the 106-104 loss to the Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen some guys get hot, but I don't think I've seen anyone
do it seemingly as easy as he seemed to do it last night," veteran
guard Brian Shaw said. "But we see that in practice every day. If he
has a bad game, he's the first one in here working on his stuff
trying to get it right."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's previous high was 51 points in a 125-122 overtime loss
against the Golden State Warriors on Jan. 6, 2000. He said a personal
showcase was not in his plans when he arrived at Staples Center on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I came into the game with the mind-set of getting everybody else
involved," Bryant said. "It was just one of those nights.... one of
those freak situations."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said the last time he felt that good on the court was,
"probably in high school, the state playoffs or something." As
Bryant's point total kept increasing Monday, teammates encouraged him
to keep shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "They were saying, 'Give him the ball. He's on fire. Don't touch
his hand,'" Bryant said. "They wanted to make some jokes and clown
around, but they didn't want to disrupt my rhythm." At one point,
Jackson jokingly urged the Lakers to spread the wealth.</TE>
<TE>   "I just told them, 'Stop passing him the ball. Somebody else take
a few shots. You're wearing this kid out,'" Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant made 21 of 34 field-goal attempts--including three of six
three-pointers--and 11 of 12 free throws in 34 minutes. Jackson said
he would have left Bryant in to chase the Laker record of 71 points
set by Elgin Baylor if the game had been close or if it was the last
game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker center Shaquille O'Neal remains mum about his three-game
suspension without pay for throwing a punch at Brad Miller of the
Chicago Bulls, but he had a message nonetheless for media
representatives after practice Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Taped to O'Neal's practice jersey was a white piece of paper with
black letters that read: "IN HINDU CULTURE, THE ELEPHANT IS TALL,
REGAL, MAJESTIC, STRONG, POWERFUL AND ENIGMATIC.</TE>
<TE>   "A HINDU PROVERB STATES THAT WHEN AN ELEPHANT IS DOWN EVEN A FROG
WILL KICK HIM.</TE>
<TE>   "ISN'T THAT RIGHT, PLASCHKE?"</TE>
<TE>   The message apparently was composed in response to a column
written by Bill Plaschke of The Times that said O'Neal should be held
accountable for his actions. Jackson said he did not know where
O'Neal found inspiration for his message.</TE>
<TE>   "He came out with that and said, 'What do you think about this?' I
said, 'That's all right. It's pretty clever,'" Jackson said. "I think
the big elephant is OK. He's not down. No frog is going to kick him."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said the missed games could actually do O'Neal, and the
Lakers, some good.</TE>
<TE>   "He's physically being able to restrengthen some of the things
that we think are great to do in the middle of the season," Jackson
said. "More than likely, he won't have to miss the All-Star game now
because of this period of time he's got off. And he can do some
things that hopefully can relieve some of that discomfort in his toe
and maybe come back a little bit stronger for a little bit longer
time. Maybe we'll solve this problem after all."</TE>

<HD>Iverson Scores Career-High 58</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allen Iverson and Larry Brown still found something to disagree
about: Whether or not Kobe Bryant inspired Iverson to have his best
scoring night.</LD>
<LD>   Iverson scored a career-high 58 points, the most in an NBA game in
almost two years and the fourth-highest total in team history, as the
76ers beat the Houston Rockets, 112-106, in overtime at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Iverson was 21 of 42 from the field and made all 14 of his free
throws for his seventh 50-point game. It came one night after Bryant
scored 56 in only three quarters for the Lakers.</LD>
<TE>   "You knew when Kobe got 56, he'd be looking to have a big game,"
said Brown. "He was incredible. He took very few bad shots, none in
the fourth quarter. He had a phenomenal game."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, however, said Bryant's performance didn't inspire him at
all.</TE>
<TE>   "I've won scoring titles, I've scored 50 points before and I have
won individual awards," Iverson said. "I haven't won a championship,
and that is the only thing I am concerned about."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson's previous career-high was 54, accomplished twice.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want the ball when I'm in a groove like that," said
Iverson, who had 20 points at halftime, 17 in the third, 14 in the
fourth and seven in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Cuttino Mobley led the Rockets with 25 points. Mobley, with Eric
Snow all over him, had a chance to win it in regulation, but missed a
jumper as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 96, Washington 91--Tim Duncan came back from a
one-for-12 start to score 16 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter
to lead the Spurs at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan struggled for 20 points on five-for-21 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 106, Indiana 102--Tim Thomas scored 25 points and Sam
Cassell and Ray Allen each had 23 as the Bucks held on at
Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers rallied to within two points late in the game despite
losing Reggie Miller to an ejection and Jermaine O'Neal to a sprained
left knee.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 92, Detroit 90--Vince Carter scored 24 points, including a
game-tying dunk with 2:26 remaining and two go-ahead free throws with
13.4 seconds left to lift the Raptors at Auburn Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 116, Atlanta 107--Dirk Nowitzki scored 40 points and the
Mavericks tied a franchise record with 18 three-pointers in winning
at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta got a career-best 46 points from Jason Terry.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 109, Cleveland 102--Chris Webber had 34 points and 14
rebounds, and Peja Stojakovic had 36 points at Sacramento as the
Kings won their ninth in a row after trailing for three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 94, Chicago 86--David Wesley tied his season-high with
26 points to lead the Hornets at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leon Smith, a troubled 6-foot-10 forward who went from high school
to the NBA in 1999, agreed to a 10-day contract with the Atlanta
Hawks. ... The San Antonio Spurs put rookie point guard Tony Parker
(sprained ankle) on the injured list. ... The Charlotte Hornets
activated forward George Lynch (foot) and placed Jerome Moiso (knee)
on the injured list. ... The Chicago Bulls activated forward Eddie
Robinson, an off-season acquisition who has played only three games
because of a toe injury.</TE>

<KH>Sam Farmer  ON THE NFL</KH>
<HD>Miller's Value Is Clear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The starting quarterbacks still around in the NFC playoffs: past most
valuable player Brett Favre, current MVP Kurt Warner, future MVP
Donovan McNabb ... and Chicago's Jim Miller.</LD>
<LD>   One of these things is not like the others.</LD>
<LD>   OK, so Miller has the third-lowest passer rating in the conference
and has only 13 touchdown passes--almost three times fewer than
Warner (36). Still, he has done a marvelous job of running Chicago's
ultra-conservative offense, which inspires such stirring nicknames as
the "Run &amp; Shoop" (offensive coordinator John Shoop never met a
handoff he didn't like) and the "Take a Knee."</LD>
<TE>   Chicago is the City of Big Shoulders, but the Bears don't rest
their entire game plan on Miller's. That strategy will help them in
the playoffs. Green Bay would be lost without Favre. St. Louis is in
trouble without Warner. And, simply put, McNabb is Philadelphia's
offense. As for the Bears, however, they could keep cruising along if
they had to use Shane Matthews at quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say Miller is just a guy taking up space in the
huddle. He's a good pocket passer who, unlike Matthews, can throw
deep when asked. His touch is questionable, though, and he has been
known to fire passes he should have floated. The Bears don't ask him
to throw too much, though, instead relying on him to make a few plays
a game and otherwise protect the football.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't make mistakes," he said, "you're going to win a lot
of football games."</TE>
<TE>   There is talk the Bears will make a run at New England's Drew
Bledsoe after the season. But he will be far more expensive than
Miller and might not be able to do much more in Shoop's restrictive
system.</TE>
<TE>   Not only has Miller helped the Bears to a 13-3 record and the NFC
Central title, he has stayed uncharacteristically healthy. He blew
out his Achilles' tendon and sat out the second half of last season,
missing his chance to take over the team in the wake of Cade McNown's
shoulder injury.</TE>
<TE>   A year before that, Miller served a four-game suspension after
testing positive for steroids, a mess he still blames on a simple
misunderstanding.</TE>
<TE>   There were plenty of times he thought a chance like this would
never come. A year ago this week, he was whizzing around on a
snowmobile, his foot in a cast, contemplating his life after
football. Now, he's full throttle into the playoffs. Go figure. Maybe
that's why he seems especially calm as he prepares to face
Philadelphia's blitz-happy defense.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot at stake," he said. "But at the same time, you've
got to just go out and play football and enjoy yourselves. It's
nothing we haven't done over the last seven months."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the widow and family of Minnesota Viking tackle Korey
Stringer filed a $100-million lawsuit against the franchise Tuesday,
saying coaches made him practice the day after he fell ill at
training camp and didn't attend to him fast enough when heatstroke
set in.</TE>
<TE>   One new tidbit: the suit alleges then-offensive line coach Mike
Tice called Stringer a "big baby" for struggling in the heat on the
first day of camp. Tice, now the head coach, denied saying that and,
in a statement through the club, said he was "disappointed and hurt"
by the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ram guard Adam Timmerman began his NFL career with the Green Bay
Packers, who flew him out before selecting him in the seventh round
of the 1995 draft. First stop: Lambeau Field, a place Timmerman
thought was more odd than awe-inspiring.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the scouts and I were driving over from the hotel, and I
just remember pulling up in the car and saying, 'Holy Smokes!'" said
Timmerman, who will be reunited with his old teammates when the Rams
play host to the Packers. "It's kind of in the middle of nothing
else. There probably is not a three-story building within a mile of
there. The stadium kind of rises up from the houses and Kmart."</TE>
<TE>   Timmerman, you see, was used to a more cosmopolitan setting. He
went to South Dakota State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate how differently coaches and owners view things,
former Cincinnati coach Sam Wyche tells the story of an afternoon
spent with Bengal owner Paul Brown. The two went to watch the
Cincinnati Reds.</TE>
<TE>   Wyche spent nine innings studying then-manager Pete Rose, watching
the way he talked to players, looking for any adjustments he was
making, soaking in the nuances.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul turned to me and said, 'Not a lot of fannies in the seats
today,'" he said. "It struck me that we were watching the same game
but looking at it in two totally different ways."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even when he was coaching at a small-time football school, Steve
Spurrier had big-time swagger. He became coach at Duke in 1987, and
stayed there for three seasons, leading the Blue Devils to a 20-13-1
record and their first bowl appearance (All-American Bowl) since
1960.</TE>
<TE>   Duke beat North Carolina in each of their three meetings during
the Spurrier era; the Tar Heels have not lost to their bitter rival
since.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1989 season finale, after his team put a 41-0 spanking on
the Tar Heels, Spurrier led the Duke players out of the visitors'
locker room and in front of the scoreboard for a team photo.</TE>
<TE>   Word is, Washington Redskin owner Dan Snyder has already cleared a
spot on his wall for the group shot at Texas Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Fox is expected to lose as much as $20 million on its Super Bowl
broadcast because NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics will compete
for advertising dollars, an analyst predicts.</TE>

<LD>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers acknowledged for the first time Tuesday that
they are pursuing Bill Parcells.</LD>
<LD>   The Buccaneers fired Tony Dungy, the only winning coach in their
26-year history, Monday night and are believed to be close to an
agreement with Parcells.</LD>
<LD>   After denying during a news conference that the team had ever had
discussions with Parcells, the sons of owner Malcolm Glazer issued a
statement saying talks began with agent Jimmy Sexton on Tuesday
afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   Dungy, who had a 56-42 record at Tampa Bay, might interview next
week for the Indianapolis Colts' head coaching job, according to his
agent, Ray Anderson.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Braves' acquisition of Sheffield seems to nullify
all of the Mets' off-season moves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Mets shuffled and spent, shuffled some more and spent
some more. They traded for Roberto Alomar. They bought Roger Cedeno.
They traded for Mo Vaughn. They bought David Weathers. They traded
for Shawn Estes. They traded for, then traded away, David Justice.
They tossed $25 million at Juan Gonzalez, who said no.</LD>
<LD>   The Atlanta Braves, another year older, their offense no better,
seemed vulnerable.</LD>
<LD>   Until Tuesday, when the Braves punctured the Mets' balloon.</LD>
<TE>   While Dodger fans debate whether their team is better off without
Gary Sheffield, the trade that sent him to Atlanta tilted the balance
of power in the National League East back to the Braves.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as the Mets have done, I'll take Atlanta," San Diego
Padre General Manager Kevin Towers said.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves, who will be aiming for their 11th consecutive division
title, surrendered outfielder Brian Jordan, pitcher Odalis Perez and
a minor league pitcher to obtain the kind of hitter who makes
pitchers quake.</TE>
<TE>   The soap-opera soundtrack that accompanied Sheffield's tenure with
the Dodgers--from his charging them $2.5 million to buy out his
no-trade clause before he would join the team in 1998 to his
almost-daily bashing of Chairman Bob Daly last spring and his charge
that General Manager Dan Evans lied to him last fall--cannot drown
out the blare of his production.</TE>
<TE>   In each of his three full seasons with the Dodgers, Sheffield
never hit lower than .300, never hit fewer than 34 home runs, never
drove in fewer than 100 runs.</TE>
<TE>   And while the Mets have put together an infield that has plenty of
run-scoring potential with Vaughn, Alomar and Edgardo Alfonzo,
Atlanta's trio of Sheffield, Chipper Jones and Andruw Jones gives the
Braves a big advantage in the outfield.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a pretty good outfield, when you're talking about B.J.
Surhoff as a fourth outfielder," Towers said.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves' projected starting outfield combined to hit 108 home
runs last season; the Mets' outfield of Cedeno, Jay Payton and Benny
Agbayani hit 20.</TE>
<TE>   And the Braves start with Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine and finish
with John Smoltz, Cy Young Award winners all, while the Mets start
with Al Leiter and four question marks and finish with erratic closer
Armando Benitez.</TE>
<TE>   Met General Manager Steve Phillips has been looking to add a
starting pitcher and has been talking to Pedro Astacio's agent. Rick
Helling and James Baldwin, two other starters who remain on the
free-agent market, are other possibilities. None does to a pitching
staff what Sheffield does to a batting order.</TE>
<TE>   Astacio, 32, was 8-14 with a 5.09 ERA in 26 starts last season for
Colorado and Houston, and sat out the final month because of a
partial tear of the labrum in his right (pitching) shoulder. He has
been pitching in the Dominican Republic this winter.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips conceded that the Braves got "a great player." Although,
he added, "I'm not sure he can hurt us as much as Brian Jordan did.
I'm not tempting him to do that. I'm just saying Brian Jordan killed
us. Our preference would have been for them to wind up in the
American League, East or West, considering we play the Central this
year."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan hit .295 with 25 home runs and 97 runs last season. He
probably will replace Sheffield in left field for the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   As for Perez, he joins a suddenly crowded stable of starters. With
the trade for Omar Daal, with the signing of Hideo Nomo and the
anticipated signing of Kazuhisa Ishii, the Dodgers could open
training camp with eight candidates for the starting rotation. And if
Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby can return from surgery as the team
expects, Eric Gagne and Terry Mulholland would offer a nice surplus.</TE>
<TE>   "They could have a heck of a rotation, but that's a lot of ifs,"
Towers said. "And they don't have [Jeff] Shaw. You've got to have a
closer if you want to go deep into the postseason."</TE>
<TE>   To get there, the Dodgers would have to hurdle the San Francisco
Giants and the World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks. The Giants
retained Barry Bonds, signed outfielder Reggie Sanders, who hit 33
home runs for Arizona, and re-signed Jason Schmidt, who went 7-1
after they acquired him from the Pittsburgh Pirates in July. The
Diamondbacks again play trump cards in Randy Johnson and Curt
Schilling.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody in our division will beat up one another,"
Towers said. "But, if Schilling and Johnson each win 20 games again,
it'll be tough to beat the Diamondbacks."</TE>

<DH>Olympics: Romney says Salt Lake City venues will 'be
secured as well as you can secure them.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six years ago, the last time the Olympics were staged in the United
States, a bomb went off at a huge open-air plaza in downtown Atlanta.
One woman was killed, more than 100 hurt. The plaza had been open to
all with easy access--no metal detectors, no fences.</LD>
<LD>   When the Winter Olympics open next month, the open-air plaza in
downtown Salt Lake City will be the place each night to celebrate
that day's medal winners. But the plaza will be fenced off. And to
get in, fans will have to pass through metal detectors. Bags will be
searched.</LD>
<LD>   As the Games near, security issues top the agenda, the president
of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, Mitt Romney, acknowledged
Tuesday. But he said he is confident that a $310-million security
plan means the various venues in and around Salt Lake will "be
secured as well as you can secure them."</LD>
<TE>   For instance, he said, F-16s will patrol the skies. Airspace will
be closed off for a 48-mile radius extending out from downtown Salt
Lake during certain key events--for instance, the opening and closing
ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel confident that every source of risk has been addressed.
That doesn't mean there's a guarantee," he said. "But all the risks
that are known to man have been addressed."</TE>
<TE>   And overall, he said, "We are ready." The Games open Feb. 8.
Organizers have already sold $172 million worth of tickets; in
Nagano, Japan, four years ago, the total was $80 million. If things
go smoothly, Romney said, the Games could be "magical." They will be
the last Olympics in the United States for at least 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Romney said in a meeting with editors of The Times, "There's
nothing that keeps me awake at night." But he quickly added, "There
will be surprises or snafus," and organizers face a key challenge in
transporting athletes, fans and the press to certain sites, in
particular to mountain venues in Park City, about a half-hour east of
downtown Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be judged by not whether or not we have problems but
whether we're able to correct them quickly enough that they don't
interfere with the athletes' experience or the experience of the
world that watches them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,400 athletes from some 80 nations are due at the Games. In
the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the federal government
has added $55 million to security funding--on top of $185 million
committed previously.</TE>
<TE>   In all, after adding another $70 million--$35 million apiece from
the state of Utah and from SLOC itself--security costs for the Games
now total $310 million, the aim being to create what Romney called a
"seamless web" of security.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the federal investment in security costs at the Lake
Placid Olympics in 1980, the prior Winter Games in the United States,
amounted to $23 million. Federal security funding in Salt Lake is 10
times greater.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the direct cost of the Salt Lake Games totals $1.9
billion. Federal, state and local government funding accounts for
about $600 million; SLOC's budget is $1.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for the deployment of about 11,000 security
personnel--5,000 from the military, 6,000 from federal, state and
local law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to surround perimeters," Romney said. "The Winter Games
have some real peculiarities. It's one thing to secure Staples
Center, which has [metal detectors] at the entrances. Now try to
secure the downhill course."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he predicted a less visible military presence at the
Salt Lake Games than in Lillehammer in 1994 or Nagano in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   And, "I don't think it will look to the spectator much different
than prior Games, if different at all." The escalating costs of the
Games have sparked debate about the future direction of the Olympic
enterprise--with Romney recently suggesting consideration of the U.S.
government playing a role, given its investment in security and other
costs, in deciding which U.S. city is chosen to bid internationally
for the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, that decision has been up to the U.S. Olympic
Committee; four cities are vying for the 2012 Summer Games--New York,
San Francisco, Washington and Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Romney said that he still believes the Games are worth staging in
the United States, calling them "a world-stage event" that can "raise
the civility of humanity."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "Does it singly bring peace to the world? No. But I
believe it does pull toward peace."</TE>

<LD>On May 15, 1998, the Dodgers traded Mike Piazza (and Todd Zeile) to
the Florida Marlins for Gary Sheffield, Bobby Bonilla, Charles
Johnson, Jim Eisenreich and Manuel Barrios. None of those players are
with the Dodgers today. A look at what happened to those players and
what the Dodgers have to show for the Piazza trade:</LD>
<LD>   GARY SHEFFIELD</LD>
<LD>   Traded to Atlanta for outfielder Brian Jordan and pitchers Odalis
Perez and Andy Brown.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BOBBY BONILLA</TE>
<TE>   Traded to the New York Mets for pitcher Mel Rojas. Rojas was
traded with pitcher Dave Mlicki to Detroit for pitchers Robinson
Checo, Apostol Garcia and Rick Roberts. Checo and Garcia were
eventually released, Roberts pitched for Class-A Vero Beach last
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHARLES JOHNSON</TE>
<TE>   Traded with outfielder Roger Cedeno to the Mets for catcher Todd
Hundley and pitcher Arnold Gooch. Hundley left as a free agent before
the 2000 season. Gooch was released and pitched last season in the
minors for Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JIM EISENREICH</TE>
<TE>   Retired after the 1998 season.</TE>

<LD>Mira Costa Soccer Player Died of Heart Defect</LD>
<LD>   Ryan King, a 16-year-old junior varsity soccer player at Manhattan
Beach Mira Costa High who died Nov. 16 after collapsing at practice,
died of a congenital heart defect, the Los Angeles County coroner's
office has concluded.</LD>

<LD>For the second game in a row, Alhambra Keppel played without its head
coach and took out a rival, this time defeating Bell Gardens, 84-58,
Tuesday in an Almont League girls' basketball game.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Richard Marquis has been on leave since Friday, "pending an
investigation," said Lois Nash, assistant superintendent of human
resources for the Alhambra School District.</LD>
<LD>   "When we put somebody on leave, it's for a reason," said Nash, who
would not comment on the nature of the investigation. "In the
interest of the coach and the parents, we want to be as thorough as
possible and resolve the matter as soon as we can."</LD>
<TE>   Tan Ha is interim coach.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Toledo scored 18 points, and Krista Arase scored 14 for the
Aztecs (16-2, 3-0), ranked No. 13 in the Southland by The Times.</TE>

<HD>Yagudin Takes Charge With Energy, Precision</HD>
<DH>Figure skating: Russian wins short program and leads men's
competition at European championships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAUSANNE, Switzerland</DL>
<LD>Alexei Yagudin won the short program Tuesday, positioning himself to
recapture the European Figure Skating Championship he lost two years
in a row to teammate Yevgeny Plushchenko.</LD>
<LD>   Although he set a lighthearted tone during his homage to winter,
Yagudin delivered the required elements with practiced seriousness.</LD>
<LD>   The Russian hit a clean quad-triple combination, two more triples
and had a sequence of captivating footwork that sent ice shavings
flying.</LD>
<TE>   Three other skaters also hit quad combinations, but Yagudin's mix
of precision and energy put him firmly in first place, earning mostly
5.9s for both technical merit and presentation.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course the steps, that's what I like," Yagudin said. "The
jumps are the same, the spins are the same. But I had a good time
creating the steps."</TE>
<TE>   Russian teammate Alexander Abt finished second, delivering a clean
quad-triple, ahead of France's Brian Joubert, whose quad combination
contained a double. Ilya Klimkin also hit a quad-triple to finish
fourth, leaving the Russians in strong contention for a sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Plushchenko is sitting out the competition with a reported groin
injury, saving his challenge for the Olympics next month at Salt Lake
City.</TE>
<TE>   The women's competition begins today with qualifying rounds. The
pairs final skate is scheduled for tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France, and defending
champions Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio of Italy, are
tied for first place in ice dancing after splitting the compulsory
dances.</TE>

<LD>Did you see who was handed a flame?</LD>
<LD>   Amid hundreds of heroes, a lousy storyteller.</LD>
<LD>   A guy who sees Olympic rings and thinks, five iced crullers. A guy
who can't ski. A guy afraid to light a match.</LD>
<TE>   Yet Tuesday they gave him an entire flame, in a torch, down on the
corner of 14th and Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Asked him if he could run two blocks with nobody chasing him.
Asked him if he could do it while holding a three-pound weight that
was not imprinted with the words, "Rocky Road." Asked him to please
not burn the city down.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would try. It was an honor for the torch to pass
through his town on the way to Salt Lake City next month for the
Winter Olympics, so he would try.</TE>
<TE>   But sitting on the shuttle bus with other Olympic torchbearers
early Tuesday afternoon, his legs were cement and his will wavered.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't belong. He knew that now. They picked the wrong guy. How
could he do this?</TE>
<TE>   Sitting across from him on the bus was an 80-year-old torchbearer
who teaches inner-city children to ski.</TE>
<TE>   Behind him, a torchbearer who gives life to premature infants.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of the bus, a liver transplant survivor. And in the
back row, a kid who beat Hodgkin's disease.</TE>
<TE>   "So why are you here?" someone finally asked the storyteller.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure," the storyteller said.</TE>
<TE>   As Olympic moments go, the start of this story carried all the
emotion of a slalom preliminary, only without the annoying beeps.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, you wanna carry the Olympic torch?" asked the storyteller's
boss.</TE>
<TE>   "For the United States?" said the storyteller.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, um ... " said the boss.</TE>
<TE>   The torch, as the storyteller was quickly reminded, is not about
countries.</TE>
<TE>   That is its beauty. That is the one thing that separates it from
virtually every other part of the Olympic movement, including those
five rings.</TE>
<TE>   The torch does not recognize differences in continents or
language. It is the same torch whether it is held by the doctor from
West Covina or west Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The flame is one color, and many colors. The hands that hold it
can been old and wrinkled, young and smooth, brown or yellow.</TE>
<TE>   The only requirement, it seems, is that those hands be strong.</TE>
<TE>   The storyteller looked at his hands. They were not particularly
strong.</TE>
<TE>   These hands had never cured a child or rescued an animal or
bettered the world.</TE>
<TE>   These hands, even while wearing gloves, had no right holding the
most endearing symbol of the world's most important sports event.</TE>
<TE>   The storyteller signed up anyway. He thought it would be fun.</TE>
<TE>   He filled out forms and affidavits. He promised he would not use
the torch as a croquet mallet, a birthday candle, or to defend
himself against Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   He promised that, for his entire two-tenths of a mile, he would
keep his head up and his shoes laced.</TE>
<TE>   One day last week, a package carrying his torchbearer's uniform
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   The storyteller's wife unwrapped the box, her eyes darting from
the uniform to the storyteller's belly, uniform to belly, uniform to
belly.</TE>
<TE>   Then she screamed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's torn?" the storyteller asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's white!" she shouted.</TE>
<TE>   One crash diet later, the storyteller was rumbling along the
streets of Los Angeles with a busload of heroes, a piece of flatware
among this city's finest china.</TE>
<TE>   Again, they asked, "So why are you here?"</TE>
<TE>   Again, the storyteller couldn't answer.</TE>
<TE>   So they told him.</TE>
<TE>   Said the doctor: "You're here because everybody touches somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Said the AIDS fighter: "Everything we do affects somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Keller, a torch cheerleader who has accompanied it around
the country, stood in front of the bus and ended the debate.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of you is here because somebody has seen the flame within
you, and your power to spread that flame," she said. "That's what
this day is about."</TE>
<TE>   She gently held up an actual torch.</TE>
<TE>   "Read it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There, in letters that streaked toward the shiny metal base, were
the words, "Light the fire within."</TE>
<TE>   As the shuttle pulled up on the corner of 14th and Stanford, the
heroes sent him off not with stares, but cheers.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, the flame arrived, in the hands of a wide-eye high
school girl running in memory of friends who had been killed in an
auto accident.</TE>
<TE>   The storyteller tipped his torch, and the fire jumped. Now, it was
his.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember," Keller had said earlier. "For those few minutes, you
will be the only person in the world who has that flame."</TE>
<TE>   The storyteller remembered. As the orange and blue heat flapped
wildly in his face, he did the only thing he could think of doing.</TE>
<TE>   On an oily patch in the middle of 14th Street, he dropped to one
knee.</TE>
<TE>   It was only for a second. He figured he had to thank somebody.</TE>
<TE>   And then he was off, jogging between rows of aging warehouses that
suddenly awakened with faces and hands.</TE>
<TE>   Through the flame, he could see the smiles. Even with the whirring
of the security motorcycles, he could hear the cheers.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't feel as though he was carrying the flame. It felt as
though he was the flame.</TE>
<TE>   The more he stretched out the torch in his left hand, the louder
the cheers. He stretched out his right hand, more cheers, as if he
were carrying two torches.</TE>
<TE>   Then the storyteller understood what the heroes have always
seemingly always known, the one thing they were trying to tell him.</TE>
<TE>   Spreading your fire is no more difficult than opening your arms.</TE>
<TE>   Every couple of years, the Olympics embrace the world by simply
opening their arms.</TE>
<TE>   The storyteller thought, this is easy. He then turned and opened
those arms to the guy running behind him.</TE>
<TE>   His name is Ted Hayes. He is the founder of our Dome Village
homeless shelter.</TE>
<TE>   He was not a torchbearer, but a support runner, a person invited
to run along with the flame in case the torchbearer falters.</TE>
<TE>   The storyteller thought, why wait? He asked Hayes to grab a piece
of the torch, and together they carried it.</TE>
<TE>   "Man," said Hayes, shaking his dreadlocks.</TE>
<TE>   "Man," said the storyteller.</TE>
<TE>   They jogged to the end of the two-block stretch, where the
storyteller then tipped the flame and passed it to the AIDS fighter.</TE>
<TE>   An official then drove up and turned off the gas, extinguishing
his flame.</TE>
<TE>   The caravan of cars and trucks moved ahead, the little street
became quiet, then the strangest thing happened.</TE>
<TE>   It was if the torch lit itself again.</TE>
<TE>   A warehouse worker walked up.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I touch it?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another person walked up, and another, each asking only to touch
the used torch.</TE>
<TE>   A vagrant walked up, holding a tiny money clip containing what
looked like one dollar.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's my wallet as collateral," he said. "Can I touch it just
for 10 seconds?"</TE>
<TE>   Sure, said the storyteller, to the warehouse worker and vagrant
and anyone else drawn to the flame that briefly filled a tiny corner
of our great town.</TE>
<TE>   Touch it. Everyone, please, touch it.</TE>

<LD>Rico Hines is still experiencing headaches from a concussion he
suffered early last week and is questionable for Thursday's game at
Arizona State. The Bruins have won 10 of 11 since Hines, a guard,
broke into the starting lineup.</LD>
<LD>   Freshman Cedric Bozeman will start if Hines does not. Bozeman,
back for two weeks from a knee injury, probably will play more
minutes than Hines even if the senior is healthy.</LD>
<LD>   Hines played against USC and Kansas last week, telling trainers he
felt fine. However, he had difficulty concentrating in school and
finally acknowledged the headaches had not gone away.</LD>
<TE>   "I talked to my mom and she reminded me I can't jeopardize life
after basketball," he said. "There was no way I was going to miss
those games last week, but I have to do what is smart."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Steve Lavin said Hines will start if he is cleared by
doctors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Practices the last two days were especially spirited, which Lavin
credits to his 10-man rotation.</TE>
<TE>   "With so many players contributing, they have hope there is a
niche for them to get more minutes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes for an intense practice."</TE>

Trojans, who play  at No. 15 Arizona on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "He's the anchor of our ship," Bibby said of Hutchinson. "He's a
guy that does everything that we ask of him at any time. He's the
only player that I've ever had that's never complained one time.</LD>
<LD>   "We were running [Monday] and he might be the worst runner we have
on the team but he's ... right there at the front, giving his all."</LD>
<TE>   Hutchinson, a junior from Albany, Ga., was honored.</TE>
<TE>   "It caught me off guard," he said. "[Bibby] said I'd been working
pretty hard, he's impressed by the way I handle myself in situations
and stuff like that."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby has been critical of the seniors all season for a perceived
lack of leadership and said he could see how his anointing of
Hutchinson could be perceived as slighting them.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care," Bibby said. "I'm not concerned about a slug to the
seniors. If you step up and you make it happen, you're deserving of
becoming captain. Hutch doesn't miss anything, he's always going to
class, he's always at the extra workout. [He's] not as vocal as I
would like him to be, but I think he does all the things by example."</TE>

<HD>The Spirit Lives On in This Torchbearer</HD>
<DH>Olympics: War hero Zamperini, nearly 85, has beaten the
odds long enough to carry the flame for four different Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He huffed and he puffed as he jogged up Western Avenue, but Lou
Zamperini had a mission and he wasn't about to fail.</LD>
<LD>   The glass-topped Olympic torch had been entrusted to him for
two-tenths of a mile Tuesday afternoon, making him a link in the
human chain that will relay the flame to Salt Lake City for the
Winter Games Feb. 8. For him, it was a sacred trust.</LD>
<LD>   Looking straight ahead as he chugged toward the intersection of
Western and Adams, hoping the pants he had rolled over at the
waistband wouldn't droop, Zamperini lifted the torch skyward, holding
his right arm high for all the world to see.</LD>
<TE>   Zamperini, 85 in 10 days, never won an Olympic gold medal. A
standout miler at Torrance High and USC, he switched to the 5,000 and
was eighth in that event at the 1936 Berlin Games.</TE>
<TE>   His is a triumph of the spirit, of an ordinary guy who endured
unfathomable pain but chooses to see and share the joy of being
alive. A man who still rides a mountain bike, climbs the hills behind
his Hollywood home and runs, a man who jokes that he made a
concession to age by giving up skateboarding on his 81st birthday.</TE>
<TE>   A man who should not have been alive to carry this Olympic torch
or any other.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about him," said his daughter, Cynthia, as his
turn approached. "He's got the Olympic spirit. If he needs to do it,
he'll do it."</TE>
<TE>   Crossing the street and waving to the small crowd that had
gathered along the route, Zamperini handed the torch to speedskater
Maria Garcia, who continued the relay along Adams and past the
Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles. Zamperini's
family--Cynthia, son Luke, daughter-in-law Lisa and grandson
Clay--gathered around him to pose for pictures. His wife of 55 years,
also named Cynthia, died nearly a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt good until I got halfway up the hill," Zamperini said,
chest still heaving. "The hill did it.</TE>
<TE>   "But I made it. I think I'm getting greedy. I've got my fourth
torch."</TE>
<TE>   It will take much more than a measly hill on Western Avenue to
stop Lou Zamperini.</TE>
<TE>   Being the bombardier in a plane that crashed over the Pacific
during World War II couldn't extinguish his spirit. Drifting on a
life raft for 47 days with two crewmates, little water and no food
but the few fish they snared, couldn't snuff out the flame that burns
within him.</TE>
<TE>   Being imprisoned in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp and the daily
beatings couldn't diminish his faith in mankind and God.</TE>
<TE>   Zamperini, who still has the death certificate his parents
received after his plane went down and he was presumed dead, ran
Tuesday as he had practiced in the Hollywood hills, steady and true.
He dedicated his relay leg to an old friend, James Armstrong, a
former mayor of Torrance who died earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   "This is history being made," Justine Agnew, who lives around the
corner from the place Zamperini received the torch at Western and
27th, said as she pointed her new disposable camera at Zamperini.</TE>
<TE>   History is a living thing for Zamperini, for whom Zamperini Air
Field in Torrance is named. He has forgiven his enemies and his
captors and has learned hope is a far more powerful emotion than
hatred or fear.</TE>
<TE>   "I figure the war took 10 years off my life," he said. "I decided
to get those 10 years back. I did it by good attitude and good
diet.... I see people gripe and complain and I say, 'Hey, you're
shortening your life.'"</TE>
<TE>   Zamperini has lived life to the fullest.</TE>
<TE>   He ran to escape the cops as a high-spirited kid in Torrance, but
turned his gift into a hobby. A 4:21 miler as a junior at Torrance
High, he won a scholarship to USC and was invited to join the 1936
U.S. Olympic team. On the ocean voyage to Hamburg, he made an
astounding discovery for a kid raised during the Depression.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea what you did aboard a ship," he said. "They eat."</TE>
<TE>   He gained 10 or 12 pounds, too much to run as fast as he could
have, but his blistering 56-second final lap in his eighth-place
finish won the attention of Adolf Hitler, who demanded to shake the
hand of the spunky American.</TE>
<TE>   He enlisted in the Army in 1941 and was sent to Hawaii in October
1942. During a rescue mission searching for a B-25 that had
reportedly been shot down, Zamperini's plane dived into the sea; he
and two crewmates were the only survivors. One died before they
drifted to the Marshall Islands, southwest of Hawaii. By the time a
Japanese trawler picked them up, Zamperini weighed about 79 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Zamperini and pilot Russell Phillips were moved from prison camp
to prison camp, tortured, beaten, fed vermin-infested rice. He was
forced to speak during a Japanese radio propaganda broadcast. He held
out until Japan surrendered in 1945, when he was promoted to captain
and awarded the Purple Heart, among other medals.</TE>
<TE>   He foundered after the war but later became active in his local
church, particularly with youth groups. His torchbearing career began
in 1984, before the Los Angeles Games, and that, in turn, opened a
new world for him.</TE>
<TE>   He had passed the torch to Olympic swimmer John Naber the morning
of the opening ceremony, and the two chatted at a reception for USC
athletes. They became friends. "I don't know whether I adopted him or
he adopted me," Naber said. They played golf, par-3 pitch-and-putt,
and Naber began introducing him to friends who worked for
corporations that were Olympic sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   Zamperini carried the torch before the 1996 Atlanta Games and was
the subject of a CBS special before the Nagano Games, where he and
his daughter carried the torch near one of the prison camps where he
had been tortured. Nicolas Cage bought the rights to his life story,
although the movie remains in the scriptwriting process.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I understood the depth of his story until I saw the
CBS coverage of him," Naber said. "There is no question in my mind he
understands the ideals of the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   Zamperini wrote an essay about the Olympics. Part of it says, "The
Olympic spirit is like the wind. You don't see it coming or going but
you hear its voice. It then becomes an echo of days of glory."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "Carrying the torch [Tuesday] that's an echo of those
days. Being invited to the Amateur Athletic Foundation [for a
reception], that's an echo. Going to the Olympics, that's an echo."</TE>
<TE>   Echoes that live on.</TE>

<DH>Games: Relay runners along the coast and in Los Angeles qualify as
Olympians in their own right.</DH>

<LD>When 18-year-old Evita LaVoie of Banning was picked to carry the
Olympic flame through the streets of Laguna Beach, she wasn't sure she
was worthy.</LD>
<LD>   "Compared to some of these other runners like the Marines, I thought,
'I didn't do anything to support our country,' " said LaVoie, a
three-sport athlete at Banning High who nearly died in a car crash 10
years ago. After brain surgery, LaVoie had to teach herself to eat and
walk again.</LD>
<LD>   "I figured I was just ordinary," she said.</LD>
<TE>   But LaVoie admitted she didn't feel very ordinary Tuesday morning as
she jogged up Pacific Coast Highway by Aliso Beach Park with dozens of
classmates and hundreds of sleepy-eyed Laguna Beach residents cheering
her every step.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so nervous. I kept thinking I was going to drop [the torch]. It
was so heavy."</TE>
<TE>   LaVoie was one of the runners who helped carry the Olympic flame along
the Orange County coastline Tuesday on its journey to Salt Lake City. By
trip's end, 11,500 people will have passed the torch since it was ignited
Nov. 19 in Olympia, Greece. Torch-carrying runners will cover about 20%
of the 1,167 miles through California. Vehicles will handle the rest of
the journey.</TE>
<TE>   From Orange County, a police-escorted truck convoy transported the
flaming caldron to Olvera Street in Los Angeles, where runner Jason Murry
was waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Murry, 20, of South-Central Los Angeles, paused on the La Placita
bandstand before a crowd of 2,000 as Mayor James Hahn and other city
leaders reflected on the Olympic Games of 1932 and 1984 hosted by Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Take a moment to stop and salute the Olympic flame and say how proud
you are the Olympics are in the United States," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of torchbearers carried the flame through Los Angeles,
igniting the enthusiasm of the thousands who cheered them along city
streets. The runners were a mix of Southern Californians: relatives of
those who died on Sept. 11, movie stars, former Olympians and everyday
people nominated by their friends.</TE>
<TE>   The spectators were a mix of those there both to honor individuals and
to salute the Olympic spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "When are we ever going to see this again!" said set decorator Kristen
Gassner, 32, of Eagle Rock. She and Shannon McGinnis, a 44-year-old movie
prop worker from Echo Park, jumped up and down and shrieked like
teenagers as the torch approached.</TE>
<TE>   They were in downtown Los Angeles, near Broadway and 8th Street,
yelling for runner R. Doyle Campbell--a man they'd never met.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department special-operations
chief, is a cancer survivor who underwent a liver transplant 17 years
ago. Since then, he has worked to bring attention to the need for organ
donors.</TE>
<TE>   In Chinatown, torchbearer Gary Conlin covered his stretch in a
wheelchair as more than 100 of his friends lined Broadway, waving signs
and flags.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to get up out of my chair and really run when I saw them!"
said the 41-year-old Lou Gehrig's disease patient from Fullerton. "It was
really exciting being a part of history."</TE>
<TE>   At the Coliseum, Mayra Torres, who has run two marathons and is
training for her third, didn't even break a sweat while carrying the
torch up to the stadium's rooftop Olympic flame, previously ignited by
storied Olympian Rafer Johnson to start the 1984 games.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt really proud to be doing something that so many athletes had
done," said the 18-year-old senior from San Fernando High School. Mayra
is part of Students Run Los Angeles, a nonprofit group that trains
students for the Los Angeles Marathon to give them a sense of
achievement.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, the first torchbearer Tuesday was 47-year-old Eileen
Delaney of Fallbrook, who took off at 7 a.m. from a car dealership in San
Juan Capistrano, a few miles south of the city's historic mission.
Monday's relay--the first leg of the California journey--had ended at
nightfall in downtown San Diego with Lance Armstrong, three-time Tour de
France champion and cancer survivor, carrying the torch.</TE>
<TE>   Delaney was nominated by her daughter, Heather, for her community
volunteer work and round-the-clock assistance during Heather's difficult
pregnancy. Delaney said she didn't do much to prepare for her big moment.</TE>
<TE>   "My training routine was pushing myself away from the table," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Her running routine was also a little strange.</TE>
<TE>   "We walked, we ran, we skipped. We did a little bit of everything."</TE>
<TE>   On its way through Newport Beach, the torch was carried by former
Olympic gold medal decathlete Bruce Jenner, Lance Bass of N'Sync and Tom
Frost of Rancho Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   Frost's 22-year-old daughter, Lisa, died when her hijacked plane
crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. Melanie Frost has seen
her husband compete in about 30 marathons, but none of those 26.2-mile
runs compared to Tuesday's 0.2-mile jog up Newport Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a different time," his wife said. "Tom ran this for Lisa.
The stress of this is more emotional than physical. He was very
emotional, completely overwhelmed by all of it."</TE>
<TE>   Frost said the most emotional moment was on the bus that torch
carriers rode together to the points where they would pick up the relay.
Each participant took a moment to explain why they had been nominated to
run. Frost said he told his story last.</TE>
<TE>   "I had everyone in tears, including myself. I had to stop myself
several times," he said. "That bus ride took a lot out of me."</TE>

<HD>Lido Man Seeks Separation of Church, Beach Parking</HD>
<DH>Courts: He sues Newport because worshipers don't have to feed
meters on Balboa. He calls it unconstitutional.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Newport Beach resident has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that
the city unconstitutionally violates the separation of church and state
by giving churchgoers special rights to some of the most valued real
estate in town: beach parking.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe that every citizen has a responsibility to be vigilant to
make sure the provisions of the Constitution are not diluted," said John
Nelson, who describes himself as a developer-contractor and agnostic. He
said he's spent $6,000 so far in legal fees. The suit was filed Friday in
U.S. District Court in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is what practically passes for a sacred space in some areas
of Newport Beach: a parking spot on the peninsula. Usually, the metered
spots require 25 cents per quarter-hour.</LD>
<TE>   But in the early 1970s, city officials passed an ordinance that
allowed free Sunday morning parking, 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., at the metered
spots in front of four churches: Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church
and Christ Church by the Sea, St. James Episcopal Church of Newport Beach
and the Christian Science Church and Reading Room, all of them on Balboa
Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson lives on Lido Isle, near two of the churches.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Tod W. Ridgeway said that eliminating the free parking would
create problems for those living near the churches because churchgoers
would take the unmetered spots in front of their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a nightmare," said Ridgeway, who lives near Our Lady of
Mount Carmel. "It would be bedlam on my residential street" if the free
parking was discontinued.</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. Daniel J. Murray of Our Lady of Mount Carmel said the dispute
doesn't involve the church but is between the city and Nelson. He said
Our Lady has been there since 1923, long before parking meters. The
church has 43 parking spaces for services that attract about 300 people.</TE>
<TE>   And he also offered a glimpse at the city's possible reasoning when it
decided to allow free parking nearly three decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is the thinking at the time was, 'Why should we have to pay
to go to church?' " said Murray, who pointed out that the 1st Amendment
also warns against the prohibition of free exercise of religion. "If
people don't have quarters, they can't come to church."</TE>
<TE>   Harry Schwartzbart of the Americans United for Separation of Church
and State said he considers the free Sunday parking to be a trivial
issue, especially when measured against items such as President Bush's
faith-based initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure my organization would not spend one nickel debating this
issue in court," Schwartzbart said. "You're splitting hairs."</TE>
<TE>   But Nelson remains undaunted, vowing to fight as long as he must to
make sure Sunday churchgoers drop their quarters in the meter. It's not
that he's against religion, he says. In fact, it's just the opposite. He
wants to make sure religion is protected from the tyranny of government.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's not a popular cause, but we need to stick to the issues,"
Nelson said. "I'm a lone ranger who believes in the Constitution of the
U.S."</TE>

<HD>Fullerton Council Shoots Down Sports Bar</HD>
<DH>Business: Merchants in downtown district fought proposal, saying it
didn't fit with image.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By a 3-2 vote, Fullerton's City Council on Tuesday voted against
allowing a proposed sports bar downtown on Harbor Boulevard, overturning
the city's Planning Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council considered the project after the Planning
Commission's decision was appealed by 20 downtown merchants, who said the
project wasn't compatible with area businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The $600,000 sports bar, which would have included a dance floor and
sidewalk patio seating, would have taken over a pair of storefronts just
north of Amerige Street. The council's staff determined that the sports
bar would have been compatible, and said that the police did not object
to another downtown bar. However, Police Chief Patrick McKinley did
oppose the bar's proposal to stay open until 4 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   Albert Bushala, who sought approval to open the bar, told the packed
City Council chambers the merchants should give him a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure everybody in here will change their minds about this," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bushala told council members that if they rejected his permit, he
would take his money elsewhere. Opponents erupted in cheers and applause.</TE>
<TE>   Though a few merchants spoke in favor of Bushala, most argued that
another bar didn't fit with the image they wanted to see downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "We want a nice image," said Jan Fontes, a downtown antique-store
owner. "We don't need another bar."</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the First Christian Church, located downtown, also
spoke against the bar, pointing to potential parking problems.
Councilwoman Jan M. Flory, who is a member of the church, was one of two
council members supporting a permit. The other was Councilman Chris
Norby. Flory pointed to a city study from the 1980s that said increased
night life in a downtown area "helps trigger retail" later on.</TE>
<TE>   Flory said she came to the meeting thinking she would vote against the
sports bar, but after hearing the opponents, was reminded of the movie,
"Footloose" in which the townspeople opposed letting the young people
dance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important to me that downtown survive because there are
very few downtowns left in this country," she said. "We are lacking foot
traffic."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Mike Clesceri and Mayor Don Bankhead opposed the bar.</TE>
<TE>   The swing vote came from Councilman F. Richard Jones, who appeared at
first to speak for the bar but changed his mind, saying it was one of the
hardest decisions he's had to make as a councilman.</TE>
<TE>   Later, a disappointed Bushala said he wasn't sure of his next move.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll regroup, think it through again," he said.</TE>

<HD>Church Sues Over Land-Use Dispute</HD>
<DH>Development: Cottonwood Christian Center claims Cypress is stunting
its growth in favor of tax producers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County megachurch filed lawsuits Tuesday claiming Cypress
was trying to halt its building plans in favor of businesses that would
provide the city with tax dollars.</LD>
<LD>   The legal actions, filed in federal and state courts, are the latest
salvo in a 15-month land tussle between Cottonwood Christian Center and
the city over 18 acres of prime real estate in a redevelopment area near
Los Alamitos Race Course.</LD>
<LD>   Cottonwood is one of a growing number of faith-based institutions
nationally that are employing a religious land-use act passed by Congress
in 2000 to fight city impediments to the free exercise of religion.</LD>
<TE>   "The act clearly protects the rights of churches to be able to build
and expand when they feel called to do so, absent any health and safety
concerns," said Brad Dacus, president of the Pacific Justice Institute,
which provides legal assistance to Christian causes. "[The Cottonwood]
case will be an important case."</TE>
<TE>   In the Cottonwood lawsuits, the church seeks unspecified monetary
damages along with the right to develop six adjacent parcels of land it
purchased in 1998 for $13 million.</TE>
<TE>   The nondenominational church wants to build a complex at Katella
Avenue and Walker Street that would include a 4,700-seat sanctuary, a
preschool, a bookstore, a coffee shop, meeting facilities and a youth
center. The church, whose weekend services attract 4,000 and are
broadcast to 50 countries, has outgrown its 2.4-acre facility in
neighboring Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said the church doesn't fit with their redevelopment
plans, and they would prefer to see tax-generating businesses on the
property, such as retail stores and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a year, city and church officials have sought a
compromise, including a move to an adjacent piece of property.</TE>
<TE>   "We've negotiated in good faith for a long time," said the Rev. Mike
Wilson. City officials said they haven't seen the lawsuit but will
continue to work with the church.</TE>
<TE>   "Cottonwood is doing what they need to do, in their opinion, to
protect their legal remedies," said David Belmer, the city's community
development director.</TE>
<TE>   In the lawsuit, Cottonwood accuses the city of a variety of
discriminatory practices that violates state and federal laws by
"treating private religious institutions on less than equal terms with
nonreligious institutions, and by depriving Cottonwood the ability to
fairly and adequately secure a place to assemble for conducting religious
worship."</TE>
<TE>   The church also alleges that city officials, in negotiating a deal
that would place the church on an adjacent piece of property, demanded
"voluntary" payments from Cottonwood in lieu of the property taxes that
churches are exempt from paying.</TE>

<DH>Crime: Lock registration in trunk, shred waste paper to foil
identity thieves, police say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to stem the increase in so-called identity theft,
police in several central Orange County cities are urging drivers to keep
their registration and other personal documents locked in the car trunk.</LD>
<LD>   Police in Anaheim and Garden Grove are also urging residents not to
leave mail in unlocked curbside mail boxes and to shred discarded
paperwork that might contain personal information.</LD>
<LD>   The steps are in response to an increase in auto burglaries and mail
thefts police believe are linked to identity theft.</LD>
<TE>   "What makes this different from other burglaries is that the only loss
is paperwork, and in some cases they don't take anything and just write
down the information," said Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim officials placed fliers at libraries and city facilities, and
distributed stacks to community groups Tuesday, urging residents to lock
important documents--such as registration--in the car trunk or to carry
them in a purse or wallet. Even an old speeding ticket left in an
unlocked glove compartment can provide data to thieves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's got pretty good information on it," said Garden Grove police
Det. Scott Yuen, who specializes in identity theft and major fraud cases.</TE>
<TE>   Police said identity theft is relatively simple: Thieves seek personal
information, such as Social Security numbers, and use it to create fake
IDS that can aid in cashing bogus checks.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent Garden Grove case, a thief broke into a car and took a
check from the back of a checkbook, a credit card and an expired driver's
license. The victim didn't noticed the missing items until the following
month when the bills arrived, Yuen said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big problem," he said.</TE>

<LD>Carl Karcher opened the first Carl's Jr. restaurant in Anaheim in
the 1940s. In the cutthroat fast-food business, the company has faced
various dilemmas over the years. Who could forget the corporate
bloodletting over whether to add burritos several years ago?</LD>
<LD>   But I venture to say it's never been accused of demeaning a chicken.</LD>
<LD>   Until now.</LD>
<TE>   A Virginia-based group says the company's new TV ad does just that.
I'd say Carl's Jr. hotly disputes the charge, except that it basically
laughs it off.</TE>
<TE>   I'm always interested in other people's point of view, so I phoned
Karen Davis to ask why her group thinks the ad "portrays chickens in a
degrading and demeaning manner."</TE>
<TE>   It was either that or dismiss her as a kook.</TE>
<TE>   I start way behind her, in that I didn't know it was possible to
demean a chicken. I condemn cruelty and improper care of them, but I
hadn't considered putting them in show business as part of that.</TE>
<TE>   The ad first aired about 10 days ago. It shows a group of men in suits
standing around as one turns a live chicken every which way in a futile
search for nuggets. They note that the chicken has wings, a breast and
thighs, but no nuggets. The ad is meant to spoof competitors who sell
chicken nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   The ad's punch line shows a man removing a rubber glove and saying,
"It's not there, either."</TE>
<TE>   The question before the house: Did the ad demean the chicken?</TE>
<TE>   Davis heads United Poultry Concerns, a group dedicated to "promoting
the compassionate and respectful treatment of domestic fowl."</TE>
<TE>   Some of you probably consider that a punch line in itself. I made the
mistake once in print of vaguely suggesting that, and it landed me on the
group's mailing list for the last year or so. I've learned the group
takes on matters large and small when it comes to ducks, geese or
chickens.</TE>
<TE>   The TV ad is not a small one, Davis insists. "When someone's poking
around your body and sniffing around, looking under your tail, wing and
treating this bird's body derisively . . . that's our objection. There's
more to abuse and harm than sticking a knife in somebody."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the bird would feel bad being used in such a way?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Davis says. She cites "The Development of Brain and Behaviour in
the Chicken," a book by Dr. Lesley Rogers, whom Davis describes as a
"chicken physiologist and ethologist." In the book, Rogers concludes that
chickens have cognitive capabilities equal to mammals, Davis says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only that they understand pain and suffering, but that they
have the mental capacity to experience what is being done to them," Davis
says.</TE>
<TE>   The bright lights of filming, the numerous takes likely needed to
produce the spot and the absence of a "significant other" to calm the
chicken would combine to make the experience stressful for the chicken,
Davis says.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, Davis says we wouldn't subject a dog or cat to that, so
why do it to a chicken? She wants Carl's Jr. to pull the ad and for
people to protest in writing.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Brayman, a spokesman in St. Louis for CKE Restaurants Inc., the
company still bearing Karcher's initials, says he has a hard time taking
the complaint seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is that this is strictly a humorous commercial spot to
try to resonate with customers that there's no such thing as a chicken
nugget," Brayman says. He faxed me a statement from the American Humane
Assn. in which it concluded that "no animal was harmed in the making of
this commercial."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute, however, lies in Davis' claim that the chickens have
feelings that likely were hurt. "We have no quantifiable information that
proves that chickens do or do not have feelings," Brayman says.</TE>
<TE>   We can't settle that here, but I asked Davis whether she considers her
group way out of the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I feel like miles away from the mainstream? Probably," she says.
"But we're not as far as we were 10 years ago. In the past 12 years,
since I started UPC, and without any illusions or rose-colored glasses
on, I have seen a major change in attitudes of people, certainly the more
educated people who are amenable to ideas and information."</TE>
<TE>   I want to be in that camp, so I'll meekly conclude by stashing a bunch
of jokes I had in mind.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean I think chickens have feelings or that Carl's Jr.
did anything wrong.</TE>
<TE>   I'll merely use as my exit line Davis' response about what her members
say when they ponder whether their view will ever prevail:</TE>
<TE>   "Not in our lifetime, but sometime."</TE>

<HD>Chefs, Scientists Cook Up Future of Food</HD>
<DH>Conference: Experts at CSUN event say professionals need to be
versed in both culinary arts and technology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shop in a store with meatless burgers and milk that stays fresh for
a month, and you may ask yourself: Is it food or is it technology?</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, some research chefs and others in food manufacturing say that
technology and the culinary arts have converged. They even have a word
for this marriage of food, art and science: culinology.</LD>
<LD>   A term trademarked by the Research Chefs Assn., a food industry
organization, culinology was the theme of a daylong conference Tuesday at
Cal State Northridge.</LD>
<TE>   Whatever it's called, culinology is the wave of the future, said Mark
Crowell, director of culinary development for Starbucks Coffee Co., one
of more than 200 food professionals and students at the the 15th annual
Southern California Food Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Though Crowell trained as a chef, he had to learn about the science of
food on the job, while working for the Marriott Corp. and other large
companies.</TE>
<TE>   "I could make great food," Crowell said, "but I had no idea how to get
food manufactured."</TE>
<TE>   More and more, Crowell said, food companies are looking for people who
can do both.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hired a person with a dual food-science and culinary degree,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because she is both chef and scientist, he said, "she is both creative
and disciplined in a scientific sense. She's logical, and she uses the
tools she learned from her scientific background, but she can also make
that leap to the creative side."</TE>
<TE>   The Research Chefs Assn., which has about 1,100 members, has helped
develop a culinology curriculum. A bachelor of science degree in the new
field will be offered starting this fall at the University of Nebraska,
said past president Jeffrey Cousminer, who heads a flavor laboratory for
Firmatech, an international flavor and fragrance company.</TE>
<TE>   Conference organizer Deirdre Larkin, who teaches food science and
nutrition at Cal State Northridge, said she thinks it will be helpful to
students preparing for food-related careers.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of our students are trained in the cooking aspect and need to
be trained in the scientific aspect, as well," Larkin said. "They need to
know the technology of food, as well as the art associated with it."</TE>
<TE>Many Languages in Food World</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, a team of food-science students from CSUN squared
off against a team from Cal Poly Pomona to see who could make a better
Santa Fe-style meal. During breaks in the program, participants nibbled
on student-made doughnuts.</TE>
<TE>   Speaker Thomas Sadler, vice president for research and development at
Cargill Custom Dressings, said that culinologists differ from other food
professionals in being able to speak more than one of the many languages
of the food world.</TE>
<TE>   He gave as an example the term "ticket time." Those in the audience
who had worked in restaurants knew that it means the time between an
order's entering the kitchen and the finished dish's being handed to the
server for delivery to the customer.</TE>
<TE>   People working in the highly collaborative food industry have to be
"multilingual," Sadler said, conversant with the specialized languages of
chefs, food manufacturing, food technology and even sales.</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate his straddling of the culinary and technology worlds,
Sadler wore his "culinology jacket," which was half short white chef's
jacket and half long white lab coat.</TE>
<TE>   Not everybody at the conference saw the need for a new kind of
professional. Kurt Schneider, a chemical engineer in the food industry,
argued for teams of specialists.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had once helped create a new citrus-flavored
meal-replacement beverage for the Japanese market. The project was highly
successful, said Schneider, who worked as part of a team that included a
professional chef and a food chemist.</TE>
<TE>'It's a Whole New World'</TE>
<TE>   "I think the answer is not to have one person who can do everything,
but having three professionals who can interact," Schneider said. "The
key is to know what you don't know and farm it out to the right people."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Cuzens, a recent UC Santa Cruz graduate with a degree in
biochemistry and molecular biology, never expected to end up working in
the food industry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole new world," said Cuzens, who works for the flavorings
giant T. Hasegawa U.S.A.</TE>
<TE>   Cuzens said she never thought much about flavorings as a science
student, but is now fascinated by such edible wonders as pina
colada-flavored jelly beans.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mixture between science and creative art, really," she said.
Whatever you call it, she added, "it's intriguing."</TE>

<LD>Hundreds of torchbearers carried the Olympic flame through Los
Angeles on Tuesday, igniting the enthusiasm of the thousands who cheered
them along city streets.</LD>
<LD>   The runners were a mix of Southern Californians: relatives of those
who died on Sept. 11, movie stars, former Olympians and everyday people
nominated by their friends.</LD>
<LD>   The Olympic torch relay will cross the Ventura County border shortly
before 9 a.m. as a pickup truck carrying the official caldron with the
flame makes its way north on the Ventura Freeway. Oxnard boxer David
Rodela will be the first torchbearer to carry the flame after it reaches
Oxnard, and over the next two hours and 15 minutes it will work its way
through parts of Oxnard and midtown and downtown Ventura. There will be
public ceremonies at Oxnard's Plaza Park at 9:47 a.m. and at Ventura City
Hall at 11:24 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   The spectators were a mix of those there to honor individuals and to
salute the Olympic spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "When are we ever going to see this again?" asked set decorator
Kristen Gassner, 32, of Eagle Rock. She and Shannon McGinnis, a
44-year-old movie prop worker from Echo Park, jumped up and down and
shrieked like teenagers as the torch approached.</TE>
<TE>   They were in downtown Los Angeles, near Broadway and 8th Street,
yelling for runner R. Doyle Campbell, a man they had never met.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department special operations
chief, is a cancer survivor who underwent a liver transplant 17 years
ago. Since then, he has worked to bring attention to the need for organ
donors.</TE>
<TE>   In East Los Angeles, 15-year-old torchbearer Dean Green had a built-in
cheering section as he ran near the intersection of Breed and Cesar E.
Chavez streets. The La Puente teenager is scheduled to earn an Eagle
Scout award for community service.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a good reason to ask for the day off from work," said his
aunt, Lupe Dillon, 48, of Whittier, as family members and friends cheered
Dean and took pictures.</TE>
<TE>   In Chinatown, torchbearer Gary Conlin covered his stretch in a
wheelchair as more than 100 of his friends lined Broadway, waving signs
and flags.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to get up out of my chair and really run when I saw them,"
said the 41-year-old from Fullerton, who has Lou Gehrig's disease. "It
was really exciting being a part of history."</TE>
<TE>   Conlin got an ovation from the lunch crowd when he wheeled himself
into Philippe's restaurant after his relay stint.</TE>
<TE>   Applause followed torchbearers every step of a route that took them
through downtown and Koreatown, along Wilshire Boulevard's Miracle Mile,
through West Hollywood, along Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard and out to
Universal City in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The flame's Los Angeles visit started at Olvera Street, where runner
Jason Murry, 20, of South-Central Los Angeles lit his torch from a
flaming caldron carried by a truck.</TE>
<TE>   From the bandstand, Mayor James K. Hahn told a crowd of about 2,000 to
"take a moment to stop and salute the Olympic flame and say how proud you
are the Olympics are in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Ray Erwin, 49, of Downey stood on a brick wall as he filmed the scene
with his video camera. He wore a vest with 75 Olympic pins, souvenirs of
the six past Olympics he has attended.</TE>
<TE>   Murry waved as he hoisted his torch and jogged down Los Angeles
Street, beneath an arch formed by firetruck aerial ladders.</TE>
<TE>   At the Coliseum, Mayra Torres, who has run two marathons and is
training for her third, didn't even break a sweat while carrying the
torch up to the stadium's rooftop Olympic flame, previously ignited by
storied Olympian Rafer Johnson to start the 1984 Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt really proud to be doing something that so many athletes had
done," said the 18-year-old senior from San Fernando High School. She is
part of Students Run Los Angeles, a nonprofit group that trains students
for the Los Angeles Marathon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like history," said David Howard, 14, of West Angeles Christian
Academy, who joined nine other student council members at the Coliseum
ceremony. "For me to see it in person, it's really special," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At Universal City, a group of about 50 gathered to watch the final
runners of the day, including the former Olympian, Johnson, and movie
star Arnold Schwarzenegger.</TE>
<TE>   "In light of everything that's going on, we wanted to be part of
something positive," said spectator Emma Lawson, 48, of Moreno Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Escort runner Karam Sethi, 13, said he and his mother had been running
around their house in Riverside for a month to make sure he was ready for
the event.</TE>
<TE>   "All that practice made me get over the nervousness and appreciate the
honor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's torch run had started south of the historic Mission San Juan
Capistrano, with 47-year-old Eileen Delaney of Fallbrook jogging the
first leg. She joked about preparing for the day: "My training routine
was pushing myself away from the table."</TE>
<TE>   Delaney handed off to Galdino Don Juan, a 61-year-old pastor from
Solana Beach who works with underprivileged children and the homeless. He
carried the flame into the crowded streets of Dana Point, where 11 more
runners took it in turn north to Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   There, 18-year-old Evita LaVoie of Banning carried it through the
streets as schoolmates and hundreds of residents urged her on.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared to some of these other runners like the Marines, I thought,
'I didn't do anything to support our country,' " said LaVoie, who
recovered from a devastating auto accident 10 years ago to become a
three-sport athlete at Banning High School.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just so high on adrenaline, I felt like running with the torch
forever."</TE>
<TE>   On its way through Newport Beach, the torch was carried by former
Olympic gold medal decathlete Bruce Jenner and Tom Frost of Rancho Santa
Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   Frost's 22-year-old daughter, Lisa, died when her hijacked plane
crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very emotional, completely overwhelmed by all of it," his wife
Melanie Frost said of Tuesday's events. "Tom ran this for Lisa."</TE>

<HD>Davis' Budget Too Optimistic, Analyst Warns</HD>
<DH>Deficit: Independent study finds plan to close $12.5-billion gap
assumes questionable solutions and could leave the state $4 billion
short.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>The budget proposed by Gov. Gray Davis contains assumptions that
could leave the state $4 billion in the red, according to the state's
independent legislative analyst.</LD>
<LD>   Elizabeth Hill warned lawmakers Tuesday that the $100-billion budget
that Davis proposed last week to close a $12.5-billion shortfall is
overly optimistic, relies heavily on one-time solutions and pushes a
variety of expenses into the future. As a result, Hill predicted,
California will end up with a $4-billion operating deficit in the 2003-04
fiscal year.</LD>
<LD>   "We have an ongoing imbalance that needs to be addressed this year in
order to put the state budget on better fiscal footing," Hill said.</LD>
<TE>   Davis' budget, according to Hill's analysis, not only fails to
eliminate the threat of future deficits, it could also make them worse.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has made a series of proposals that would allow California to
borrow money and defer payments that would require the state to pay
interest and other costs for years to come. The proposals include
borrowing against the state's tobacco settlement money, delaying
contributions to state retirement funds and borrowing from a series of
special funds.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Hill predicted, expected revenue will be $3 billion or
more below assumptions used to fashion the state's 2001-02 spending plan.</TE>
<TE>   State Finance Director Timothy Gage said the $3-billion figure sounds
too high.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "If revenues are such that they won't bridge the gap in
[2003-04], obviously we'll look at additional solutions. It's a balancing
act. Do you go in and devastate programs based on a forecast on revenues
two years out?"</TE>
<TE>   The $3.3-billion difference between Hill's revenue assumptions and the
governor's largely reflects Davis' expectations for revenues from stock
options and capital gains this budget year and next.</TE>
<TE>   The state's projected shortfall over the next 18 months grows to at
least $14.5 billion, according to Hill's office, if Davis' cost estimates
for carrying out current policies are coupled with Hill's lower revenue
projections.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is counting on the Bush administration to give the state about
$1 billion in federal money to help cover medical and terrorism-related
expenses. Hill said lawmakers should expect perhaps half that amount.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' proposed budget also assumes education expenses to be nearly $1
billion less than Hill's projections.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Hill added, the state faces repayment of $6 billion or more
for past electricity purchases. California is seeking to sell bonds to
repay the state's general fund.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace, an El Cajon Democrat,
defended the administration's proposal to borrow as a means of closing
the shortfall. He said that the alternative, raising taxes, would delay
the state's economic recovery, adding that deeper budget cuts would wind
up costing the state more money down the line.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe borrowing is the smart thing to do," Peace said.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said Hill's
review of Davis' spending plan reflects contentions made by his party.</TE>
<TE>   "We said we thought he was overestimating revenues and the analyst
clearly agrees with us," Brulte said.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt it confirmed what we've been saying, which is that the
governor didn't submit a real budget," added Assemblyman John Campbell,
an Irvine Republican who is vice chairman of the Assembly Budget
Committee.</TE>

here. I just know that after reading Lisa Kerkorian's child support
petition, I'm never popping one of those pills. I can't afford to.</TE>
<TE>   Kerkorian was a randy 48 years older than Lisa--old enough to be her
grandfather--and yet she claims he was running around town like he was a
one-man Rat Pack.</TE>
<TE>   "I confronted him about a rumor I had heard that he had been seeing
other women," Lisa says in her court declaration. And then, she claims,
"I ran into Kirk, who was on a date with another woman, at a restaurant
he and I frequented."</TE>
<TE>   In his defense, Kerkorian warned her that marriage wasn't for a young
buck like him. But as Lisa admits, she begged and pleaded after little
Kira was born in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very important to me that Kirk and I marry, so as to
legitimize Kira, and provide some dignity and respect to our
relationship," Lisa says.</TE>
<TE>   Here's where the old man, who might not be the sharpest billionaire
around, came up with a plan. He agreed to marry her if she promised to
file for divorce after just one month.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know if the bride wore white, but I think it's fair to say
dignity and respect mean different things to different people.</TE>
<TE>   Anyhow, this brings us to the tragic crisis at hand. Kerkorian, who
put Lisa up in a $10-million Beverly Hills mansion--with three nannies
hovering about in the event little Kira might need her nose wiped--agreed
to pay $50,000 a month in support.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   So he began paying $75,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   Now destitute despite her "several million dollars in assets," lovely
Lisa finds herself "house rich and cash poor" while Kirk does the town
with "between $5,000 and $10,000 in his pocket at any given moment."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa says he told her cash was the way to do business, because "it
didn't leave a paper trail." I can think of several government agencies
that might find these words to be of interest.</TE>
<TE>   In Lisa's claim for a bigger chunk of gold, she says Kerkorian's
income is a cool $25 million a month. Kerkorian's attorney, Dennis
Wasser, told me Lisa's claims "are largely inaccurate," and he'll answer
them in court.</TE>
<TE>   "I should not have to be a slave to Kirk's personal manipulation,
abusive personality, economic coercion and financial control in order to
provide Kira with that to which she is entitled," Lisa says in her
petition.</TE>
<TE>   She certainly has a point, even if she is the first slave I know of
with millions in assets and a monthly payout of $75,000 from her ex.</TE>
<TE>   If I were the 84-year-old Kerkorian, whose wealth Lisa puts at $6.4
billion, I'd give $1 billion to the ex and set up a $1-billion trust fund
for the little girl, just to be done with it. He'd still have $4.4
billion lying around, which should keep a girl on his arm until every
tooth falls out of his head.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa says she'd be happy with $320,000 a month, but she's not going to
be a shrew about it. She'd settle for a mere $220,000 if Kirk makes "his
private jet or a comparable private jet available for Kira's travel for
up to five round trips per year."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure where this kid plans to go at the tender age of 3. But I
guess if your first birthday party is held at the Hotel Bel-Air and costs
$70,000, as Kira's did, you're sure as heck not going to settle for
vacations at Danish Days in Solvang, no matter how good Andersen's pea
soup is.</TE>
<TE>   You know, I was going to say the only sympathetic character in this
story is poor little Kira. But then I took a look at how much cabbage
she's burning, and I'm not so sure.</TE>
<TE>   Her pets alone are going through $436 a month, and according to Lisa,
Kira's quite the good-times girl, running up a $14,000-a-month tab for
parties and play dates. Provided, of course, that you can believe any of
these numbers.</TE>
<TE>   She's also got a healthy appetite for such a young tyke, with a
monthly food tab of $4,300 for eating in and another $5,900 eating out.
Something tells me Kira won't be celebrating her fourth birthday at Los
Tacos.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the monthly travel tab of $144,000.</TE>
<TE>   Look, I've raised a couple of kids. If one of the three nannies can't
make a trip to Paris or Rome, I'd juggle a few things to fill in.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if Lisa gets the $320,000 a month, I'd happily escort her and
Kira around town. That way, instead of looking like a single parent, Lisa
could have some dignity and respect, not to mention the help of an
experienced parent.</TE>
<TE>   I can tell you it only gets harder from here on out, Lisa. By 10, this
kid's going to have her own attorney. Can you imagine the allowance
she'll go after?</TE>

<HD>California to Number Exits on Freeways</HD>
<DH>Traffic: The system, already in use in almost every other state, is
aimed at reducing motorists' confusion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For everyone who has been confused by the two Chapman Avenue exits
on the Orange Freeway in Anaheim or thrown off course by the four Sierra
Highway exits on the Antelope Valley Freeway: Change is on the way.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning this month, California plans to start numbering the exits on
its state and interstate freeways, like just about every other state in
the union has for years.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, which will cost up to $30 million, the exit numbers
will ascend from zero starting at the Mexican border on all north-south
freeways. Freeways that run east-west will start at zero at the Pacific
Ocean.</LD>
<TE>   The exit numbers will be added alongside street names on a total of
5,800 exit signs. The change will occur over three years as crews
complete their routine replacement of freeway signs around the state.</TE>
<TE>   The numbering system is expected to reduce confusion, particularly for
out-of-towners and motorists who haven't memorized freeway exits, many of
which have similar names.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the numbers would help distinguish the El Camino Real
exit on the Golden State Freeway in San Clemente from the nearby Camino
de Estrella and Camino Capistrano exits.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials also hope the numbers will reduce accidents
caused by motorists who veer across traffic because they suddenly realize
they are about to miss their exit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's simple," said California Highway Patrol Commissioner D.O.
"Spike" Helmick, a supporter of the numbering system. "Someone tells you
to take the I-5 to Exit 17. As you get closer . . . 14, 15 and 16 . . .
you know your exit is coming up."</TE>
<TE>   The exit numbers also will help travelers place themselves in the
California cosmos. On north-south routes, the exit number will correspond
to the number of miles from the Mexican border, while on east-west routes
the number will designate the approximate distance to the Pacific Ocean.
(Thus, Exit 150 on the Golden State Freeway would be roughly 150 miles
from the Mexican border.)</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Highway Administration has required such a numbering
system for all states since the late 1950s. But at that time, California
had already built an extensive freeway system and thus was exempt from
the federal guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the federal government, local law enforcement and
traffic-safety advocates have touted the benefits of numbered exits for
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been a real advocate for this for the five years I've been on
the job," said Matthew Schmitz, safety engineer for the Federal Highway
Administration in California.</TE>
<TE>   But some state officials have resisted the change, saying it would be
costly and unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   When asked in 1991 by a Times reporter about adopting the federal
system, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation said:
"If it isn't broke, why tinker with it?"</TE>
<TE>   Chuck O'Connell, who was Caltrans' deputy district manager in Los
Angeles from 1960 to 1995, said no one ever pushed that hard for numbers
on exits. "It didn't really come up on the radar screen as a high
priority," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans spokesman Dennis Trujillo attributed the change to a
directive from Gov. Gray Davis to Caltrans chief Jeff Morales to make the
state's highway system more efficient. "It is because the time has come
and it makes sense to make the changes," Trujillo said.</TE>
<TE>   The nearly 6,000 new signs will be made of a new, highly reflective
material that will be easier for drivers to see at night.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans in the past experimented with the exit numbering system in
Southern California, but never extended it to all 4,138 miles of the
state's freeways.</TE>
<TE>   In at least one case, the numbering system helped fuel the lore of one
small liberal arts college.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, Caltrans added numbers to the exits on the San Bernardino
Freeway around Claremont, including a No. 47 for an exit that leads to
Pomona College. The number has since been adopted as the school's lucky
number because, by coincidence, 47 is also the number of students who
graduated in the school's first class and the school's motto has 47
characters.</TE>
<TE>   California already has a system that marks specific freeway segments
based on a "post mile" maker. The small white signs resembling rowboat
paddles designate the distance from each county line. Thus, the first
sign on the northbound Santa Ana Freeway at the San Diego County line
reads 0.0, while the last one before the freeway crosses into Los Angeles
County reads 44.38.</TE>
<TE>   When it converts to the numbered exit system, Caltrans will also have
to make the switch on all state records.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Mellen, a spokesman for the Auto Club of Southern California, said
many of its members have asked why the Golden State has refused to accept
the numbering system that has worked well in other states.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the exit-numbering system benefits those who have never
been in the area," he said. "It gives them an easier way in which to
maneuver the freeway system."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Gage, a Buena Park businessman who has lived in Georgia, North
Carolina and New Jersey, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Here in Southern California," Gage said, "the names on the exits only
mean something to motorists with experience or familiarity."</TE>

<CX>   Numbering freeway exits--A story in the Jan. 16 California section
about a plan to number state freeway exits included two errors: One of
the two Chapman Avenue exits on the Orange Freeway is in the city of
Orange, not Anaheim, as the story stated. The El Camino Real, Camino de
Estrella and Camino Capistrano exits are all on the San Diego Freeway
(I-5), not the Golden State Freeway, as the route is known in Los Angeles
County.</CX>

<HD>Supervisors Opt to Keep Retirement Benefit</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: Board rejects motion to drop lucrative perk that
allows six elected managers to inflate pension by adding vacation bonus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A divided Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday rejected a
push to eliminate a lucrative retirement perk for the county's six
elected managers after the majority said the officials deserved the extra
pay.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors John Flynn, Judy Mikels and Frank Schillo blocked
Supervisor Steve Bennett's push to end the county's practice of allowing
the officials to inflate their pension earnings just before retirement by
adding on a vacation bonus.</LD>
<LD>   The benefit has been condemned by taxpayer advocates and two citizens
committees appointed by the Board of Supervisors to review salary and
benefit packages.</LD>
<TE>   But the majority argued that because appointed managers receive the
benefit, elected department heads should get it too. As they explained
their vote, the three supervisors took turns praising the work of the
county's elected managers.</TE>
<TE>   "They are loyal to the taxpayer--I think that is worth money," Flynn
said. "We denigrate elected officials too much. . . . These people work
hard and I don't see them taking long vacations."</TE>
<TE>   Under a policy approved by supervisors in 1999, Auditor Christine
Cohen, Assessor Dan Goodwin, Clerk-Recorder Richard Dean, Dist. Atty.
Michael D. Bradbury, Sheriff Bob Brooks and Treasurer-Tax Collector
Harold S. Pittman are allowed to inflate retirement pay by tacking on the
equivalent of seven weeks' vacation time to their final-year salary.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett questioned the perk last year when supervisors were asked to
approve it for former Auditor Tom Mahon. It works like a cash bonus
instead of compensation for vacation, Bennett argued, because the elected
officials have no restrictions on how much time they take off.</TE>
<TE>   A Times analysis last year found that the practice boosted retirement
pay an average of $6,000 a year. Mahon received an extra $13,400 a year
in retirement pay when he stepped down in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   County officials calculate the perk will cost nearly $1 million during
the next 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett last week proposed stripping the benefit for future elected
managers. Three department officials--Bradbury, Dean and Pittman--have
announced they are retiring this year. On Tuesday, Bennett stressed that
his proposal was not intended to punish people but to end an excessive
perk.</TE>
<TE>   "Elected department heads have far more independence than the
appointed department heads," Bennett said. "I'm not saying the current
elected department heads have not been working very hard."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Kathy Long agreed with Bennett, saying the perk is viewed
suspiciously by the public.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd much rather talk about raising their salaries than approving
something the public considers a hidden benefit."</TE>
<TE>   But the other supervisors were equally adamant that eliminating the
benefit would reduce elected managers to "second-class department heads."</TE>
<TE>   "This sends a message that maybe they are elected--but they aren't
worth as much as the one appointed by the CEO," Mikels said.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett was recently successful in eliminating some of the extra pay
that county supervisors receive for sitting on various civic boards and
commissions. Tuesday's vote was a disappointment, he said after the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you have to just gracefully lose," he said.</TE>

<HD>Santa Paula Posts Nearly 13% Crime Jump in 2001</HD>
<DH>Police: Sharp rises in robbery and theft end a 10-year decline in
reported offenses. City's rate is still half its peak of a decade ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Paula's decade-long decline in crime ended abruptly in 2001
as reported offenses jumped nearly 13% because of sharp rises in robbery
and theft.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had an increase in crime that's nothing to brag about," Police
Chief Robert Gonzales said. "But we've had a big decrease in the last few
years."</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Paula Police Department, the first local police agency to
release a crime report for 2001, said crime increased from 757 reported
offenses in 2000 to 853 last year, with robberies soaring 51%, from 37 to
56.</LD>
<TE>   However, the crime rate for Santa Paula--a farming community of about
29,000 residents--is half its peak of a decade ago. And last year's surge
follows a large decline from 1999 to 2000, making the crime rate last
year about the same as in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula's crime total reflects offenses in eight categories
reported annually to the FBI--murder, rape, robbery, felony assault,
burglary, theft, auto theft and arson.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said crimes such as theft and robbery are closely tied to the
number of drug addicts and career criminals on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "It all depends on who's out and who's in [prison]," he said. "We hit
some of the criminals we know in 1999, so things were down in 2000. Now
some of those guys have gotten out, and we think they're doing burglaries
and robberies."</TE>
<TE>   Officers recently arrested two people, ages 21 and 22, on suspicion of
burglary. Authorities said both are repeat criminals who face a possible
conviction on a third felony--a third strike that would put them behind
bars for 25 years to life.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe they have also been involved with robberies," Gonzales
said.</TE>
<TE>   As is often the case in a small town such as Santa Paula, Gonzales
said he has known one of the suspects all his life. "I knew him growing
up here," the chief said, "but now he's going to be away for a long, long
time."</TE>
<TE>   Crime increased in six of the eight categories, though it dropped in
murder and rape.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not encouraging," Gonzales said. "I'm in the process right now
of analyzing the data month to month so we can see what things we've done
that worked, and what things we can do."</TE>
<TE>   An encouraging sign, he said, is reflected in the drop in
robberies--to only three in December, well below the monthly rate for the
rest of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Another promising development, officials said, is the addition of two
officers to the 32-officer force. One is being trained specifically to
track the activities of street gang members and drug abusers, Gonzales
said.</TE>
<TE>   A new program to begin this month teams a police officer with a county
probation officer to work with youths considered at high risk of becoming
criminals. The departments will receive $80,000 annually for two years

<HD>Oxnard Board to Consider Upgrade Work at 4 Schools</HD>
<DH>Education: The plan calls for renovations at the district's four
oldest senior highs. Most of the $16.5 million would go toward Camarillo
High.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard Union High School District leaders tonight will consider
approving $16.5 million in much-needed renovations at the district's four
oldest high schools.</LD>
<LD>   The out-of-date facilities--particularly at Adolfo Camarillo High
School--have long been a source of contention between parents and
district officials. The dissension at Camarillo was aggravated last year
by the opening of the sprawling, $55-million Pacifica High School in
Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm happy the board has chosen to finally pay attention to the
students in Camarillo and the needs of our kids," said Debra Creadick, a
parent who has pushed hard for the upgrades. "They have deserved an
up-to-date facility. It's long overdue."</LD>
<TE>   Modernization projects at Camarillo, Hueneme, Channel Islands and Rio
Mesa high schools--totaling about $36 million--were approved in 1999, but
delayed when the state ran out of school bond money that was to be used
as matching funds. The district still has about $7.2 million remaining
for those projects from a $57-million bond passed by Oxnard and Camarillo
voters in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the money would come from various district funds and
future revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Problems at the four schools, which are from 36 to 46 years old, range
from outdated electrical systems to bad plumbing to crumbling restrooms,
said Lou Cunningham, the district's facilities director.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan before the board tonight, student and faculty restrooms
at all four campuses would be gutted and rebuilt beginning this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Also, at Camarillo High--the district's oldest campus--a $12.3-million
repair plan would begin immediately if approved.</TE>
<TE>   That plan includes new electrical, plumbing, heating and
air-conditioning systems, replacement of floors, doors and windows and
upgrading science labs, Cunningham said.</TE>
<TE>   Most upgrades at the other three schools would be put off for at least
two years. Officials are counting on state school bonds being passed in
November and in 2004 and 2006 to fund those improvements, Supt. Gary
Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Hueneme and Channel Islands high schools would get about
$210,000 each for new white boards and bulletin boards in all classrooms.
At Rio Mesa, about $150,000 would fund a project to move the teachers'
lounge.</TE>
<TE>   "The facility environment sets the climate, and this indicates to
these students we care about these schools and are trying our best to
bring them up to a modern style," Davis said. But Creadick and other
parents say even if the upgrades are approved, officials have a long way
to go to make things equal.</TE>
<TE>   The district's two newest high schools--Pacifica and $33-million
Oxnard High, which opened in 1995--also have the only two performing arts
centers and are "within jogging distance of each other," Creadick said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every child in this district deserves to have like facilities,"
Creadick said. "The board needs to put together a plan so that kids at
Camarillo High School and kids at Pacifica High School are getting the
same thing."</TE>
<TE>FYI</TE>
<TE>   Trustees for the Oxnard Union High School District meet at 5:30 p.m.
today in the district office board room, 220 South K St.</TE>

<HD>Rape Testimony Called Prejudicial</HD>
<DH>Courts: Lawyers defending Vincent Sanchez in his murder trial ask a
judge to bar mention of the serial sexual assaults he reportedly
confessed to.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying the evidence is so prejudicial it will bias a jury in the
upcoming murder trial, defense lawyers are asking a judge to bar
testimony about a dozen rapes and sexual assaults allegedly committed by
Vincent Sanchez.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, 31, an unemployed handyman, is facing multiple life prison
sentences after admitting he sexually assaulted several women in Simi
Valley and the western San Fernando Valley between September 1996 and
July 2001.</LD>
<LD>   He is also accused of fatally shooting Moorpark College student Megan
Barroso, 20, last year during an attempted rape and
kidnapping--allegations that make him eligible for the death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors want evidence of the earlier sexual assaults included
during Sanchez's murder trial. But defense lawyers contend evidence of
those crimes would stir the emotions of jurors and prevent a fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy Public Defender Neil Quinn raised the issue Tuesday
during a hearing in Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn contends evidence of the sexual assaults should not have been
presented to the grand jury that indicted his client Sept. 4 because it
is inconsistent with evidence from Barroso's killing.</TE>
<TE>   Barroso was shot with an assault rifle while driving home from a party
in the early hours of July 5. Quinn suggested that if his client intended
to rape Barroso, he would not have fired six shots from an AK-47 into her
rental car.</TE>
<TE>   "It has all the earmarks of some kind of explosion of rage," Quinn
argued. "It doesn't look like a rape."</TE>
<TE>   One of the bullets struck Barroso in her abdomen. County Medical
Examiner Ronald O'Halloran told the grand jury that Barroso probably did
not die immediately, instead bleeding internally for minutes or even
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Her body was found Aug. 4 at the bottom of a steep ravine in Black
Canyon, just outside Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Barroso was clad only in a T-shirt and panties, but the medical
examiner could not determine whether she had been sexually assaulted.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County prosecutors contend there are striking similarities
between the killing and the prior attacks on women.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona argued that Sanchez kept clothing
and other trophies from his rape victims.</TE>
<TE>   Barroso's jacket was found during a search of Sanchez's home. Corona
also noted that one of the prior assaults occurred near the location
where Barroso was shot.</TE>
<TE>   "His plan is to rape people," Corona said. "It's all the same."</TE>
<TE>   Corona said it was proper that evidence of those crimes was given to
the grand jury and should be allowed at Sanchez's murder trial.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing is scheduled to resume today, and Judge Ken Riley is
expected to rule in about a week.</TE>

<HD>2 Campaigns Bid to Ease 3 Strikes</HD>
<DH>Corrections: A bill and a voter initiative would exempt petty
thieves from the law's longest prison terms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>A pair of campaigns was launched Tuesday to overhaul California's
popular three-strikes law so that its 25-year-to-life sentences would
bypass petty thieves and apply only to serious and violent felons.</LD>
<LD>   Advocates said the two plans would bring the 1994 law closer into line
with voters' intentions when they enacted Proposition 184, which created
the pioneering "three strikes and you are out" statute.</LD>
<LD>   Under the law, the third-strike sentence of 25 years to life behind
bars without parole is imposed when a felon is convicted of a third
felony on top of two previous serious or violent felonies. The third
felony need not be serious or violent.</LD>
<TE>   The law gives judges and prosecutors the discretion to disregard
certain previous convictions so they cannot be counted toward a third
strike.</TE>
<TE>   However, supporters of the law, including Secretary of State Bill
Jones and victims' rights advocates, said they would fight efforts to
change the law, insisting that it has worked successfully to reduce crime
in California and that changing it would give criminals a card to "get
out of jail free."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference, Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles)
countered that argument and announced the introduction of a bill, AB
1790, to restrict the heaviest penalties of the three-strikes statute to
criminals convicted of serious or violent felonies.</TE>
<TE>   She noted that in November, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that the law's 50-year-long jailing of shoplifter Leandro Andrade
was "cruel and unusual" because it was disproportionate to the relatively
minor crime he had committed, the robbery of videos from a Kmart in San
Bernardino County.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer is appealing the ruling to the U.S. Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Flanked by other liberal Democrats, including Sens. Sheila Kuehl of
Santa Monica, Richard Alarcon of Sylmar and Gloria Romero of Los Angeles,
and Assemblyman Carl Washington of Paramount, Goldberg conceded Tuesday
that she would face an uphill battle to push the bill through an
election-year session of the Legislature, and get a signature from Gov.
Gray Davis and approval by the voters in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg recalled that the Legislature and voters were told in 1994
that the proposed three-strikes law would apply to inmates convicted of
serious or violent felonies, but from the outset it has also been imposed
on petty crooks charged with less serious misdemeanor crimes, usually
punishable by no more than a year in the county jail and a $1,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   In cases such as shoplifting, the relatively minor offenses can be
toughened into felonies by laws that allow enhancing them to a potential
third-strike offense.</TE>
<TE>   The federal court did not overturn the three-strikes law, but left the
door open for hundreds of inmates to individually seek reduction of their
sentences or release from prison.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg said such case-by-case suits would run up heavy taxpayer
expenses, choke the courts, and take prosecutors and police officers away
from other important cases.</TE>
<TE>   "Let the time fit the crime," Goldberg said.</TE>
<TE>   At least half a dozen bills have been introduced since 1994 that
sought to modify the statute to apply only to murders, rapists and other
major criminals. Each has failed.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg said she expects a better outcome this time because the issue
of fairness will "resonate with people."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, she said that in this election year, it "will be difficult"
to get it passed, even by a majority vote in the Democrat-dominated
Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, a Republican candidate for governor who as an assemblyman wrote
the 1994 three-strikes bill, called the law a "huge success" in reducing
crime in California and accused those who would amend it of "working on
behalf of the criminals instead of victims."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, an organization known as Citizens Against Violent Crime
announced the kickoff of a campaign to gather 419,260 voter signatures to
qualify an initiative similar to Goldberg's bill for the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Leo McElroy, a public relations executive and campaign consultant,
said recent polling by the firm of Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin and
Associates found that 65% of Californians support amending the law to
apply only to violent felonies.</TE>

<HD>3 Still Missing in Boating Accident on Castaic Lake</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three men believed to have drowned in Castaic Lake were still
missing Tuesday after a daylong search by volunteer divers.</LD>
<LD>   The recovery operation will continue today for the missing passengers
of a luxury powerboat that capsized Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The body of the fourth man aboard, Ken Lane, 41, of La Crescenta, was
found shortly after the accident Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Still missing are Steve Coulombe, 38, of Agua Dulce; Nelson Ray
Brinkman, 30, of Phelan, and Chuck Wiseman, 47, of Castaic.</TE>
<TE>   Four volunteers, all experienced deep-water divers, explored the
wreckage in two-person teams. Four other divers aided the deep-water
teams with their decompression, which is especially challenging because
the lake is at an oxygen-reducing 1,515 feet above sea level and the boat
is resting on the lake floor 247 feet beneath the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Because the boat is in such deep water, divers were only able to
explore the wreckage for 20 minutes at a time.</TE>
<TE>   An official of a Canadian sonar manufacturer is expected to arrive
Thursday to assist the recovery effort.</TE>
<TE>   On the first dive, the team searched the boat and a 25-foot circle
around it, with the second team expanding that radius to 50 feet.</TE>
<TE>   A remote-controlled vehicle with a video camera is expected to explore
the lake floor around the wreckage today to narrow the search area,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the lake's speed limit is 35 mph, witnesses told deputies
they estimated that the boat was traveling up to 85 mph, Harrell said.
Victims could have been ejected and since moved with the current,
Sheriff's Deputy David Cervantes said.</TE>
<TE>   "That means the bodies could be anywhere in the lake, and we need to
get additional resources to deal with that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County officials said they will continue the recovery
efforts until the missing are found.</TE>

<HD>Archdiocese Buys a Hole in the Ground</HD>
<DH>Property: Church officials don't yet have a plan for the 192-acre
Irwindale pit, formerly a quarry.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a pit, really, a vacuous space nearly a mile across and almost
200 feet deep, 192 acres of almost sheer nothing.</LD>
<LD>   Once a mining quarry, from which tons of rock and gravel were dug out
and hauled away, it has sat inactive for more than 20 years, a hole in
the ground.</LD>
<LD>   The people of Irwindale nicknamed it the Olive Pit--for Olive Street,
which forms its northern border--and, alternately, the Baldwin Park Pit,
after the city that borders it on three sides.</LD>
<TE>   Consolidated Rock Products stopped mining there in the mid-1970s and
has spent the last five years trying to sell the property. Late last
year, Vulcan Materials Co., which now owns Consolidated Rock, found a
most unlikely buyer: the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Although neither Vulcan nor the archdiocese would disclose the
purchase price for the lot, property records indicate that it was
assessed last year for $1.7 million. The site was listed in September
2000 for $4.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The company is in a program to dispose of properties that are no
longer used for mining," said Brian Ferris, Vulcan's lawyer. The
archdiocese, he said, paid cash.</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale, population 1,446, is so pock-marked with craters that any
land not occupied by houses, businesses and the Santa Fe Dam resembles
the surface of the moon. Fifty percent of the city is occupied by quarry
land, and 17 large rock-and-gravel craters, such as the Olive Pit,
inhabit two of the city's 9 square miles.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last two decades, most of that land has become inactive;
only five gravel quarries are still operating, said City Manager Steve
Blancarte, and officials in the city 18 miles east of downtown Los
Angeles have been pushing for the reclamation of the other pits.</TE>
<TE>   One quarry was recently filled in to create a 107-acre business and
industrial park; another became the Irwindale Speedway, which opened in
early 1999. The city famously spent $20 million in 1987 in a failed
attempt to persuade Al Davis to bring his Raiders to the city to play in
a converted pit they had nicknamed "Raider Crater."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Catholic Church will now participate in the renovation of
Irwindale with its Olive Pit property is a point of speculation.
Blancarte said city officials had spoken with the archdiocese about using
the property for a cemetery or a golf course. Or both.</TE>
<TE>   "They've talked about a combination of the two," Blancarte said.</TE>
<TE>   But Tod M. Tamberg, spokesman for the archdiocese, said no specific
plans for the property were in the works. Any conversations held with
Irwindale city officials, he said, were simply exploratory. "You want to
see what they think of the property," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very common for the archdiocese to buy property without a
short-term or long-term purpose in mind," Tamberg said. "The real estate
department thought it was something we should do, and we did it."</TE>
<TE>   So for now, he said, the site will just sit, as it has for decades.
"We may never use the land," Tamberg said. "It may look strange to you,
but that's the way the archdiocese works."</TE>

<LD>I wavered over my newspaper for a long time the other morning,
trying to figure out which tale jerked my chain harder:</LD>
<LD>   My colleague Ann O'Neill's story about the billionaire's ex-wife
wanting $320,000 a month in child support for one child.</LD>
<LD>   Or my colleague Tina Daunt's story about a billionaire industry
spreading millions in free political ads and campaign bucks around town
in hopes of getting a civic blessing on its signs, which a fellow in
Louisiana has called "litter on sticks."</LD>
<TE>   In the end, the reason you're reading about one and not the other is
this: The first story, dazzling though it is in its wretched excess, only
really affects a billionaire foolish enough to beget a child at the age
of 81, and a 36-year-old woman shameless enough to tell the world that
she needs almost 4 million dollars a year to raise one child.</TE>
<TE>   The second story hits millions of us every day, but enriches at most
perhaps two dozen officials foolish or shameless enough to give away the
store, even though it happens to be ours.</TE>
<TE>   In the two-mile drive from my home to the freeway, I saw 29 billboards
this morning. Mine is not a flossy part of town--I doubt that the
billionaire daddy has so much as thumbed my page in the Thomas Bros.
guide--and most of these billboards, in Spanish or English, flog soda
pop, money-grams to Mexico, bus travel and cemetery services. Sometimes,
they push the booze and nicotine that they haven't been allowed to sell
on TV. Sometimes, they tell us not to smoke and not to drive drunk, but I
suspect that's only when the soda-pop companies don't buy the space.</TE>
<TE>   Your way to work must take you past some of the city's other 9,671 or
so billboards. But only about a score or so of us--City Council members,
the city attorney and the mayor--get much good out of them.</TE>
<TE>   And what goods! Last year, multinational billboard firms gave about a
million dollar and millions of square feet of free billboard space to
candidates, among them James Hahn, who got elected mayor, and Rocky
Delgadillo, who got elected city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   We'll soon find out whether that romancing gets the companies to
second base. After a yearlong ban on new billboards, the City Council
votes this spring on a law that would topple 1,400 billboards around town
(hurrah!) and allow 70 new monster billboards along freeways instead
(hmm).</TE>
<TE>   Because one freeway billboard can scare up 10 times the trade of a
sign in my neighborhood, the firms would love to swap--and to add a wink
to that smile, they may be trading away illegal billboards that shouldn't
be up anyway. What's to lose?</TE>
<TE>   If a lobbyist named Ken Spiker Jr. can persuade L.A. to let down the
barriers to freeway billboards, he gets a bonus, as much as a million
dollars (That's only three months' child support to a billionaire, but to
me, and probably to Ken, it's handsome dough). What makes his job a
little easier is that he has a hall pass as the industry's guy on--I love
this part--a committee that reviews the city's sign law and recommends
changes!</TE>
<TE>   And what do the rest of us get out of this? Nada. Not a red cent, not
a thin dime, not one Yankee dollar.</TE>
<TE>   There's a "onetime fee" when a billboard first goes up, but after
that, they're home-free. And because some signs may have been standing
since before the advent of color TV, by default this could amount to a
nice little civic charity for billboard companies.</TE>
<TE>   There are states--Hawaii, Vermont, Oregon--that have no billboards,
and make that part of their tourist allure. There are cities and counties
that charge fees for the "litter on sticks." One region in South Carolina
took in nearly a million a year on billboard property taxes and fees. Is
L.A., cradle of the fortune cookie and the drive-in churches, less bold
and inventive than the home state of Strom Thurmond?</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, some businessmen named their mini-mall development
company "La Mancha," which they thought was Spanish for "the impossible
dream." It really means "the spot," like a stain, which the city decided
mini-malls were, and laid a moratorium on them.</TE>
<TE>   Now one man's blot can be another man's free speech. The billboards
won't go away. But because they won't, all Angelenos should get something
out of them, without having to run for office.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council votes today on Councilman Jack Weiss' proposal to
stop illegal billboards by requiring a bar code on each legit sign and
getting rid of the rest. I like that, but don't stop there. A bar code
could signal an expiration date too: "It's January, time to write that
check for your annual billboard fee."</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, maybe we can put our own billboards around City Hall,
Burma-Shave style:</TE>
<TE>   "It's City Hall/</TE>
<TE>   So come on in/</TE>
<TE>   Lobbyists welcome/</TE>
<TE>   Residents skinned."</TE>
<TE>   --Urban shave</TE>

<HD>Curtain Drops on Pasadena Nonprofit That Staged Shows</HD>
<DH>Money: The foundation was formed to diversify uses of the city's
civic auditorium. The group owed $1.9 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A nonprofit foundation that stages musicals, ballets and other
shows at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium has shut down with $1.9 million in
debts, much of it owed to the city-owned venue.</LD>
<LD>   The Pasadena Civic Auditorium Foundation was dissolved Jan. 8 by its
board of directors with all its remaining shows canceled. Its 3,100
season ticket-holders will receive refunds, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the 145 performances the foundation staged since its 1998
creation did not break even and the debts became untenable after two
recent shows, "Tap Dogs" and "The Nutcracker," suffered poor attendance,
foundation leaders said.</LD>
<TE>   "The foundation has struggled for some time and when the last two
shows did not make money, it was the point of no return," said foundation
President Rick Barr, who also is the general manager of the auditorium.
"It was about 20% of the business at the Civic. Other tenants and events
won't be affected."</TE>
<TE>   The landmark venue run by the city's Pasadena Center Operating Co.
also is home to the Pasadena Symphony and the Distinguished Speaker
Series. The elegant Renaissance-inspired structure designed in 1932,
officials said, is rented out about 220 days a year for events, including
the local Emmys, the People's Choice Awards and NAACP Image Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to diversify the entertainment lineup, some members of the
Pasadena Center Operating Co. board decided in 1998 to form the
foundation to bring a new mixture of shows to the venue while gathering
charitable contributions for the program.</TE>
<TE>   "The city couldn't get involved in such a speculative venture as
presenting shows because it could put the city in [financial] jeopardy,"
said Roger Smith, chief executive officer of the Pasadena Center
Operating Co. "It was a good thing the city didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the $1.4 million owed by the foundation to the city's
operating company is not money the venue will have to pay and is mostly
unpaid rent that has been written off as debt that cannot be collected.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Barr said, the foundation owes about $500,000 to
creditors, including Dallas Summer Musicals of Texas, with which the
foundation had a lengthy contract for musical productions.</TE>
<TE>   It and other creditors will not receive payment because the foundation
is penniless, officials said. However, the auditorium's box office held
on to receipts from season subscribers so they will be refunded in full,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the quality of shows, competition from other venues and
entertainment, and the financial fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks proved fatal.</TE>
<TE>   "They counted on turning it around this year. The problem was people
just did not buy tickets," Pasadena Councilman Paul Little said. "It is
close to a couple of hundred bucks for a family of four."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said "The Nutcracker," which netted $100,000 in a 2000 run, did
not break even this Christmas season. "The productions out on the road
from New York aren't exactly super-duper in the paying public's eyes," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Mayor Bill Bogaard said the foundation's financial problems
were known to city officials, but its folding remains a disappointment.
"Each year it got deeper and deeper into the hole," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Like many foundations, he said, it counted on charitable
contributions. "The 501c foundation was formed in the belief they'd raise
money. There are a lot of generous people in Pasadena. But there are a
lot of competing and better-established causes."</TE>

<HD>Suit Aims to Save Rare Fish Near Planned Mine</HD>
<DH>Courts: Environmental group's action against federal agency is
unlikely to affect the project near Santa Clarita, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawsuit aimed at protecting an endangered fish is unlikely to
change a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ruling in favor of a proposed
gravel mine near Santa Clarita, officials said this week.</LD>
<LD>   The suit brought by the Center for Biological Diversity based in
Tucson states that the wildlife service failed to designate "critical
habitats" for the unarmored threespine stickleback along the Santa Clara
River and three other locations. Under the Endangered Species Act,
federal agencies may not approve projects that would destroy or seriously
alter areas designated critical habitats.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, seeks to force the
wildlife service to reconsider its 1998 opinion that the Transit Mixed
Concrete Co. mine will not harm the stickleback. The mine would extract
78 million tons of sand and gravel from Soledad Canyon, just east of
Santa Clarita.</LD>
<TE>   The inch-long stickleback was once abundant in Southern California,
but its population has dwindled in recent decades, partly because of
unchecked development, environmentalists say.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of projects proposed and ongoing that would
adversely modify or destroy critical habitats [around the river]," said
Peter Galvin, a biologist with the center. "The Soledad Canyon mine is
one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Lois Grunwald said Monday that a
successful lawsuit could prompt a new review of the agency's decision,
but it probably would not change its opinion. In many cases, designating
habitats does not "create a higher level of protections" for endangered
species, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Galvin said Grunwald's statements were "absolutely incorrect," and
added that he hoped the lawsuit would help clarify the level of
protection that should be afforded to federally designated critical
habitats.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Clara River is prone to dry spells that kill off the
stickleback. Water drawn from the river for the mining project would
probably mean longer dry periods, but the wildlife service has determined
that any threat to the fish would be negligible, agency biologist Ray
Bransfield said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government, which owns the land, has already directed
Transit Mixed Concrete to monitor river levels to protect the fish and
another endangered species, the arroyo toad, Bransfield said. The mine
would be temporarily shut down if the water levels get too low.</TE>
<TE>   In the suit, the Center for Biological Diversity asks that critical
habitats be designated in Soledad Canyon, two streams in the river
watershed and in the lower San Antonio Creek on the Vandenberg Air Force
Military Reservation in Santa Barbara County.</TE>
<TE>   Galvin said Fish and Wildlife had proposed protecting those areas in
1980 and was required by law to finalize the habitat designation within a
year.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fish and Wildlife Service has let this languish out there for 20
years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Grunwald said she was not sure why the agency had waited so long. But
she noted that expanding the endangered species list has generally taken
precedence over habitat designations.</TE>
<TE>   The green-gray stickleback was found throughout the Los Angeles area
in the early 20th century. By 1942 it had become so scarce that
biologists believed it was extinct. It was declared a federal endangered
species in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   The Soledad Canyon mine was approved by the federal Bureau of Land
Management in August 2000. The city of Santa Clarita, the Sierra Club and
other groups attempted to overturn that decision, arguing in part that
federal agencies did not adequately address the mine's effect on
endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the U.S. Interior Department rejected that appeal. The
project must still be approved by the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors, which will consider it Feb. 26.</TE>

<HD>Man Arrested in Roommate's Killing</HD>
<DH>Violence: The victim, a disabled 63-year-old, was defenseless in
beating and stabbing attack, police say.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Police arrested a Van Nuys man Tuesday on suspicion of beating his
disabled roommate to death.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Robert Lee Solandino, 63, was found by a friend Monday
afternoon in the weathered, Cape Cod-style apartment complex on Friar
Street where he lived with Michael William Willoughby.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles detectives arrested Willoughby, 57, less than a quarter of
a mile from the crime scene. He is accused of beating, cutting and
stabbing Solandino on Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   The diminutive, bespectacled Solandino recently had undergone stomach
surgery and was receiving disability payments, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "The victim couldn't defend himself," Det. Al Aldaz said. "It was a
very brutal killing."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors reported seeing Willoughby running from the apartment
complex Saturday night, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Aldaz described Willoughby as a diagnosed schizophrenic who has been
in and out of mental institutions. He also served time in state prison
from 1988 to 1992 for robbery, Aldaz said.</TE>
<TE>   Four months ago, Solandino answered a newspaper ad for a roommate and
moved into the second-floor apartment rented in Willoughby's name, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before that, Willoughby had attacked another roommate because
the man didn't have a spare cigarette, Aldaz said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information about how to reach Solandino's family is asked
to call the LAPD's Van Nuys station at (818) 756-8348.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles County's brief era of overflowing social welfare
coffers came to an end Tuesday when officials revealed a $70-million
shortfall in programs that move people off welfare rolls.</LD>
<LD>   To close the gap, the county will have to cut into a variety of
anti-poverty programs it had funded with unspent welfare funds, a county
welfare official told the Board of Supervisors during a fiery meeting
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors, furious at the delay in bringing the problem to
light--the department had known of it since at least May--refused to
approve the program cuts without more study. And they accused officials
of the Department of Social Services of lying in an effort to protect
their bureaucracy.</LD>
<TE>   "The department's deceitful behavior has led to its gluttonous
recommendation to siphon money from the most needy," fumed Supervisor
Gloria Molina. "I'll be damned if I am going to allow you to backfill
with money that belongs to residents in our neighborhoods for a mistake
that the bureaucrats have made."</TE>
<TE>   She ordered the county's auditor-controller and chief administrative
officer to help the department come up with a plan to cover the debt over
time without reducing core services.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Golightly, interim head of the department, said he did not warn
the board about the deficit because he first wanted to make sure the
problem was as bad as he feared. The department came to the board Tuesday
seeking approval to redirect money to cover the shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   "We were hopeful at the time working administratively with the state
Department of Social Services that we would be able to reduce that amount
substantially," Golightly said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he briefed the supervisors' aides about a potential deficit in
September and gave them final numbers in November. Not having done so
sooner "was a mistake, in retrospect," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Golightly, this isn't just a bad judgment call," shot back
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. "You put the core mission of this county's
welfare system at risk and in jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   The deficit stems, in essence, from increasing costs of administering
CalWORKS, a series of so-called welfare-to-work programs.</TE>
<TE>   With a welfare caseload roughly 10 times that of any other county, Los
Angeles took longer to transfer its roughly 200,000 recipients to the new
program, Golightly said. As a result, it accumulated a surplus of more
than $100 million each year since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Golightly said a state report on Los Angeles' relatively low cost per
recipient led his department to believe the state would accept a larger
budget request for Los Angeles this year and put in a request for $555.5
million for CalWORKS.</TE>
<TE>   It was a bad assumption. The state kept Los Angeles' share of the
money--federal dollars administered by the state--at last year's level,
$469.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, Los Angeles' welfare-to-work program continued to
"mature," bringing more job-retention services such as child care and
transportation to more people. The programs are expected to cost $539.5
million this year.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that the state-mandated programs now cost the county
$70.4 million more than the state pays for them.</TE>
<TE>   And the county department's fiscal woes do not end there. It is
battling a federal mandate to return about $50 million in interest earned
on federal funds that states doled out to counties before they were
spent. Golightly said federal officials have asked for the interest back
and his department is lobbying for a reprieve.</TE>
<TE>   All of this comes at a time when the state is struggling with a
massive deficit of its own, which Gov. Gray Davis proposes to fix in part
by cutting $1.1 billion from programs for the poor, including CalWORKS.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the local welfare department's proposed solution involved
lobbying state officials to redistribute past unused funds to counties
based on need. Golightly said the state agreed to this, but it is unclear
how much Los Angeles will get.</TE>
<TE>   The mainstay of the department's plan involved using "incentive"
funds--bonus dollars earned by the reduction of welfare rolls--to make up
the difference.</TE>
<TE>   That money has been used to fund a 46-program initiative of community
programs meant to assist the poor, called the Long Term Family
Self-Sufficiency plan. But not all of the programs have been implemented
and the department figures it can free nearly $110 million by not
starting some of them and cutting back or ending others early.</TE>
<TE>   The board rejected that plan Tuesday. Instead, supervisors directed
the department to make another study and present a more thoughtful list
of cuts.</TE>
<TE>   On motions from Supervisors Yvonne Burke and Michael Antonovich, the
board said two community programs that had been slated for cuts should be
given higher priority: after-school programs and a project to aid
emancipated foster youth. Supervisors also said they would meet to
consider whether any employees should be disciplined for not bringing the
deficit to their attention earlier.</TE>

<LD>Continuing its efforts to reach out to areas threatening secession,
the Los Angeles City Council agreed Tuesday to hold its Jan. 22 meeting
at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood is one of three areas of the city that have petitioned for a
secession study. Last month, the council met in Wilmington, another area
threatening to break away.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Eric Garcetti, who represents Hollywood, said the meeting,
which will begin at 7 p.m., will allow residents better access to the
council while showcasing the new theater at 6801 Hollywood Blvd.</LD>

<HD>Columnist Gets Wild in the Morning; Oh, Wait, That's the Radio Guy</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Good morning L.A., you're listening to Steve Harvey on the radio. .
. . Get on the phone and tell somebody because Steve Harvey's gonna be
wild. . . . I'm gonna be waaaay off the hook, but before we get started.
. . .</LD>
<LD>   Wait a minute! That was the other Steve Harvey speaking on his radio
show on KKBT-FM (100.3). Sorry about that. I don't know how his radio
intro and my column intro could have gotten mixed up. But crazy things
happen with all this complicated modern technology.</LD>
<LD>   Anyway, while we're on the subject of radio, one other personality I
really miss hearing is funnyman Gary Owens, one of the stars of the old
"Laugh-In" television show.</LD>
<TE>   I read on Don Barrett's laradio.com Web site that Owens recently
performed the introduction when talk show host Larry Marino made his
debut on KRLH-AM (590).</TE>
<TE>   In true Owens fashion, he described Marino as "a man who has more
talent in his little finger than he does in his big finger."</TE>
<TE>   On the move: And are we ever, with today's artwork (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   We have a bike that was apparently ridden by a performing animal . . .
a grueling trail walk of more than 25 feet (contributed by Charlotte Poe
of Somis) and a sobering thought for drivers near Barnsdall, Okla.
(snapped by Mike Evans of La Mesa).</TE>
<TE>   Give me an S, give me a U. . .: You probably recall--even if you wish
you couldn't--the movie of a few years ago "The Positively True
Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom."</TE>
<TE>   I see now that threats are being made in the case of the disputed
selection process for the Newport Harbor High School pompom squad. But
this is, after all, Newport Beach. So I guess this movie will be called
"The Positively True Adventures of the Southern California
Cheerleader-Suing Mom."</TE>
<TE>   Stupid driving tricks: The Laguna News-Post's police log said a
motorist "observed two cars driving northbound on Coast Highway from Dana
Point with people who were throwing things at each other from open
windows. He also said that they were trying to join hands while driving."</TE>
<TE>   Happy to report the cops got 'em.</TE>
<TE>   Don't let the door hit you on the way out: I started thinking about
that moment in the movie "Orange County" when the young writer declares:
"I've got to get out of Orange County." And it occurred to me that a sort
of escape theme runs through works about Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Some other examples:</TE>
<TE>   * "We was cooped up in Long Beach too long"--con woman Ann Sothern,
heading back to Alabama in the movie "Crazy Mama."</TE>
<TE>   * "Leave with me! There's no reason for you to stay. Not here, not in
L.A."--a Gen Xer in the movie "Less Than Zero."</TE>
<TE>   * "I really want you out of L.A."--the president of the United States
to his wife in the movie "Independence Day" (of course, he knows that
L.A. is about to suffer a flying saucer invasion).</TE>
<TE>   * "I'm never going back to Glendale"--title character in the novel
"Mildred Pierce."</TE>
<TE>   * "L.A. proved too much for the man, so he's leavin' . . ."--from the
song "Midnight Train to Georgia" by Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips.</TE>
<TE>   * "She had to get out/Get out/Get out/Get out"--from the song "Los
Angeles" by the rock group X.</TE>
<TE>   And I'm not offended by the departures. Anything to keep the
population down.</TE>
<TE>miscelLAny:</TE>
<TE>   In its February issue, Surfer magazine names the "10 Best Surf Towns,"
a list that looks as though it were put together by Jeff Spicoli, the
zonked-out wave-rider in the movie "Fast Times at Ridgemont High."</TE>
<TE>   The selections of Hermosa Beach and Santa Cruz make sense. But one of
the top 10 is San Luis Obispo, which, the magazine explains, has a
"vibrant surf culture."</TE>
<TE>   Problem is, it's also 10 miles from the water.</TE>
<TE>   As Spicoli would say: "Far out!" Or "Far in!"</TE>

<HD>Nation of Islam Fee Waiver May Be Reviewed</HD>
<DH>Policy: At the urging of the ADL, Weiss and Garcetti ask that the
city attorney determine whether the Convention Center anti-gang event
meets requirements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Los Angeles officials Tuesday sought to reconsider a $30,000
fee waiver granted to the Nation of Islam for use of the Convention
Center, following a challenge by the Anti-Defamation League.</LD>
<LD>   City Councilmen Jack Weiss and Eric Garcetti introduced a motion
asking for the city attorney to determine whether the event, scheduled
for Feb. 14-16, meets the requirements for a waiver.</LD>
<LD>   "The allegations raised in the ADL letter are serious," Weiss said.
"Because of the legal nature of the questions, they warrant a legal
analysis."</LD>
<TE>   Weiss also asked for a broader look at the policy of waiving fees at
the Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   Under city policy, a waiver can be granted if the event is beneficial
to the community, said Belu Onyedika, a spokesman for the Los Angeles
Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   "The Anti-Defamation League fails to see how subsidizing Nation of
Islam's unwavering record of racism and bigotry serves any public or
educational purpose," wrote ADL Interim Regional Director Aaron Levinson
and league counsel Tamar Galatzan in the letter to the council.</TE>
<TE>   The event, called Saviors Day 2002, has an anti-gang focus, with
workshops on community organizing, gang intervention and family
relationships, said Tony Muhammad, western regional representative of the
Nation of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "Gang violence is up in Los Angeles, and the Honorable Louis Farrakhan
believes he can play a role in curtailing gang violence," Muhammad said.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad said the ADL's criticism of Farrakhan is misplaced. "He is
not a man who has been divisive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The ADL letter alleges that Farrakhan "has long expressed
anti-Semitic, anti-white, anti-Catholic and homophobic rhetoric."</TE>
<TE>   The ADL challenged the waiver on the grounds that it violates city
policy prohibiting waivers for religious events that are not generally
open to the public, and a policy that limits waivers to $2,500 per day.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Jan Perry, who sponsored the waiver approved by the
council last month, said the city has approved waivers for other
religious groups that hold educational conferences. City records show
waivers for the National Ecumenical Congress, St. Sophia Cathedral, the
Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the Salvation Army and the Greek
Orthodox Western Diocese.</TE>
<TE>   "It is consistent with what we have done in the past," Chief
Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton said.</TE>
<TE>   Perry said she cleared the waiver with the city attorney's office
ahead of time. She said the event is an educational conference open to
the public, not a religious event. Both Weiss and Garcetti voted for the
waiver when the council approved it Dec. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss said he did not challenge the waiver Tuesday because of
Farrakhan's statements, but asked for proof that the conference serves a
public purpose and otherwise meets city policy.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-gang event will fill local hotels and bring $2.8 million to
the local economy, Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   "It will bring 15,000 Nation of Islam delegates to the Convention
Center to be trained in community organizing," Perry said. "After the
intense training, delegates will be sent to various communities in Los
Angeles as peace ambassadors to work on gang intervention."</TE>
<TE>   Perry noted that Farrakhan will close the event with a speech in
Inglewood. She said if the event meets city guidelines, any attempt to
block the waiver because of past comments by Farrakhan would be improper.</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk about freedom of expression, as a government we are not
in the business of censoring others' comments whether we agree with them
or not," Perry said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A former state prison guard was sentenced Tuesday to 2 1/2 years
behind bars for bringing marijuana into the prison.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony Lunnon, 43, of Lancaster was caught during an undercover drug
sting at the Lancaster prison and admitted to taking marijuana there at
least 20 times last year, Deputy Dist. Atty. Max Huntsman said.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators in the sting met Lunnon at a Food for Less supermarket
near the prison and gave him methamphetamines and marijuana to deliver to
an officer posing as an inmate in the California State Prison where
Lunnon worked.</LD>
<TE>   After his arrest, Lunnon admitted that he regularly delivered drugs to
another inmate in the prison.</TE>
<TE>   "Corruption at the prison is a constant thing, and so are our
investigations," said Huntsman, a member of the district attorney's newly
expanded Justice System Integrity Division.</TE>
<TE>   Lunnon was fired shortly after his arrest in October. He pleaded
guilty to one charge of taking a controlled substance into the jail and
attempting to sell methamphetamines, Huntsman said.</TE>

<HD>Council Urges Airport Panel to Give Relief to Businesses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to ask the
city's Airport Commission to consider extending additional relief to
airport businesses hit hard by a steep drop in sales after the terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Council members also expressed concern about allegations made by union
representatives that concessionaires at LAX are taking advantage of
workers after Sept. 11 by cutting jobs, hours and work breaks.</LD>
<LD>   Several council members suggested that the Airport Commission help
struggling businesses by extending their contracts to operate LAX's
retail shops and restaurants. The lawmakers said that could provide an
incentive to concessionaires to preserve jobs and rehire those workers
who lost their jobs after the attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "The question is, if we extend contracts with tenants at LAX, will
this give employers a chance to extend jobs?" said Councilman Ed Reyes.</TE>
<TE>   The commission voted in December to provide $9.5 million in rent
relief to some airport businesses. The program allowed concessionaires to
skip their monthly minimum payments from Oct. 1 through Dec. 31. Instead,

<HD>Bid for New Venue in '96 Death Loses</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Texas businessman accused of murder after a woman co-worker
plunged in 1996 from an Industry Hills hotel balcony has lost his bid to
move his trial out of the San Gabriel Valley, authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for Robert Lee Salazar argued that he could not get a fair
trial in the area because of heavy media coverage of the case, including
television dramatizations of Sandra Orellana's death.</LD>
<LD>   Pomona Superior Court Judge Theodore Piatt said that there wasn't
enough evidence to show that Salazar wouldn't get a fair trial, said Jane
Robison of the district attorney's office.</LD>
<TE>   Salazar, who has pleaded innocent, told authorities that Orellana, 27,
accidentally fell eight stories at the Sheraton on Nov. 13, 1996, while
they were having sex.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar, 37, was arrested a week after her death, but was released for
lack of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said last year that later DNA testing revealed Orellana's
blood on one of his T-shirts and on a sheet in her room next door to
Salazar's.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar, who was arrested again March 2, 2001, in Texas, did not fight
extradition. He was freed after posting bond but must return to
California for court appearances.</TE>

<HD>An Annual Event 'You Never Want to Miss'</HD>
<DH>Long Beach: There are plenty of laughs at the State of the City
address, a luncheon sponsored by the area chamber of commerce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you do business in Long Beach and missed Tuesday's State of the
City address, start kicking yourself.</LD>
<LD>   This luncheon, sponsored by the largest chamber of commerce south of
San Francisco and attended by 1,500 people, sold out months ago. In this
town, it is the business event of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Gathered in one ballroom were Long Beach's establishment, from
university presidents to titans of transportation, port to airport--all
expecting your business card pressed into their hands.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Beverly O'Neill, considered a sophisticated politician with a
breezy wit, quoted "the philosopher Mae West" four times--reportedly down
from eight times last year.</TE>
<TE>   Recovering from a flub in which she referred to John F. Kennedy as
"John Clinton," the unflappable O'Neill paused, her comic timing perfect:</TE>
<TE>   "It reminds me of another Mae West line," she said, waiting a beat. "
'I used to be Snow White, then I drifted.' "</TE>
<TE>   To which this giant civic pep rally burst into applause.</TE>
<TE>   If one was looking for the downside, the nitty of the gritty problems
in this very urban city of 461,500, California's fifth-largest, one was
clearly in the wrong room.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here because our local supports the city," said a United Auto
Workers training rep from the aerospace giant, the Boeing Corp., which
has a huge expansion underway near Long Beach Airport. "You never want to
miss this," said Clare Dellemann, an Edward Jones Investments rep wearing
a brace around her broken neck.</TE>
<TE>   Much like the nation's State of the Union address, in which even the
president's detractors smile and applaud ever-so politely, the mayor's
ode to the city was greeted with enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   In the ballroom audience were at least two O'Neill opponents in this
April's mayoral election. (Because she has served the city's two-term
limit, O'Neill is running as a write-in candidate.)</TE>
<TE>   But the room was clearly hers. O'Neill was credited for what she noted
as city strides. They included a 28% hike in retail sales since 1999; a
$300-million expansion of the port; the new Carnival Cruise ship dock
under construction near the Queen Mary; and the bread-and-butter civic
job of filling potholes and repaving streets.</TE>
<TE>   The event was sponsored by the Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce,
which has 2,000 members. Sounding vaguely like an Academy Award winner,
the chamber's board chairman, Jay Davis, said, "I'd like to recognize my
Dad" for founding a local company "and I'd like to thank my wife for
putting up with me all these years."</TE>
<TE>   The theme of the lunch was a tribute to Long Beach City College's 75th
anniversary and its significance to the area for having graduated 2
million students.</TE>
<TE>   Lending humor to the potentially dry subject of civic affairs was the
introduction of O'Neill. She was described not only as a teacher who rose
to become college president, but also as a singer who played the lead,
Yum-Yum, in her Polytechnic High School production of "The Mikado." And .
. . she likes chocolate and white daisies.</TE>
<TE>   To which O'Neill replied, "For a while there I was thinking 'This Is
Your Life.' You know more about me than I want you to."</TE>

<LD>Having failed to persuade Greyhound Lines not to move a bus
terminal to a Mission Hills mall, City Council President Alex Padilla won
approval Tuesday of rules meant to keep buses out of adjacent residential
neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   The council approved a measure to put up signs banning vehicles
weighing more than 6,000 pounds from using Rincon Avenue between Laurel
Canyon Boulevard and Pearwood Avenue, to order police enforcement and to
investigate whether the limit should be extended to part of Rinaldi
Street.</LD>
<LD>   Padilla had asked the firm not to move its terminal from San Fernando
to La Rinda Plaza, but an aide said the property is properly zoned for
the use.</LD>
<TE>   "The next step is actual enforcement of weight limitations on streets
to protect residential neighborhoods," Padilla said.</TE>

<HD>Fireman Enters Plea in Arson</HD>
<DH>Courts: Retiree will get two years in blazes that destroyed his
ex-wife's carport and vehicles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A retired Los Angeles firefighter captured after 2 1/2 years on the
run from charges that he stalked his ex-wife, beat her and set fire to
her South Pasadena carport pleaded no contest Tuesday to arson and will
be sentenced to two years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   David Walter Pierson, 67, captured in Laughlin, Nev., last September
by South Pasadena police, entered the plea in Pasadena Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Charged with arson, spousal abuse, burglary of a vehicle, stalking and
three counts of violating a court order, Deputy Dist. Atty. Philip Wojdak
said, Pierson faced up to eight years in prison if convicted.</LD>
<TE>   "Given his age and his lack of a prior record, this is a stiff
disposition," Wojdak said of the plea bargain. Pierson must pay his
ex-wife $4,000 in restitution before his Feb. 5 sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Pierson was captured Sept. 18 after investigators discovered that
retirement checks were being mailed to a Laughlin post office box, South
Pasadena police said. Postal inspectors, who received Pierson's
photograph, confirmed that he visited it every Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Pierson, who was a firefighter for 27 years, fled California after
witnesses saw him set fire to his ex-wife Pauline Hohrmann's car and two
other vehicles in a South Pasadena garage on April 19, 1999--weeks after
she got a restraining order against him.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Jones, a South Pasadena Fire Department investigator, said
Pierson admitted the arson during the drive back from Nevada after his
arrest. Jones said Pierson used a flammable liquid to ignite the fire
that destroyed his ex-wife's car and two other vehicles and burned an
adjoining structure and a utility pole in the 1800 block of Fremont
Avenue.</TE>

<LD>One man was killed and five people were injured when a Los Angeles
Fire Department ambulance and several other vehicles collided late

<LD>   A 42-year-old man, whose name was withheld pending notification of

said.</LD>
<LD>   Police said three other vehicles crashed as they entered the
intersection. None of the other injuries were believed to be
life-threatening, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The accident occurred when the ambulance was responding to a call in

<LD>Saying the evidence is so prejudicial that it will bias a jury,
defense lawyers are asking a judge to bar testimony about a dozen rapes

Sanchez.</LD>
<LD>   An unemployed handyman, Sanchez, 31, is already facing multiple life
prison sentences after admitting that he sexually assaulted several women
in Simi Valley and the western San Fernando Valley between September 1996
and July 2001.</LD>
<LD>   He remains accused of shooting Moorpark college student Megan Barroso,

<HD>Tainted Ground Water Has Moved Closer to Well Serving 17,000 People</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HERMANN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ground water containing a toxic gasoline additive has traveled
closer than previously thought to a well that produces drinking water for
about 17,000 homes in Rialto, Fontana, Colton and Bloomington.</LD>
<LD>   "Two existing west San Bernardino County wells are the ones that are
the most imminently threatened," Kurt Berchtold, the assistant executive
officer of the regional water board, said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Gasoline has been leaking into the ground from a fuel storage tank
terminal on Riverside Avenue near the Rialto-Colton border for about 25
years. Officials from the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board
have been overseeing the cleanup of the site since 1993.</LD>
<TE>   In August, water officials said they believed that a plume of ground
water contaminated by the leak stopped a mile north of two municipal
drinking wells, one of which is in operation. But water samples about a
third of a mile from the wells show that the plume has traveled much
farther.</TE>
<TE>   The contaminant, methyl tertiary butyl ether or MTBE, is added to
gasoline to reduce air pollution. Some studies have suggested that it
causes cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Pierce, a spokesman for Houston-based Kinder Morgan Energy
Partners, which owns the major portion of the tank farm, said the samples
taken from two test wells last week reveal MTBE concentrations of 12
parts per billion and 4 parts per billion, both of which are below the 13
parts per billion that the government allows in drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   "That means there would not be any danger if someone were to drink
it," Pierce said. The presence of MTBE in the test wells does not mean it
is in anyone's drinking water, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Berchtold said the area where the contaminated plume is located is
largely unpopulated.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not identified any other wells in the path of the
contamination," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The general manager of the water district that owns the two threatened
wells said that only one is pumping water to the nearly 17,000 homes that
the district serves in San Bernardino County.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Araiza said the district never started using the second well
and doesn't intend to begin operating it until the contaminated plume is
contained and cleaned up.</TE>
<TE>   Araiza said the district has hired an expert to study the problem, and
district workers regularly test water from the working well to ensure
that no traces of MTBE or benzene, another toxic component of gasoline,
turn up there.</TE>
<TE>   Araiza said the district's threshold for MTBE will be much lower than
the level allowed by the government, because even at as low as 4 parts
per billion, MTBE can make water smell and taste like gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to take a chance of putting anything that tastes like
gasoline in our water supply," he said. "If we see any trace of MTBE in
the well, we'll shut it down.'</TE>
<TE>   Araiza said he learned about the plume and the threat it posed to the
district's wells from newspaper stories and not from regional water board
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything comes out of this, I hope it is better communication
between the regulators," he said.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Alleges Free Parking on Sundays Is Illegal</HD>
<DH>Litigation: A Newport Beach man says a city policy exempting meter
fees for churchgoers violates the separation of church and state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Newport Beach man has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that the
city unconstitutionally violates the separation of church and state by
giving churchgoers special rights to some of the most valued real estate
in town: beach parking.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe that every citizen has a responsibility to be vigilant to
make sure the provisions of the Constitution are not diluted," said John
Nelson, who describes himself as a developer/contractor and agnostic. The
suit was filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is what practically passes for a sacred space in some areas
of Newport Beach: a parking spot on the peninsula. Normally, the metered
spots require 25 cents per quarter-hour. But in the early 1970s, city
officials passed an ordinance that allowed free Sunday morning parking, 8
a.m. to 1 p.m., at the metered spots in front of four churches: Our Lady
of Mount Carmel Catholic Church and Christ Church by the Sea, St. James
Episcopal Church of Newport Beach and the Christian Science Church and
Reading Room, all of them on Balboa Peninsula.</LD>
<TE>   Nelson lives on Lido Isle, near two of the churches.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Tod Ridgeway said that lifting the free parking would create
problems for those living near the churches, because churchgoers would
then take the unmetered spots in front of their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a nightmare," said Ridgeway, who lives near Our Lady of
Mount Carmel. "It would be bedlam on my residential street.'</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. Daniel J. Murray of Our Lady of Mount Carmel said the dispute
doesn't involve the church, but is between the city and Nelson. But he
said Our Lady has been there since 1923, long before parking meters. The
church has 43 parking spaces for services that attract about 300 people.</TE>
<TE>   And he took a stab at why the city decided to allow free parking
nearly three decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is the thinking at the time was, 'Why should we have to pay
to go to church?' " said Murray, who added that the First Amendment warns
against the prohibition of free exercise of religion. "If people don't
have quarters, they can't come to church.'</TE>
<TE>   Harry Schwartzbart of the Americans United for Separation of Church
and State said he considers the free Sunday parking to be a trivial
issue, especially when measured against items such as President Bush's
faith-based initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure my organization would not spend one nickel debating this
issue in court," Schwartzbart said. "You're splitting hairs.'</TE>
<TE>   But Nelson, who said he's spent $6,000 so far in legal fees, vowed to
fight as long as he must to ensure Sunday churchgoers drop their quarters
in the meters. It's not that he's against religion, he said. In fact,
it's just the opposite. He wants to make sure religion is protected from
government.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's not a popular cause, but we need to stick to the issues,"
Nelson said. "I'm a lone ranger who believes in the Constitution of the
U.S."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County church filed lawsuits Tuesday charging that the
city of Cypress was trying to halt its building plans in favor of
businesses that would provide the city with tax dollars.</LD>
<LD>   The legal action, filed in federal and Superior Court in Santa Ana, is
the latest salvo in a 15-month dispute between Cottonwood Christian
Center and the city over 18 acres of real estate in a redevelopment area
near Los Alamitos Race Course.</LD>
<LD>   The church is seeking unspecified monetary damages along with the
right to develop on six adjacent parcels of land it purchased in 1998 for
$13 million.</LD>
<TE>   City officials said the church does not fit with their redevelopment
plans, and they would prefer to see tax-generating businesses on the
property such as retail stores and restaurants.</TE>

<HD>Developer Accused of Not Curbing RunoffPollution: O.C. group says
firm building luxury homes on former oil field is letting tainted water
flow into river.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A local environmental group is accusing a developer of allowing
dirty runoff and other pollutants to flow from a former Yorba Linda oil
field into a river that leads to the coast.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County CoastKeeper's complaint states that Toll Bros. is
violating the federal Clean Water Act and state regulations by allowing
dirty runoff, mud and construction materials to flow from its Vista del
Verde project site, where the developer is building luxury homes, into
the Santa Ana River.</LD>
<LD>   "We are shocked at the magnitude of violations," CoastKeeper's Garry
Brown said in a written statement. "According to our consultant, it is
the dirtiest construction site he has seen.'</LD>
<TE>   Jim Sattler, a Toll Bros. project manager, said he cannot comment on
specific allegations because he has not seen the complaint yet.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I know, we've been adhering to all the requirements," he
said, noting that the company has plans in place to control erosion and
storm-water pollution. State water officials who have visited the site
have had no complaints, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not been in violation yet and [these accusations] would be
news to me," said Sattler.</TE>
<TE>   Toll Bros., based in Pennsylvania, is one of the largest U.S. home
builders.</TE>
<TE>   The 843-acre site, an old oil field that wraps around the newly opened
Black Gold Golf Course at the base of the Chino Hills, is being turned
into a master-planned community of 2,179 luxury homes. Attached, detached
and estate homes will be built over the next two decades, with prices of
$400,000 to more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Newport Beach-based environmental group filed a letter Friday
giving 60 days' notice of its intent to sue, a preliminary move required
under the Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   CoastKeeper's complaint says that the group has videotapes, water
samples and photographs revealing that the construction of three
subdivisions-Montecito, Fairways and Pinnacle-violated the federal and
state water quality laws. The projects lack controls to stop rainwater
and other runoff from coming into contact with construction debris and
also lack measures that would keep the contaminated runoff from flowing
off the construction site, the complaint states. Erosion has not been
minimized, creating sediment-laden runoff, according to the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   If the group's concerns are not resolved within 60 days, it will file
a federal lawsuit against the developer, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana River flows to the ocean in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A similar CoastKeeper suit against the Irvine Co. resulted in major
modifications to part of its Newport Coast development. Those changes
stemmed the flow of polluted runoff into the ocean. In exchange for
enhanced protection and monitoring, the environmental group dropped its
Clean Water Act lawsuit against the developer and its appeals of state
and federal decisions over a 635-home Crystal Cove project. The
development is above state-protected waters that serve as a dolphin
birthing ground.</TE>

<LD>A divided Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday rejected a
push to eliminate a lucrative retirement perk for the county's six
elected managers after the majority said the officials deserved the extra
pay.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors John Flynn, Judy Mikels and Frank Schillo blocked
Supervisor Steve Bennett's attempt to end the county's practice of
allowing the officials to inflate their pension earnings just before
retirement by adding a vacation bonus.</LD>
<LD>   The benefit has been condemned by taxpayer advocates and two citizen
committees appointed by the Board of Supervisors to review salary and
benefit packages.</LD>
<TE>   But the majority argued that because appointed managers receive the
benefit, elected department heads should get it too. As they explained
their vote, the three supervisors took turns praising the work of the
county's elected managers.</TE>

<HD>Judges Extend Drug Rehab for Felons</HD>
<DH>Courts: Appellate justices rule that Proposition 36 may apply to
those who have been out of prison less than five years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appellate court ruled Tuesday that judges can allow
defendants convicted of felonies in recent years to receive drug
treatment under Proposition 36.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, which could affect hundreds of defendants convicted of
minor drug use, will help clear up confusion among California judges over
who is eligible for the initiative. The 2nd District Court of Appeal in
Los Angeles issued the published opinion a few days after hearing oral
arguments.</LD>
<LD>   Approved by 61% of state voters in November 2000, Proposition 36
allows defendants convicted of using, possessing or transporting drugs
for personal use to receive treatment instead of jail time. But the
statute read that defendants who have been convicted of serious or
violent felonies are eligible for drug treatment only if they have been
out of prison for five years.</LD>
<TE>   Since Proposition 36 took effect more than six months ago, judges have
been divided about whether they had the power to dismiss prior felony
convictions for the purposes of sentencing a defendant to drug treatment.
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Ana Maria Luna said she believed
Proposition 36 did not allow her that power. Luna praised Tuesday's
ruling for enabling her to place defendants who need help into
rehabilitation programs.</TE>
<TE>   But she said judges should be cautious when they refer defendants with
violent felony convictions to treatment programs. "In exercising that
discretion, the court is going to have to look at the overall criminal
behavior of the individual . . . and if the person is at a point in their
life that they are ready for treatment," Luna said.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the same appellate court cleared up another area of
disagreement when it ruled that the initiative applies to cases of
nonviolent offenders convicted but not sentenced before the measure took
effect July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's ruling came in the case of Ronald Lee Varnell, who was
charged in May 2001 with possession of methamphetamine. Prosecutors
argued that Varnell was not eligible for Proposition 36 treatment because
he was convicted in 1995 of assault with a deadly weapon and was released
three years before last year's drug arrest. Defense attorneys asked the
judge to dismiss the conviction and refer Varnell to drug treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Joan Comparet-Cassani agreed to the dismissal so
Varnell's sentence would be cut in half to 16 months in prison, but she
denied his request to enter a drug treatment program.</TE>
<TE>   In their 17-page ruling, the appellate justices wrote that judges have
long had the authority under state law to dismiss prior felony
convictions for purposes of sentencing. Because the statewide proposition
did not prohibit the use of that law, the justices wrote that "we must
conclude that power, firmly embedded in our criminal jurisprudence,
coexists with the sentencing scheme at issue."</TE>
<TE>   The justices directed Comparet-Cassani to hold a new sentencing
hearing for Varnell, but did not require her to place him in drug
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Alex Ricciardulli said the appellate court
decision empowers trial judges and "further extends the umbrella of
rehabilitation" to defendants who would have been disqualified otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   But Marc Nolan, who argued the case for the state attorney general's
office, said the ruling "doesn't necessarily change the result in this
case or in any other case." The ruling doesn't say judges have to dismiss
convictions to make defendants eligible for Proposition 36, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nolan said his office has not decided whether to appeal the court's
decision.</TE>

<HD>Lawmaker Wants California to Float Bonds for Defense</HD>
<DH>Security: A Los Feliz assemblyman will propose raising funds to be
used by police and fire departments to meet the threat of terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>

</DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles lawmaker plans to introduce legislation today that
would allow California to float up to $500 million in "homeland defense
bonds" to help local police and fire departments protect the public from
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   With local governments now expected to spend hundreds of millions of
dollars dealing with the countless security concerns raised by the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, Democratic Assemblyman Dario Frommer (Los Feliz)
said the state should follow Washington's example and appeal to the
public.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Treasury Department has begun offering "Patriot Bonds" to
help the federal government raise money to fight terrorism, continuing a
long tradition of selling securities during wars and trying economic
times. With California facing new security demands at the same time it is
saddled with a $12-billion budget deficit, state officials should borrow
the concept, Frommer said.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a sense of patriotism right now, of supporting the home
front," said Frommer, who will unveil his legislation today at a news
conference in Burbank with Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and other
law enforcement leaders. "I have spoken to a lot of people in my district
about this, and I have gotten a positive response."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement groups had been pushing a ballot measure to raise
sales taxes by one-quarter of a cent to assist police and fire
departments. That effort fizzled last week, however, and some of the
groups are getting behind Frommer's effort, which would also have to be
approved by voters. Frommer said he aims to place the proposal on the
November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Frommer has met with state Treasurer Phil Angelides, whose office
would administer the bond sale, and is still developing the details of
the proposal. Unlike proceeds from the federal bonds, which can be used
for any purpose, the state bonds would have to benefit police and fire
departments, emergency medical services, and other government departments
that face new fiscal challenges due to the terrorism threat.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides would be permitted to sell up to $500 million in bonds. They
would earn 90% of the yield of five-year Treasury securities, which is
currently about 4%.</TE>

<HD>Davis Proposal to Defray Deficit Called Costly</HD>
<DH>Budget: Critics say delay in funding state employees' and teachers'
retirement funds could cost taxpayers $10 billion over 30 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' proposal to pare $1.9 billion from the state's
budget deficit by delaying pension payments to state employees and
teachers could cost Californians more than $10 billion over the next 30
years, administration officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In his proposed $100-billion budget, Davis offers a series of loans,
cuts and other maneuvers in what he characterizes as a "balanced"
spending plan for the fiscal year beginning July 1. One of his proposals
to narrow the $12.5-billion deficit would have the Legislature skip
payments for a year to the California Public Employee Retirement System,
and for two years to the State Teachers Retirement System.</LD>
<LD>   That proposal is designed to help Davis avoid raising taxes and
cutting more deeply into programs in an election year. But the ultimate
cost in interest and other payments is so steep that Davis administration
officials hope to find less costly alternatives.</LD>
<TE>   "If we can find something that's cheaper, we're interested in doing
that," Department of Finance Director Timothy Gage said.</TE>
<TE>   Agreements struck with pension fund managers allow the administration
to shelve the idea if Davis can find another solution by May--and some
state lawmakers are urging that Davis do so.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the political equivalent of a payday loan," said Senate
Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga. "We think it is a
horrible idea. If you're born today, and you enter the work force 25
years from now, the taxes you pay will go to pay off Gray Davis' 2002
budget."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine), the leading Republican on the
Assembly Budget Committee, predicted that the proposal will die: "It is
very expensive and it is messing in retirement systems. That has a
political stigma."</TE>
<TE>   Davis proposes to skip $948 million in payments into the $97-billion
teachers' pension fund starting in April and continuing for two years.
The state would defer for a year an additional $1.02 billion in payments
into the public employees pension fund, the nation's largest pension fund
at $146 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Managers of the state employee pension fund agreed to a deal in which
the state pays what amounts to an interest rate of 8.25% starting in 2004
for the money. The rate reflects the pension funds' average annual return
on investments.</TE>
<TE>   Another sweetener for the fund managers is Davis' proposal to boost
cost of living increases in pension benefits for current and retired
state employees. He wants the state to grant annual increases equal to
80% of future inflation, rather than the current 75% level.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Department of Finance, the cost of skipping $1.029
billion in state employee pension payments would be $6.93 billion over 30
years. Delaying the $948 million in payments to the teachers'
pension--including an 8% rate of return, plus other improvements in the
retirement plan--would cost $3.42 billion over the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Morgenstern, who heads the state Department of Personnel
Management and sits on the board that oversees the state employees'
pension fund, said the long-term cost "gives you pause, except that is
the cost of money. It is like buying a house. Thirty years from now that
amount of money will not be that much."</TE>
<TE>   The deal also affords the state "a nice opportunity . . . to provide
retirees with some retirement protection" by raising their potential cost
of living bumps, Morgenstern said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Controller Kathleen Connell, a member of the boards that
oversee the pension funds, denounced the 8.25% interest rate as
"usurious." She said the state could reduce its costs significantly by
simply borrowing elsewhere for a shorter period, as little as a year.</TE>
<TE>   Given the funds' health, pension checks would not be threatened under
the proposal, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   However, two unions have sued the state employees' pension fund. The
suits allege that the board failed to give the public adequate notice
before approving the proposal last month.</TE>
<TE>   Other governors facing budget deficits have borrowed from pension
funds--and unions have sued. Courts have ruled that the state can borrow
from the funds so long as current and retired employees get commensurate
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   State employees' unions have been among Davis' strongest political
supporters. But in recent months, as the Democratic governor has balked
at granting significant pay hikes to at least some state workers,
relations have become strained.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to hurt the governor," said Perry Kenny, president
of the 140,000-member California State Employees Assn., which has sued.
"We're just trying to get the best for our members."</TE>

<HD>Judge Denies Separate Trials for Dog Owners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>A judge refused to order separate trials for the lawyer couple
accused in last year's fatal dog mauling of Diane Whipple and left open
the possibility that sex-related material could be introduced at their
trial in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a classic case for a joint trial," Judge James L. Warren said
Tuesday in issuing his ruling.</LD>
<LD>   Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel, who had sought the separate trials,
face charges of involuntary manslaughter and keeping a vicious dog.
Knoller also is charged with second-degree murder in the Jan. 26, 2001,
death of the college lacrosse coach.</LD>
<TE>   Jury selection is to begin Jan. 24 in Los Angeles, where the case was
moved because Warren feared a pool of impartial jurors could not be found
in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Warren ruled that sex-related testimony would only be relevant and
allowed at the trial if the prosecution can prove it was connected to the
dogs' behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is sex that is relevant in this case, either with dogs or
humans, it would be scrutinized outside the presence of the media," the
judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the couple had asked that sex-related material be
omitted from their trial.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Jim Hammer said Knoller testified to a grand jury in March
that Bane, the male dog responsible for the attack, "put his head in Miss
Whipple's crotch."</TE>
<TE>   Hammer said Monday that "any evidence, if it exists, regarding any
inappropriate sexual conduct by the dogs" would be relevant at trial and
should not be excluded.</TE>
<TE>   Nedra Ruiz, Knoller's lawyer, vehemently denied any evidence of
inappropriate sexual activity between her client and the dogs. She said
the only sex-related incident with the dogs, Bane and Hera, happened when
the animals barged into Knoller and Noel's bedroom while they were having
sex.</TE>

<HD>Julie Kohl, 98; Owner of Diners Near USC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Julie Kohl, who endeared herself to generations of USC students and
Coliseum fans with her two eateries near campus, Julie's Trojan Barrel
and Julie's Restaurant, has died. She was 98.</LD>
<LD>   Kohl, one of the first women restaurateurs in the city, died Monday in
the Los Angeles rest home where she had lived for the last four months.
She had suffered a number of mild strokes in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   A native Angeleno, Kohl owned the Trojan Barrel on Figueroa Street
from 1975 until it closed in 1999. But it never quite matched the
popularity-or generated the lore-of her original Julie's Restaurant a
block away at 37th and Flower streets.</LD>
<TE>   From 1941 to 1975, Kohl played hostess at Julie's to everyone from Bob
Hope to Ronald Reagan and countless other sports fans either heading to
or coming from the Los Angeles Coliseum, which over the years was home to
USC football, UCLA football and NFL football with the Rams and Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   "She knew everybody-and to know her was to love her," friend Anne
Linehan said. "She just always greeted her guests like they were coming
to her home instead of to her restaurant.'</TE>
<TE>   Those guests included several generations of USC students, faculty and
administrators who were her steady and loyal customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The old saying at SC was, 'Meet me at Julie's,"' said Chris Petcoff,
who first ate at the restaurant in 1961 and became a close friend of
Kohl.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great Trojan atmosphere, just a very upbeat place to go,"
said Art Bartner, director of the Trojan marching band.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl filled her restaurant with framed pictures that provided a
virtual history of USC athletics.</TE>
<TE>   Julie's was also known for outdoor tables around a swimming pool,
whose presence no one seems to be able to explain.</TE>
<TE>   "There were USC boys who had too much to drink and fell in there,"
Petcoff said. "Boy, she really kicked them out of there, but they all
loved her.'</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, USC basketball Coach Stan Morrison promised to do a
cannonball from the roof into the pool fully clothed if the Trojans got
into the NCAA playoffs. Morrison ultimately had to come through on his
promise.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl was said to have known every USC coach since 1941. John McKay,
football coach from 1960 to 1975, became a close friend.</TE>
<TE>   McKay always held court at booth No. 1, where he plotted plays and
gabbed with his coaching staff and any reporter who pulled up a chair.
When McKay left to coach the NFL Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Kohl had his booth
dismantled and shipped to Tampa Bay, where it was installed in his new
restaurant hangout.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of a watering hole for us," said Marv Goux, who first
went to Julie's Restaurant as a USC football player in the 1950s and
continued the habit as an assistant coach at USC from 1957 to 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "The [McKay] booth was always reserved for us," Goux said. "People
would come in and say, 'Why can't I have that one?' Julie would say, 'No
one ever gets that one.' She was great. She loved the University of
Southern California.'</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of French immigrants, Kohl was born on North Broadway on
the edge of Chinatown. Her father, Casimir Mazet, owned the Parisian
Bakery on Ord Street. As a child, Kohl helped deliver bread to
restaurants with her father, who later became a partner in the
Franco-American Bakery.</TE>
<TE>   As a young woman, according to Linehan, Kohl was something of a
socialite who spent time traveling in Europe. In 1932, her father
purchased land near the Coliseum to set up food and souvenir stands to
cash in on the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "He contacted his daughter and said, 'You get home here because you're
going to help me,' " said Lineman. "He set up a hot dog stand and she ran
that.'</TE>
<TE>   A 1998 story on Kohl in the monthly magazine of the Jonathan Club in
downtown Los Angeles said Kohl once worked as a hostess and secretary at
a local restaurant. When it closed, her father suggested she go into
business for herself.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to him, 'What do I know about food? I'm a front-of-the-house
person,"' Kohl said in the 1998 story.</TE>
<TE>   Her father suggested she turn an empty building on property he owned
on Figueroa near Exposition Boulevard into a restaurant called Julie's.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-four years later in 1975, Kohl decided to cut down on her
workload, leased out Julie's and opened the nearby Trojan Barrel.</TE>
<TE>   Bartner, the USC marching band director, was among the old regulars
who followed her to the new location. A member of the USC marching band's
support group, Kohl for years donated money for band scholarships. In
1995, she donated $100,000 for the university's new band facility, which
is known as the Julie Kohl Band Facility.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, she donated the 1.45 acres that housed Julie's Restaurant,
then valued at $750,000. Over the next 14 years, she donated nearly
$500,000 to the university, including gifts to the USC Norris
Comprehensive Cancer Center.</TE>
<TE>   Until last year, Kohl never missed a USC home game, and her loyalty
did not go unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   Since she turned 90, she always received a birthday present from the
USC athletic department: a football jersey bearing her age in giant
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, she was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl, who was married four times, had no children.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral Mass will be said at 12:30 p.m. Saturday at Calvary
Mortuary, 4201 Whittier Blvd., Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Arne Larsson, 86; Had First PacemakerFrom Associated Press</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>STOCKHOLM
</DL>
<LD>Arne Larsson, a Swedish heart patient who received the first
implanted pacemaker more than 40 years ago, has died at 86.</LD>
<LD>   Larsson died Dec. 28 of skin cancer at his home in the Stockholm
suburb of Saltsjoe-Duvnaes, his wife, Else-Marie, said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Prepared to die in 1958, Larsson always credited his persistent wife
and the pioneering spirit of his doctors for what he called his "new
life.'</LD>
<TE>   "He knew that without the pacemaker, he would have died when he was 43
years old," Else-Marie Larsson said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Arne Larsson's operation on Oct. 8, 1958 in Stockholm was done to
treat a heart block condition known as Stokes-Adams syndrome, which slows
the heartbeat and decreases blood flow to the brain.</TE>
<TE>   The pacemaker was implanted by Dr. Ake Senning, a cardiac surgeon, and
developed by Dr. Rune Elmqvist, a medical device engineer. It used two
transistors and was the size of a hockey puck.</TE>
<TE>   The device used tiny shocks to return Larsson's heart to 70 beats per
minute. But within five hours, the history-making pacemaker stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Senning implanted a second pacemaker that Elmqvist had built, and
Larsson was out of the hospital within two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The operation sparked a moral debate on whether mechanical devices
should be placed in the human body to sustain life.</TE>
<TE>   "We were more realistic about how thin the thread is between life and
death," Else-Marie Larsson said of her husband. "His love for life was to
the end.'</TE>
<TE>   Larsson became ill in 1956, after contracting hepatitis from eating
tainted oysters. His health problems developed into Stokes-Adams
syndrome, a condition that decreases blood flow to the brain. There was
no cure.</TE>
<TE>   As he suffered daily convulsions and losses of consciousness, his wife
learned of a machine that could control a patient's heartbeat. She went
to her husband's surgeon with the information.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife attacked the doctor night and day. She said, 'Doctors, you
must do something.' At last they say, 'What can we do?"' Larsson recalled
in 1998 during a visit to St. Jude Medical in Minnesota, which took over
the Swedish company that made the first implantable pacemaker.</TE>
<TE>   Since his first operation, Larsson had received 26 pacemakers but led
an active life and appeared at many clinical meetings as an ambassador
for the pacemaker industry.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 8, 1998, Larsson rang the closing bell at the New York Stock
Exchange to commemorate the 40th anniversary of his implant.</TE>
<TE>   Pacemaker technology has advanced dramatically since the first
implant. Current devices are as small as a half dollar and use computer
technology, advanced sensors and the equivalent of up to 500,000
transistors. Pacemakers are prescribed by physicians to more than 500,000
patients worldwide each year, according to St. Jude Medical, which is
based in suburban St. Paul.</TE>
<TE>   "Arne's life was saved and an industry that now provides
life-enhancing technology to millions of people around the world began on
that day," said Terry Shepherd, St. Jude's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Larsson is survived by his wife; their two children, Bjoern and MaLou;
and six grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral is scheduled for Jan. 29.</TE>

<HD>Jeanne Voltz, 81; Past Editor of Times' Food Section</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeanne Voltz, a pioneering newspaper food editor, died Monday of
pneumonia at the University of North Carolina hospital in Chapel Hill.
She was 81 and had been living in Pittsboro, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   Voltz was food editor at the Los Angeles Times from 1960 to 1973,
coming to the paper from the Miami Herald, where she had worked since
1947. Voltz left The Times to become food editor of Woman's Day magazine,
a job she held until her retirement in 1984.</LD>
<LD>   She was one of the first newspaper food editors of the modern era,
when the sections were edited by journalists rather than by the
advertising department. But Voltz had to be convinced to take the job.</LD>
<TE>   A feature writer for the Birmingham News and Mobile Press-Register,
when she got to the Herald she was pushed in the direction of the women's
pages. "I didn't want to do clubs and I certainly didn't want to do
society and fashion," she once told a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "They had decided food was big news. They had figured out women were
the ones who decided what to subscribe to.'</TE>
<TE>   Voltz wrote nine cookbooks, including "The Los Angeles Times Natural
Food Cookbook" in 1973 and "The L.A. Gourmet: Favorite Recipes from
Famous Los Angeles Restaurants," co-written with Burks Hamner and
published in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, she wrote "Barbecued Ribs, Smoked Butts and Other Great
Feeds," which was named one of the best cookbooks of the year in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Collinsville, Ala., in the last several years she had become
active in the Society for the Preservation of Southern Food and was an
advocate for her native cuisine. Her last book was "The Country Ham
Book," published in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "The South has the kind of climate that grows certain things the way
no other place in the country does," she once said. "I've worked in Los
Angeles and New York, but you can't ever get away from grits and greens.'</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her children, Jeanne M. Voltz, a food stylist in
New York, and Luther Manship Voltz, a Woodland Hills software engineer.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Talib Is Charged With Conspiracy</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Ashcroft decides, for now, against treason. The
Californian could face a life term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department said Tuesday that it has charged the
American Taliban prisoner captured in Afghanistan with conspiracy to kill
U.S. citizens and providing aid to terrorists. If convicted, he faces
life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft decided--for now--not to charge John Walker
Lindh with treason--which would carry a possible death sentence. Debate
over how to charge Lindh has reverberated through the Bush administration
and across radio call-in shows nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   But Ashcroft held out the possibility that Lindh, 20, could still face
treason charges, and he rejected assertions from Lindh's family and
supporters who portrayed him as a misguided youth who was tragically
brainwashed by Taliban forces in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   "Youth is not absolution for treachery, and personal self-discovery is
not an excuse to take up arms against one's country," Ashcroft said at a
news conference. "Misdirected Americans cannot seek direction in
murderous ideologies and expect to avoid the consequences."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued after the government's announcement, a lawyer
hired by Lindh's family noted that Lindh had not been given access to
legal counsel. Still, attorney George C. Harris said, "We are going to do
everything in our power to make sure that John has a fair trial."</TE>
<TE>   Under a criminal complaint filed Tuesday, Lindh faces charges of
conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens overseas--specifically soldiers in the
war in Afghanistan; providing material support to separate foreign
terrorist groups; and engaging in prohibited transactions with the
Taliban. The conspiracy charge carries a possible life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh--who in the past has used his mother's maiden name,
Walker--which is the name used in court documents--is to be transported
to Virginia to stand trial. The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court
in Virginia, suggests that much of the evidence against him comes from
his own words. Lindh voluntarily provided new and extensive details of
his service with the Taliban in two days of FBI interviews last month
after he and fellow Taliban soldiers surrendered to Northern Alliance
forces in Afghanistan, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's own statements make clear, Ashcroft said, that the young man
made conscious, repeated decisions to fight with and support the Taliban
and Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after he ventured off from California
to Pakistan in late 2000 to study Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh told investigators that, while training at an Al Qaeda terrorist
camp in Afghanistan last year, he met with Bin Laden, who "thanked him
for taking part in jihad" against Americans around the world, Ashcroft
said. Once his training was completed, he requested to "go to the front
lines to fight" with the Taliban, according to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Even after he learned of Al Qaeda's role in the Sept. 11 attacks,
Lindh--armed with an AKM rifle--allegedly remained with his Taliban
fighting group in an unsuccessful effort to maintain their position in
Takhar against Northern Alliance attacks.</TE>
<TE>   He and fellow Taliban soldiers ultimately surrendered to Northern
Alliance forces, and Lindh--identifying himself as a Pakistani--was
questioned around Nov. 25 by CIA agent Johnny M. Spann, who was
subsequently killed in a violent uprising by the imprisoned Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Television footage of Lindh--wounded, disheveled and imprisoned with
his fellow Taliban soldiers--riveted Americans and set off vigorous
debate about his future.</TE>
<TE>   What could have triggered a shy, bookish youth from the Bay Area--once
enthralled by hip-hop music before he discovered Islam at a mosque near
his home--to take up arms against his country? And what should be done
with him now?</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's fate has provoked fierce debate on radio call-in shows and
galvanized public opinion, with various polls showing as many as 59%
saying he should be tried for treason and face the death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials within the White House reportedly favored treason
charges against Lindh, but Ashcroft noted Tuesday that such a charge
carries a "high evidentiary burden." The Constitution requires either a
confession in open court or the testimony of at least two witnesses to an
"overt" act of treason in order to prove the capital offense.</TE>
<TE>   The treason charge in Lindh's case would probably have required
corroborating testimony from either fellow Taliban soldiers or from U.S.
soldiers who witnessed his conduct, said a Justice Department official
familiar with Ashcroft's deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   "Either way, that particular burden would require some work that
hasn't been done yet," the official said. "I don't think it was really a
close call."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft, asked if he foresaw bringing future treason charges against
Lindh, said that 'if additional evidence is developed that would provide
a basis for other charges . . . then we would be free to bring other
charges against him."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said Lindh became a willing, even eager participant in a
terrorism enterprise, embracing the Taliban's anti-American cause and
training in weapons, explosives and battlefield combat during his weeks
in two separate camps.</TE>
<TE>   "John Walker chose to fight with the Taliban, chose to train with Al
Qaeda and to be led by Osama bin Laden," Ashcroft said. "We may never
know why he turned his back on his country . . . but we cannot ignore
that he did."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh has been held in military custody aboard a U.S. Navy ship in the
Arabian Sea. Although authorities would not disclose his whereabouts
Tuesday, they said he is being transferred to FBI custody. No date has
been set for his arraignment.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh is to be tried in a civilian federal court in Alexandria, Va.--a
departure from President Bush's plan to try terrorists and their
supporters in military tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Bush issued a directive allowing the government to use
the special military courts to try suspected terrorists who are not U.S.
citizens and are captured in the United States or overseas. But the plan
was roundly criticized for being too broad in scope, and the
administration has now opted against using military tribunals for two
high-profile defendants--Zacarias Moussaoui, suspected of being the
thwarted "20th hijacker," and Lindh. Some argued that he effectively
renounced his citizenship by joining the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Bush "is supportive of the process put in place. He is confident that
the process will end in justice," White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer said Tuesday after the charges were announced.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, also praised Ashcroft's handling of what he called a
"difficult and complex" case. "Like every American, I was appalled that
someone from our country would join and fight with an organization as
repulsive and repressive as the Taliban." He urged Lindh to cooperate
further with the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   But some civil liberties and defense litigation groups challenged the
charges against Lindh and said the administration may have a tough time
proving them in court.</TE>
<TE>   Elisa Massimino, Washington director for the Lawyers Committee for
Human Rights, said a good defense would be to challenge whether Lindh
gave his statements to the FBI voluntarily, as authorities maintained
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said Lindh, when questioned by the FBI aboard a military
ship, was read his Miranda rights, waived his right to an attorney both
orally and in a signed document and spoke freely with investigators.</TE>
<TE>   But Massimino said: "Here you've got a guy who is being held on a
military ship by hundreds of personnel who view him as the enemy. It's
difficult to imagine that a waiver to a right to counsel in that
situation was really voluntary. . . . That will be a primary focus at his
trial."</TE>
<TE>   Other legal experts said it would be difficult for Lindh's lawyers to
convince a court to exclude his statements to the FBI on the grounds that
they were made involuntarily.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very rare that defendants get confessions thrown out as
involuntary," said Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson, a former
federal prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "No court will be eager to throw out the evidence against Walker,"
Levenson added. On the other hand, she said, if the defense lawyers
develop evidence that Walker was tortured or under the influence of
drugs, they might be able to mount a good argument for excluding the
damaging statements.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Mark Geragos, who represented Whitewater figure Susan
McDougal, agreed that it would be a "very tough challenge" to get the
statements thrown out, but said Lindh's lawyers have to try.</TE>
<TE>   "I would imagine that would be one of the keys to the case," since
Lindh's "own statements could be the most devastating evidence against
him," Geragos said.</TE>
<TE>   Both Geragos and Levenson said it was noteworthy that the government
is not seeking the death penalty against Lindh.</TE>
<TE>   "Strategically that was a good move by the government," Levenson said.
"Although the jurors will still look at the evidence closely, it takes
away the sympathy factor" that could be invoked by Lindh's lawyers if
their client faced death if convicted.</TE>

<HD>Last Tango in Cyprus</HD>
<DH>The leaders of the Mediterranean island's Greek and Turkish sectors
are resuming talks in what many see as two wily old foes' final attempt
at compromise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NICOSIA, Cyprus
</DL>
<LD>One is 82, the other 77. They met as opposing lawyers in a string
of terrorist trials nearly half a century ago and have grown old trying
to outfox each other in one of the world's most intractable armed
standoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Their common obsession has spawned a respectful but wary friendship.
They have no doubt spent more time conversing than many married couples
do, and their periodic estrangement has been punctuated by jovial barbs,
traded through the media, about each other's advancing girth and age.</LD>
<LD>   Over the decades, the bantering, backslapping chemistry between
Glafcos Clerides, Greek Cypriot president of the internationally
recognized government of Cyprus, and Rauf R. Denktash, his younger
Turkish Cypriot counterpart, has become a legendary counterpoint to their
chronic failure to negotiate an end to the 38-year-old conflict.</LD>
<TE>   But faced with growing outside pressure and a one-year deadline, the
two men have opened a new round of contacts that is viewed as their last
and most promising effort to bridge the Mediterranean island's rigid
ethnic partition.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is Denktash's claim--recognized only by Turkey and enforced
by about 35,000 Turkish troops--to rule the Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus on one-third of the island. Asserting sovereignty over all of
Cyprus, Clerides' government insists on reunification in exchange for a
wide measure of local autonomy for the Turkish Cypriots, who are
outnumbered 3 to 1 by the far wealthier Greek Cypriots.</TE>
<TE>   Face to face for the first time in four years, Clerides and Denktash
met Dec. 4 in the U.N.-controlled buffer zone that has separated their
parts of the island since 1974. They agreed to resume formal negotiations
there today in the presence of U.N. envoy Alvaro de Soto.</TE>
<TE>   Later in December, each leader crossed the cease-fire line for the
first time since 1975 and dined as a guest at the other's home. They met
again informally Friday to discuss how to search for the bodies of more
than 2,200 people who disappeared in ethnic fighting in the 1960s and
'70s.</TE>
<TE>   The men, who call each other by their first names, are treating each
step with a sense of urgency.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as Clerides and myself are concerned, I think this is the last
tango," Denktash said in a recent interview, noting that his rival is not
expected to seek reelection early next year. "We cannot waste this
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   "They know each other so well that there can be no tricks," said Greek
Cypriot government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou. "If Denktash will be a
little reasonable, we can reach a solution, because Clerides means
business."</TE>
<TE>   The new talks are being driven by an expected vote next December on
Cyprus' bid to join the European Union and by hopes that EU membership
can bring prosperity to both parts of the island if a rapprochement comes
first.</TE>
<TE>   As that deadline looms, each Cypriot leader is sounding eager to
supplant his legacy as co-perpetrator of the conflict with the image of a
peacemaker.</TE>
<TE>A History of Negotiating</TE>
<TE>   Denktash was the Turkish Cypriot community leader and Clerides
president of Cyprus' House of Representatives when ethnic violence
erupted in December 1963, three years after independence from Britain.
They were chief negotiators during the explosive year 1974, when Greece's
military junta sponsored a coup that aimed to make Cyprus part of Greece,
prompting a Turkish military invasion that left 6,700 people dead or
missing and a total of 215,000 displaced on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   The two British-trained lawyers go way back. In the 1950s, Clerides
was a defense attorney for accused terrorists of EOKA, which resisted
British rule. Denktash, who helped found a Turkish Cypriot paramilitary
group to counter EOKA, was a prosecutor for the colonial administration.</TE>
<TE>   Clerides lost those trials but not respect for his adversary. In 1964,
he ventured into Nicosia's embattled Turkish quarter to drive Denktash's
wife and children to the airport and get them safely aboard a flight to
Turkey. Later that year, with Denktash under arrest, Clerides says he got
wind of a plan to have the prisoner "shot while escaping" and helped win
his safe release.</TE>
<TE>   The Greek Cypriot leader's four-volume memoir, "Cyprus: My
Deposition," is tinged with regret for his failure in the early 1970s to
persuade then-President Makarios to restore the autonomy that Turkish
Cypriots had lost in 1963. That, Clerides writes, would have prevented
the island's violent partition.</TE>
<TE>   Hope for a Cyprus accord has long been based on a belief that Clerides
is driven to reverse the disastrous result of that miscalculation and
that Denktash is equally determined to end the poverty and international
isolation of his self-proclaimed ministate. But their decades of talks
have frustrated a who's who of statesmen, from Henry Kissinger to Kofi
Annan.</TE>
<TE>   One problem is Denktash's distrust of the United Nations, which is
committed to reunifying Cyprus. The two Cypriots negotiate in English,
but Denktash once switched to his rudimentary Greek to urge Clerides to
shut Boutros Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian who was then U.N.
secretary-general, out of the room and continue mano a mano without "this
Arab who is trying to cheat us both."</TE>
<TE>   Their negotiations can get downright comic. Years ago, Clerides tuned
out a Denktash harangue and, to underline his indifference, pulled a
camera out of his bag and spent several minutes trying clumsily to insert
a roll of film. Denktash, a superb photographer, walked over, grabbed the
camera, quickly loaded it, gave some terse pointers on how to use it and
went back to his fiery speech.</TE>
<TE>   The hopes of two generations of Cypriots have risen and fallen on the
two men's smallest gestures and perceived slights.</TE>
<TE>   Denktash refused for months to use a U.N.-installed hotline because he
mistakenly thought the Greek Cypriot leader had plugged the phone in
beside his toilet. Denktash did call with condolences for the recent
death of Clerides' brother. And when Clerides' daughter got married, a
piece of wedding cake was dispatched across the buffer zone to the
Denktash residence.</TE>
<TE>   "They get along famously and are similar in many ways, but Denktash
feels intellectually superior to Clerides, a bit disdainful," says a
former international mediator who requested anonymity. "And Clerides
feels a certain bitterness that Denktash has not been more accommodating
to someone who helped get him out of jail."</TE>
<TE>   But the Cyprus dispute transcends their colorful personalities and
reflects more the ancient religious, political and ethnic differences
between the island's ancestral motherlands, Greece and Turkey. Both of
these are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and tensions
between them have put a strain on the U.S.-led alliance.</TE>
<TE>   The two countries, which went to the brink of war six years ago, have
been at loggerheads over the EU's expected admission of Cyprus under the
Clerides government.</TE>
<TE>   As long as the island remains partitioned, EU membership would bring
economic benefits only to the Greek Cypriot side. Turkey last year
threatened, in that event, to annex the Turkish Cypriot region--a step
that would dim Turkey's own hopes of joining the union. Greece, in turn,
warned that Cyprus must be allowed to join the EU with or without a
settlement and said it would use its power as a member to veto nine other
EU candidates, all from Eastern Europe, if Cyprus was kept out.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Greece and Turkey have been pressing their ethnic kin
on Cyprus to be more flexible and strike a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Denktash is hearing that message not only from his allies in the
Turkish government and military but also from a growing number of
Cypriots in the north who are fed up with the presence of Turkish troops
and the fallout from Turkey's prolonged financial crisis.</TE>
<TE>   European diplomats say that any accord would probably include the
return of some Turkish-occupied territory to Greek Cypriots and some
power-sharing deal for a central government that would control banking
and foreign relations island-wide. Greek and Turkish Cypriot regions
would continue to run their affairs, including local policing, while a
reduced number of Turkish troops would stay in the north as part of a
larger U.N. peacekeeping force.</TE>
<TE>Transition Period Key</TE>
<TE>   The key to an agreement, the diplomats say, would be the terms and
length of a transition period during which freedom to move across the
buffer zone and acquire property would be restricted for the sake of
avoiding renewed bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview at his presidential mansion on the old Venetian walls
of Nicosia, the capital, Denktash said that such freedoms should be
suspended for an indefinite period to prevent his people from being
overwhelmed.</TE>
<TE>   "Separation is necessary for our security," he said. "Here we have two
nations that were at each other's throats for so many years. You cannot
simply put these people together again. So compromise is absolutely
necessary. But how can you expect Mr. Clerides to compromise when the
whole world tells him that they are a full-fledged candidate for the EU?"</TE>
<TE>   Clerides, who declined to be interviewed while the contacts are
underway, told CNN's Turkish-language station in November: "We are happy
that we are going to join the EU, but we would be much happier if we can
find the solution and join without difficulties. We want a solution
urgently."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "We don't trust that one day Denktash is not going to walk
away and say, 'I am now a sovereign state.' We cannot accept any division
of Cyprus into two equal states."</TE>
<TE>   The two aging warhorses have been sparring like this for so long that
some wonder whether they have it in them to make a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "They love the game," said Mehmet Ali Birand, an Istanbul-based
Turkish commentator and columnist who has been covering Clerides-Denktash
talks since 1965. "They love exploiting each other's weaknesses and going
for the kill. They're so pleased when they score points. We're watching
two samurai going into their final fight.</TE>
<TE>   "But they are trapped," he said. "Whether they want it or not, they
may be pushed into a settlement. The expectations are extremely high."</TE>

<HD>World Press Tries to Unknot Tale of Bush and the Pretzel</HD>
<DH>Reaction: Some papers are skeptical or sarcastic. Others delve into
the history of the salty snack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Was it an Al Qaeda plot? An Enron end run? Or was it, as President
Bush said, just a wayward pretzel that briefly felled the leader of the
free world?</LD>
<LD>   With the only witnesses to the presidential fainting spell two
canines, the international press has been left to speculate about what
happened and whether Bush can watch TV and chew pretzels at the same
time.</LD>
<LD>   "George Bush attempted to taste the biscuit with his attention focused
on a football game--a combination of actions that, it appears, proved
difficult," said the Greek daily To Vima.</LD>
<TE>   The media responded to the pretzel pratfall with jokes, queries about
Bush's mental and physical health and detailed explanations of the
knotted American-style pretzel.</TE>
<TE>   "Though not to everyone's taste, they are not considered a health
hazard," London's Independent newspaper informed readers dryly.</TE>
<TE>   True to form, the Germans consulted pretzel experts, the French
contemplated Americans' "complicated relationship with food," and the
Italians looked to the religious roots of the pretzel. The Saudis worried
that the scare will prevent Bush from focusing attention on Israel's
oppression of the Palestinians, while Britons offered Bush a few
backhanded compliments.</TE>
<TE>   The incident proved Bush is "a man of the people," London's Daily
Telegraph said in an editorial. "This is exactly the sort of accident
that befalls Homer Simpson, night after night."</TE>
<TE>   The conservative paper noted in its news pages that the president "was
not eating something foreign or in any way fancy when he passed out." The
paper was cheered by the fact that the leader of the international war on
terrorism still has time for Sunday football. "He has shown himself, once
again, to be completely in tune with the tastes and instincts of the
people he leads," its editorial said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, most Americans didn't end up prone with facial bruises at
the end of the game--at least not from pretzels. The Independent labeled
the official story "Hard to Swallow."</TE>
<TE>   "Was he poisoned perhaps? Has the stress of fighting the war on
terrorism while fending off inquiries about the collapse of his friend
Ken Lay's Enron overwhelmed him? Was there maybe some family tiff?" the
paper asked in an editorial. It concluded that "the vanquisher of Al
Qaeda may have met his match."</TE>
<TE>   Germany's mass-circulation Bild, the daily of choice for blue-collar
Germans, also asked if there wasn't more to the story: "Has the
president's alcohol problem been taken up again?"</TE>
<TE>   Expressing concern for the president's health, Saudi Arabia's
English-language Arab News said that while no one believes there is
anything seriously wrong with Bush, his pretzel mishap has led to
speculation about the impact of an ailing president on the world.</TE>
<TE>   "These are particularly dangerous times internationally. The United
States has assumed considerable responsibilities and powers in its
campaign against global terrorism. In order to bring together a coalition
of support within the Arab world, the White House had to focus its
attention more constructively on Israel's oppression of the
Palestinians," the paper said in an editorial.</TE>
<TE>   "If, however, Bush's unusual collapse is a symptom of more serious
medical problems, we can be absolutely sure that, lacking any clear
direction from a troubled White House, Washington's foreign policy will
click back on its traditional Zionist track. Palestinians will continue
to choke on Israeli aggression while the U.S. president may again choke
on a typical Yiddish pretzel," it said.</TE>
<TE>   No, no, said the Italian press. The American-style pretzel was
invented by a 16th century German monk as a reward for children who
memorized their prayers, La Repubblica newspaper said. The word derives
from the Latin prex, or prize, it said.</TE>
<TE>   Leave it to the British tabloids to challenge the Italians on Latin.
London's Daily Mail declared that the word "pretzel" comes from
pretiola--Latin for "little reward." The dough is folded to look like a
child's arms in prayer, and the three holes represent Christianity's holy
Trinity. And it was German and Dutch immigrants who took the pretzel
across the Atlantic when they settled in Pennsylvania in 1710, the paper
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pretzel is brezel in Germany, where the Berliner Morgenpost sought out
the opinion of a master baker on the safety of the U.S. snack food--and
the likelihood that it could have caused the president's swoon.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no reason to doubt the quality of the American pretzel,"
opined Eberhard Groebel, speculating that Bush's spell was due to his
ignoring "the 50-gram rule." That is a German etiquette adage that holds
that one should not try to talk with more than 1.75 ounces of food in
one's mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in his wildest dreams, Osama bin Laden couldn't have managed
what one tiny pretzel did this weekend," began a story in the Berliner
Zeitung daily. "According to reports from the White House, it not only
brought the mightiest man in the world to his knees but flat out on the
floor."</TE>
<TE>   Spain's national daily, ABC, reported that after an exhaustive
investigation, the FBI, CIA and Secret Service had "rejected [the
possibility] that the biscuit in question came from Afghanistan and have
certified that it is a genuine American salted pretzel."</TE>
<TE>   Russian newspapers, perhaps reflecting the more somber tone of the
Vladimir V. Putin era, restrained themselves. The daily Komsomolskaya
Pravda ran a detailed diagram of Bush's anatomy, with the location of the
pretzel blockage marked with a star.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush's organism, although weakened and unconscious, managed to cope
with the indisposition," wrote the daily Gazeta. "The organism first
rejected the pretzel but later swallowed it and digested without mercy."</TE>
<TE>   Ah, but Bush shouldn't be overconfident, the French and British press
warned.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows that the most powerful man on Earth is, above all, a man,"
wrote the Lyons newspaper Le Progres. "And as a man, he is in danger of
digging his grave with his teeth. . . . Especially when he comes from a
society that obviously has a complicated relationship with food."</TE>
<TE>   Added London's Mirror tabloid: "Attila the Hun survived bloody battles
only to die of a nosebleed on his wedding night. Sir Francis Bacon wanted
to prove frozen food lasted longer and went outside to stuff a chicken
with snow. The experiment was a success, but he died of pneumonia."</TE>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' proposal to let state and local police obtain
roving wiretaps on suspected criminals was dropped from the legislation
containing it Tuesday after the legislative counsel's office concluded
that it was illegal.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, a centerpiece of Davis' State of the State address last
week, had been welcomed by some law enforcement leaders but criticized by
civil libertarians and some liberals.</LD>
<LD>   Davis unveiled the idea at the outset of a reelection bid in which he
faces challenges from three Republicans--former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan, Secretary of State Bill Jones and investor Bill Simon Jr.--each
vying for the GOP nomination to take on the Democratic incumbent.</LD>
<TE>   Asked to size up the chances of a roving-wiretap bill passing now,
Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) said: "I think none. There is
no opportunity, because whether the Legislature has the will or not, our
attorney is telling us it is moot because we lack the authority."</TE>
<TE>   Although aides to the governor challenged that interpretation, the
legislative counsel said that a state law authorizing roving wiretaps for
state and local prosecutors and police would exceed the authority federal
wiretapping law gives states, and would thus be invalid. President Bush
signed legislation in October that broadened federal wiretapping
abilities to target suspected terrorists, but that law did not expand
states' powers to allow roving wiretaps at the local level, the counsel
concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio acknowledged that Assemblyman Carl
Washington (D-Paramount) dropped roving wiretaps from his legislation
Tuesday after hearing the legal opinion, but said the Davis
administration would continue to work with the lawmaker, and may attempt
to have it reinstated later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Maviglio said the Davis administration contacted local district
attorneys and the Justice Department before making the proposal public,
and was informed it was within the state's powers.</TE>
<TE>   George Vinson, Davis' security advisor, added that changes to federal
law are still in flux, and that state lawmakers should eventually be able
to pass legislation this year permitting roving wiretaps on suspected
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   With conventional wiretaps, police must obtain a judge's order
authorizing them to listen in on a specific phone number. Roving wiretaps
allow them to follow a suspect from number to number.</TE>
<TE>   Vinson said the administration may agree to back an alternative
proposal that would would still require police to go to a judge any time
they wanted to expand their wiretap authority but would speed up that
process.</TE>
<TE>Legal Questions Only One of Plan's Problems</TE>
<TE>   Some constitutional authorities joined with the legislative counsel in
questioning Davis' approach. Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC professor of
constitutional law, said Davis appeared to have acted without the benefit
of careful legal analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The legal questions about Davis' wiretap proposal are only part of its
difficulties. It also has been criticized by civil libertarians and some
Democrats in the Assembly and Senate, who are wary of its proposed
expansion of police power. As a result, some lawmakers on Tuesday
predicted that the proposal is unlikely to become law.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Washington, who was carrying the measure sponsored by Los
Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley, and whose
bill Davis has seen as the best opportunity for expanded wiretap
authority--had to pare back his bill just to get it out of the Public
Safety Committee, which he chairs.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's bill, AB 74, initially would have allowed state and local
authorities to obtain roving wiretaps through state courts, and also
would have allowed them to conduct surveillance on e-mail and Internet
communications.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement leaders argue that wiretap laws have failed to keep up
with technology, and that criminals can now sidestep surveillance by
switching mobile phones and using e-mail and Internet chat rooms to
communicate. A roving wiretap would allow police to keep up with the
times and the criminals, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities must now obtain court orders to tap specific phone
numbers, which they say puts them at a disadvantage in an age when
criminals can buy cheap prepaid cell phones at convenience stores.</TE>
<TE>   "The world of terrorism in terms of criminal planning and strategizing
has clearly shown law enforcement that these people are pretty clever,"
Baca said in an interview. "They will use one cell phone, turn it off,
come back with another phone, turn that one off . . . conducting their
transactions on dozens of mobile phones. Our current system prevents us
from following that conversation without going back into court."</TE>
<TE>   Roving wiretaps and e-mail surveillance have come under fire, however,
since Davis proposed them last week. It was because of that criticism
that Washington requested the legal opinion from the legislative counsel.
Once he received it, he announced that his bill would no longer authorize
roving wiretaps.</TE>
<TE>   Several lawmakers also objected to the provisions of Washington's bill
that would extend wiretapping to e-mail and the Internet, arguing that
the privacy of countless innocent people would be infringed. Washington
then scratched those sections from his measure as well.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Keeley was among those who raised doubts about the idea of
police and prosecutors screening e-mail. During a spirited committee
hearing, he questioned the prosecutors and police who supported that
proposal, and they conceded that they were still developing ways to
screen e-mail without unduly intruding on personal privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the types of scattershot investigative tools that result in
the widespread loss of personal privacy," said Francisco Lobaco of the
American Civil Liberties Union, which opposed the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Having pared back his legislation Tuesday, Washington's bill now would
only slightly expand local wiretapping powers to target suspected
terrorists planning to use anthrax or other "weapons of mass
destruction." Its main purpose is to allow local police and prosecutors
to continue to obtain wiretaps beyond next year, when their power to do
so under state law is set to expire.</TE>
<TE>Slight Expansion Is All Most Lawmakers Expect</TE>
<TE>   Such a law, several lawmakers said, is as strong as is likely to pass
in the Capitol this year, particularly after the counsel's office
opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky called the legislative counsel's analysis a "very strong
opinion" showing that state and local governments cannot engage in
wiretapping except as permitted by federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky and others have questioned the need for expanded state
wiretapping powers, noting that local authorities can already partner
with the federal government to conduct surveillance on suspected
terrorists if needed.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report by the state Department of Justice showed that
California law enforcement requested 88 wiretap orders in 2000. Judges
granted every request.</TE>
<TE>   The wiretaps cost an average of $56,767 and resulted in the arrests of
271 people. Of those, 17 were convicted. Most were used in drug
investigations and involved home phones, cellular phones and pagers.</TE>

<HD>Memo Warned of Enron's Setup Being Seen as 'Hoax'</HD>
<DH>Probe: Full text suggests that a senior executive was not telling
Kenneth Lay anything new. She ridicules accounting procedures and
forecasts the company's collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>A detailed road map of Enron Corp.'s aggressive accounting
maneuvers and an uncannily accurate prediction of the company's collapse
were laid before Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in August in a lengthy
memo that became public Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Excerpts of the memo had been released by congressional investigators
Monday, but the full extent of the warnings became known only Tuesday
with the release of the entire text.</LD>
<LD>   The author of the memo, Sherron Watkins, 42, expressed concern that
the company's vaunted business success would eventually become considered
"nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax." Watkins, a vice president of
corporate development at Enron, worked directly under the architect of
Enron's complex and highly questionable financial dealings.</LD>
<TE>   Watkins focused particularly on what were known as the "Raptor"
transactions, in which Enron transferred several marginal investments to
a putatively independent partnership. The partnership had gone virtually
bankrupt by last summer, but Enron still was not disclosing the loss to
shareholders, Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   The full text suggests that Watkins did not believe she was telling
Lay much that he did not already know--and that many of the company's
financial transactions were mere accounting shams.</TE>
<TE>   She attempted to persuade Lay either to reverse the offending
transactions promptly or to disclose them fully to shareholders and
"develop damage containment plans." Lay did neither.</TE>
<TE>   "Her motivation is not vindication or being proven right or bringing
down the company," her husband, Richard, said Tuesday from the family
home in Houston. "She's a team player."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins went to work at Enron Tuesday morning as news of her memo was
splashed across the front pages.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a normal day," said her lawyer, Philip Hilder, although he
acknowledged that "it's very difficult for anybody to go to work under
these circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins has suffered no retaliation from anyone at the company, the
lawyer said, although a source close to her said Watkins has been made to
feel "an outcast."</TE>
<TE>   Sherron Watkins, the daughter of two secondary school educators, grew
up in the distant Houston suburb of Tomball and graduated from the
University of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday morning, television news trucks jammed the street in front of
the Watkins home. Later that day, Richard Watkins praised his wife for
doing "something quite courageous. She has the strength of her
convictions. But she's very vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor said the hint of moral indignation in Watkins' memo to Lay
was genuine.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly she thought it was her moral and professional duty to do what
she did," said Carrie Wood, who also was Watkins' sorority sister at UT.
"Sherron was drawn to the dynamic intellectual challenge of being an
Enron vice president. I don't think she was drawn to the materialistic
greed that sprang out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Word of Enron's accounting irregularities leaked out slowly during the
fall, depressing the company's already-dropping stock price. Its
businesses destroyed and its reputation in tatters, Enron finally filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins wrote her memo on the heels of the surprise resignation Aug.
14 of Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling. The corporate
announcement of Skilling's departure ascribed it to "personal reasons."</TE>
<TE>   But to Watkins and others inside the company, the move hinted at his
deep unease at the accounting irregularities and presaged a difficult
period of public scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he . . . looked down the road and knew this stuff was
unfixable, and would rather abandon ship now than resign in shame in 2
years," she wrote to Lay. Moreover, she warned, "the probability of
discovery significantly increased with Skillings's shocking departure.
Too many people are looking for a smoking gun."</TE>
<TE>   Many of Enron's financial maneuvers would not bear that scrutiny, she
said, even though they had been formally approved byEnron's outside
auditor, Andersen, formerly known as Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>'We're Such a Crooked Company'</TE>
<TE>   This particularly applied to deals Enron had made with LJM, a
partnership that had been set up to trade with Enron and was managed by
Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. The goal was to move debt
and other liabilities off Enron's books, where they would have a negative
effect on the company's financial picture, and park them with a
putatively independent company. As long as these liabilities remained
secret, Enron's reputation, and its stock price, remained buoyant.</TE>
<TE>   The LJM deals inspired deep unease within Enron, Watkins related,
quoting one colleague remarking: "I know it would be devastating to all
of us but I wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company."</TE>
<TE>   Lay responded to Watkins' letter by meeting with her personally and
persuading the Enron board to commission an internal review by Vinson &amp;
Elkins, one of Enron's Houston law firms.</TE>
<TE>   Robert S. Bennett, Enron's Washington attorney, defended the company's
response. The nine-page review of Watkins' concerns by Vinson &amp; Elkins
issued Oct. 15 shows "the good faith of Ken Lay and the company. . . . It
shows that they meaningfully looked into this."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said the law firm interviewed Watkins but that it put "a lot
of faith in Arthur Andersen."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins, however, had specifically warned Lay against allowing Vinson
&amp; Elkins to conduct the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Can't use V&amp;E due to conflict," she wrote in her memo. "They provided
some true sale opinions on some of the deals."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, she argued that the firm would be ruling on the
propriety of legal opinions it had itself issued.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the law firm said in its report, written by Vinson partner
Max Hendrick III and addressed to Enron General Counsel James V. Derrick
Jr., that it was specifically instructed by Enron not to "second guess .
. . the accounting advice and treatment" provided by Andersen. The report
stated that Enron and Andersen representatives acknowledged that the
accounting treatment of the suspect transactions "is creative and
aggressive," but it did not conclude that it was "inappropriate from a
technical standpoint."</TE>
<TE>   Vinson &amp; Elkins spokesman Joe Householder declined to discuss whether
it was a conflict of interest for the firm to investigate Watkins'
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not in a position to talk about our engagements with Enron or
any other client," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As it happens, the firm overruled almost all of Watkins' substantive
objections to the LJM transactions, although it did acknowledge some
"awkwardness" arising from LJM's executives serving as Enron officers.</TE>
<TE>   "Transactions were negotiated between Enron employees acting [for]
Enron and other Enron employees acting for LJM," the law firm's report
stated.</TE>
<TE>   It also noted that within Enron there was widespread suspicion that
the Enron employees representing LJM were enjoying special perquisites,
including higher compensation. But it said the awkwardness would be
eliminated in the future because LJM executives were leaving the Enron
payroll and relocating their offices from its headquarters building.</TE>
<TE>Focus on the 'Raptor' Deals</TE>
<TE>   The report did, however, provide indirect evidence of Enron's custom
of minimizing the public disclosure of the nature of its financial
maneuvers. Among other things, the company gave its outside lawyers
little opportunity to examine closely the financial reports and other
documents it was releasing for public consumption.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron's practice is to provide its financial statements and
disclosure materials to V&amp;E with a relatively short time frame within
which to respond with comments," the report stated.</TE>
<TE>   In her memo, Watkins focused most heavily on several transactions
between Enron and LJM known as the Raptor deals. The term referred to a
special business entity that Enron had established to hold several
investments that were expensive and of possibly marginal value, including
ownership in a broadband communications company called Rhythms
NetConnections and other technology and energy companies.</TE>
<TE>   To cover the LJM-Raptor acquisition of the investments, Enron pledged
shares of its own stock and that of some of its subsidiaries. But it also
engaged in a series of complicated derivatives deals aimed at hedging the
possibility that the value of Rhythms and the other assets would fall.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Watkins noted, Enron went as far as to record more than $500
million in revenue from those derivatives deals. That, she said,
presented numerous problems.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, Enron had not received the $500 million from LJM.
Rather, the payment was conditioned on the value of the underlying
investments remaining high; if the investments deteriorated, there was an
increasing chance that Enron would never receive the money.</TE>
<TE>   Further, it was likely that a truly independent company would not have
paid anywhere near $500 million for the investments at issue--meaning
that the deal was not legitimately an arm's-length sale.</TE>
<TE>   Vinson &amp; Elkins acknowledged this, noting in its report that LJM
"permitted Enron to close transactions that otherwise could not have been
accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, as the value of the investments dropped, Enron was obligated
to make up the difference by paying LJM more of its own stock.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout 2001 the underlying investments did fall in value--and so
did the value of Enron stock. That meant the company had to contribute
vastly more shares to LJM than it ever anticipated. That was a
contingency that was never fully disclosed to the public or Enron's
shareholders, who stood to lose value in their own shares as more were
pledged to LJM.</TE>
<TE>   "It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses
in a related company and will compensate that company with Enron stock in
the future," Watkins wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Not until Nov. 8 did Enron fully disclose the nature of the Raptor
deals--as part of its public announcement that the improper accounting of
those transactions and others resulted in its overstating its earnings by
$586 million over a nearly five-year period.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement all but destroyed any chance that the company would
be able to survive in its existing form.</TE>
<TE>Addiction to Accounting Tricks</TE>
<TE>   Enron critic Mark Roberts, president of Off Wall Street Consulting
Group, a Cambridge, Mass.-based stock research firm, said the Watkins
memo adds to the evidence of Enron's addiction to illegitimate accounting
tricks.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptor deals were derivative transactions "with recourse," meaning
deals in which the counter-party would be compensated for any losses, he
noted in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "If the buyer doesn't have risk, the risk stays with Enron and has to
be reflected on their balance sheet," said Roberts, whose firm sold Enron
shares "short," a bet that they would fall, as early as last May.</TE>

<HD>U.S.-Russia Uranium Pact Stalls</HD>
<DH>Energy: A price dispute could lead to a nuclear power fuel shortage
and hurt national security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WILLMAN</AU>
<AU>ALAN C. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A landmark 1993 agreement to sell tons of uranium stripped from
Russian warheads to fuel American power plants is in jeopardy because of
a dispute over price between the Russians and a U.S. company.</LD>
<LD>   The standoff between the Russians and the U.S. company responsible for
carrying out the deal already has stalled shipment of uranium to the
United States. And arms control specialists are concerned that a collapse
of the deal could increase the chance of terrorists or rogue nations
obtaining the nuclear material.</LD>
<LD>   A senior Bush administration official, Energy Undersecretary Robert G.
Card, told the American company in a letter last week that "U.S.
strategic interests may be at risk if the [firm] cannot ensure continuity
of shipments of Russian down-blended [uranium] to the United States."</LD>
<TE>   Card said the disagreement could also lead to "a nuclear power fuel
shortage" here; the U.S. company relies heavily on the uranium purchased
from Russia for sales that it makes to American nuclear power plants. The
company supplies about 70% of the uranium fuel used in American nuclear
plants, which generate about one-fifth of all electricity used in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The high stakes illuminate an anomaly in how the United States has
handled a crucial national security function: Since mid-1998, the
government has ceded to the private company, USEC Inc. of Bethesda, Md.,
far-reaching responsibility for implementing the agreement with the
Russians to purchase 500 metric tons of military uranium.</TE>
<TE>   Because USEC and the Russians remain at odds over pricing, no
shipments have been authorized for 2002. Ordinarily, the year's first
load of uranium--three metric tons, or enough for about 120 nuclear
warheads--would have been ordered by October and would begin flowing to
the United States in March.</TE>
<TE>   In a written response to Card on Thursday, USEC President William H.
Timbers Jr. said that the energy official's letter "undermines and could
significantly affect the ability of [USEC] to reach prompt and successful
agreement" with the Russians regarding the 1993 uranium deal. Timbers
also termed Card's concerns about a possible shortage of nuclear-power
fuel "unwarranted and disingenuous."</TE>
<TE>   Copies of the letters were obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   A USEC spokesman said Tuesday that the company expects to resolve its
differences with the Russians without any serious consequences.</TE>
<TE>   A Bush administration official familiar with the current talks said
that USEC and the Russians "seem to be at loggerheads. . . . I think [the
uranium agreement] is in jeopardy. I would not characterize this as
normal negotiations." The official spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>1993 Agreement Is Seen as a Watershed</TE>
<TE>   From the standpoint of those concerned about the potential spread of
nuclear weaponry in the aftermath of the Cold War, the 1993 U.S.-Russian
accord, known as "Megatons to Megawatts," was a watershed.</TE>
<TE>   During a 20-year period, the U.S. government would purchase about 500
metric tons (about 1.1 million pounds) of highly enriched uranium
stripped from former Soviet warheads. The purchase proceeds would employ
thousands of Russian scientists and technicians, who would blend down, or
dilute, the material for use as fuel in commercial nuclear power plants.</TE>
<TE>   The deal appeared to have several attractive features.</TE>
<TE>   The securing of the weapon-grade uranium--at a price of approximately
$12 billion--would keep it from well-capitalized terrorists such as Osama
bin Laden. And by employing Russians to blend down the material to
commercial-grade fuel, the deal would help dissuade them from selling
their services to others who covet nuclear materials and expertise, such
as Iraq or Iran.</TE>
<TE>   The purchases of Russian uranium began in 1995, under the purview of
the U.S. Department of Energy and the government-held United States
Enrichment Corp., a precursor of USEC Inc. Then-President Clinton, with
bipartisan congressional backing, approved privatizing the corporation in
1997. And in 1998, investors bought the entity from the government in a
deal worth nearly $1.9 billion. Its shares trade on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The newly privatized USEC Inc. remained the exclusive U.S. agent for
the Russian uranium deal. In the last seven years, USEC has paid $2.2
billion for fuel derived from 141 metric tons of weapon-grade enriched
uranium from the Russians, the equivalent of about 5,600 warheads.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the uranium fuel that USEC sells to utility
companies comes from Russia; the company also produces it at a single
plant in Paducah, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   For the Russians, the value of the uranium deal is huge--as much as
$700 million a year. The sale proceeds provide a significant revenue
source for Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, which is responsible for
safeguarding nuclear material at production and research facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Security at many of the sites has long been lax, U.S. officials say. A
number of government reports have documented the shortcomings, such as
porous fencing, an absence of video surveillance and nuclear workers who
have gone unpaid for months at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "The uranium deal is the only thing that stands between anarchy and
stability in the Russian nuclear weapons complex," said Thomas L. Neff, a
Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist who in 1991 first
proposed the Megatons to Megawatts concept to the White House and the
Russians.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the decision to turn day-to-day implementation of the
agreement over to private industry raised concerns among some
policymakers. The chairman of Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors,
Joseph B. Stiglitz, opposed the arrangement at the time. He later termed
it "bad national security policy and bad economic policy."</TE>
<TE>   USEC executives have consistently said that the company's
profit-making imperatives do not conflict with the federal government's
national security needs.</TE>
<TE>   The specifics of the current dispute can be traced to early 2000, when
USEC made a contract proposal--subject to the approval of both
governments--for new pricing terms that would have taken effect this
month. The proposed terms would have enabled USEC to purchase uranium for
about 15% less than the Russians received in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Russians did not agree to the revised terms at an annual
review last fall, when the first order for a 2002 uranium shipment was to
have been placed. With no new terms ratified, USEC would be obligated by
contract to pay the same price for uranium this year that the Russians
charged in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But USEC has declined to order deliveries for 2002 unless Russia
accepts its lower-price terms through 2013. Neither side has yielded,
precipitating the potential breakdown in the Megatons to Megawatts deal.</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty over the uranium agreement comes at a time when USEC
is counting on a restructuring of the deal to help its bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   The company warned in a financial statement filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission for the quarter ending Sept. 30 that it could
suffer without the more favorable terms. Without the Russian and U.S.
governments agreeing to those provisions by Jan. 1, USEC said, "earnings
and cash flow in fiscal 2002 and thereafter would be adversely affected
and would be substantially lower than currently projected, absent USEC
making other arrangements."</TE>
<TE>   USEC engaged in multiple rounds of negotiations in Moscow last month
without success. Just last week, it sent its senior vice president,
Phillip G. Sewell, back to Moscow in an attempt to push the Russians to
accept USEC's latest offer. The Russians declined.</TE>
<TE>   The interruption of the uranium shipments comes only a month after
President Bush vowed to expand U.S. cooperation with Russia. The
president said he wanted to "dismantle strategic weapons, reduce nuclear
material and increase security at nuclear sites" as part of an
international effort to "keep the world's most dangerous technologies out
of the hands of the world's most dangerous people." He cited this as a
heightened priority after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Charles B. Curtis, deputy Energy secretary under Clinton, said that
any schism in implementing the uranium agreement with the Russians
creates related national security problems.</TE>
<TE>   Such discord, Curtis said, "has an immediate consequence. And putting
that [U.S.-Russian] cooperation at risk is a tremendous national security
consequence." Curtis noted that on other occasions when the Russians took
umbrage at the American handling of the uranium purchases, they blocked
U.S. observers from visiting Russian nuclear facilities, preventing
verification of whether weapon-grade materials were adequately
safeguarded.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. government needs to play a stronger supervisory role over
the commercial activities of USEC," Curtis said. "There needs to be an
active and purposeful oversight of this commercial arrangement. And I
think that's not evident."</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman for USEC, Charles B. Yulish, said the company is
continuing to actively negotiate and fully expects to reach an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeking a prompt resolution to this matter and that's why we're
fully engaged with the Russians to seek mutually acceptable terms,"
Yulish said. " . . . They have the incentive to take the right deal and
we have the incentive to offer it. But right now it's one of those
negotiating deals that you just have to be patient with."</TE>
<TE>   Yulish said that USEC's efforts to win new terms for the uranium
agreement have been complicated by the changeover of administrations in
Washington and by new leadership at Russia's atomic energy ministry. Both
governments must approve any change in terms.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington said Tuesday, "We're
not in a position to comment."</TE>
<TE>Bush Team Urges Firm to Avoid Further Delays</TE>
<TE>   In his letter last week to USEC's president, Card emphasized that the
Bush administration wants the company to immediately take steps necessary
to resume shipments of the Russians' military uranium. Card suggested
that USEC should not risk further delay of shipments in 2002 by holding
out for better long-term prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Our first priority remains the continuity of shipments of
down-blended Russian [uranium] in 2002," Card wrote in his letter to
USEC's president, Timbers. " . . . I want to stress that this is a
requirement for the U.S. Government and that no long-term contract will
be reviewed favorably unless it contains a separate mechanism to ensure
2002 deliveries. Given the lack of progress on [the] negotiations, we
support focusing on 2002 at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Timbers countered in his letter to Card that USEC has "been working
diligently in these negotiations to advance the long-term strategic
interest of the U.S. by pursuing the long-term stability of the [uranium]
Agreement--not some stop-gap approach that will lead to continued
uncertainty in this important program."</TE>
<TE>   According to Timbers, four previous disruptions to the uranium
shipments were the fault of the Russians. But critics say that USEC
contributed to some delays out of financial interest.</TE>
<TE>   The current dispute comes as USEC is discussing a range of issues with
the Bush administration, including continuation of its role as the
exclusive agent for the Russian uranium deal. The administration can, at
any time, appoint a new agent or an additional agent to compete with USEC
for the purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Several U.S. electric utilities that purchase uranium from USEC have
told the administration they are now interested in buying the product
directly from Russia.</TE>

<TE>Key Moments</TE>
<TE>1992: U.S. and Russia agree that the United States will purchase from
Russia highly enriched uranium from dismantled nuclear weapons. The
uranium is to be converted to low enriched uranium for commercial
nuclear reactor fuel. Congress creates United States Enrichment Corp.
and makes it exclusive U.S. agent to buy the uranium.</TE>
<TE>February, 1993: U.S. agrees to buy at least 10 metric tons of highly
enriched uranium a year from Russia in the first five years and 30
metric tons in next 15 years.</TE>
<TE>January 1994: United States agrees to pay Russia $12 billion for 500
metric tons of highly enriched uranium over 20 years. The corporation
is given the option to buy uranium up to amounts specified annually,
at a price to be negotiated yearly.</TE>
<TE>December 1996: The corporation signs a five-year deal to buy specific
amounts of Russian uranium at a price agreed to by both governments.</TE>
<TE>July, 1998: The corporation is sold by the U.S. to investors through
an initial public offering. It remains the U.S. governmenteithers
exclusive agent for the Russian uranium agreement.</TE>
<TE>December 1999: Citing shortfalls from the Russian uranium deal, the
corporation threatens to withdraw as U.S. agent without a
$200-million federal subsidy. The Clinton administration refuses; the
corporation backs down.</TE>
<TE>Dec. 31, 2001: The five-year agreement with Russia expires. The
corporation and Russia do not reach a new agreement, disrupting
uranium shipments.</TE>
<TE>Jan. 8, 2002: Energy Undersecretary Robert G. Card advises the
corporation that ``U.S. strategic interests may be at risk if [the
corporation] cannot ensure continuity of shipments of Russian
down-blended HEU [highly enriched uranium].'' Card also says that if
outstanding issues with Russia ``are not resolved expeditiously, the
United States could find itself with a nuclear power fuel shortage.''</TE>

<KH>THE ENRON INQUIRY</KH>
<HD>Andersen Fires Executive Who Oversaw Enron Audit</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Firm puts three partners on leave and relieves four
others of management duties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Andersen accounting firm said Tuesday that it fired the
executive in charge of auditing Enron Corp., saying partner David B.
Duncan organized an effort to destroy thousands of documents after
learning of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen also placed three other partners responsible for the Enron
engagement on administrative leave and took away management
responsibilities from the four partners who ran the Houston office where
the Andersen audit was conducted.</LD>
<LD>   "Based on our actions today, it should be perfectly clear that
Andersen will not tolerate unethical behavior, gross errors in judgment
or willful violation of our policies," Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's
managing partner and chief executive, said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, the New York law firm representing Duncan, issued
a statement saying he did nothing wrong and is cooperating with
investigators. A spokesman said Duncan was following the instructions of
an Andersen attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan did not return a phone call to his home.</TE>
<TE>   An Andersen official said the firm learned in the first week of
January that documents had been destroyed. Its assertion that Duncan
systematically destroyed documents after learning that the SEC was
looking into the Enron audit is yet another devastating blow to Andersen,
said Lynn Turner, the SEC's former chief accountant.</TE>
<TE>   "It is about as close to an admission of guilt that you can get
without actually saying it," Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, accounting firms facing probes and litigation place the
partner who headed the problem audit "on ice" while the matter sorts out,
according to accounting experts. They don't allow the individual to do
more audits, but they don't fire the person, because they want the
partner to testify on the firm's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "It is almost unheard of for a partner to get fired during one of
these investigations, and so early in it," said Turner, who heads the
Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen collected $25 million for the Enron audit, one of the largest
audit fees in corporate America. Microsoft, by comparison, paid less than
$5 million in audit fees last year.</TE>
<TE>   Turner predicted the firing would help congressional investigators,
who plan to meet with Duncan in Washington today. "Frankly, now that he's
been fired, he may have a little more motivation to cooperate with us,"
said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are reviewing six boxes of Duncan's personal files,
which they hope to use to reconstruct some of the destroyed records.
Johnson said that Duncan may have "crucial information" relevant to the
probe--"and apparently he's prepared to share it with us."</TE>
<TE>   Each successive revelation about how it handled the Enron
audit--starting last year when Andersen reissued the energy company's
financial reports, slicing nearly $600 million off its profit statements
over a four-year period--has been increasingly damaging for the firm,
said Howard Schilit of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis in
Rockville, Md.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's integrity has been challenged, employee recruiting and
retention efforts have been damaged and Andersen faces the prospect of
huge financial penalties and judgments stemming from numerous federal
probes and Enron shareholder lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, 42, is a former treasurer of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity at
Texas A&amp;M who serves on the advisory board of the business school's
accounting department.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan also is a member of the politically powerful board of the
American Council for Capital Formation, a Washington-based organization
that lobbies for business-friendly tax and environmental policies.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the board are Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and an array of
Washington blue-chippers from both parties, including former Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, former
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer and former ambassador
and Democratic Party chief Robert S. Strauss.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen claimed that an internal investigation found that Duncan
organized an "expedited effort to destroy documents" in the Houston
office and called a meeting with staff members Oct. 23 to get the task
started.</TE>
<TE>   What is especially damaging, according to accounting experts, is that
Andersen asserts Duncan started shredding papers and deleting electronic
files after learning that Enron had received a request for information
from the SEC about its financial accounting and reporting. Such an action
could be grounds for obstruction of justice charges.</TE>
<TE>   "This effort was undertaken without any consultation with others in
the firm and at a time when the engagement team should have had serious
questions about their actions," Andersen said in its statement.</TE>
<TE>   "The activity appears to have ended shortly after the lead partner's
assistant sent an e-mail to other secretaries on Nov. 9--the day after
Andersen received a subpoena from the SEC--telling them to 'stop the
shredding,' " Andersen said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen rejected the claims of Duncan's attorney that he was
following orders. The firm said an Oct. 12 e-mail to the Houston office
from Nancy Temble, an in-house attorney, was a routine reminder for the
Enron team to follow the firm's documentation and retention policy and
did not authorize the destruction of documents.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail to Andersen partner Michael C. Odom said: "Mike--It might
be useful to consider reminding the engagement team of our documentation
and retention policy. It will be helpful to make sure that we have
complied with the policy. Let me know if you have any questions."</TE>
<TE>   Schilit said Andersen's actions and statements over the last several
days represent the seeds of what might turn into the accounting firm's
defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Andersen may be in a damage-control mode where they stress that their
internal policies were violated and that this guy is a scoundrel,"
Schilit said.</TE>
<TE>   But others said Andersen is correct to sever ties with people it
believed violated its policies and to disclose what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sad situation all the way around, but Andersen is taking
the right steps to restore its reputation and working through the details
as you would expect," said Randolph Beatty, dean of USC's Leventhal
School of Accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Ira Solomon, head of the accounting department at the University of
Illinois, noted that although Andersen has had a troubled audit, the firm
is acting responsibly and that "You can't characterize Andersen as a
corrupt organization."</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm said it has recovered some documents from
electronic backup files and is working to retrieve more. Andersen also
said it does not believe that any crucial "work papers" were destroyed.
Such papers typically detail the rationale for accounting decisions made
during an audit.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen said its internal probe is continuing and that the
individuals already named and other staff members could face additional
sanction.</TE>
<TE>   The partners who were put on leave were Thomas H. Bauer, Debra A. Cash
and Roger D. Willard. The Houston-based partners being relieved of
management responsibilities were D. Stephen Goddard Jr., Michael M.
Lowther, Gary B. Goolsby and Odom.</TE>
<TE>   A Duncan associate, Jerry Strawser, dean of the school of business at
Texas A&amp;M, said Duncan was well-regarded in Texas accounting circles, and
he reserved judgment on Andersen's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time our department of accounting wanted to do a project or
needed ideas of how to structure courses or programs, he would be on the
short list of who to call," Strawser said.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan also was instrumental in recruiting students for Andersen and
in using his Andersen contacts to raise funds for the school, Strawser
said.</TE>

<HD>Activists Doc Apparent Chechen Killings</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Russia's leading human rights group says it has documented the
apparent killing of three men and the disappearance of six others during
a Russian "special operation" in Chechnya over the New Year's holidays.</LD>
<LD>   "As interviews with local residents make clear, the special operation
was carried out with the crudest violations of human rights and the law,"
the chairman of the group Memorial, Oleg Orlov, wrote in a letter to
Vsevolod Chernov, the chief prosecutor of the separatist republic.
Memorial released the letter alleging actions in the village of
Tsotsin-Yurt to news organizations Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, Orlov said Russian forces detained massive numbers of
local residents, most of whom complained that they were insulted and
humiliated by the soldiers. About 80 residents said they were "cruelly
beaten" during their detentions, which took place between Dec. 30 and
Jan. 3.</LD>
<TE>   Russian soldiers continued firing at suspected rebels even after being
informed that civilians were in the line of fire, according to
information collected by Memorial, and used two detainees as "human
shields" during the battle. Witnesses said that the two men were still
alive when the battle ended but that their bodies turned up shortly
afterward near the local military headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "Both bodies were mutilated," Orlov wrote. "Ears, noses and genitals
had been cut off."</TE>
<TE>   Memorial also documented the apparent disappearance of seven other
residents detained by federal forces during the Tsotsin-Yurt operation.
On Jan. 7, residents found three bodies on the outskirts of town that
appeared to have been blown up with grenades. One was identified by its
clothing as belonging to one of the missing detainees; the other two
bodies apparently had not been identified.</TE>
<TE>   The operation in Tsotsin-Yurt was only one of a number to take place
in recent weeks as Russian military leaders have sought to use the harsh
winter weather and lack of vegetation to root out separatist rebels. In
December alone, Memorial documented the apparent killings of more than
two dozen civilians in the republic.</TE>
<TE>   The commander of Russia's joint forces in the region, Lt. Gen.
Vladimir Moltenskoi, told the Krasnaya Zvezda military newspaper that
there will be no letup in such operations.</TE>
<TE>   "About a hundred militants, including a few dozen chieftains," were
killed in "successive and continuous special operations" in the towns of
Tsotsin-Yurt, Novaya Zhizn, Kurchaloi and Argun, Moltenskoi told the
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 residents of Tsotsin-Yurt picketed the Russian regional
headquarters in the Chechen capital, Grozny, on Tuesday to protest the
operations. A similar protest drew about 500 in Argun, where a "special
operation" has been underway since Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   After criticism from Western governments and from human rights groups,
Russian military officials have said they have stopped conducting
house-to-house document sweeps, known as zachistka operations, and have
lifted curfews.</TE>
<TE>   But Orlov and other human rights activists complain that the change is
in name only.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no more zachistkas, but there are 'special operations' to
check residency registrations and locate members of illegal military
groups," Orlov wrote in a statement after a meeting with Moltenskoi and
Chernov. "There is no more curfew on the territory of the Chechen
republic, but movement is curtailed for certain hours of the day to
permit counterterrorist operations."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Polish journalists released late Tuesday,
President Vladimir V. Putin said, "The army, in fact, is not conducting
any military activity there." But he went on, in an apparent
contradiction, "There are only local operations."</TE>

<HD>71-Year-Old Israeli Settler Beaten, Slain</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Shooting by four Palestinian militiamen is followed by a
fatal attack on women in car. Revenge appears to be motive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIT JALA, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Palestinian gunmen kidnapped a 71-year-old Israeli at a roadblock
in this West Bank village Tuesday, drove him to a field in a nearby
village, beat him and then shot him to death, the Israeli army said, in
what appeared to be a revenge killing.</LD>
<LD>   Hours later, in a second attack, a pair of Palestinian gunmen opened
fire on a car heading toward the West Bank Jewish settlement of Givat
Zeev, killing a 45-year-old settler and seriously wounding her
70-year-old aunt, the army reported.</LD>
<LD>   The attacks fueled fears that the death of a Palestinian militia
leader in disputed circumstances Monday has triggered a fresh spiral of
revenge attacks that could destroy U.S. efforts to secure a cease-fire in
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</LD>
<TE>   Israel Television said the army was preparing to respond "forcefully"
to Tuesday's killings. Palestinian sources said Palestinian security
organizations were on high alert in anticipation of a retaliatory attack.</TE>
<TE>   In what may have been an effort to head off an Israeli response, the
Palestinian Authority reportedly arrested Ahmed Saadat, secretary-general
of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, late
Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>'Political Arrest'</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Rahim Mallouh, Saadat's deputy, said the PFLP leader had been
called to a meeting with a Palestinian official in the West Bank town of
Ramallah, where a team of security officers arrested him.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very dangerous political arrest," Mallouh said in a
telephone interview. "It came in response to pressures from Israel and
the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Israel has demanded Saadat's arrest and extradition in connection with
the assassination of Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi, who was gunned down
in an East Jerusalem hotel in October. The PFLP claimed responsibility
for Zeevi's killing, saying it was an act of revenge for Israel's
assassination of Saadat's predecessor, Mustafa Zibri, better known as Abu
Ali Mustafa.</TE>
<TE>   Raanan Gissin, spokesman for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, expressed
skepticism that Saadat was indeed under arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "Until I see him behind bars, I will not believe this," Gissin said.</TE>
<TE>   In Beit Jala, residents said Tuesday night that they were badly shaken
by the killing of Avi Boaz, an engineer and dual Israeli-American
citizen. Boaz, a settler living in the West Bank, was well known and well
liked in this traditionally Christian village, Palestinians said. He had
built many houses in the village and for years lived in Beit Jala's
Everest Hotel, and had lunch with friends there shortly before he was
killed, Palestinian sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers expressed outrage that someone many considered a dear friend
had been killed in their midst.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an unacceptable crime," said a leader of a Palestinian
opposition faction in Beit Jala, who spoke on condition he not be named.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Sharon Levy, Israeli commander of the Israeli-Palestinian
District Coordinating Office in Beit Jala, said Boaz was driving with a
Beit Jalan friend near the Arab Orthodox Club when they were stopped at a
roadblock staffed by the Palestinian naval police.</TE>
<TE>Car Commandeered</TE>
<TE>   Four Palestinian gunmen from the Tanzim militia, which is linked to
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah
movement, pulled the Palestinian from Boaz's convertible, Levy said. The
gunmen then commandeered the car and drove off with Boaz. Although Boaz's
Palestinian companion quickly alerted the Israelis to the abduction, the
Palestinian police at the roadblock told their commanders that they knew
nothing of the kidnapping, Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the Palestinian Authority turned over Boaz's battered body
to the Israeli army south of Jerusalem, two gunmen standing on the side
of the road several miles north of Jerusalem opened fire on the car
driven by settler Yoela Chen. Security officials said the gunmen signaled
Chen to pull over near a gas station, spoke to her and then sprayed her
car with gunfire, killing her and injuring her aunt.</TE>
<TE>   The killings came on a day when more than 15,000 Palestinians, many of
them shouting for revenge, buried Fatah militia leader Raed Karmi, who
died when a bomb exploded near his hide-out in the West Bank town of
Tulkarm. Karmi, who boasted of killing Israelis, had been near the top of
Israel's most-wanted list for months.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli newspapers reported Tuesday that the army had assassinated
Karmi. But Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said he had died in a
"work accident," an Israeli euphemism applied to militants who blow
themselves up preparing bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has killed dozens of militants since fighting erupted in
September 2000, saying the acts prevent terrorist attacks. Although much
of the international community condemns the killings as extrajudicial,
most Israelis see them as legitimate acts of self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   But Karmi's killing drew criticism here for shattering a relatively
quiet period that had reigned since Arafat announced a unilateral
cease-fire Dec. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of Karmi's death, the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia
linked to Fatah, shot dead a 19-year-old Israeli soldier at a West Bank
roadblock. The militia said it had carried out the killing to avenge
Karmi's death and said Fatah would no longer observe Arafat's declared
cease-fire. But West Bank security chief Jibril Rajoub said Tuesday that
the unilateral cease-fire will continue.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate statement, however, the militant Hamas movement warned
that unless Israel ends its confinement of Arafat to Ramallah, the
Islamic organization's military wing will carry out a series of attacks
inside Israel. Israel has refused to allow Arafat to travel from Ramallah
for more than a month, saying its travel ban will continue until
hearrests Zeevi's killers.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli army chief of staff, came under
withering criticism from some left-wing members of the Knesset, Israel's
parliament, for the timing of the alleged assassination of Karmi.</TE>
<TE>   "When an action such as an assassination is carried out in Tulkarm,
one must wonder what this begets in terms of timing," said Ran Cohen, a
Meretz Party member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. He
asked Mofaz, who was testifying before the committee, "Have we thus
buried three weeks of quiet through which we could have progressed toward
talks with the Palestinians?"</TE>

<HD>Colombia Zone Now Heart of Rebel Problem</HD>
<DH>S. America: Guerrillas and government came to the brink of war over
the territory itself, not because of any issue in the peace negotiations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>A road leaving this teeming frontier town winds toward a series of
cliffs that soar over river gorges. Etched into one cliff, with a
sweeping view of wild, unspoiled jungle, lies an emblem of the problems
facing Colombia's peace process.</LD>
<LD>   It is a massive sculpture, 30 feet high and 130 feet long, hewn from
the rock. The artwork features a winged Manuel Marulanda, the leader of
this country's largest rebel group, the FARC, approaching Simon Bolivar,
South America's legendary liberator.</LD>
<LD>   Guerrilla workers scrambled to finish the sculpture as the peace
process was collapsing around them. They said it was important to show
the army who owned this part of Colombia, a demilitarized zone that was
ceded to the rebels three years ago to initiate the peace process.</LD>
<TE>   "They might come and destroy it, but we'll just build it back again,"
one of the workers said as he watched his team carve Soviet-style
marching soldiers and a hammer-and-sickle-wielding farmer.</TE>
<TE>   A last-minute diplomatic mission has put the peace process back on
course, but it was by no means clear Tuesday where it was heading. That's
because the zone itself has become part of the problem. The guerrillas
think they own it. And the government--specifically the military--wants
it back.</TE>
<TE>   "The zone has been a problem from the start," said Alfredo Rangel, a
defense expert and advisor to Colombia's military. "All the problems in
the process come from it."</TE>
<TE>   Evidence for that came Tuesday, as troops and tanks continued to
surround the zone, even though negotiators had staved off a Monday night
deadline to invade it.</TE>
<TE>   Despite fears from negotiators that the military's presence would
quash any hopes of productive talks, top defense officials said troops
will continue surrounding the zone because another deadline, to end the
zone's existence, is approaching Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to intensify. The military presence is going to continue,"
said Vice President Gustavo Bell, who is also the country's defense
minister.</TE>
<TE>   The zone was the cause of the near-rupture in the peace process this
week. The FARC--Spanish initials for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia--has spent the past three years snubbing President Andres
Pastrana from the government-bestowed haven. The rebels assassinated
senators and civic officials near the zone. They held captured police and
military officials prisoner in the zone. They hid kidnapping victims in
specially built wooden houses in the zone. They even used it to land a
hijacked airplane.</TE>
<TE>   After the FARC had abused the zone in a particularly spectacular
fashion last summer and fall--it allegedly received bomb training there
from Irish Republican Army guerrillas and used the area to hide hostages
from a mass kidnapping--Pastrana decided to crack down in October.</TE>
<TE>   He began sending more troops to surround the zone. He stopped the
entry of foreigners except with permission from the government. And most
worrisome of all for the FARC, he began air force patrols.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana maintains that the patrols have always been in place. But the
guerrillas complained to negotiators that the air force was using the
patrols to harass them, flying low over their camps.</TE>
<TE>   "The air patrols really bothered them. They weren't sure the
government had control" over the military, said one source close to the
peace negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the new restrictions, the guerrillas walked out of the
talks, saying there were no guarantees for their safety.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana, who was elected in 1998 largely as a result of his pledge to
bring peace to Colombia, has frequently given in during the past three
years of talks. But this time, he refused to budge, saying that the
restrictions will remain.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts speculated that the sudden resolve was a sign that Pastrana
is trying to mollify hard-liners in the military, who have become
increasingly powerful.</TE>
<TE>   Others have attributed Pastrana's steel to this year's presidential
election. Pastrana is constitutionally barred from running again for
office, but his political party's candidate is suffering badly in the
polls.</TE>
<TE>   But one participant in the recent negotiations said that Pastrana is
simply angry. After tolerating countless embarrassments, he felt he had
amply demonstrated his commitment to peace. It was an insult, the
official said, that the guerrillas would see the relatively modest
security measures as a threat.</TE>
<TE>   And so, the two sides came to the brink of war over the zone itself,
not over any issue in the peace negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana "feels that he has done more for peace than any other world
leader," said one diplomat close to the talks. "We helped [the
guerrillas] to see that."</TE>
<TE>   In the final agreement, which Pastrana accepted only half an hour
before the army was to invade, the guerrillas agreed that the zone was
safe enough for negotiations. But they left many more problems
unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   The FARC made no promises to stop using the zone as it has so far, a
center for guerrilla activities where the military cannot attack. The
government has implemented no controls within the zone itself to stop
such activities. Nor has there been any progress toward a real peace.</TE>
<TE>   When Pastrana last extended the zone Oct. 7, he gave the FARC until
Jan. 20 to begin talking about real issues, such as a cessation of
hostilities and an end to kidnappings. And so, the zone will again become
a center of the dispute. Pastrana has already begun using it as a
political tool, implying that its continued existence depends on concrete
steps taken by the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, some of the diplomats at the talks fear that the
rebels have begun to believe that the zone has outlived its usefulness,
that they have trained enough fighters and made enough money to begin a
full-scale war.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic problem is the issue of trust," said one diplomat involved
in the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Others were more optimistic that the parties will finally move on to
discuss more serious themes.</TE>
<TE>   James LeMoyne, the U.N. negotiator who helped restart the peace talks,
said he believes that the negotiations will continue with more
seriousness now.</TE>
<TE>   "They went to the brink and they came back," said LeMoyne, who looked
spent after three straight days of talks. "In my experience, when you go
to the brink, you don't go back."</TE>

<LD>Zimbabwe's parliament dropped a much criticized bill curbing media
freedom from its business after an advisory committee found serious
problems with some clauses, the opposition Movement for Democratic Change
said.</LD>
<LD>   But the delay did not seem to indicate that President Robert Mugabe
had shelved a plan to ban foreign journalists and outlaw any reporting
deemed to sow "alarm and despondency."</LD>
<LD>   "The Access to Information and Privacy Bill is not on the order paper
today," MDC spokesman Learnmore Jongwe said in the capital, Harare.</LD>

<HD>Pakistan Shuts More Militants' Offices</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Police closed the offices of another militant group Tuesday ahead
of a visit by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that is aimed at
defusing the threat of war between Pakistan and India. But a defiant
President Gen. Pervez Musharraf said he still backs Kashmir's struggle
against "Indian occupation."</LD>
<LD>   Musharraf told the newly formed National Kashmir Committee that he
hopes for a peaceful end to the standoff with India, but he repeated
Pakistan's "resolve and will" to defend itself.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistani police kept up their sweep of suspected Islamic extremists,
closing three offices of the Harkat Moujahedeen, a group India accuses of
staging attacks in the disputed Kashmir region.</LD>
<TE>   More than 70 suspected militants were detained Tuesday, the fourth day
of a crackdown ordered by Musharraf, bringing total arrests to more than
1,600 and the number of offices closed to nearly 500, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   However, India has said Pakistan must do more to prevent terror
attacks against it.</TE>
<TE>   Powell was to arrive in Pakistan today before continuing on to Kabul,
the Afghan capital, Thursday. He also plans to travel to New Delhi,
India's capital, for more talks on the Indian-Pakistani confrontation
that last month led the nuclear-armed neighbors to mass hundreds of
thousands of troops on their border.</TE>
<TE>   Powell will also make a brief trip to Nepal, the kingdom's state radio
said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters before a refueling stop in Ireland, Powell said
a conciliatory speech by Musharraf showed that "the rush toward conflict
has slowed quite a bit."</TE>
<TE>   In efforts to avoid war, Powell said, "there has been an excessive
focus on achieving a pullback of the large number of troops that the two
sides have arrayed against each other in recent weeks."</TE>
<TE>   "It's more important to make sure that the political and diplomatic
situation stabilizes," he said. "If that is stabilized, then the armies
can move back in due course."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Musharraf has banned five organizations, two of which India
blames for a deadly attack on its Parliament. On Tuesday, Islamabad
ordered Pakistani banks to freeze the accounts of the five groups, a move
apparently timed to Powell's arrival.</TE>

<HD>Chretien Shuffles Canadian Cabinet</HD>
<DH>Politics: Shake-up follows the surprise resignation of the man
widely seen as the prime minister's eventual heir.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OTTAWA
</DL>
<LD>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien overhauled his Cabinet on
Tuesday, dismissing seven ministers and bringing 10 new faces into the
government just a day after the country was stunned by the resignation of
a popular Cabinet member who had been Chretien's presumptive heir.</LD>
<LD>   The restructuring was the most significant development yet in the
unofficial but quite public race to succeed Chretien as head of the
Liberal Party when--or rather if, as skeptics here say--the long-serving
prime minister decides to retire, political analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   The shake-up also reflects the changed political environment in Canada
four months after the terrorist attacks in the United States, with much
greater emphasis on domestic security and military preparedness than in
recent decades.</LD>
<TE>   Brian Tobin, a garrulous and ambitious Newfoundlander who had served
as minister of industry until he abruptly announced Monday that he was
quitting Parliament, had long been considered Chretien's preferred
successor but had been eclipsed by Cabinet rivals in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Tobin, who said he was leaving government for family reasons, may have
preferred to resign rather than lose his undeclared campaign for the
party leadership, Canadian political commentators said.</TE>
<TE>   Now the political spotlight has shifted to the newly designated deputy
prime minister, John Manley, who as foreign minister had been propelled
to unexpected prominence by the Sept. 11 terror strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Manley became Canada's point man in the coordination of security
policies with the United States, winning plaudits at home and in
Washington for his vocal support of the Bush administration's campaign
against the Al Qaeda terrorist network in Afghanistan and beyond. In a
coincidence of timing, Time magazine's Canada edition honored Manley on
Tuesday as its Canadian "newsmaker of the year."</TE>
<TE>   "There are many surprises in public life, and we have had a few in the
past 24 hours," Manley said.</TE>
<TE>   Manley will give up the foreign affairs portfolio but will assume
overall responsibility for security issues, while supervising state-owned
corporations and major national public works projects. In concentrating
all those areas in the deputy prime minister's office for the first time,
Chretien is in effect creating a new government position, with many of
the hands-on responsibilities that the prime minister had directly
assumed, Manley said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But Chretien, 68, who was first elected prime minister in 1993, again
denied that he plans to step down any time soon. "I had a walk in the
snow last night, and I'm staying," he told reporters as he announced the
Cabinet changes in a nationally televised news conference.</TE>
<TE>   The fiscally conservative finance minister, Paul Martin, who survived
the Cabinet shake-up, is also considered a strong candidate to succeed
Chretien.</TE>
<TE>   General elections were last held in 2000 and, if the Liberal majority
holds, they need not be called again until 2005. But under the
parliamentary system, Chretien could step down and be replaced by a new
Liberal leader before his term expires.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation in Ottawa, meanwhile, focused on the surprise resignation
of Tobin, which brought a halt, at least temporarily, to one of the most
colorful and closely watched careers in Canada's recent political
history.</TE>
<TE>   Though just 47, Tobin has been a fixture on the national political
scene since he first arrived as a brash backbencher here two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   At Chretien's request, Tobin had stepped down as Newfoundland's chief
executive to join the Cabinet in Ottawa in what was widely interpreted as
a move to position him for the prime minister's office.</TE>
<TE>   Tobin's sudden departure led to suggestions by opposition leaders that
some undisclosed scandal rather than family obligations had prompted the
move.</TE>

<HD>Marines Blast Tunnel System in Kandahar</HD>
<DH>Military: Area was apparently used by Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters
as recently as a day earlier, officials say. Meanwhile, Afghan skies are
relatively quiet.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>Marines destroyed tunnels Tuesday on the fringes of their base at
the Kandahar airport in southern Afghanistan that were apparently used by
armed Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters as recently as a day earlier, defense
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Associated Press and Reuters reported that a cache of weapons was
found in the tunnels and in a nearby mud-walled house, but a spokesman
for the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., said no weapons were found
at the site.</LD>
<LD>   Marine Capt. Dan Greenwood told reporters in Kandahar that patrols
Monday evening had spotted seven men heading toward an abandoned
mud-walled house outside the base perimeter, the wire services said.
Greenwood was quoted as saying the men appeared to be armed with assault
rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.</LD>
<TE>Demolition Experts Blow Up Network</TE>
<TE>   A patrol Tuesday morning set off for the site and found it abandoned,
said Central Command spokesman Cmdr. Frank Merriman. He said demolition
experts used conventional explosives to blow up the nearby tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   The tunnels, a few hundred yards from the nearest Marine position, are
in the same area where unidentified gunmen launched a night attack on
U.S. forces at the airport last week just as the first planeload of
prisoners was taking off for a U.S. naval base in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   No U.S. troops were injured in that firefight, which military
officials believe was a probing attack to test the base's defenses.</TE>
<TE>   As Marines continued to patrol the perimeter of the airport on the
lookout for other Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters, 19 more prisoners were
transferred into U.S. custody. Military forces are now holding 433
prisoners in Afghanistan, on a warship and in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The skies over Afghanistan were quieter Tuesday than they have been
for all but a few nights since U.S. airstrikes began Oct. 7. Warplanes
flew limited sorties over the country but didn't drop any bombs, Merriman
said.</TE>
<TE>Minister Meets With Prospective Donors</TE>
<TE>   In the Afghan capital, Kabul, interim Foreign Minister Abdullah and
the U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, met Tuesday with
representatives from 15 prospective donor nations, discussing what
Afghanistan needs and what the world might give at a "pledging"
conference scheduled for next week in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   "Our infrastructure is shattered," Abdullah told the gathering of the
Afghanistan Support Group, which was organized in Berlin last month to
begin laying out a salvage plan for the country. "Our economy is in
ruins."</TE>
<TE>   Although international humanitarian aid has been crucial in heading
off a famine and a worsening refugee situation, Afghanistan now needs
non-humanitarian aid, Abdullah said. The shattered country needs money to
cover everything from the back wages of government workers to the
purchase of windows, phones and desks for federal offices, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past few days, Afghan and U.N. officials have begun pleading
for relatively small sums to prop up the government of interim Prime
Minister Hamid Karzai while the transfer of larger aid packages is worked
out.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan has placed the cost of rebuilding at about $45 billion
over the next 10 years--a sum that few outside observers expect will be
pledged in Tokyo. In a study released Tuesday, the World Bank, U.N.
Development Program and Asian Development Bank estimated the cost of
reconstruction to be $15 billion over the next 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Brahimi's spokesman, Ahmed Fawzi, said Tuesday that the billions of
dollars can wait but that millions are needed immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Only $7 million of a promised $20 million had been wired into an
emergency start-up account by Monday night, Fawzi said.</TE>

<HD>Deadline Nears for Airport Baggage Screening Measures</HD>
<DH>Security: New interim plan includes matching bags to traveling
passengers. But critics see weaknesses that terrorists can exploit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As the airline industry scrambles to meet its first major security
deadline, government and aviation officials said they do not anticipate
major disruptions when new baggage screening measures go into effect
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta is scheduled to explain the
new measures in a speech today. However, the plan is only temporary,
until a system for checking all bags with specialized explosive detection
machines can be put in place.</LD>
<LD>   "The airlines have been particularly vocal about their preparedness,
which indicates to me that they are expecting this to go smoothly," said
Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which monitors
the industry. "There are probably some airports where they won't get it
right on the first day, but, by and large, we will get through it."</LD>
<TE>   However, some critics say the baggage screening measures are
insufficient because they leave loopholes that terrorists could exploit.</TE>
<TE>   Under the interim plan, airlines will use a combination of measures to
screen checked baggage, all of which were prescribed by Congress in a
transportation security bill passed late last year. Mineta initially said
he doubted the congressionally mandated deadline of Friday could be met,
but he later reversed that opinion.</TE>
<TE>   The basic screening technique, called bag matching, involves ensuring
that no bag is loaded into the cargo hold unless the passenger who
checked it also gets on the plane. In addition, a greater proportion of
bags will be searched by hand, with specially trained dogs or explosive
detection machines.</TE>
<TE>   Officials acknowledged that the combination of measures is not
guaranteed to stop a suicide bomber, but they said it represents a
tangible improvement. Until now, only a tiny proportion of checked bags
on domestic flights has been screened for explosives. These bags were
either picked at random or belonged to passengers flagged for closer
scrutiny by computerized profiling systems. And bag matching--a basic
security procedure employed by other nations--had only been required for
international flights.</TE>
<TE>   In preparation for bag matching, Delta Air Lines announced Tuesday
that it would no longer accept checked baggage less than 30 minutes
before a flight is scheduled to depart.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. airlines have long been opposed to bag matching on domestic
flights, and the new rules included a concession to the industry's fears
of widespread delays: Bag matching will only be required when a passenger
first boards a plane, and not on connecting flights.</TE>
<TE>   "They are giving the airlines a pass on the connecting bags," said
David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Assn., an advocacy group
for passengers. About one of every four travelers is a connecting
passenger.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Barnett, an MIT professor and aviation consultant, said that
making an exemption for connecting flights exposes travelers to some
additional risk.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that after this is introduced, people will find a way to
expand it to connecting flights," Barnett said. "It is still a big step
forward."</TE>
<TE>   Airlines could close the loophole by scrutinizing connecting bags more
closely when they are first accepted. They could simply use one of the
other approved methods: trained dogs, explosive detection machines or
hand searches. Industry officials refused to discuss specifics, but
Deborah McElroy, president of the Regional Airline Assn., said: "The
traveling public can rest assured that all checked bags will be
screened."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Congress wants all checked bags scanned using
state-of-the-art explosive detection machines. Lawmakers have set a Dec.
31 deadline to meet that goal.</TE>
<TE>   About 160 of the machines, which use CT technology similar to that in
medical scanners, are currently in service at airports around the
country.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. diplomats asked the interim government of Afghanistan for help
Tuesday in determining the status of Clark Russell Bowers, an American
whose family says he has been taken hostage while on a humanitarian
mission.</LD>
<LD>   The new U.S. liaison office in Kabul, the Afghan capital, took up the
case with Foreign Minister Abdullah, a State Department spokesman said.
The American diplomats had few other details about the case to share.</LD>
<LD>   Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker told reporters the United States
had asked for help "to develop further information based on the sketchy
reports that we do have." The Afghan Foreign Ministry promised to pass
the request to military and Interior Ministry.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, Amanda Bowers said her 37-year-old husband had called twice
during the last week by satellite phone to say that he had been taken
hostage by Afghan tribal warlords and was being held for $25,000 ransom.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement to the media outside her home in Harvest, Ala., Amanda
Bowers said her husband told her he had been driven around for several
hours blindfolded after he and an interpreter were seized.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they had no information substantiating Bowers'
kidnapping but that they were not ruling it out.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department said the incident, if true, is more likely to be
linked to crime rather than politics or the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Bowers' wife described him as a self-employed political consultant who
was on his second trip to Afghanistan since Sept. 11 to deliver
humanitarian goods, mainly medical supplies.</TE>
<TE>   But friends said they understood he was delivering Bibles to the
overwhelmingly Muslim country.</TE>

<HD>Trade Could Cure Jobless Ills, Bush Says</HD>
<DH>Politics: President courts public support for Senate bill to give
him more negotiating power with foreign countries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS
</DL>
<LD>Surrounded by the longshoremen of one of America's busiest ports,
President Bush expressed new worries about unemployment Tuesday and
prescribed a regimen of aggressive foreign trade to expand job
opportunities and lift the nation's sagging economy.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm worried about the loss of jobs," Bush said, telling the
workers--who needed little convincing--"if you trade more, there are more
jobs available for hard-working Americans."</LD>
<LD>   In courting public support for a bill pending in the Senate that would
grant him added leeway to negotiate trade pacts, Bush is doing what his
two immediate predecessors also did: remind workers in the industrial and
agricultural heartlands that millions of jobs rely on open trade, even as
cheaper manufacturing costs in distant lands may siphon some employment
away from the United States.</LD>
<TE>   It is an issue of growing concern as the administration pushes for the
expanded authority to negotiate trade agreements at a time when
unemployment in the United States is at a six-year high.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech in New Orleans to about 1,000 people gathered on a large
wharf capped a two-day swing in which he traced the route of farm
products--from the heartland, where John Deere makes huge farm machinery
in East Moline, Ill., to the fertile soils of Missouri and then to the
port where various agricultural products are loaded aboard ships for
overseas sales.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons I'm traveling down the spine of America and on the
mighty Mississippi is because I want to remind our fellow citizens how
important trade is," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to these workers that we trade. The people who are
loading these ships load them because we're trading around the world. The
farmers who are selling products can sell more if we trade. And if the
farmers sell more of their products, we can sell more of the machines
made in Moline, Ill."</TE>
<TE>   The trade-promotion trip is part of a travel schedule Bush has
undertaken in anticipation of themes and issues he will touch upon in his
Jan. 29 State of the Union address.</TE>
<TE>   With considerable ardor, Bush urged the Senate on Tuesday to "get me a
bill I can sign," as the crowd broke into sustained applause.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called fast-track legislation was approved last month on a
215-214 vote in the House and sent to the Senate. The Senate
traditionally has been more favorable to measures intended to remove
tariffs and other trade barriers, but the fast-track measure faces a
potential obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) has promised an early
vote, but only if the Senate also considers new assistance for workers in
industries hurt by imports.</TE>
<TE>   Pressing the Senate to act--and underscoring his focus on the
economy--Bush said: "This isn't a Republican issue, this isn't a Democrat
issue. Trade is a jobs issue."</TE>
<TE>   The president was still sniffling from a head cold, but he seemed to
have recovered from his brief fainting spell while watching football on
TV at the White House on Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   He continued joking about it in public, telling this food-loving city
that he dined Monday night at Antoine's, a famous New Orleans restaurant.
He added: "I didn't have any pretzels."</TE>
<TE>   What he did have, among other things, was baked Alaska. "I forgot how
good the food is. I'm going to have to spend about a week working off
that baked Alaska," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his head cold, the president uncharacteristically skipped
his daily exercise routine for two straight days, according to White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   He said Bush also showed him a slight indent on the bridge of his
nose, caused presumably by the frame of his glasses when he fell Sunday
and hit his head either on a coffee table or the floor or both.</TE>
<TE>   The fall also left a noticeable bruise on the president's left cheek.</TE>

<HD>Army Shifts to Lighter, Faster Tanks</HD>
<DH>Military: The phasing out of the M-1A-1 Abrams starts today,
signaling the need for a more mobile force for future conflicts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FT. LEWIS, Wash.
</DL>
<LD>They're heavy, they're slow, they smell bad. It takes 20 gallons of
gas just to start them, and once they get going, they sound like
screeching monsters. Sometimes--almost always, when the situation is as
unpleasant as the weapon--you just need a tank.</LD>
<LD>   But in modern warfare that doesn't necessarily require a 72-ton
behemoth with a 120-millimeter cannon, it's time to try something new.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the U.S. Army at Ft. Lewis begins phasing out its last M-1A-1
Abrams tanks, part of the transition to a new, lighter, more mobile force
the military says will be necessary for the conflicts of the future.</LD>
<TE>   The Army's remaining 44 main battle tanks here eventually will be
handed over to the Oregon National Guard, to be replaced by a fleet of
fast, lightweight Interim Armored Vehicles that will allow the Army to
deploy faster and deeper than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not for Desert Storm. It's not for when the North Korean
horde comes across the border. It's for "Oh, my goodness, we've got to
get to Afghanistan," Maj. Matt Venhaus explained Tuesday. If the Army had
had a force such as the one now being trained at Ft. Lewis after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he said, "on Sept. 12, we would have been in
Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   There has been much talk in recent years of building an Army of the
future, as conflicts in places such as Somalia, Kosovo and Afghanistan
point to the kind of chaotic, low-intensity warfare America will
increasingly be asked to conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Early last year, the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division at Ft. Lewis
became the first of six brigades to begin turning into the Army's first
new medium-weight combat brigade. Today, the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry
Division is launching its own move.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the old M-1A-1s were fired up, hauled into a garage,
inspected and repaired in preparation for the hand-over to National Guard
units. Mechanics began pulling out the huge, 1,500-horsepower turbine
engines, steam cleaning the tracks and aiming scopes down the barrels of
the long cannons. The repairs are expected to cost $250,000 for each tank
hauled down to Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   That any serious combat unit would be thinking of phasing out the
M-1A-1 tank, probably the most powerful land fighting vehicle in the
world, points up the dramatic changes in the nature of warfare that have
taken place since the tanks were first delivered to the Army in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   The $3.2-million Abrams was able to squash the Iraqi Republican
Guard's Soviet-built tanks in the 1991 Persian Gulf War on the wide
desert plains of Kuwait. It was designed for what many military
strategists, schooled in the Cold War, imagined would be a ferocious tank
battle with high-tech Soviet tanks somewhere in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, military officials say, the Cold War is over, and the Army
has been called to more missions over the last seven years than in the
previous 40 years--many of them in unpredictable urban areas where a tank
would take too long to get there and be virtually useless once it
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   While the Army is by no means phasing out its tanks--plenty of units
will keep them--the transformation at places like Ft. Lewis is intended
to provide the Army's first middle-ground alternative. The two
medium-weight combat brigades here are designed to be more heavily armed
than infantry units, faster and more mobile than tank brigades.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, said the 1st Brigade commander, Col. Harry Scott Jr., is to
have a force that can be deployed anywhere within 96 hours, equipped with
its own vehicles and support systems, reconnaissance teams and heavy
weapons, capable of taking on everything from peacekeeping missions to
urban warfare to traditional, major theater warfare when aided by other
combat units.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, as a light infantry brigade, I need 350 trucks that are not part
of my organization to move my soldiers," Scott said. "With this
transformation, I'm able to increase my mobility and my lethality."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the 1st Brigade will wind up later this year with more big
guns than it had before, because many of the new wheeled vehicles will
have 105-millimeter cannons attached to them. Still, there was a sense of
regret Tuesday as soldiers began preparations to ship out the tanks.</TE>
<TE>   "Arguably, this is the most lethal combat vehicle, right here, to ever
grace the battlefield. There's just simply nothing that can match it,"
said Lt. Col. Ernest Audino, commander of the unit within the 1st Brigade
that is giving up its tanks. "When you need critical combat power at a
critical time, the M1s can deliver it."</TE>
<TE>   The tank Audino rides into battle has the words "Whispering Death"
stenciled on its 17-foot-long cannon. His gunner, Sgt. Andrew Trimele,
said they chose the name based on what NATO forces in Europe called the
lumbering monster during exercises when it came up silently on them--the
deafening screech of its engines inaudible because it's projected behind
the tank. (Other M-1A-1s under inspection Tuesday: "Cancel Xmas,"
"Comgitsum," "Cardiac Arrest.")</TE>
<TE>   Trimele loves tanks so much he won't be staying for the
transformation; he's hoping to transfer to a tank brigade in Europe.
"Every time I go out in the woods and I fight this and we train in it,
I'm just amazed that I get paid to do this for a living," Trimele said.</TE>
<TE>   "I reenlisted in the Army to be on tanks," Trimele says. "The new idea
for an interim brigade is great. I fully support it. I just don't want to
be part of it. I love tanks too much."</TE>
<TE>   Said Spc. William Bower, who will be a crew member on one of the new
armored vehicles: "It's a mixed feeling. When you work in this [the
M-1A-1] you know it packs so much power, and you know it's the safest
vehicle on the battlefield. The turret alone in this weighs 23
tons--that's what the whole [interim] armored vehicle weighs."</TE>
<TE>   But he's willing to give it a try.</TE>
<TE>   Scott is prepared for his men's misgivings. "We're going to have some
soldiers who watched [the film] 'Patton' and always wanted to be a
tanker, and they don't want to give them up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The new vehicles, he said, are faster, roomier, and the ones equipped
with guns can shoot as far and as fast as a tank. "This is 2000
technology," he said. "That will excite them."</TE>

<LD>   The town of some 2,800 people is the site of the Doe Run Co.'s lead
smelter, the nation's largest. Tests over the years have found often
dangerous levels of lead in soil, on streets, inside houses, in schools

<HD>Catholic Church Faces Scrutiny in Pedophilia Case</HD>
<DH>Religion: Ex-priest's criminal trial is to open today, and the
Boston cardinal has been sued for his handling of the scores of
accusations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>In a case that promises to shed new light on how the Catholic
Church has dealt with pedophilia in the clergy, opening arguments are
expected to begin today in the trial of a former priest accused of child
molestation.</LD>
<LD>   John J. Geoghan, 66, faces one assault charge for allegedly putting
his hands down the bathing suit of a 10-year-old boy in 1991. But the
ex-priest faces two more criminal trials in other counties and at least
86 pending civil lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Additionally, 118 people have sued Bernard Cardinal Law, the
archbishop of Boston, who employed what is widely characterized as the
"geographic cure" when he transferred Geoghan from parish to
parish--despite warnings about the priest's questionable behavior.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors plan to depose Law in the case, a rare event for a Roman
Catholic archbishop in the U.S. It's unclear whether the prelate will
take the stand, but his testimony is expected to offer an unusual
portrait of how the church has handled a difficult problem that in recent
years had generated increasing attention. Pedophilia in the church had,
for years, been kept quiet, but recent lawsuits and public accusations
have forced church officials to confront the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the case has prompted a series of public apologies from Law,
who, on Sunday, while saying Mass, asked for prayers "for those who bear
the pain of these acts." Law also asked for prayers for himself as he
struggles with a problem the church long sought to deny.</TE>
<TE>   The numerous lawsuits against Geoghan, an area priest for more than 30
years, also caused church officials here to issue a new policy requiring
the reporting of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Under the policy, which Law announced last week, clergy, employees and
volunteers in the Boston archdiocese will be subjected to the same state
statute that requires teachers, social service workers and others to
report suspected child abuse. Information obtained during confession will
be exempt.</TE>
<TE>   In a painstaking attempt to guarantee a balanced jury, Superior Court
Judge Sandra L. Hamilton on Monday interviewed more than 60 prospective
jurors. One man who was rejected as a juror told Hamilton: "This [case]
is just shattering my faith in the priesthood."</TE>
<TE>   The case has received widespread publicity locally, including a
disclosure by the Boston Globe this week that Geoghan divested himself of
real estate worth more than $750,000 by transferring the land to his
sister. Then, claiming poverty, he received a court-appointed attorney.</TE>
<TE>   In the current case, Geoghan faces just one count of indecent assault
and battery on a person under the age of 14. The maximum penalty is 10
years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The abuse allegedly took place at a swim club in nearby Waltham, west
of Boston, where Geoghan was a priest in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Geoghan often urged parents to send their sons to the club, the
indictment in the case states. Sometimes, the indictment continued,
Geoghan recruited altar boys for his church at the swim club.</TE>
<TE>   Charges of rape of a child under 16 in a criminal trial set to begin
next month could put Geoghan behind bars for the rest of his life if he
is found guilty. That case also involves a swimming pool and a locker
room.</TE>
<TE>   The date for a third criminal trial involving two more counts of
indecent assault and battery on a child under 14 has not been set.</TE>
<TE>   In all, more than 130 people at a series of Boston-area parishes have
come forward to charge Geoghan with molesting them when they were as
young as 4. Statutes of limitation prevent criminal prosecution in most
of those cases.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials have admitted that they received repeated reports
about Geoghan's alleged activities. Though he underwent counseling and
psychiatric evaluation, Geoghan merely was transferred when suspicions
grew too strong, church officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, he was removed from his duties as a priest.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference last week, Law admitted that the way the matter
was handled was "in retrospect, tragically incorrect."</TE>

<HD>High Court Backs Agent Who Stopped Motorist</HD>
<DH>Ruling: In case of drug smuggling, justices say police need only a
reasonable suspicion, not evidence of a crime, to pull over a vehicle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court reaffirmed Tuesday that police have broad leeway
in deciding when to pull over vehicles and that they may rely on
innocent-looking actions as grounds for their suspicions.</LD>
<LD>   Even slowing down at the sight of a parked squad car or driving a
minivan can be a factor that weighs in favor of stopping a motorist, the
justices said.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous ruling revived marijuana-smuggling charges against an
Arizona man whose slow-moving minivan was stopped by a Border Patrol
agent near the Mexican border.</LD>
<TE>   More significant, the high court used the case to reiterate that there
is no "neat set of legal rules" to say when officers have the required
"reasonable suspicion" to stop a motorist.</TE>
<TE>   The pretext must be more than "a mere hunch" but can be well less than
actual evidence of wrongdoing, said Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
Officers can rely on a "common-sense inference" from what they observe to
decide when a vehicle should be pulled over. And judges should not
casually second-guess these decisions, Rehnquist added.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling marked another Rehnquist reversal of an opinion written by
Judge Stephen Reinhardt of Los Angeles, one of the liberal leaders of the
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist and Reinhardt differ on their interpretations of the 4th
Amendment, which forbids "unreasonable searches and seizures" by the
government.</TE>
<TE>Decision Reverses Los Angeles Judge</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist has insisted that judges should not tie the hands of police
officers. Reinhardt has argued that judges should protect the privacy of
pedestrians and motorists by limiting the police from conducting searches
without warrants.</TE>
<TE>   They clashed over a case that began on a January afternoon in 1998 in
southern Arizona. Agent Clinton Stoddard noticed a minivan traveling on a
dirt road north of Douglas, Ariz. Smugglers frequently take such back
roads to avoid checkpoints on the highways.</TE>
<TE>   When the minivan approached Stoddard, it slowed abruptly and the
driver sat rigid, avoiding eye contact. In the back seat were children
whose knees were visible, as if they were resting on something large.</TE>
<TE>   When the minivan suddenly turned onto another remote road, the last
turn before a checkpoint, the agent decided to stop the vehicle. After
questioning the driver, Ralph Arvizu, the agent learned that he lived in
a neighborhood known for smuggling and drug-dealing. Stoddard then
searched the minivan and found a duffel bag with 128 pounds of marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   When Arvizu appealed his case, the 9th Circuit ruled that it involved
an "illegal stop" because the agent had relied on too many innocent
actions as grounds for stopping the motorist.</TE>
<TE>   "Slowing down after spotting a law-enforcement vehicle is an entirely
normal response," Reinhardt wrote, and does not indicate criminal
activity. The same is true of driving a minivan and of failing to make
eye contact with a police officer. Moreover, the driver had committed no
traffic offenses, he said.</TE>
<TE>   It is important that courts "clearly delimit" the factors that warrant
the "stopping and questioning of citizens who are minding their
business," Reinhardt wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians have faulted the high court for giving police
unchecked authority to stop vehicles. This can lead to "racial profiling"
against minority motorists and can result in annoying and unwarranted
stops, they say.</TE>
<TE>ACLU Study Used by Defendant's Side</TE>
<TE>   One brief filed with the court noted that a study by the American
Civil Liberties Union found that of 34,000 highway stops by the
California Highway Patrol in 1997, only 2% resulted in arrests.</TE>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court took up the government's appeal in U.S. vs.
Arvizu, 00-1519, and reversed the 9th Circuit. The chief justice said
that searches should be judged by "the totality of the circumstances" and
that a variety of factors tipped the balance in favor of stopping Arvizu.
He was driving along a dirt road on a route used by smugglers and taking
actions that seemed intended to avoid the police.</TE>
<TE>   "Undoubtedly, each of these factors alone is susceptible to innocent
explanation," Rehnquist said. "Taken together, we believe they sufficed
to form a particularized and objective basis for Stoddard's stopping the
vehicle."</TE>

<HD>Anti-Bias Agency Can Sue, Despite Arbitration Deals</HD>
<DH>Judiciary: Justices rule that Congress intended for the federal
EEOC to have the right to enforce antidiscrimination laws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Federal civil rights lawyers can sue employers and win money
damages for workers who have suffered discrimination, even when the
workers have signed an agreement to arbitrate their disputes with
management, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-3 decision marks a partial reversal of a pro-arbitration ruling
handed down a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Its practical effect may be limited, however, since the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency charged with enforcing the
nation's job discrimination laws, intervenes in fewer than 1% of the job
bias cases filed each year.</LD>
<TE>   But with as many as 10% of U.S. workers covered by an arbitration
clause, workers' rights advocates said it was crucial that government
lawyers retain the power to come to the aid of ordinary workers who face
discrimination, especially when their companies have an advantage over
them.</TE>
<TE>   The case that reached the high court illustrated just that point.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Baker had been hired as a $5.50 per hour cook at a Waffle House
restaurant in Columbia, S.C., but he was fired shortly after suffering a
seizure at work.</TE>
<TE>   Baker later tried to sue his employer for illegal discrimination, but
the restaurant chain countered that he had signed a standard employment
agreement promising to arbitrate "any dispute or claim" involving his
job.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge and the U.S. Court of Appeals agreed that Baker's
agreement barred him from suing his employer in court.</TE>
<TE>   But the EEOC took up Baker's case, and its lawyers argued that it
would be unfair to force a low-wage worker into private arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   Hiring a judge for a few days can cost as much as $5,000, and an
arbitration agreement typically calls for both sides to split the cost.
Even if they were fired unfairly and in violation of the law, many
workers would be denied a hearing if they had to pay for the arbitration,
the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court took up the case of EEOC vs. Waffle House, 99-1823,
to consider whether arbitration agreements must always be honored, but
ruled instead that the agency's lawyers have the authority to sue on
behalf of individual workers.</TE>
<TE>   "A straightforward reading of the law" makes clear that Congress
wanted the EEOC to have the freedom to enforce the antidiscrimination
laws, Justice John Paul Stevens said for a liberal majority.</TE>
<TE>   The agency can seek back pay, reinstatement or money damages on behalf
of an individual worker, or it can take up the claims of groups of
workers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's authority extends across the spectrum of federal job
discrimination laws, which prohibit job bias based on an employee's race,
religion, gender, national origin, age or disability.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the right decision because it recognizes the EEOC is
furthering the public interest when it prosecutes cases of employment
discrimination," said EEOC Commissioner Paul Miller, a Clinton appointee.
"It's an inherently unfair situation if a company can say, 'You must sign
this binding agreement giving up your rights if you want a job here.' "</TE>
<TE>   Although the agency enforces the anti-bias laws, discrimination claims
are handled by private lawyers. In 2000, 79,896 complaints of employment
discrimination were filed, but only 402 resulted in lawsuits by the EEOC,
the commission said.</TE>
<TE>   Until Tuesday, the tide had been flowing strongly in the direction of
binding arbitration for job disputes.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the justices appeared to clear the way for employers
nationwide to insist on arbitration as a condition of getting a job. On a
5-4 vote, the high court ruled these private arbitration agreements must
be honored by the courts.</TE>
<TE>   This ruling, in Circuit City Stores vs. Adams, tossed out a lawsuit
brought by a gay computer salesman from Napa who said he had been
harassed by his co-workers and a supervisor. He had sued under the
state's civil rights laws.</TE>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court's conservative majority said that because the
salesman had signed an arbitration agreement, he was blocked from going
to court. Its opinion relied on the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925, a
measure originally intended to protect commercial agreements between
shippers and merchants.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's case did not address the status of the EEOC, however. This
year, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy switched sides
and joined the liberal bloc to uphold lawsuits filed by the EEOC.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Clarence Thomas, a former EEOC chairman, dissented and
complained that "employees will be allowed two bites at the apple." They
can bring an arbitration claim against their employer, and, later, the
EEOC can file a suit in court on their behalf, he said. He was joined by
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for employees had mixed reactions to the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to see the Supreme Court isn't going to force arbitration
on workers in all cases when they don't want it," said Lewis Maltby of
the National Workrights Institute in Princeton, N.J. Arbitration can be
beneficial, he said, but only if it is fair and voluntary.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Palefsky, a San Francisco attorney who represents employees,
called the decision "correct, but narrow. It does not provide any real
help for the millions of employees who have lost their ability to enforce
their civil rights. The EEOC does not have the resources to help all the
people who need it. There is still a desperate need for new legislation."</TE>
<TE>   Reps. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and 33
other House Democrats have introduced a bill that would allow workers to
sue on their own behalf regardless of arbitration agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Business lawyers were also divided.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Chamber of Commerce attorney Stephen Bokat said the ruling was a
minor setback. "We are certainly strong proponents of arbitration, and
this is not the outcome we would have liked. But the EEOC gets active in
only a small number of cases," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Employers say arbitration is quicker and cheaper than litigation, and
just as fair.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Lorber, a Washington business lawyer, worried that the ruling
would undercut the attractiveness of arbitration for corporations. "It
takes away the incentive to set up arbitration if you can't be sure it
will resolve the matter," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But San Francisco attorney Garry Mathiason, whose firm represents
thousands of employers, said the ruling would strengthen arbitration in
the long run.</TE>
<TE>   "This puts the EEOC in the role of policeman. They can police bad
arbitration systems and bring more balance and fairness to the system,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>2 Hurt in Shooting at N.Y. School</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A teenager opened fire in the hallway at a high school near Lincoln
Center on Tuesday, seriously wounding two students in what authorities
said may have been a dispute over a girl.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting on Manhattan's Upper West Side occurred at Martin Luther
King Jr. High School on what would have been the 73rd birthday of the
apostle of nonviolence. The public school has 3,000 students.</LD>
<LD>   Schools Chancellor Harold Levy at first said the shooting may have
been gang-related, but later said authorities believed the shooting was
because of a dispute concerning a girl. He said the suspect was an
18-year-old who had not been attending school.</LD>
<TE>   No arrests had been made in the case by Tuesday evening, police
spokesman Lt. Brian Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in school and we heard two gunshots," said senior Romain
Morrison, 17. "They were telling everyone to get out of the hallways."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Andrel Napper, 17, and Andre Wilkins, 18, were shot
from behind in a fourth-floor hallway. One was wounded in the back and
the other in the buttocks. Both were hospitalized Tuesday night; one was
in serious condition and the other was listed as stable.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkins' father, Wadell Parks, said he was grateful his son wasn't
paralyzed.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing we've got to deal with now is this issue of how this
other child, because he's a child as well, got into the school with a gun
and was able to try to kill my son and another of his classmates," Parks
said.</TE>
<TE>   A .380-caliber handgun was found on the fifth floor, along with three
shell casings, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Students were kept in their classrooms as police swept the building on
Amsterdam Avenue between 65th and 66th streets.</TE>

<HD>Kennedy's Tax Cut Salvo Is a Democratic Dilemma</HD>
<DH>Politics: The senator's plan to stall some of Bush's reductions
could hurt moderate party members, some say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The brewing congressional tussle over tax cuts won't be simple
partisan sport, pitting party against party. It also will reopen
divisions among Democrats over policy and political strategy in a closely
fought election year.</LD>
<LD>   That much should become clear today, when liberal icon Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.) proposes blocking the impending repeal of the
inheritance tax and suspending some of the income tax relief scheduled to
take effect for the nation's wealthiest classes--two key elements of the
2001 tax cut law that is a cornerstone of President Bush's economic
policy.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy is not the first Democrat to make such a proposal, but he is
by far the most prominent and powerful. And though it may not be
surprising from a liberal who opposed the tax cut in the first place,
Kennedy comes to the debate with a new standing as a cross-party deal
maker. He is fresh from reaching a bipartisan agreement on education
reform with Bush that the president has been touting as a model of how
Washington should operate.</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy's proposal, to be made in a speech at the National Press Club,
will mark a departure from the caution of Democratic congressional
leaders who have been shying away from openly advocating a delay in the
tax cut. Their fear is that such a proposal would revive the
tax-and-spend image the party has labored to shed.</TE>
<TE>   But a growing number of other Democrats are arguing that the 10-year,
$1.35-trillion tax cut signed into law last spring should be revisited in
light of the dramatically changed fiscal and political circumstances: the
war and a recession that have returned a surplus-laden federal budget to
deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy and the others argue that Congress cannot adequately finance
important domestic priorities unless it cancels some of the tax cut,
which is being implemented gradually over the next decade. Of the $1.35
trillion in tax cuts the law provided, only $101 billion worth took
effect in 2001-02.</TE>
<TE>   "Future additional tax breaks for the wealthy do not deserve higher
priority than strengthening education or covering prescription drugs
under Medicare or protecting Social Security or meeting other urgent
national priorities," Kennedy will say in the speech, according to a
source familiar with the prepared text.</TE>
<TE>   An aide said Kennedy will propose blocking income tax rate cuts
scheduled to take effect in 2004 and beyond for the top tax brackets. For
example, the top rate--which applies to annual income in excess of
$297,350--would be frozen at 38.6%, rather than dropping to 37.6% in 2004
and 35% in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   The aide would not say how many brackets the Kennedy plan would affect
but said the rate freeze would yield about $350 billion in revenue over
10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy also will propose keeping the inheritance tax in place for
estates in excess of $4 million. The levy now applies to inheritances in
excess of $1 million, but under the new law that threshold is scheduled
to rise gradually through 2009, with the tax fully repealed in 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy will be putting himself at odds with Bush, who argues that
delaying or repealing the tax cut would be tantamount to raising taxes in
the middle of a recession.</TE>
<TE>   The senator's speech also comes as tensions have risen between the
White House and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Daschle received widespread attention for
asserting that the Bush-backed tax cut had contributed to the economic
downturn and helped push the federal budget into deficit. But Daschle
stopped conspicuously short of calling for repealing or stalling any part
of the tax cut law. Democrats argue that it is Bush's responsibility to
propose a way out of the economic problems they say he caused.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle also has said it makes no sense to take the political risk of
pushing for tax changes that Bush would certainly veto.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even some of the Democrats who voted for the tax cut--including
Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and Reps. Ellen O. Tauscher of Alamo
and Lois Capps of Santa Barbara--have warmed to the idea of canceling
some of the cuts for upper-income people.</TE>
<TE>   As a party position, however, that would pose political risks for
several Democrats who supported the tax cuts and who are up for
reelection this year. Such risks could affect the party as a whole
because, with Democrats controlling the Senate by a one-vote margin, they
can ill afford to undercut even a single colleague with a weak hold on
his or her seat.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you have as one of your highest priorities to reelect the
moderate Democrats from South Dakota, Montana and Missouri on one hand,
then on the other hand blame them for voting for a tax cut that [Daschle]
maintains has created this recession?" said Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.).
"Hello?"</TE>
<TE>   Miller was among 12 Senate Democrats who voted for the cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.), who faces a
tough reelection fight, also does not want to rewrite the tax cut he
helped negotiate last spring. "He doesn't feel it's appropriate to
revisit the issue in the midst of a recession," said Baucus spokesman
Michael Siegel.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, frustrated by Daschle's refusal to openly call for
rolling back the tax cut, are eagerly awaiting Kennedy's speech to give
them a clearer target. And they hope to tar Daschle with the same brush
they use on Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   "We've said that the Daschle tax increase was coming, and now we've
seen Sen. Kennedy propose it," said Senate Republican Trent Lott
(R-Miss.).</TE>
<TE>   Added a White House official who asked not to be named: "Kennedy is
saying what Daschle wanted to say. Kennedy is just more blunt."</TE>
<TE>   Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for Daschle, denied that the senator is
pushing for a tax cut rollback but said he has no problem with other
Democrats doing so.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been Democrats on both sides of the tax issue from the
beginning," Schmelzer said. "They can express their views."</TE>

<HD>Administration Sticking With Clinton Pollution Suit</HD>
<DH>Policy: Ten power companies are targeted. But an upcoming EPA
ruling may weaken the case for the government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>After an eight-month review, the Bush administration announced
Tuesday that it will proceed with lawsuits filed by the Clinton
administration against polluting power companies because they are
consistent with the Clean Air Act.</LD>
<LD>   "The department takes seriously its obligation to enforce the laws
protecting our nation's environment," Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said in a
statement.</LD>
<LD>   However, a senior Justice Department official acknowledged that the 10
power companies are unlikely to settle the lawsuits before the
Environmental Protection Agency announces its expected weakening of the
rules that are central to the suits.</LD>
<TE>   At issue is whether the utilities broke the law by making
modifications to their facilities that significantly increased pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called new-source review provision of the 1970 Clean Air Act
requires companies to install modern pollution-control devices when
building new plants or modifying existing ones. The administration,
however, has been working on changes to the rules that would make them
more acceptable to industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's announcement only reinforces my puzzlement over why the
administration is about to undermine the very same laws they are
prosecuting," said John Walke, director of the clean air program for
Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, which
represents several of the targeted utilities, said the government's
decision to pursue the cases does not necessarily bode ill for its
clients.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Segal, an attorney who is a spokesman for the council, suggested
that the EPA could have difficulty prevailing in the cases if the
underlying regulations are changed.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of these highly technical regulations and the lawsuits filed
to enforce them could have immense implications for air quality,
particularly in the Northeast. Changes to the rules will be viewed by
environmentalists as a measure of how far the administration is willing
to go to satisfy the concerns of industry.</TE>
<TE>   A weakening of the regulations, which dictate what changes businesses
must make to their facilities to reduce pollution, is unlikely to render
the lawsuits moot, but it could result in settlements that are more
favorable for the utilities.</TE>
<TE>   Settlement terms are likely to be based on the requirements of rules
in force when the settlement is reached, rather than when the lawsuit was
filed, according to a senior Justice Department official, who spoke on
the condition that he not be named.</TE>
<TE>   The utilities targeted in the suits include Illinois Power Co. and
Dynegy Midwest Generation, Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Co.,
American Electric Power Service Corp., Ohio Edison Co., Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric &amp; Power Co., Alabama Power Co., and Duke Energy Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the administration ordered the Justice Department to review
the lawsuits and told the EPA to reassess the new-source review
regulation in the context of the administration's energy policy.
Utilities and manufacturing companies complain that the program
discourages them from making changes that would increase efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, most of the lawsuits have been in limbo.</TE>
<TE>   A settlement has been reached in the suit against Tampa, Fla.-based
TECO Energy, and the government has made agreements in principle with two
other companies, Cinergy Corp. and Virginia Electric Power Co., which had
not been sued.</TE>
<TE>   If the remaining eight lawsuits were settled along the same terms,
nationwide sulfur dioxide emissions would be reduced by at least 25%,
according to the EPA. Sulfur dioxide, the cause of so-called acid rain,
is one of the chief pollutants produced by coal-fired plants and has been
linked to heart and lung ailments that resulted in hospitalizations and
early deaths.</TE>
<TE>   A study by the environmental group Clean Air Task Force concluded that
if the 51 power plants operated by the sued companies installed modern
pollution controls, 4,300 to 7,000 premature deaths from respiratory and
cardiac problems would be prevented each year, along with tens of
thousands of asthma attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The new-source review program applies to all major polluting
facilities, including chemical and manufacturing plants, refineries and
pulp mills.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in several Northeastern states, which have joined the
federal government in suing the utilities, complain that delays and
proposed rule changes by the administration have harmed their citizens,
who live downwind from the massive coal-burning plants.</TE>
<TE>   "Every month the settlement sits on the table means another month we
have more asthma cases than we should have and more of our lakes and
forests are being killed," said Marc Violette, spokesman for New York
Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer.</TE>

<HD>Peeling Found in Flight 587's Tail Fin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Federal safety investigators said Tuesday they have discovered
internal damage in the tail fin of the American Airlines jet that crashed
in November in New York, but further testing is needed to determine
whether it occurred before or after the accident.</LD>
<LD>   The National Transportation Safety Board said NASA scientists
examining the 27-foot tail fin found that some layers of the advanced
composite material used to build it had peeled apart from each other, a
phenomenon known as "delamination." It was the first tentative indication
of possible flaws in the material.</LD>
<LD>   The Airbus A300 jet's tail fin broke off shortly after takeoff from
John F. Kennedy International Airport, and Flight 587 crashed into a
nearby neighborhood, killing all 260 aboard and five people on the
ground.</LD>
<TE>   The tail fin was built with composites, which are lighter and stronger
than most metals. Composites are built of many layers of carbon fibers
embedded in a special resin and molded together under heat and pressure.
They lose their strength when delamination occurs, because the layers of
material separate like pages of an open book.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB said its investigators continue to look for a mechanical
malfunction or structural defect that may have caused or contributed to
the accident. But they have not come across any evidence of an in-flight
explosion or fire that might indicate sabotage.</TE>
<TE>   "Some delamination has been noted," the NTSB said in a statement,
referring to the internal damage found in the tail fin. "But at this
time, it is not known whether this occurred before impact or as a result
of impact." An Airbus spokesman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB said tests at NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia will
"take many more months." Up to now, the tests have been conducted with
ultrasound and other scanning devices. New tests will be "more extensive
and intrusive," the NTSB said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are also scouring airplane junkyards for a tail fin from
another A300 to take apart. The tail fin--also known as a "vertical
stabilizer"--helps keep an aircraft flying straight. Engineers design
such components to be many times stronger than any forces a plane would
encounter in flight.</TE>
<TE>   Ever Barbero, an engineering professor at West Virginia University and
an expert on composites, said it will be very difficult to determine
whether the delamination was due to a preexisting flaw.</TE>
<TE>   "A failure of the material is not localized--it spreads," Barbero
said. "And when it spreads, it creates delaminations. Whether that
delamination was there before or after the crash, who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   The tail fin and the plane's rudder--pulled from Jamaica Bay about a
mile from the Queens neighborhood where the main fuselage crashed--showed
little visible damage. In the seconds before the crash, the flight data
recorder registered several sharp, unusual movements of the rudder, which
is part of the tail fin assembly and is used to help steer the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have not been able to determine whether those movements
were commanded by the pilots as they flew through the wake of a heavier
jet ahead, or whether they were caused by the tail starting to come off
or some other event.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus discovered a delamination in the tail fin of the plane while it
was still at the factory. But the company said the flaw was repaired
using approved procedures, and the aircraft was put into service with no
additional requirements beyond routine inspections.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Agency OKs Search for Oil in Fla. Preserve</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>A proposal to search for oil in the Big Cypress National Preserve
by detonating dynamite in 14,700 holes and drilling an 11,800-foot
exploratory well has won initial approval from the National Park Service.</LD>
<LD>   An environmental assessment issued Monday includes dozens of
stipulations intended to protect marshes, forests and wildlife within the
729,000-acre preserve that is a watershed for the Everglades and a home
to the endangered Florida panther.</LD>
<LD>   Collier Resources Co. still needs approval from the park service
regional director in Atlanta, the Army Corps of Engineers and the state.</LD>
<TE>   The company's plans include drilling the holes in a 41-square-mile
grid and detonating small charges of dynamite 25 feet underground in each
of them to record sound waves and look for oil. Collier Resources also
wants to build a 7 1/2-mile access road in the preserve.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists contend seismic testing, drilling and more roads,
pipelines and culverts would harm the panthers, alligators, black bears,
wading birds and dozens of protected species inside the preserve.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no better way to protect Big Cypress than to just not drill,"
said Shannon Estenoz of the World Wildlife Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club's Roderick Tirrell said he's concerned about potential
environmental damage caused by the access road, which could alter water
flows southeast into the Everglades.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate because we're spending so much money to restore the
Everglades," he said. "We feel that [Big Cypress] is a crucial watershed
because the eastern water is so mired in pollution, drainage and
development runoff."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Duncan, Collier Resources general manager, said the company
believes additional drilling won't affect wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The Collier family retained the mineral rights to their land when they
sold it to the federal government for the preserve in the 1970s. The
government allows oil drilling as long as it doesn't harm the preserve.</TE>
<TE>   The company draws about 2,200 barrels of crude oil daily from two well
fields at opposite ends of the preserve. More than 110 million barrels
have been extracted to date.</TE>

<HD>Scientist Says Race Was Factor in U.S. Spy Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SANTA FE, N.M.
</DL>
<LD>A nuclear weapon scientist once suspected of spying for China says
he was prosecuted because of his race in a book released Tuesday giving
his side of the government case that ended with all but one charge
against him being dropped.</LD>
<LD>   "My Country Versus Me," co-authored by Wen Ho Lee and journalist Helen
Zia, argues the FBI and prosecutors singled out the Taiwan-born scientist
because he is Chinese.</LD>
<LD>   "Had I not been Chinese, I never would have been accused of espionage
and threatened with execution," Lee writes of an FBI interrogation
session during which he says agents told him he faced the same fate as
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, executed in the electric chair in 1953 for
spying for the Soviet Union.</LD>
<TE>   Lee, 63 and a naturalized U.S. citizen, was fired from his job at the
Energy Department's Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico in March
1999 amid allegations of spying for China. He was held in solitary
confinement for nine months but never was charged with espionage.</TE>

<HD>A Regular Life in Unusual Times</HD>
<DH>Profile: Enron insider Sherron Watkins led a quiet existence before
becoming a key figure in the firm's scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>She goes to Bible study class and buys cookies from every Girl
Scout who comes to the door. She gave $40 to the neighborhood association
for tree planting, which earned her the rank of "regular," not quite
"patron" or "sustaining."</LD>
<LD>   Sherron Watkins, 42, became a national figure in the Enron Corp.
affair this week after the disclosure of her August letter warning fellow
company executives of questionable accounting measures. But friends say
Watkins, an Enron vice president, has tried not to let the growing
scandal at her company overwhelm her life.</LD>
<LD>   The last time Carrie Wood, Watkins' neighbor and former sorority
sister, saw her friend was Sunday. Wood asked how she was.</LD>
<TE>   "I've gotten an SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] subpoena,"
Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   "For documents? Or for you?" Wood asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Both," Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   But she appeared normal, Wood said, noting that "she was going off to
buy her daughter some shoes."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins lives in Southampton, a pleasant, tree-lined Houston
neighborhood with big but not extravagant houses nestled close together.
A few blocks away is Rice University, where she runs up the stadium steps
to keep fit.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins and her husband, Richard, who works in oil and gas financing
for a Canadian company, and their 2-year-old daughter live in a gray
saltbox-style home with a large American flag out front. On Tuesday
morning, television news trucks filled the street, but by afternoon they
had given up their quest for an interview and left.</TE>
<TE>   Like the street, the inside of the Watkins house was quiet,
domestic--golf clubs on the study floor, family photos on the walls and
tables, an empty beer bottle near the door. Richard Watkins had a
clipboard on which he was noting who called and what they wanted. It was
a long list.</TE>
<TE>   The husband didn't want to talk much, but neighbors were glad to offer
testimonials.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very professional--we keep it just neighbors," said Chris
Cagley, who lives across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Cagley worked for Enron too, as a contract employee, but he said he
never discussed office matters with Watkins. Her role in calling
attention to the questionable practices came as a surprise to him when he
picked up the Tuesday paper. He was filled with admiration.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how corporations are," he said. "No one wants to stand out,
to say anything bad. But Sherron wanted to inform people, to let them
know what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Watkins' attorney, Philip Hilder, was being besieged by the
news media in his new downtown offices, which are still under
construction. He did simultaneous TV interviews, perfecting the art of
saying nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "We fully anticipate we will be subpoenaed to appear" before Congress
and other regulatory hearings, he said repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   Hilder, a former federal prosecutor who specializes in white-collar
criminal defense, responded to one interviewer who asked if he had
handled a case like this before:</TE>
<TE>   "Has anybody handled anything like this before?"</TE>

<LD>\o7 A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard, observed,
worn, viewed, dialed or downloaded, it's in play here.</LD>
<LD>\f7    What: "SportsCentury: Sugar Ray Leonard"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN Classic, Friday, 5 and 8 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Sugar Ray Leonard says as this profile opens, "There is no greater
feeling than being on center stage in the ring." He also says his goal
"was to be world-wide known."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard's thirst for fame partly explains a career that included four
"retirements" before he quit for good in 1997 at 40. In his last fight,
against Hector Camacho, Leonard suffered his first knockout.</TE>
<TE>   As with most "SportsCentury" profiles, there are too many talking
heads. And boxing fans might complain there isn't enough fight footage.
But this edition ably captures Leonard in favorable and unfavorable
lights.</TE>
<TE>   "If Ali was the boxer of the '60s and '70s, Ray Leonard was the boxer
of the '80s," says Ross Greenburg, the president of HBO Sports.</TE>
<TE>   Highlighted is the first Leonard-Thomas Hearns fight in 1981,
considered by many as the fight of the '80s. Leonard rallied to stop
Hearns on a TKO in the 14th round.</TE>
<TE>   The two Roberto Duran fights get considerable play, particularly the
\o7 "no mas" \f7 fight in New Orleans when Duran quit in the ninth round.
The second Leonard-Hearns fight in 1989 and Leonard's matches with Marvin
Hagler also get more than cursory mention.</TE>
<TE>   Outside-the-ring topics include his detached retina, his drug problems
in the early 1990s--first revealed by The Times--and his failed marriage
to Juanita Wilkerson and his relationship with their sons, Ray Jr. and
Jarrel. Juanita, Ray Jr. and Jarrel are part of the show, as are brothers
Roger and Kenny, who worked for and were fired by Leonard. Leonard
married his current wife, Bernadette, in 1993 and they have two small
children. His new family is not part of the show.</TE>
<TE>   Juanita, who in the beginning says there are two Ray Leonards, in the
end says, "I truly believe the real Ray Leonard is in there somewhere but
Sugar Ray won't let him out."</TE>

<LD>Dan Le Batard of the Miami Herald commenting vehemently on the
Dolphins losing to the Baltimore Ravens in a playoff game:</LD>
<LD>   "Miami was ravaged and shamed by Baltimore, a defending champion in
more ways than one, and the 20-3 bullying was such that the careening
Dolphins were sent stumbling all the way into their off-season looking
lost and scared and impotent, a frightened child in a haunted place.</LD>
<LD>   "Miami has now made its past four playoff exits by the combined score
of 147-13, which is as preposterous as it is unfathomable."</LD>

<TE>   Mocking Moss: Fired Minnesota Viking coach Dennis Green will become a
TV fishing commentator.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't find a man more qualified to speak on bass than Green,"
said Steve Hummer of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   "After working so long with Randy Moss, he is a certified expert on
big mouths."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Moss: Mike Bianchi in the Orlando Sentinel: "The Minnesota
Vikings' coaching change will do Randy Moss good. Next year, under new
coach Mike Tice, I say Moss will give at least 78.3%."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Still more Moss: Fox analyst Marv Levy: "The difference between Randy
Moss and a dollar bill is, you can still get four quarters out of a
dollar bill."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Power failure: Tony Kornheiser in the Washington Post, on the
Indianapolis Colts' failure to acquire Steve Spurrier as coach: "You
don't think the Colts wanted Spurrier? With Peyton Manning, Edgerrin
James and Marvin Harrison? Are you kidding me? That would have been like
giving Roger Penske an 800-horsepower engine to tinker with."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   His new toy: Mike Lopresti in USA Today wonders how Spurrier and
Washington Redskin owner Daniel Snyder will co-exist: "You knew Snyder
would just have to have him, and be the first owner on the block with a

weather, its beaches, its lifestyle, its star power.</TE>
<TE>   "[Yet,] on a gorgeous afternoon, perfect for playoff football, the

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: TV analyst Danny Ainge, a former Portland Trail Blazer,
doesn't mince words when it comes to the team's myriad problems, blaming
most of them on management: "The Rasheed [Wallace] thing has gotten
worse, not better, over time, and the Shawn Kemp thing is a nightmare
that really hurt the franchise.</TE>

<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Golfer Casey Martin had surgery Tuesday at Sacred Heart Medical
Center to remove potentially deadly bacteria from his withered right leg.</LD>
<LD>  His agent, Chris Murray, said Martin will be hospitalized for about a
week and spend six to 10 weeks in rehabilitation.</LD>
<LD>  Martin has Klippel-Trenaunay-Webber Syndrome, a degenerative
circulatory disorder in his right leg that makes it extremely painful for
him to walk more than a short distance.</LD>
<TE>  Martin recently had surgery in Denver to improve the blood flow in his
right leg. After a second operation, an infection developed.</TE>
<TE>  In 1998, Martin won a federal lawsuit against the PGA Tour for the
right to use a golf cart in tour sanctioned events.</TE>
<TE>  The decision was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court last year.</TE>

<HD>NCAA's Dempsey Will Retire at End of the Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cedric Dempsey is retiring as NCAA president, ending a nearly
nine-year run with the college sports governing body that included the
signing of two major television contracts.</LD>
<LD>   Dempsey played an instrumental role in the NCAA's contracts with ESPN
and CBS that will generate $6.2 billion over 11 years beginning in 2003.
He also led the restructuring of the organization's governing body, and
presided over the NCAA's move from Overland Park, Kan., to Indianapolis
in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Dempsey, 69, said Tuesday he will retire at the end of the year after
holding the organization's top job since 1994.</LD>
<TE>   "My challenge over the remainder of my term is to counsel those
engaged in creating change--both in terms of reform and bringing new
leadership," Dempsey said in a written statement. "I look forward to that
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Dempsey, a former athletic director at Arizona, said he wrestled with
whether to seek a contract extension or retire.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's time to move on, so I will do that," Dempsey said. "I've
been thinking about it for a while."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement came on the final day of the NCAA's annual convention
at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the NCAA is where it is today because of Ced," said Bob
Lawless, chairman of the NCAA's executive committee and president of the
University of Tulsa.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been a real treasure for the NCAA."</TE>
<TE>   Lawless will head the search for a successor to Dempsey, the third
leader of the NCAA in its 96-year history.</TE>
<TE>   University of Georgia police are investigating a report of rape and
attempted rape at a dormitory that allegedly involved athletes, associate
athletic director Claude Felton said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an incident at McWhorter Hall and there were
student-athletes involved," Felton said.</TE>
<TE>   He would not identify the athletes but said their coaches were aware
of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   University police Chief Chuck Horton said a female student said she
was raped by a man she knew and that a man she did not know tried to rape
her Monday night.</TE>
<TE>Speedskating</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Plain-Dealer reported Tuesday that a second athlete has
accused Apolo Anton Ohno of race-fixing at last month's U.S. Olympic
trials.</TE>
<TE>   The paper said Ron Biondo essentially backed up the allegations made
by Tommy O'Hare, a skater who did not make the Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   O'Hare filed a complaint alleging Ohno conspired with teammate Rusty
Smith to fix a race at the trials.</TE>
<TE>   Biondo finished fourth in the 1,000-meter final. He had to beat Smith
to qualify for one of the two individual spots on the team, but claims
that Ohno kept blocking him so that Smith would get the spot.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno had locked up his spot on the team and said he didn't want to
risk an injury with a daring move. He finished third behind Smith and
race winner Shani Davis, whose victory knocked O'Hare off the team.</TE>
<TE>   Biondo said Smith reciprocated by letting Davis, a close friend of
Smith and Ohno, win the race. Davis had to finish first to earn enough
points to overtake O'Hare for the sixth and final spot.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno has denied any wrongdoing in the race, the only one he didn't
win.</TE>
<TE>   Biondo made the team but will skate only in the relay.</TE>
<TE>Soccer</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Kasey Keller, who has been playing in England, will rejoin
the U.S. team for the CONCACAF Gold Cup, the championship of soccer's
North and Central American and Caribbean region.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. opens against South Korea on Saturday at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also added former Colorado Rapid coach Glenn Myernick as an
assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime stars Brandi Chastain, Kristine Lilly, Tiffeny Milbrett and
Julie Foudy were among 13 WUSA players selected for the U.S. women's team
that will play in the Four Nations tournament in China this month.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Mia Hamm is injured and not on the roster.</TE>
<TE>Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   The Olympic hopes of Austrian skier Josef Strobl, winner of seven
World Cup races, ended when he shredded knee ligaments in a crash during
downhill practice at Kitzbuehel, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to have surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Oleg Lisogor of Ukraine won his third race in two days, capturing the
men's 100-meter breaststroke in a FINA World Cup swim meet at Imperia,
Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rica's Claudia Poll took the women's 100 and 400 freestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Tonya Harding's landlord filed a lawsuit Monday to evict the former
Olympic figure skater and her roommate from a three-bedroom riverfront
home at Vancouver, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Dale E. Anderson claims Harding and her former manager, Linda Lewis,
owe him $4,530 in rent, according to court documents.</TE>

<HD>Fear of Civilian Deaths May Have Undermined Effort</HD>
<DH>Some argue that the Pentagon's obsession with 'collateral damage'
has actually raised the long-term cost in lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The war isn't over, but already Pentagon and intelligence agency
teams are going to Afghanistan for a post-mortem on U.S. weapons and
tactics. The Air Force has launched a similar effort, code-named
"Enduring Look."</LD>
<LD>   Yet neither of these studies, nor any others planned thus far, is set
to dig deeply into one of the toughest problems of the war--civilian
casualties.</LD>
<LD>   The omission reflects what may seem a surprising fact: Behind a screen
of self-congratulatory public statements by senior officials, the U.S.
military is tied in knots over the issue, known euphemistically as
"collateral damage."</LD>
<TE>   Since the Afghan war began more than three months ago, fear of
criticism about civilian casualties has spread through the Pentagon "like
a virus," as one senior commander put it. And, unfair as they consider
such criticism, senior officials admit that it has influenced wartime
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some charge that obsessive attention to safeguarding
civilians has undermined military effectiveness, fueled interservice
rivalries and hurt morale. Worse, these officials say, it has increased
the likelihood of Al Qaeda chieftains escaping because of its pervasive
influence on U.S. strategy.</TE>
<TE>   And, they argue, focusing too much on bad public relations about
casualties has raised the long-term cost in lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Collateral damage considerations are considerations that need to be
weighed against mission accomplishment," a senior military officer said.
But he said he feels that a culture of hesitation has infected the
military at all levels.</TE>
<TE>   "In an environment in which [each reported incident] is autopsied,
these become more than considerations. They become the first thing people
think about," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In such a climate, the last thing some officials want is a detailed
examination of the issue. First, they think, that could lead to measuring
success by "body count." At the same time, it could open up military
commanders to a level of public scrutiny that they believe ultimately
infringes on command prerogative.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the military is paying a price for withholding detailed
information about civilian casualties and for its failure to engage in
open discussion about what U.S. policy should be.</TE>
<TE>   A gulf of mutual suspicion has opened between the Pentagon and critics
in the global human rights community--critics who have had a substantial
impact on military decision-making, regardless of what professional
soldiers think about them.</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty International has demanded "an immediate and full
investigation into what may have been violations of international and
humanitarian law" as a result of "indiscriminate attacks" by the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   James E. Jennings, president of Conscience International, wrote in
early December, "The total number of war victims in Afghanistan equals or
exceeds those killed on our own soil on Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   And a University of New Hampshire professor has released a tally based
on news reports suggesting that the number of civilian deaths from the
U.S. campaign exceeds 4,000.</TE>
<TE>Pentagon Looks to Past Conflicts</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, the Pentagon has responded by sidestepping specifics and
broadly defending its record compared with past conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, for instance, amid a slew of news reports and editorials
addressing civilian losses, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said, "I
can't imagine there's been a conflict in history where there has been
less collateral damage, less unintended consequences."</TE>
<TE>   And defense officials were pleased when the Dalai Lama, the exiled
spiritual leader of Tibet, said the Afghan war is unlike Vietnam, Korea
or World War II. "The American side is very, very carefully selecting
targets, taking maximum precautions about the civilian casualties," he
said early in the war.</TE>
<TE>   One indicator of the Pentagon's sensitivity was a meeting that
Rumsfeld held in November with a dozen religious leaders--an open
discussion about the moral limits on war. According to one participant,
Rumsfeld was clearly frustrated.</TE>
<TE>   Vice Adm. Thomas Wilson, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency,
described how targets were determined. He insisted that the United States
was using just enough ordnance to "do the job" without causing excessive
civilian deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Loconte of the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, who
also attended the meeting, quoted Wilson as saying that the Pentagon had
opted to "slow the pace of the campaign and increase the risk of the
people executing it" because of legal restraints and "moral values."</TE>
<TE>   War planners frequently chose not to hit particular targets, even if
they were considered important in purely military terms, Wilson said, and
pilots were complaining about lost opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone so far the other way" in adopting measures to avoid
harming civilians, a senior officer declared, that "it drives targeters
and planners crazy believing that the system is overcompensating."</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every attack must be approved by Central Command in Florida,
this officer said, and the percentage of precision-guided weapons being
used is rising drastically.</TE>
<TE>   Yet "the U.S. still gets blasted for not being sensitive," this
officer complained,</TE>
<TE>   He and others expressed frustration that neither the media nor the
public understands the considerations behind the Pentagon's reluctance to
engage in a detailed debate about specific incidents.</TE>
<TE>   One reason, the senior officer said, is to avoid providing the enemy
with information about the "thresholds" for American action. "If the U.S.
said we did or didn't bomb A or B because of some specific reason, then
the enemy would have a recipe book for not being bombed," the officer
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to give the bad guys a no-hit list," the officer said.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason given for not defending each incident in public is
concern that information supplied by the Pentagon may later be used in
international courts to try to hold pilots or targeters legally
responsible.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone acknowledges that attention to the issue of civilian losses
has become one of the conditions under which Americans wage modern
warfare. But many officers say that disproportionate attention is paid to
the issue--with a consequent tendency to hold back that has undesirable
consequences of its own.</TE>
<TE>   So heavily does the issue weigh on those most closely involved in
fighting the war that Lt. Gen. Chuck Wald, the early air war commander
for the campaign, said he felt a continuous need to act as a cheerleader
for his staff in the Combined Air Operations Center, according to
officers there.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here because of dead Americans," Wald would find himself saying
almost daily as he urged those choosing targets not to be too cautious.</TE>
<TE>Interservice Squabbles Arise</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the issue of civilian casualties has become ammunition
for interservice battles. "You don't let the Air Force bomb stuff and
take some risk," an officer said. "No wonder, then, that the Army and the
pundits argue you have to have boots on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't have a better air campaign because collateral-damage
concerns stopped obvious military missions, like interdicting moving
targets," another officer said. "When everybody's telling you a civilian
structure is nearby, [that] there might be refugees in that column, we
can't see inside a truck, [so] we end up not bombing the bad guys."</TE>
<TE>   "If Osama bin Laden is in a mosque, I'd take it down," another said,
although in the present climate that probably would not happen.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has
promised an accounting, saying, "You have to find out what the ground
truth is, and we will do that,"</TE>
<TE>   But so far, at least, no major official effort is underway to
establish such facts.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Wald set up a special desk in the Combined Air Operations Center
to examine incidents of civilian deaths. He was motivated in part by the
fact that Pentagon and Central Command officials inquired about every
such incident. But this is an informal effort that is not publicly
acknowledged and it is not matched in any methodical way at the Defense
Intelligence Agency or elsewhere in the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is there likely to be any exposition of numbers of dead or
mistakes made--not with Rumsfeld on the record as saying, "Nobody wants
to see a single civilian death."</TE>
<TE>   "Look what we're reduced to," an officer complained, pointing to what
he sees as Rumsfeld's defensive stance. "We're the most careful in the
world? I cannot imagine us being more careful about minimizing civilian
casualties.</TE>
<TE>   "But how about we're the most deadly? How about, if you're a bad guy,
we're going to kill you?"</TE>
