<HD>Kidnap Dramas Collide With Life</HD>
<DH>Television* Plot lines focusing on missing children are
coinciding with reality.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The small blond girl peeks out from her upstairs bedroom, anxious
about the clamor downstairs where her parents are hosting a
boisterous party populated with swingers. Soon after she retreats to
her bed, her door slowly opens, and she gazes at a stranger. Hours
later, police are investigating her disappearance.</LD>
<LD>   The little girl is not Danielle Van Dam, the 7-year-old girl
kidnapped from her San Diego home and murdered in a nationally
watched case that culminated this week in the conviction of her
neighbor, David Westerfield.</LD>
<LD>   The youngster in this situation is actress Jenna Boyd, and the
scene is from CBS' hit "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation." And the
"investigator" looking for her is David Caruso, the star of the new
spinoff "CSI: Miami." The episode aired in May and will repeat Sept.
16, leading into the premiere of the new drama.</LD>
<TE>   In a notable collision of fiction and fact, a number of new and
returning dramatic TV shows are showcasing kidnappings as a major
theme at a time when news broadcasts are dominated by the Van Dam
case, the recent snatching of 4-year-old Jessica Cortez from Echo
Park, the kidnapping and slaying of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion and
the abduction and rape of Lancaster teens Tamara Brooks and
Jacqueline Marris. TV watchers would be excused for assuming this is
simply another example of Hollywood seeking ratings by exploiting
other people's misfortunes. But what may be most surprising about the
dramatic intersection of news and entertainment is that it's largely
coincidental.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, kidnapping has been a perennial dramatic theme, a reliable
narrative device on just about every police series. What's different
about the current flow of abduction-themed shows is their presence
amid the even larger flood of news reports about children in peril.
So while the evening dramas may have been conceived in the relative
solitude of writers' minds, they hit close to home by so closely
overlapping the nightly news.</TE>
<TE>   UPN's new supernatural drama "Haunted" is one of the shows
showcasing kidnappings. In the first episode of that series, which
will premiere next month, anguished parents confront a private
investigator searching for their son, who has been kidnapped by a
vicious criminal.</TE>
<TE>   Far from drawing scorn from advocacy groups, the abduction-themed
programs are largely getting a thumbs-up from those on the front
lines. Advocates for the families of kidnapped children may object to
the easy resolutions that mark television programs, but otherwise
seem to welcome the attention the issue is getting from network
programmers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some producers have been shaken by the sudden and
unexpected relevance of their projects.</TE>
<TE>   When Emile Levisetti, one of the executive producers for
"Haunted," was helping to develop the first episode, the missing
child plot was merely a dramatic device designed to introduce the
main characters and theme of the show.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been living with this story on 'Haunted' for more than a
year," Levisetti said. "But this July, I could see that things were
beginning to change. Now people may watch it with a little more
gravity.</TE>
<TE>   "....If we were selling our show now," Levisetti said. "I don't
know if this is the story we would have chosen. But we don't have any
regrets. We will not be having any other missing children in our
upcoming episodes."</TE>
<TE>   "We are acutely aware of the sensitivity surrounding kidnappings,"
said Howard Gordon, one of the executive producers of Fox's "24."
"It's occupying the whole world we're living in now. We're not
exploiting it. But we're not writing away from it, either."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said the correlation between fictional kidnappings and the
coverage of high-profile kidnappings resembles concerns in Hollywood
following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. "24" was just one of the
television and film projects that altered or eliminated plot elements
that veered too close to details about the bombings. A depiction of a
plane exploding was edited out of the series' first episode.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to "CSI: Miami," "Haunted" and "24," other recent or
upcoming shows dealing with the kidnapping of youths include:</TE>
<TE>   * The July 28 episode of NBC's reality legal drama "Crime and
Punishment," which featured the trial of a man accused of kidnapping,
attempted murder and child abuse when a 12-year-old girl is found
tied up in his apartment.</TE>
<TE>   * The pilot of FX's critically acclaimed police drama "The
Shield," in which a young girl was taken by her drug-addicted father
and sold to a child molester, who keeps her locked up in the basement
of an abandoned house.</TE>
<TE>   * The pilot of CBS' new fall drama "Without a Trace," about the
FBI's Missing Persons Squad, centering on a young career woman held
against her will by a co-worker.</TE>
<TE>   * "Hack," an upcoming CBS drama starring David Morse as an
ex-cop-turned-taxi-driver who seeks to redeem his troubled past by
helping others. In the pilot episode, one of his fares--a tearful
father (Conor O'Farrell)--asks the cabbie to locate his missing
teenage daughter, who had been corresponding via the Internet with an
unknown man. It turns out the man is holding the girl prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Carter, an executive producer on "Hack," said that the
torment the father feels about his daughter's disappearance coincides
with the trauma experienced by the families of kidnapped children.</TE>
<TE>   "We see a father who does not know where his child is, and the
anguish of that," Carter said. "This is a very human reaction, a real
dealing with emotional distress."</TE>
<TE>   For all of these fictional projects on episodic shows, there have
thus far been no TV movie projects announced that would dramatize
this summer's kidnap tales, along the lines of the Emmy-nominated
1989 film "I Know My First Name Is Steven"; the drama was based on
the case of Steven Stayner, who was abducted at age 7 and sexually
abused for seven years before escaping. Of this summer's photogenic
news, the tale of trapped miners more quickly drew the attention of
the TV movie producers.</TE>
<TE>   For now, law enforcement officials are unconcerned about TV's
spate of kidnapping shows, saying there is no indication that the
shows are exploiting tragedies or sparking copycats.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole issue of youth abductions has been a closet issue on
some levels; Hollywood does not always represent this problem
accurately," said Georgia Hilgeman-Hammond, executive director and
founder of the Vanished Children's Alliance, one of the country's
oldest missing children's foundations.</TE>
<TE>   "But a lot of people do learn about this through television shows.
It's the responsibility of the producers to try and depict this
problem as realistically as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Kidnapping experts also point out that despite the high profiles
of the cases, the number of kidnappings of young people is actually
down from previous years.</TE>
<TE>   "Abductions of children by strangers is one of the rarest crimes,"
said Jenni Thompson, director of public affairs for the Polly Klaas
Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on missing and abducted
children, named after the 12-year-old Petaluma girl abducted from her
home at knifepoint and murdered. "Of all the crimes against children
in general--murder, rape, sexual abuse--less than 1% of all missing
children are kidnapped by strangers."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Thompson added, "all this media coverage has made this even
more of a scary reality."</TE>
<TE>   While the anguish of families or survivors of lost children may be
aggravated by such fictional fare--which almost always concludes with
the safe recovery of the victims and a happy ending--law enforcement
experts and leaders of several advocacy organizations specializing in
missing children see some value in the current stream of fictional
dramas, even though they say the situations are often less than
authentic.</TE>
<TE>   "The more people see these kinds of shows, the more they may
realize that these kinds of things can happen, and they can do
something about it," said Randy Aden, a supervising special agent
with the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Stories of abductions--whether rooted in reality or told from a
more fantastical perspective--are a regular plot line in network TV.
Hart Hanson, an executive producer of CBS' "Judging Amy," which has
explored child kidnappings from a legal and societal perspective,
said the aspects of abductions "have all the hallmarks of good drama.
There's the ticking clock, the high stakes, the emotions. It's good
for bombs going off, which isn't our show at all."</TE>
<TE>   In almost every instance, the child is located alive and basically
unharmed, "which may often not be the result in reality," said
Hilgeman-Hammond.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Morena, a case manager with Child Quest International, an
organization devoted to the protection and recovery of missing,
abused and exploited children, said that families dealing with lost
children find that the fictional story lines often trivialize the
real-life trauma of the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "For these people, it's a daily way of life, and we'd like to see
some of these producers show more responsibility rather than
displaying this false sense of security," Morena said. "When a child
is found on television, it's like everyone is ecstatic, it's one for
the good guys, everyone is happy, when in fact the probability of
that happening is low."</TE>
<TE>   Though the abductions on "24" may have disturbed some viewers,
Gordon said their predicament was essential for the story.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted this show to be a mirror of society," he said. "People
who want a 'blue sky' show perhaps should not watch us. We're not
afraid of the unhappy ending. Lots of bad things happen. It's sort of
our theme. These are scary times and the world is a scary place."</TE>
<TE>   "24," at times targeted by critics as being too melodramatic in
having Kim in constant peril from abductors, will deal directly with
the aftermath of her ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole gist of this season will revolve around Kim and Jack
dealing with this," Gordon said "The story will be informed very
heavily by her abduction. She will be put in a position where she can
help someone."</TE>
<TE>   The Polly Klaas Foundation's Thompson said she did not feel the TV
dramas were being exploitative, and hoped that the shows will spark
more public dialogue about abductions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a crime people really need to understand, and maybe a TV
show will get them to talk and think about it," she said. "Maybe it
will push them to a place where they will take action. It's a
positive step."</TE>

<HD>Insider Dish: Griffin Tells Tales on the Stars</HD>
<DH>The comedian, during her act at the Laugh Factory, trades
her show-biz access for laughs, skewering a few big Hollywood names.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Good celebrity dish, like navigating a Costco or missile defense, is
best left to the professionals.</LD>
<LD>   You have to be a patient and thoughtful consumer of TV (enduring
an entire "E! True Hollywood Story" for that one sublimely stupid
tidbit, for instance). And you must understand how to read the
supermarket tabloids, which are to "Entertainment Tonight" what the
Nation is to Highlights.</LD>
<LD>   Kathy Griffin reads the tabs like a Talmudic scholar.</LD>
<TE>   In an age not only of celebrity but of media outlets like InStyle
magazine--which helps craven stars rip off the public by fetishizing
their purses, candles and kitchen tiles--Griffin blows into the room
and says, in effect, "Stop the insanity."</TE>
<TE>   At the Laugh Factory in West Hollywood, where the comedian is
performing a solo show Wednesday nights through Oct. 30, Griffin got
going on celebrity adoption.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know who's running Thailand now, but they need to stop
handing those kids out like candy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   " ... Now it's like the hot thing in Hollywood. Crack babies are
so last year. You've got to have a Thai baby.... It worked wonders
for Angelina. Angelina Jolie with her Thai baby is now mother of the
year. I like how since that breakup, all of a sudden there's pictures
of her dressed in, like, a soccer mom shirt and a skirt at the park
playing with her Thai baby. Where's the vial of blood? I mean, I
don't forget."</TE>
<TE>   It was a reference to the fact that Jolie and her estranged
husband, actor Billy Bob Thornton, publicly celebrated their love by
wearing necklaces with tiny vials of each other's blood.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin not only doesn't forget this stuff, she uses it
journalistically, unlike the happy amnesiacs who exchange idolatry
for access.</TE>
<TE>   But even their position on the red carpet can't compare to the
up-close-and-personal glimpses that Griffin, a comedian and actress,
has gotten as a show business initiate. Indeed, part of the reason
Griffin is doing these Laugh Factory shows is to position herself for
greater exposure.</TE>
<TE>   You don't quite trust which side she's on, but Griffin has been a
double agent for years--co-starring, on the one hand, in "Suddenly
Susan," one of those deplorable "Friends"-inspired sitcoms NBC
crammed down the public's throat in the late '90s, and on the other
going up in clubs and on talk shows to tell tales out of school.</TE>
<TE>   Followers of L.A. stand-up shows like the decade-old Uncabaret,
which is running at the Knitting Factory in Hollywood, have long
enjoyed the behind-the-scenes anecdotes of the comedian-actor-writer
types in town.</TE>
<TE>   The shows tend to be a mixed bag of on-point viciousness and
solipsism. Griffin, an Uncab regular, has enough eyewitness dish to
keep her two-hour Laugh Factory show from lagging.</TE>
<TE>   Her show is raunchy. It's Joan Rivers-esque but without the
plastic surgery and the daughter. With her flaming red curls and
toned figure, Griffin seems like just the sort of person you want on
the next Stairmaster, as she tells you which stars she likes and
doesn't like. She's got a lot to say about trash TV--the Fox show
"American Idol" is a guilty pleasure. And make no mistake: As much as
Griffin loves to expose her tabloid divas, she longs to be one
herself. "I've been in the tabloids twice just for the [expletive]
I've said in this show," Griffin told the audience, beaming. "So call
it in."</TE>
<TE>   She recounted her recent appearance on "Hollywood Squares," when
she found herself having lunch backstage with, among others, Anna
Nicole Smith, Little Richard and Chaka Khan.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, Griffin said, couldn't make sense of her polenta, and
Little Richard couldn't make sense of Smith. Griffin, meanwhile, took
plenty of mental notes.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the bigger the star, the more the audience
enjoys Griffin's trashing of them. "Sex and the City" star Sarah
Jessica Parker is taken to task for her fake award show voice,
wherein she clutches an Emmy or Golden Globe every year and says,
haltingly: "I ... am ... so ... profoundly ... thrilled ... by ...
this ... honor ... which ... I ... never ... ever ... saw ...
coming."</TE>
<TE>   Julia Roberts as America's Sweetheart? Give Griffin a break. "She
will ... cut you in a heartbeat," Griffin said, adding that the only
reason Roberts married cameraman Daniel Moder was because
ex-boyfriend Benjamin Bratt posed on the cover of Vanity Fair with
new wife Talisa Soto.</TE>
<TE>   In Griffin's delicious version of things, an inflamed Roberts
wouldn't be upstaged. "Oh no, no, no," Griffin imagines Roberts
saying. "Not on my watch."</TE>
<TE>   Gwyneth Paltrow gets worse. Griffin recalls how the lithe actress
had the nerve to promote the recent comedy "Shallow Hal," in which
Paltrow played a 300-pound woman, as an empowerment film for
overweight women. "This movie teaches us that you shouldn't judge a
book by its cover," Griffin quotes Paltrow as saying.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, really? Like the guys you go out with, Gwyneth? Like when you
went out with big, fat, ugly Brad Pitt? Or chubby Ben Affleck? Or tub
of lard Luke Wilson?"</TE>
<TE>   If Griffin means to take us into her confidence, she's playing the
right angles. When she strays into politics, she seems a tad out of
context. Celebrity, after all, is now our common language, our
collective frame of reference. It's a sorry state of affairs, and
Griffin couldn't be more pleased.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Griffin performs Wednesday nights at 8 at the Laugh Factory,
8001 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, through Oct. 30. Tickets are $15.

<HD>Non-Russian Fare Stymies Singers</HD>
<DH>Galina Gorchakova and Sergei Leiferkus are fine in
Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. Puccini and Verdi, however ...</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An evening of Russian and Italian opera excerpts served as the second
and final performance by the touring Russian National Orchestra at
the Hollywood Bowl on Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Alexander Vedernikov, recently appointed as music director of the
Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, led this engaging program, his soloists
two popular Russian singers well known in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   In the Russian half of the program, soprano Galina Gorchakova and
baritone Sergei Leiferkus excelled in arias by Tchaikovsky and
Rachmaninoff, their vocal and dramatic abilities nicely displayed.</LD>
<TE>   In the first half, in familiar music by Puccini and Verdi, both
singers proved the opposite of comfortable and were very often in
vocal trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Gorchakova, who appeared last season with the opera companies of
Los Angeles and San Diego and who is scheduled to return to San Diego
next spring in Bellini's "Norma," made the most of the showcase that
is Tatyana's Letter Scene in "Eugene Onegin." But earlier, in arias
from "Tosca" and Cilea's "Adriana Lecouvreur" and in the Di
Luna/Leonora duet from "Il Trovatore," the soprano from Siberia
labored regularly and sang inconsistently, very often off-pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Leiferkus, who has been much admired in previous visits
here, made some unpleasant and non-Italianate sounds in arias from
"Otello" and "Macbeth" and the "Trovatore" excerpt. Later, when he
got to Aleko's cavatina from Rachmaninoff's "Aleko," his singing
became surprisingly mellifluous and persuasive.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Vedernikov and the orchestra were model collaborators.
By itself, the ensemble handsomely played excerpts from "Luisa
Miller," "Manon Lescaut," "The Masked Ball" and "Onegin." At the end,
it bravely essayed a non-operatic piece, Liapunov's glib
transcription of Balakirev's "Islamey," a legendary piano piece that
in this version was more colorful than substantial.</TE>
<TE>   As it had Tuesday, the orchestra began the evening by playing the
U.S. and Russian national anthems. Both nights, "The Star-Spangled
Banner" was in the key of C, which can be a stretch for those used to
singing it in B flat.</TE>

<HD>KPIG Returns Online, for a Price</HD>
<DH>Radio* The popular Internet station has found a way back to
its listeners, but the Webcasts are no longer free. *</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Praise the lard: fans of hammy puns and progressive music outside the
Santa Cruz metro area can rejoice, as KPIG has returned to the
Internet airwaves.</LD>
<LD>   The tiny station--which, through its pioneering use of the
Internet, reached an audience far beyond its signal area--ceased
streaming its signal on the Web last month, when management said it
couldn't afford new royalty fees that the U.S. Copyright Office
ordered Webcasters to pay to record companies and artists.</LD>
<LD>   But the station has joined a new service from online music
purveyor RealNetworks and is part of a package that includes two BBC
channels, National Public Radio, Seattle classical station KING and
30 to 40 noncommercial, Internet-only channels of various genres.</LD>
<TE>   There is, however, a catch: Online listeners, used to getting
their free-form music cost-free, will now have to pay $5.95 a month,
a subscription fee that offsets the expense of the service and the
royalties and ensures the stream's continuation, said KPIG Webmaster
Bill Goldsmith.</TE>
<TE>   "Listeners are very excited that we're going back online in any
way, shape or form," Goldsmith said. "Everybody I've heard from has
been very understanding of the need to make this move. Granted, the
portion of the audience we've been hearing from is the most loyal and
the most vocal."</TE>
<TE>   While fans of stations such as KPIG and KING, both of which have
consistently topped audience charts among Webcasters, may be willing
to pay for their favorite streams, subscription services won't save
most radio stations trying to remain on the Internet, said Kurt
Hanson, publisher of the Radio and Internet Newsletter, an online
industry journal. For example, a classic-rock station in Cleveland
wanting to stream on the Internet won't get enough paying customers
in Los Angeles, who can simply tune in KCBS or KLOS, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a few other stations that might have that marquee
value," like KPIG, Hanson said. "It's the kind of thing you can't get
on your local AM or FM band."</TE>
<TE>   Both online and over the air, KPIG has nurtured a passionate
audience, with its "free-range DJs" and an Americana format that can
feature Alison Krauss and B.B. King, or Elvis Costello and Roy Rogers
in the same hour. Piggies (station fans) visiting the KPIG Web site
can watch DJs on the "Ham Cam," and post "squeals" for each other on
the message board.</TE>
<TE>   KPIG, located in Freedom, Calif., near Santa Cruz, claims to be
the first commercial FM station to Webcast and the first radio
station to do it full time, when it went online in August 1995. It
was beaten onto the Internet only by a couple of college stations
that transmitted intermittently, said Goldsmith, who also operates
his own online Web cast, at RadioParadise.com.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Webcasters shut off their streams this summer after the
royalty issue came to a head following nearly four years of dispute.
Radio stations have always had to pay royalties to the authors of
songs they play, but not to the performers. But an act of Congress in
1998 decreed that--unlike their broadcast-only brethren--online music
services would also have to start paying artists, via their record
companies.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the Librarian of Congress, who oversees the U.S.
Copyright Office, set the royalty rate--a price immediately
criticized as too low by the recording industry and too high by
Webcasters. The record companies say they're trying to get a fair
share for the artists, whose work gives the Webcasters the material
they play. Meanwhile, hobbyists streaming their favorite tunes from
home, Webcasters of all sizes and even well-known services such as
KPIG said the cumulative cost of the royalties was too high not to
bankrupt them. Facing fees running to thousands of dollars per month,
Webcasters cried that 90% of them would be forced offline.</TE>
<TE>   The Webcasters argue they're helping the very artists that the
record companies accuse them of robbing. Hanson noted that
Webcasters, such as KPIG and those with even more esoteric niche
programming, give airplay to songs and artists and genres of music
that listeners might never have heard otherwise.</TE>

<DH>The once painfully quiet Beth Orton is back, performing
with a confident, outgoing attitude</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beth Orton was once such a hesitant performer that the words "shy"
and "fragile" were as essential in describing her as "singer" and
"songwriter."</LD>
<LD>   No longer.</LD>
<LD>   At downtown L.A.'s Mayan Theatre on Thursday, Orton played with
confidence and command in a winning two-hour set, fulfilling the
considerable promise that's surrounded the Englishwoman since her
acclaimed 1997 debut album, "Trailer Park."</LD>
<TE>   Even in her most retiring moments on stage in the past five years,
Orton was an intriguing presence because her delicate nature mirrored
her songs' vulnerable reflections on relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most songwriters who give us conclusions about love and
other matters of the heart, Orton acknowledged in her best songs a
certain bewilderment when it comes to the nature of the romantic
beast.</TE>
<TE>   Still, her sometimes nervous, withdrawn presence on stage all but
put the stamp "cult figure" on her forehead. When the singer failed
to move forward creatively in her timid second album, 1999's "Central
Reservation," even that modest piece of turf started to seem beyond
her reach.</TE>
<TE>   The disappointment of that album makes the authority and grace of
her new "Daybreaker" all the more surprising and welcome. Not only is
this her most graceful and penetrating set of songs, but she also
sings with a new vitality, and the arrangements are superbly tailored
to the mysterious undercurrents in her subject matter.</TE>
<TE>   Even the advances in "Daybreaker," however, failed to fully signal
the shine of Orton on stage Thursday. Without sacrificing any soulful
conviction, she opened up in ways that were charming and uplifting.</TE>
<TE>   When she thanked the audience for their applause after certain
songs, she actually shouted the words at times, rather than whisper
them as in the past. Downright giddy by her old standards, she smiled
easily, did a couple of quirky dance steps and even attempted a joke.</TE>
<TE>   None of this, of course, would have mattered if the music didn't
blossom as well. Orton and her six-piece group played all the songs
from the new album (along with selections from the previous
collections), and the most liberating moments find her recognizing
the danger signs in relationships and being able to adjust, if not
completely sidestep them.</TE>
<TE>   "These habits are so hard to break and they're so easy to make,"
she sang during "Thinking About Tomorrow," and the line rings with a
truth that runs through Orton's work.</TE>
<TE>   She's as quick to admit the nagging quirks in her own makeup as
she is to find fault with others. In "Mount Washington," she warns,
"And nobody can keep you from the one you know you are." In "Concrete
Sky," which she sang during an acoustic segment, she looks outward:
"I've seen your good side, but I still don't know just what it is."</TE>
<TE>   Orton's voice has a clear, almost pristine ring, overcoming a
narrowness of range by aggressively shifting emotional tones in a
line. She sometimes leans for the mystery of Kate Bush, then the
bright declaration of Joni Mitchell. Wherever she goes vocally, her
musicians follow with playing that is stylish and seductive.</TE>
<TE>   Orton was one of the first pop figures to bridge two appealing
genres--the '60s singer-songwriter folk tradition and the
contemporary electronica movement. In "Central Reservation," however,
she seemed so uncertain about the proportion of folk and electronica
that she did the title song in both styles.</TE>
<TE>   The breakthrough in "Daybreaker" is that she seems to have turned
her back on the folk/electronica issue and simply worked out
ambitious arrangements that fit the music. The instrumentation
Thursday--guitar, synthesizer-keyboards, cello, bass, violin and
drums--provided a wide array of textures, which were mixed and
matched in ways that made the music seem fresh and smart: There were
even moments of explosive rock 'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   During the encore, Orton turned away from her own material for a
loving, prayer-like treatment of '60s folksinger Fred Neil's
idealistic "The Dolphins," which felt like a post-Sept. 11 expression
of hope and yearning.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview a few days before the concert, Orton acknowledged
that she feels more comfortable with her music, on stage and in the
studio.</TE>
<TE>   "For a long time, I didn't really know what I had done on that
first record that people thought was so special, and I worried about
it," she said. "Then it was time to make the second record and there
was a lot of pressure. I wasn't very happy making the second record
or touring with it.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to the point where I had to ask myself, 'Do I want to
continue with this or give up?' I really thought it was time to stop,
but I got strength from others. I kept meeting people I respected
like Johnny Marr from the Smiths and Emmylou Harris and Ryan Adams,
who said they were inspired by my music and wanted to work with me on
the new album."</TE>
<TE>   Orton learned to trust her own instincts rather than rely on
producers and others for direction.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a huge thing," says the singer, whose creative battles
were faced as she continues to suffer from Crohn's disease, a chronic
intestinal disorder. "When you start trusting rather than doubting
yourself, it gives you unbelievable strength and faith. Instead of
being paralyzed, you just got on with it, and I started to really
enjoy it."</TE>
<TE>   With "Daybreaker," Orton is likely to have a lot of company in
that enjoyment.</TE>
<TE>   Joining her on the bill Thursday were the Hems, a New York group
with a sort of cosmopolitan country sound that features some of the
melancholy textures of the Cowboy Junkies, and Alex Lloyd, an earnest
singer-songwriter whose music could use more of the energy and
personality he put into a customized version of the Elvis Presley hit
"Mystery Train."</TE>

<HD>McDonald Shares in the Fun, Success of the White Stripes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veteran Los Angeles rock musician Steven McDonald had thought about
going to England this weekend, but his trip got canceled.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted to go to the Reading Festival," he says. "The White
Stripes are playing there and I was hoping to start a rumor that I
would be jamming with them on stage."</LD>
<LD>   The rumor alone would have been a perfect conclusion to what may
have been the summer's most spirited rock-art project. McDonald, who
played bass for years with Redd Kross and now leads the Steven
McDonald Group, made himself an imaginary member of the bass-less duo
of guitarist Jack White and drummer Meg White by taking the songs
from the Stripes' acclaimed "White Blood Cells" album and adding his
own bass parts, as well as a few other touches.</LD>
<TE>   For the past two months he did two Stripes songs a week, posting
them for listening on the Redd Kross Web site
(www.reddkross.com)--all with the blessing of the Whites. He titled
the venture "Redd Blood Cells" and even inserted a picture of
himself, with Stripes-style red and white togs, into the album cover
alongside Jack and Meg.</TE>
<TE>   All 16 songs are available on the site, but McDonald will be
removing them after Monday. He says he is reluctant to appear to be
taking too much advantage of another act's music and wants to get
back to his own projects--he's finishing an EP and his group will
tour in September.</TE>
<TE>   "Redd Blood Cells" largely comes off as a respectful tribute, at
worst filling in some holes that didn't need filling, at best
subliminally giving a little extra body to the music.</TE>
<TE>   "Most White Stripes fans saw I was coming from the right place,"
he says. "I wasn't trying to attack the band or suggest I could
improve the record. It just seemed like they were having so much fun
and I wanted to be in on it."</TE>

<HD>The Younger Brother Lacks Context in 'RFK'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans often watch television indiscriminately, because it's
available and the price is right. So one measure of a TV movie is
whether anyone would pay to watch it in a theater.</LD>
<LD>   As for "RFK," unlikely.</LD>
<LD>   It's from FX, a Fox cable network whose belated drift toward
brawnier topics is affirmed by its coming movie "The Pentagon Papers"
as well as by this middlebrow biography spanning the final five years
of Robert F. Kennedy's life.</LD>
<TE>   Watchable it is; profound it isn't.</TE>
<TE>   "RFK" opens with the Dallas assassination of Bobby's older
brother, John F. Kennedy, whom he had served controversially as
attorney general, politics being the family business.</TE>
<TE>   It ends when RFK is gunned down by Sirhan Sirhan in Los Angeles,
on June 4, 1968, right after winning the California presidential
primary and just two months after he had mounted a stage in
Indianapolis to tell a throng, largely African American, that Martin
Luther King Jr. had been slain in Memphis. It was that kind of
horrific year.</TE>
<TE>   Noted in this story, directed by Robert Dornhelm, are RFK's
seminal political decisions during this period. He lands in New York
and campaigns victoriously for the U.S. Senate.</TE>
<TE>   After much anguish, he outrages JFK's successor, Lyndon B.
Johnson, by publicly denouncing the bitterly divisive Vietnam folly
that his brother led the nation into (with his own amen, by the way).
Finally, he goes for the Democratic presidential nomination against
increasingly unpopular LBJ, whose Great Society agenda had become one
of the war's casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby was a lightning rod even within his own party. He's mostly
sympathetic here, but no saint and ever complex while trying to live
up to JFK's romanticized legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Linus Roache (another Brit cast as an American) plays Bobby
credibly. He's witty, he's nasty, he's sad, tapping the sorrow in
that distinctive voice without mimicking him. James Cromwell,
however, offers little beyond one-dimensional menace as LBJ.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is there context here for his mutual animosity with Bobby. Or
the kind of texture that would give a truer sense of these times.</TE>
<TE>   "RFK" is most effective, and highly arresting, when Hank
Steinberg's script has Bobby and the dead JFK (Martin Donovan) engage
in emotional dialogues. This device has the younger brother's
feelings of guilt and self-doubt spilling out with great flourish.</TE>
<TE>   Yet missing even here are greater truths about Bobby, who was
associated with America's robust idealism of the early '60s and who
might have loomed large in national politics for years to come had he
lived.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "RFK" will be shown Sunday at 8 and 10 p.m. on FX. The movie has
been rated TV-PG (may not be suitable for younger children).</TE>

<HD>A Young Actress Trusts Her Instincts</HD>
<DH>Movies* Evan Rachel Wood, in two films this weekend, is 14,
already an old pro and 'scarily good,' says one of her directors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Evan Rachel Wood stars in two films that opened Friday: "Little
Secrets," a family film exploring the downside of keeping secrets,
and the Al Pacino comedy "Simone." And there's been a lot of buzz
about her latest project, "Thirteen," which she just finished
filming.</LD>
<LD>   Did we mention that Wood is all of 14?</LD>
<LD>   But being a hot young commodity in Hollywood isn't all glory. Wood
is just exhausted after working six-day weeks on "Thirteen," a
cautionary tale about a 13-year-old girl who lives life on the wild
side.</LD>
<TE>   Sitting in the dining room of her family's ranch style home in
Woodland Hills, Wood looks off into space as the makeup artist
finishes applying mascara and lipstick to her flawless complexion and
styling her blond hair for the photo shoot accompanying this
interview.</TE>
<TE>   The lithe young actress shares her home with her actress mother,
Sara, and an older brother, Ira. Sara Wood apologizes that the house
is in disarray, but the family has house guests. As Wood patiently
endures her styling session, she occasionally throws her 4-year-old
dog, Garcia, a squeaky toy.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she is scarily good," says Andrew Niccol, the
writer-director of "Simone," which stars Pacino as a down-on-his-luck
film director who creates a new leading lady from a computer program.
Wood plays Lainey, his old-beyond-her-years daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Though Wood looks nothing like Pacino or Catherine Keener, who
plays her mother in the film, Niccol cast the young actress as their
daughter. "She forms such a connection, I think, especially with Al
Pacino, they seem biologically linked," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I always joke she's playing a child, but she's the only adult in
the film," says the director.</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing about Evan is that there is an intelligence
behind her eyes. There is something going on. The thing about her is,
I don't know where she gets it from. She has amazing maturity."</TE>
<TE>   Finally out of the clutches of the makeup artist, Wood has moved
to the sofa in the family room. Garcia jumps up on the couch to join
her. Wood is now quite animated as she talks about her career, which
began when she was 4.</TE>
<TE>   Acting for her is instinctual. "I used to work with my mom for a
really long time," she says, hugging Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   But at the ripe old age of 11, when she had her first big episode
as Jessie on the now-defunct ABC series "Once and Again," she asked
her mom if she could prepare for the episode on her own. "From then
on, I just trust my instincts."</TE>
<TE>   Wood is in almost every frame of "Little Secrets" as Emily, a
bright, sweet young teenager who is a violin prodigy. Emily listens
to the secrets of all the neighborhood's kids for 50 cents apiece and
offers them advice. Meanwhile, she is trying to come to grips with
the ramifications of having kept a secret from her friends for years
and deal with her mother's late-in-life pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   The film's director, Blair Treu, auditioned a handful of actresses
before he saw Wood.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a real sweetheart," says Treu. "Then on the actress side,
she's a real pro. I have always admired these kids who in the middle
of the workday can do a very intense scene and then go off to school
and then come back. She just seems to take everything in stride."</TE>
<TE>   Wood spent two months before production began trying to look like
she knew how to play the violin.</TE>
<TE>   Doing Her Homework</TE>
<TE>   "I shot a little instructional video with a violinist of the tune
she would be playing in the film," says Treu. "We sent it along with
the violin and the bow to mimic the action and the posture. We told
her not to worry about the fingering so much. When she got to
location in Salt Lake City, we did a little fine-tuning with an
instructor to get the fingering down. But she was ready to go. She
did her homework."</TE>
<TE>   "Handling the bow was difficult," says Wood. "I didn't think it
would be that hard. I didn't have to produce a good sound. I had to
make it look really good."</TE>
<TE>   Her three seasons with "Once and Again" were cathartic. Her
character, Jessie, not only had to deal with her parents' divorce,
but she also suffered from an eating disorder and fell in love with a
female classmate. During the first season, Wood was still dealing
with her own parents' divorce. "It was almost kind of like therapy,"
Wood says.</TE>
<TE>   She says she still gets e-mail from young girls with eating
disorders, telling her that her performance was "so real. It really
touched them." And lesbians have stopped her on the street to tell
her that story line " 'meant so much to me and my partner.' That's
why I loved doing that show, because it actually meant something. It
touched so many people's lives. It was about real life."</TE>
<TE>   Wood and her mother pick her projects. "Usually, we have two
copies," she says. "Me and my mom will read them and we'll talk about
them."</TE>
<TE>   The script for "Thirteen," written by her 14-year-old co-star,
Nikki Reed, scared her. "I put it down. I was afraid of it for a
while because of the subject matter. It was so intense. I had never
really done anything like that. I phoned my agent and, right then, I
said, 'I have to do this movie.' Parents need to know this is going
to go on, and this has to really scare kids into not doing this
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Wood literally grew up in the theater in Raleigh, N.C., where her
parents operated a regional theater; her father still runs the
company. "I was always around actors," she says. "Acting is something
I always assumed I would do."</TE>
<TE>   She made her debut at 4 in "Briar Patch," a musical her father
wrote. "Then I actually toured with one of my dad's play for years.
It was his version of 'A Christmas Carol.' "</TE>
<TE>   Wood was flown out to Los Angeles at age 5 to audition for
"Interview With the Vampire." Though she didn't get the role in the
Tom Cruise film, she began getting episodic work in TV and made her
film debut opposite Kevin Bacon in the 1998 drama "Digging to China."
She and her mother and brother finally moved to Los Angeles in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   When she's not working, she hangs out with her friends, most of
whom are in the industry. She has a black belt in karate but hasn't
had time to practice the sport because of her hectic schedule. Still,
she says, "I take voice lessons every Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   Wood has been home-schooled for the last four years. "North
Carolina schools were great," she says, "but once I moved out here, I
had a really bad experience. The kids were fine but the teachers were
a nightmare. It was terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, she hasn't made up her mind yet about college. "I
am not quite there yet," she says, hugging Garcia.</TE>

<HD>Can 'Art Public' Be Extended to Include 'General Public'?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I appreciated Christopher Knight's engaging discussion of the museum
blockbuster phenomenon ("The Lure of the Blockbuster," Aug. 20). But
I found disturbing his repeated references to an "art public" and a
"general public." These condescending classifications undermine the
very issue Knight was trying to promote--that of life imitating art.</LD>
<LD>   How can life begin to be intimately connected to art when a line
is drawn between the public? Is the "art public" somehow more in tune
with art while the "general public" just wants to buy it? And how
does one neatly fit into these distinct camps? Do you have to know
particular artists or have a certain education to gain membership
into the "art public"?</LD>
<LD>   It seems to me Andy Warhol was trying to break down these
perceived divisions with his work, and somehow I don't think he would
mind if the "general public" spent $1.65 million on magnets and key
chains with his Elizabeth Taylor on them.</LD>
<TE>   DAVID Du MARS</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the primary objectives of a museum is to educate all art
constituencies, not just members of the art public who are "scattered
here and there." After all, if the museum wants to pursue the "real
money," isn't it prudent to provide a means to increase the size of
the art public by exposing, cultivating and integrating the general
public into the world of art?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In Monday's article "What's Not Happening at the Pavilion" (by Mike
Boehm), Music Center board of directors chair Andrea Van de Kamp
says: "We can serve aging gray hairs or be thoughtful and get the
kind of diversity and intensity we want the center to represent."
Diversity and loss of hair color are not mutually exclusive, Ms. Van
de Kamp.</LD>
<LD>   My graying head has seen great "diversity" (ethnic and
gender-based) among "aging gray hairs" loyally attending L.A.
Philharmonic concerts at the Pavilion for decades. The AGHs, in fact,
make up the bulk of the audience that supports the orchestra. Maybe
you should be more "thoughtful" about that!</LD>
<LD>   And you wonder how to fill the Phil's vacancy? Easy: Put the
excellent Pasadena Symphony in there under the articulate baton of
Jorge Mester. But be careful not to book them when showboat Esa-Pekka
Salonen is flailing at the L.A. band, as none of the AGHs will show
up at Disney Hall.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All of us in Greater Los Angeles who love ballet have been eagerly
awaiting the inauguration of Disney Hall so that dance can again be
presented at the Pavilion, an ideal house for major ballet companies.</TE>
<TE>   Van de Kamp's expression of a need "to be extremely cautious in
booking" belies an unnecessary timidity on her part. If I recall
correctly, for several years she was a director of the Music Center
Operating Company, which, in association with Music Center Dance
Presentations, over a 15-year period presented two yearly seasons of
the American Ballet Theatre, plus the Royal Ballet, the Kirov, the
Bolshoi, the Cuban Ballet, Stuttgart, the Royal Danish and others.</TE>
<TE>   These bookings were extremely successful, both artistically and
financially.</TE>
<TE>   Van de Kamp should take advantage of the unique facilities
provided by the Chandler Pavilion, along with her past experience,
and reenact the very successful formula used then.</TE>
<TE>   CLARA YUST</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is quite pathetic that the elitists of L.A. have forsaken the
still-gorgeous Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for the ugly Disney Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Did L.A. need Disney Hall? No. There was and is nothing wrong with
the Pavilion. It's an architectural icon of the 1960s, and it staged
a variety of wonderful performances for all to enjoy. It was always a
special event attending a performance at the Music Center.</TE>
<TE>   Did no one think ahead to the future of the Pavilion with the
Garish Hall across the street? Even if they did, obviously no one
cared. And now, the Pavilion may lie fallow--but it will still cast a
giant shadow over the hideous Disney across the street.</TE>

<HD>Understanding Hitler</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re the new CBS miniseries of Adolf Hitler's early years ("Giving
Hitler a Human Side," by Paul Brownfield, Aug. 19): Abraham H.
Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, states that
"history has made a judgment of the man, he's a monster. So now, why
do we need to know when he dated, how he dated? ... We know who he
is, we know what he did, what are we going to learn?"</LD>
<LD>   Isn't that what the Palestinians are probably saying about Ariel
Sharon? And what Jews are saying about Yasser Arafat?</LD>
<LD>   Obviously Foxman would prefer not to learn anything, even from
history. With that attitude, it's no wonder peace has eluded the
Israelis and Palestinians. Only through understanding can there ever
be change. But perhaps that is what Foxman fears the most: Change is
scary.</LD>

<TE>   In the '70s I wrote a detailed treatment titled "Young Hitler's
Secret Life" that was optioned by Bob Banner Associates and taken to
NBC. My approach to the material emphasized young Hitler's deep
interest in German mysticism and the occult. In a way, he was
literally a sorcerer's apprentice.</TE>
<TE>   NBC was very, very high on the material but eventually let it go
when potential sponsors did their own research and said no matter how
the material was presented, the very fact that it was on TV would
cause up to 20% of the audience to "sympathize with Hitler" since it
attempted to understand or explain (not defend) the monster in human
terms.</TE>
<TE>   I was amazed. It's unlikely things have changed and it will be
interesting to see how CBS deals with the core material as well as
the potentially volatile response from those for and against the
broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   Hitler was one of us. His true story should be known and told. The
horror of Hitler is that he was a nobody who discovered the most base
pathology of the biggest audience. Not unlike network decisions.</TE>

<LD>If genital gyrations on a stage constitute "theater," then I suppose
The Times' forgiving review of "Puppetry of the Penis" ("Unabashed

"criticism." But from where I sat, "Puppetry" is a sideshow display
that stretched out its welcome after 10 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   The problem with "Penis" is that it is a device with no subtext;
we learn nothing of these gentlemen.</LD>
<LD>   This, um, "theatrical event" (as the Tony Awards would call it) is
uninventive, drawn-out and, at nearly 40 bucks a seat, creates a new

<HD>Dr. Phil's Advice: Live the Life You Want While Watching
My Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few therapists, even in Los Angeles, face such a difficult
life choice: What music video would best goose a crowd of thousands,
moments before being introduced?</LD>
<LD>   But life is about such hard choices and Dr. Phil and his "Get
Real" 15-city national tour didn't blink Thursday evening at the
Universal Amphitheatre. The nod went to Shania Twain's "Man! I Feel
Like a Woman!"</LD>
<LD>   Good call, Dr. Phil! It's that kind of decision-making
that rocketed the once-obscure expert witness and clinical psychologist
from Texas into a bona fide television star now living in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Twain's rock 'n' country ode to female empowerment blasting away
from two wide screens had his largely female fans on their feet
clapping, dancing and yee-hawing in no time. As anyone who has tuned
into "Oprah" on Tuesdays knows, Dr. Phillip C. McGraw is no dummy,
and it's not just because, as he says, he's got "more degrees than a
thermometer."</TE>
<TE>   He knows his chief demographic--women between 30 and 50. And more
than the music was geared toward them during his 90-minute show,
which was equal parts therapy session, tent revival and show
business. Outside the venue, in a masterful stroke of
cross-marketing, arriving fans were offered one of Dr. Phil's
bestselling books or tapes if they joined Sam's Club. Big line for
that one.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the venue, it was really a kinder, gentler Dr. Phil.
Largely gone was the browbeating therapist on "Oprah." Instead he
talked about broad common themes of living an authentic life. Live
the life you want, he urged his audience, not the life someone else
expects of you.</TE>
<TE>   The venue also gave Dr. Phil a chance to show off his storytelling
skills, which are considerable. Between his country drawl and his
folksy charm, he held the audience in rapt attention with tales from
his own marriage to his misadventures as a drag-racing youth. You got
the idea after hearing a story about a policeman punching the teeth
out of a boyhood friend who was caught drag racing in town, however,
that maybe not all the details transpired exactly as Dr. Phil said.
But the embellishment is part of his charm.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of the evening, one got the idea that the "Get
Real" tour's real intent wasn't so much to help the masses as to
promote his upcoming television show, which debuts on NBC Sept. 16.
(It's at 4 p.m., so it won't conflict with Oprah.)</TE>
<TE>   Before his appearance, a show producer appealed to the audience to
watch the show (as did KNBC news anchor Colleen Williams and KOST
radio talk show hosts Mark and Kim, as well as Dr. Phil's 22-year-old
son). It wasn't just viewers they needed either, it was questions for
Dr. Phil to answer on the air. And they were short on guests, too,
for upcoming shows on mooching, gossip and cheating.</TE>
<TE>   If this country boy, as Dr. Phil called himself, isn't careful,
he's going to be a city slicker before he knows it.</TE>

(played by Uma Thurman) is advancing ever deeper into adulthood, with
no steady guy in sight. Accompanied by her best friend, Beth
(Juliette Lewis), she spends most nights at the local watering hole,
hoping that, somehow, Mr. Right will bubble up out of its
depressingly limited gene pool.</LD>
<LD>   After a particularly painful humiliation one night, she tearfully
asks the bartender: "What's wrong with me? I really wanna know."</LD>
<TE>   "Maybe you don't see things so clearly," he replies.</TE>
<TE>   Sight, or self-perception, is central to this emotionally true,
visually arresting movie, which arrives Sunday at 9:30 p.m. Under the
sure direction of Mira Nair, it studies the cycle of self-doubt that
has enveloped Debby's mother, Virginia (Gena Rowlands), as well as
Debby and Beth, and encroaches on a third generation: Beth's bubbly,
10-year-old daughter, Amber (Jolie Peters).</TE>
<TE>   The story unfolds in working-class Bayonne, N.J., in the late
1980s. It's an era of big hair and little skirts, and Debby and Beth
head to the bar looking trashier than the "Holiday"-era Madonna.</TE>
<TE>   Social expectations and economic limitations, as well as personal
circumstances, have really done a number on these women. Debby and
Beth are each other's primary emotional support. Yet, at the
slightest sign that one of them might be hitting it off with a guy,
jealously sets in and they abruptly turn vengeful.</TE>
<TE>   Guys aren't much better off. The bartender (Anthony De Sando) and
a bar-goer (Justin Chambers) who catches Debby's eye are trapped in
their own vicious cycles.</TE>
<TE>   Nair, whose movies include the Oscar-nominated "Salaam Bombay!"
and the gorgeous, complex "Monsoon Wedding," tends to use whiteouts
between scenes to suggest Debby's blurry vision. And, working with
cinematographer Declan Quinn, she keeps throwing in shots of
bridges--symbols of connection, or of the other paths these women
might take.</TE>
<TE>   Thurman optioned and developed this script by Laura Cahill, based
on Cahill's play. Clearly, Thurman feels strongly about the material,
and she bravely disappears into her part. From beneath a helmet of
Farrah hair and behind a raccoon mask of eyeliner, her eyes telegraph
hunger, hurt and, every now and again, hope.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis is also affecting as the sunnier Beth, while Rowlands, as
Virginia, is quietly luminous around her late-in-life Prince
Charming, played by Ben Gazzara.</TE>
<TE>   Humor bursts forth unexpectedly, and the whole movie is beautiful.
Just like these women, if only they could see.</TE>

<LD>   'Doc' Yes, 'Buffy' No, Says Watchdog Group</LD>
<LD>   TV, in many quarters, is getting racier--and the Parents
Television Council, a conservative watchdog group, isn't pleased.</LD>
<TE>   Though it had high praise for the Pax TV drama "Doc," starring
singer Billy Ray Cyrus, the organization lashed into a host of shows
in its annual report on prime-time programming--most notably UPN's
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer," which, it said, had even more graphic
depiction of sex and violence than the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Other series drawing pans from the group: CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" (portrayals of incest and sadomasochism) and the WB
sitcom "Off Centre" (discussions of three-way sex and porn).</TE>
<TE>   On a more positive note, the group lauded the networks for an
overall increase in family-friendly programming and the messages
found in six new shows, including "The Bernie Mac Show," "Smallville"
and "Reba."</TE>

<TE>   $35-Million Bond Sale for Film Archive</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis has announced that he will sell $35 million in
bonds to help finance the Vine Street Archive Foundation, a nonprofit
corporation affiliated with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   The money will go toward the acquisition, renovation and equipping
of an 18,000-square-foot former studio facility in Hollywood that
will serve as the new home of the academy's film archive and provide
office space for other Academy Foundation departments.</TE>
<TE>   The archive collection totals more than 45,000 items, including
motion picture feature films and shorts and the personal collections
of filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock, Fred Zinnemann, Sam Peckinpah
and John Huston.</TE>
<TE>   Greeks Debate Alexander Carving</TE>
<TE>   The Greek Culture Ministry says it will not allow work to begin in
November on a proposed 240-foot-tall image of Alexander the Great to
be carved on Mt. Kerdylio in northern Greece, the BBC reports.</TE>
<TE>   The project is the brainchild of a group of Greek Americans, who
have provided the bulk of the multimillion-dollar tab. The intent: to
bring in tourists, assist the local economy and reinforce the Greek
heritage of the onetime King of Macedonia--a historical figure also
claimed by the Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.</TE>
<TE>   Though local authorities compare the project to South Dakota's Mt.
Rushmore, others are less enthused. Ecological groups call the
project, which also calls for a museum, a restored amphitheater and a
parking lot, a case of "environmental megalomania."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a monstrosity," said Dimitris Grammenos, head of the
classical antiquities department in Athens. "Projects such as this
are appropriate to countries the size of the United States of America
but not the delicate Mediterranean landscape."</TE>

Pasadena's Washington Middle School in the wee hours of Saturday

<TE>   The producers, who paid $9,600 for a permit to film overnight,
never notified the city they'd be using amplified sound, said Eric
Duyshart, the city's economic development manager. They'll probably
be fined $1,400, he added.</TE>

<HD>Will Controversy Over Sins of 'Padre' Translate?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executives at Samuel Goldwyn Films, which just acquired for U.S.
distribution the Mexican film "El Crimen del Padre Amaro" (The Crime
of Father Amaro), say they are not afraid of any controversy the film
might generate here despite the firestorm it caused in its home
country.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which will release the film sometime in November to a
target audience of Latinos and foreign-film buffs, is capitalizing on
headlines the movie generated this month as Mexico's Catholic
leadership and conservative social groups tried to ban it. Recent
scandals within the Catholic Church involving accusations of
pedophilia and molestation also make the content of the film, about a
priest who impregnates a 16-year-old parishioner, particularly
timely, said Meyer Gottlieb, president of Samuel Goldwyn Films.</LD>
<LD>   "It deals with issues that are topical, and they are issues that
need to be addressed," Gottlieb said.</LD>
<TE>   The studio, known more for lower-profile, less edgy material, such
as last year's "Tortilla Soup," is branching out to include more
radical fare, including this year's German psychological drama "Das
Experiment" and "Padre Amaro," as well as such family fare as "Little
Secrets."</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Carrera's "Padre Amaro" depicts a small-town Mexican priest
who struggles with his celibacy vows. Senior clerics in Mexico
pressured the government of President Vicente Fox to ban the film,
which is rated B-15 (not recommended for children under 15). Instead,
it opened in 358 theaters across the country, a record for a Mexican
film. Taking in close to $6 million in its first two weeks, it has
become one of the highest-grossing Mexican films ever, on track to
surpass the country's 1999 mega-hit, "Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas" (Sex,
Shame and Tears), which ended up grossing $13 million.</TE>
<TE>   Gottlieb said "El Crimen" is one in a string of high-quality films
Mexican filmmakers have been churning out over the last five years,
including Salvador Carrasco's epic "The Other Conquest," Alejandro
Gonzalez Inarritu's Oscar-nominated "Amores Perros" and Alfonso
Cuaron's road romp "Y Tu Mama Tambien."</TE>
<TE>   The film stars Gael Garcia Bernal, one of Mexico's most popular
young actors, as the errant Father Amaro.</TE>
<TE>   The movie will be shown in Toronto next month. Gottlieb said he is
undaunted by the controversy it may stir within this country's
Catholic hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not anti-Catholic," Gottlieb said. "This picture does not
make fun of the church in any way. It deals with the frailties of
human beings. I am hoping that everybody will see this film for what
it really is."</TE>
<TE>   Tod Tamberg, spokesman for the Los Angeles Archdiocese, said
officials there have not been contacted by the studio, nor do they
plan any protests at this point.</TE>
<TE>   But if history is any guide, the company should be prepared for
some backlash among Catholic groups. In 1988, thousands of protesters
turned out at Universal Studios to protest Martin Scorsese's "The
Last Temptation of Christ," which they claimed slandered Jesus Christ
and other biblical figures. Protesters picketed, in small numbers,
outside theaters in New York and L.A. for weeks. In 1995 Miramax ran
into problems with "Priest," which some Catholics deemed offensive
because it portrayed priests as having sex with women and with men.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1999, Kevin Smith's "Dogma" became the target of protests
by the New York-based Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights,
which demanded that the Walt Disney Co. dump Miramax Films. Miramax
co-chairmen Bob and Harvey Weinstein personally bought back the
rights to the film for a sum reportedly between $10 million and $14
million and sold it to Lions Gate Films. The film was picketed at its
premiere.</TE>

<HD>Turning Opera Minus Into a Plus</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prokofiev's "War and Peace" was among the most highly anticipated
events of the upcoming opera season. So Friday's news of its
cancellation was disappointing, not the least because its ambitious
underwriter, Alberto Vilar, and the ambitious Los Angeles Opera had
led us to believe that the costs were covered to bring over the
production from the Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg, Russia, to say
nothing of the Kirov's cast of thousands.</LD>
<LD>   Now it turns out that the $600,000 needed to alter the sets to fit
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion stage and Vilar's peculiar payment
schedule of giving half his $1-million pledge on opening night and
the other half a year later have proved unworkable. L.A. Opera needed
money this summer to do the scenery work and book airline tickets and
hotel rooms for a lot of performers. Vilar agreed to only what he had
initially agreed to, no more and no sooner.</LD>
<LD>   This tarnishes the reputation of the company and the world's most
generous opera donor, but it's possible to sympathize with both
sides. Although L.A. Opera had no business agreeing to Vilar's terms
in the first place, I would have done exactly the same thing had I
been in the company's shoes. Vilar's promise of $1 million was a
license to dream.</LD>
<TE>   "War and Peace" is an epic work that we rarely get to encounter in
the theater. The score has been criticized for being episodic (which
it is, but look at the Tolstoy source) and maybe a bit too
Stalin-appeasing (which it was, but it was also a product of World
War II). Nonetheless, it has some magnificent music and fabulous
scenic possibilities. I haven't seen this reportedly spectacular
Kirov production, which the Metropolitan Opera presented last year in
New York. But two other productions I've witnessed, both conducted by
the Kirov's Valery Gergiev, left me entirely in the opera's thrall.
This is surely a work worth a risk.</TE>
<TE>   And how can we argue with Vilar not coughing up more money? He
told The Times that he has already sunk $4 million into this
production and that is enough for one opera. Furthermore, he says
that once he starts advancing one company money, then everybody will
want the same favor.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, of course, that Vilar's eccentric method of giving
is only fiscally feasible for well-endowed companies with exceedingly
large budgets, like the Met. At L.A. Opera and other organizations on
a tight budget, Vilar's delayed payments wreak financial havoc. For
Vilar, the system allows him to continually generate new publicity on
the installment plan. But it also means that he must have a slew of
pledges coming due, which may be another reason he is loath to take
on added outlays right now. We all know about the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Opera is spinning this embarrassing story with savvy, taking
the blame itself. It hardly needs to humiliate Vilar just as he is
about to host his engagement party here early next month, celebrating
his upcoming marriage to Harvard musicologist Karen Painter, a Santa
Monica native. L.A. Opera loudly announces that it still trusts
Vilar. And perhaps it does. Certainly it doesn't want to alienate a
man genuinely devoted to opera who also happens to be extraordinarily
rich and generous.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe, just maybe, Vilar has done the company a favor.</TE>
<TE>   As I wrote at the end of last season, L.A. Opera has a reputation
for chaos, and the upside of that may be an ability to think on its
feet and turn on a dime. L.A. Opera's decision to import
Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk" from the Kirov in place of
"War and Peace" is brilliant.</TE>
<TE>   It may not be possible to muster the same affection for the
scathing sarcasm in Shostakovich's music or for the opera's brutal
story as it is for the sumptuous glory of Prokoviev's opera. But
"Lady Macbeth" is gripping theater and a work of major historic
significance. It is what first got Shostakovich into serious trouble
with Stalin, who objected to its Modernism. Moreover, just as Gergiev
and his company would be most opera lovers' first choice for "War and
Peace," so are they for "Lady Macbeth," an opera that has never been
presented in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   But what also makes this an exceptional choice is that it ties in
with the Los Angeles Philharmonic's ongoing investigation of
Shostakovich symphonies. This season, Esa-Pekka Salonen will conduct
the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth symphonies, works that surrounded the
"Lady Macbeth" controversy, the Fifth being the popular Shostakovich
score that mollified Stalin's fury. Suddenly we've got something to
talk about.</TE>
<TE>   The companies at the Music Center don't have much of a reputation
for working together, and a recent news story in Calendar about the
future artistic direction of the center painted a picture of little
if any overall artistic vision, however creative the individual
companies may be. Here now is a chance to turn a disappointment into
a cooperative Shostakovich festival and include a serious exploration
of the potent issue of tyranny and art.</TE>
<TE>   This is a timely topic. British novelist Martin Amis has attracted
attention for his new book "Koba the Dread," in which he attacks
intellectuals in the West for having once embraced Stalin. At UC
Berkeley, we have Richard Taruskin, the always-controversial
authority on Russian music. Gergiev has fascinating things to say
about the issue; he is, after all, probably the Russian artist who
most successfully used glasnost as the window of opportunity to build
a stunning international career while still serving his homeland.
Salonen grew up in Helsinki in the '50s and '60s, in the shadow of
the Soviet Empire. Even Vilar, a Cuban, might have something to say
about the subject. There have been many Shostakovich festivals in
recent years, but we now have, overnight, the ingredients for one of
unique richness and freshness.</TE>
<TE>   Vilar has demonstrated a taste for conferences; he presents them
at Salzburg every summer. If he is reluctant to support the change of
opera, he might consider this alternative: sponsoring a symposium
that would turn this coincidence of events into meaningful context.
Vilar could save face and also offer the Music Center an example of
how it might begin to take advantage of its constituents.</TE>
<TE>   We've thanked Alberto Vilar for many things in the past. Wouldn't
it be nice if he could turn a sorry situation in a whole new reason
to thank him once more?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Carol Burnett once said that comedy is tragedy plus time. Yet without
enough of that last factor, the equation collapses, and the results
can be painful to watch.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, that tends to be the case with Sunday night's
well-meaning but only marginally watchable special "Stand Up! A
Summer at Comedy Camp" (9 p.m. on KCET). The 90-minute documentary
chronicles the efforts of Laugh Factory club owner Jamie Masada and
such comics as Shawn Wayans, Paul Rodriguez and Rob Schneider to
boost the self-confidence of disadvantaged youths through a crash
course on stand-up skills.</LD>
<LD>   The kids, who range in age from about 12 to 16, are brought to the
Hollywood club each Saturday for 10 weeks for tips on writing and
stage presence. During vague filmed sidebars, we learn that these
would-be comics are the walking wounded, most arriving from foster
homes, group homes or broken homes with tales of woe that leave
viewers cringing.</LD>
<TE>   The goal of boosting their self-worth is so noble that it seems
unfair to judge Masada's concept for achieving it, but the withering
attrition rate (nearly half of the beginning class of 37 is gone
before the final week) may be an indicator.</TE>
<TE>   When it's time to stand up and deliver, it appears that most of
these kids would rather be anywhere else on Earth at that moment than
in front of the microphone. And even the more willing can be tough to
watch. It's like filming at a children's inoculation clinic: It's
good for the kids, but is it TV?</TE>
<TE>   Yet there are bright spots. Talented Dominique seems born to the
stage, and his impression of Bill Cosby is a killer. And when
classmate Roena says after her final performance that it was "the
best day of my life," you remember that there's one thing these kids
have on their side, and that's time.</TE>

<HD>ABC in a Marketing Blitz for Ratings</HD>
<DH>Media: Disney events, including a personal appearance by
stars of the network's fall lineup, aim to bring back viewers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABC faces a stiff challenge in seeking to reverse its flagging
fortunes: selling the network's fall shows to an audience that is no
longer watching.</LD>
<LD>   With about 22% fewer viewers tuning in this summer, ABC executives
cannot solely rely on their own on-air promotions to hype shows that
debut in mid-September.</LD>
<LD>   So Walt Disney Co. has launched a barnstorming campaign intended
to generate excitement about ABC's fall schedule.</LD>
<TE>   The company is handing out 115,000 ABC car antenna balls to Disney
employees nationwide. It's stuffing 2 million "ABC Happy Hour"
inserts into music CDs of popular artists and distributing 100,000
"Dinotopia" bookmarks at Disneyland. Disney-owned sports network ESPN
will run a promotional spot every hour through September highlighting
ABC prime-time shows.</TE>
<TE>   And for the first time, Disney is assembling more than 70 actors
from the network's prime-time programs. Today and Sunday at Disney's
California Adventure in Anaheim, John Ritter, Dennis Franz, Drew
Carey, Jim Belushi and other stars are scheduled to mill about and
meet fans. Some fans from Indiana, New Jersey, Florida and Texas are
being flown in at Disney's expense after they won contests at
ABC-owned radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   "When you've got low audience levels, you have to spend more money
and be more creative in finding other ways to attract an audience,"
said Susan Lyne, ABC's entertainment president. "This is a
grass-roots way of getting our message out."</TE>
<TE>   Stakes for the company have never been higher.</TE>
<TE>   The jobs of ABC executives, up to Disney Chief Executive Michael
Eisner, hinge on whether the network can quickly reverse its ratings
slide.</TE>
<TE>   During the regular season, ABC's prime-time ratings tumbled nearly
20%. Summer prime-time ratings dipped to near all-time lows. ABC's
average nightly audience this summer has been 6.2 million, according
to Nielsen Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   That's 3 million fewer viewers from the gravy days two summers ago
when "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" became a cultural phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   With no break-out summer hit this year to use as a promotional
springboard, other Disney divisions have been drafted into service.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's Buena Vista home entertainment will add ABC promos to
upcoming video releases. The ABC Family cable channel will donate
nearly 450 spots to promote the prime-time shows on the broadcast
network.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Studios will turn over wall billboard space to ABC,
and ESPN Zone restaurants will be festooned with "Monday Night
Football" banners, game cards and beverage coasters.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, the Disney-MGM resorts have created a "Get Happy ...
With ABC" attraction for park visitors to preview the fall shows,
which already has logged more than 100,000 visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not an idea that we haven't explored and picked through
in an effort to reach a greater audience," Lyne said. "The challenge
is big, but we are addressing it in every way that we can."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's marquee marketing event is this weekend's "Prime-Time
Preview Weekend," at California Adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of people, who will pay $35 to $45 to enter the park,
will see celebrities, including ABC sports personalities Michelle
Kwan, Dan Fouts and Al Michaels. On display will be the trophies that
will be awarded at next year's NFL Super Bowl and NBA
championship--events the network will broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wish we could have this event in 70 other cities," said
Steve Sohmer, ABC's newly hired marketing chief.</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives plan to use the media to extend their reach.
"Entertainment Tonight," "Access Hollywood," News Corp.-owned Fox
News and TV, print and radio reporters from Los Angeles to
Minneapolis to Atlanta have credentials to cover the event.</TE>
<TE>   "The 20,000 people at the park are the event. But the coverage
will reach many millions more.... It's going to have real impact,"
Lyne said.</TE>
<TE>   The network's lower ratings during the last year translate into
less advertising and operating income. Morgan Stanley analysts
predict that when Disney wraps up its fiscal year at the end of
September, the network will post a deficit of about $550 million in
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a
common measurement of cash flow for media companies. The network's
revenue is estimated to be $3.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   ABC has more than doubled its marketing budget for prime-time
shows.</TE>
<TE>   ABC executives won't disclose the amount, but ABC network
President Alex Wallau said the extra money for promotions hasn't been
added to the network's bottom line. Instead, the network has saved
money by eliminating several talent deals and cutting in other areas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a reallocation of resources," Wallau said. "We're managing
our cost side so that we can launch our shows in a smart manner for
this very critical year for the ABC network."</TE>
<TE>   The marketing money will be used to buy advertisements on cable
channels, radio networks, newspapers and magazines throughout the
fall--not just the first few weeks of September.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a bad year and a summer that we need to improve upon,"
Wallau said.</TE>
<TE>   All of the major broadcast networks have experienced ratings
declines this summer. Cable TV has grabbed an all-time high in market
share, 53.5%, with broadcast networks attracting 38.2% of the total
TV audience, according to Turner Research.</TE>
<TE>   Only Fox Broadcasting Co., which scored with its summer hit
"American Idol," marked an increase, 6.7%, this summer among viewers
18 to 49--the group that's most desirable to advertisers. Top-rated
NBC has lost 9% of its summer viewers while CBS has dropped 3%,
according to Nielsen.</TE>
<TE>   The WB has remained flat while summer ratings at the Viacom-owned
UPN nosed-dived by 13%.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's slide has been more severe than at competing networks. ABC
is down 16.5% in the 18-to-49 age group. Network executives hope
their promotional efforts will prompt viewers to return to sample the
new fall fare.</TE>
<TE>   "Every fall offers a new opportunity," said Leland Westerfield, a
broadcasting analyst with the investment banking firm UBS Warburg.
"ABC has formidable work ahead, but it remains one of the dominant
brands in television. And if the network's ratings are up even
slightly this year, it will be seen as an improvement."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, though, it's really all about good programming, said
Sohmer, who oversees ABC's promotions staff of about 100.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no substitute for break-through programming," he said.
"This is a fish-bowl game, it's not like getting people to buy a car
and if they don't like it, they still have to drive it for a few
years. In television, if they don't like the flavor--click, they're
gone."</TE>

<HD>Deadline for Indictments Against Rigases Extended</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A deadline originally set for Friday for possible indictments against
members of the family that founded Adelphia Communications Corp. was
extended for 30 days.</LD>
<LD>   The routine extension, granted by a Manhattan judge, was requested
by attorneys for John J. Rigas, 77, and his sons, Timothy, 46, and
Michael, 48, federal prosecutors said in court papers. All remain
free on $10-million bail.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors "have been engaged in, and are continuing, discussions
about the case with" defense attorneys, the papers said. "Each of the
defendants has requested an extension of 30 days to engage in further
discussion with the government."</LD>
<TE>   A call to an attorney for John J. Rigas was not returned.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas and his sons--who gave up executive posts and board seats at
the Coudersport, Pa.-based cable company a month before it filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June--were accused in a federal
complaint filed in July of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars
from the nation's sixth-largest cable-TV company.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint accused the family of using $252 million in company
money to pay margin calls, or demands for cash payments on loans for
which they had put up Adelphia stock as collateral. The fraud caused
losses to stockholders amounting to more than $60 billion, the
complaint said.</TE>
<TE>   One reason prosecutors may be seeking to delay an indictment is to
negotiate guilty pleas with the defendants. An attorney for Timothy
Rigas, former chief financial officer, told Bloomberg News that no
plea discussions are underway.</TE>

<HD>AOL Shares Fall on Write-Down Fears</HD>
<DH>Media: A report that the SEC might widen its investigation
also contributes to the 9% drop. The company calls speculation
premature.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Shares of AOL Time Warner Inc. tumbled 9% on Friday on concerns the
world's largest media company may take another huge write-down of its
assets and on a report that regulators may widen their probe of the
company's finances.</LD>
<LD>   The company took a $54-billion charge in the first quarter--a
record--to write down the value of America Online's acquisition of
Time Warner. Analysts have said more write-downs could come,
resulting in another large charge next year.</LD>
<LD>   Shares closed at $12.76, down $1.31, on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   The company stressed caution, attributing the first-quarter
write-down to the decline in stock value of Time Warner between the
time the deal was announced in January 2000 and the time it closed a
year later.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be premature and inappropriate to take an impairment
charge at this time," AOL spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said. "The
review of such goodwill write-down will occur in the fourth quarter.
I'm not going to speculate on the results of that review."</TE>
<TE>   Since the year began, AOL Time Warner shares have fallen nearly
60% on concerns of slowing growth of its America Online Internet
service, the company's difficulties in getting customers to pay for
faster, more expensive Internet services and federal investigations
into its accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission
could be broadened into an investigation of insider stock sales while
the company was making rosy earnings forecasts, according to a report
Friday in the Financial Times.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen senior executives and directors of AOL, including Chairman
Steve Case and Chief Executive Richard D. Parsons, made profits
totaling almost $500 million by selling shares between February and
June of last year, even as the company repeatedly insisted it would
meet ambitious earnings projections, the newspaper said.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly wouldn't be surprising to see the investigation
widen in this direction," said Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with
Gerard Klauer Mattison. "When you see stock sales compared to those
early estimates, it's a fair question to ask, 'Who knew what and
when?' "</TE>
<TE>   Primrose said the company was fully cooperating with the SEC's
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The company lost credibility on Wall Street in September when it
lowered revenue and cash-flow targets long after many of its peers
acknowledged that an industrywide advertising slump would hurt their
results. Logsdon said most Wall Street analysts had cut their
expectations for AOL long before the company did.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the company's woes on Wall Street on Friday was a report
in the New York Times that said the SEC is looking into AOL Time
Warner's complex swapping transactions with Qwest Communications
International Inc. and WorldCom Inc.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has rejected Kilroy Realty Corp.'s
legal effort to block rival developer Thomas Properties Group from
building a $500-million corporate office park in El Segundo.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge David Yaffe in his final ruling dismissed
charges that the city of El Segundo had not, among other things,
fully studied the environmental and traffic impact of the proposed El
Segundo Corporate Campus at Nash Street and Mariposa Avenue or
allowed for sufficient public comment.</LD>
<LD>   An official with Los Angeles-based Kilroy said its attorneys have
recommended appealing the decision but the company has not yet made a
decision to do so.</LD>
<TE>   The legal decision comes only two months after Kilroy and its
supporters tried but failed to overturn the city's approval of the
project in a special referendum. Kilroy owns an office complex near
the proposed Thomas Properties development.</TE>

<LD>Classic Limousine Inc., a major Fountain Valley-based manufacturer of
custom and conventional limousines, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in what its attorney said was a bid to resolve a business
dispute with a key supplier, Ford Motor Co.</LD>
<LD>   The company uses Ford's Lincoln Town Car as the base for many of
its vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   Classic founder Nicholas Giacobone blamed the company's troubles
on industrywide turmoil amid declining tourism after the terrorist
attacks last year. He said, though, that an improving economy has
helped the 17-year-old company recently return to profitability.</LD>

<HD>DreamWorks Secures $1.5 Billion in Financing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DreamWorks SKG, the Hollywood studio founded by Steven Spielberg,
David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg, said Friday that it has closed
two major financing deals worth a total of $1.5 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The sum consists of a $1-billion film securitization, which
DreamWorks labeled as the first of its kind in the industry, and a
$500-million revolving credit line.</LD>
<LD>   Under its unique structure, the film securitization relies on
expected revenue from movies yet to be released as well as expected
cash from a library of old DreamWorks films such as "Saving Private
Ryan" and "Shrek."</LD>
<TE>   The new financing should allow DreamWorks to produce more
live-action films, its most successful business, and fund a planned
computer generated animation production unit, which would bring the
number of animated filmmaking divisions to three.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the financing also would give DreamWorks a strong
basis to pursue several entertainment assets expected to come on the
market in the months ahead from distressed media companies looking to
raise cash.</TE>
<TE>   Most notable among those is Vivendi Universal, which has said it
must shed assets to pay down debt. Many industry insiders have
speculated that its Universal Pictures division may be sought by
DreamWorks because it has strong historical ties to Spielberg.
However, Geffen has said DreamWorks has no interest in a deal to put
it into the same league as the major global media players, such as
Vivendi Universal, Walt Disney Co., AOL Time Warner Inc., Viacom Inc.
and News Corp.</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks said the financing deal substantially reduced its cost
of borrowing. It also extended the closely held company's access to
debt funding until at least October 2007.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and FleetBoston Financial Corp.
co-arranged the securitization, with nine banks participating in the
securitization and three more in the credit line.</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Fastow Relatives' Accounts Frozen</HD>
<DH>Courts: A source says the former Enron chief financial
officer's brother tried to transfer millions of dollars as part of a
civil case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge has frozen brokerage accounts belonging to former
Enron Corp. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's family members
after his brother tried to move millions of dollars out of one of the
accounts, a person familiar with the case said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The warrants were signed Thursday by U.S. Magistrate Calvin
Botley, but they were all sealed, including his order sealing the
warrants, Botley case manager Paul Yebernetsky said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "The whole record is sealed," he said, declining to elaborate.</LD>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors met with Botley for several hours Thursday. No
one from the Justice Department's Enron team was available for
comment at the federal courthouse in Houston on Friday, and a
spokesman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors sought the order because of the attempted transfer of
several million dollars by Peter Fastow, Andrew Fastow's brother,
from one account to another as part of an unrelated civil case, said
the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow's lawyers referred all calls to spokesman Gordon Andrew,
who declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston Chronicle reported Friday that the scope of the order
was broader than the requested seizure of assets revealed in federal
court Wednesday, when former Enron executive Michael J. Kopper
pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal complaint filed in Kopper's case included a list of
more than $23 million in bank and brokerage accounts held by Fastow
and his wife, Lea, his family foundation, his brother Peter and
several former Enron employees.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper, the first former Enron executive to plead guilty to crimes
related to the company's failure, admitted to creating partnerships
designed to enrich himself, his former boss Fastow and others at
Enron at the expense of the company and its shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   As part of his plea agreement, Kopper agreed to surrender $12
million he gained illegally through his accounting machinations. The
money will be paid to the Justice Department and the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that $12 million is $4 million in a Charles Schwab account
that is on the list of accounts prosecutors wanted to freeze.
Kopper's attorney, David Howard, said Kopper has agreed to surrender
the money.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow has not been charged with wrongdoing in Enron's collapse.
Kopper, however, told U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein in court
Wednesday that it was Fastow--whom he referred to only as "the Enron
CFO"--who provided loans for investments, received kickbacks or
negotiated deals that benefited the partnerships rather than Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow, his wife and his family's foundation face seizure of bank
accounts holding more than $14 million if prosecutors can show that
the funds are the product of money laundering when they were involved
in the investments.</TE>

no-interest financing after the Sept. 11 attacks, may end it soon.</LD>
<LD>   After Sept. 3, the No. 1 auto maker will offer 1.9% financing for
36-or 48-month loans, and 2.9% for 60-month loans on all 2002 cars
and trucks, except Corvettes, the Detroit News reported Friday,
citing a GM source and dealers.</LD>
<LD>   Cash rebates of $1,000 to $4,000 on most models still would be
offered. A GM spokeswoman said Friday that the company wouldn't
comment on its incentives programs until after Labor Day.</LD>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. has extended zero-percent financing on most 2002
models to the end of September, as has DaimlerChrysler.</TE>
<TE>   GM is the only U.S. auto maker seeing higher sales in 2002. Light
trucks drove a 1.7% rise in the first seven months of the year.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Plunge on Corruption Fears</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Dow tumbles 180 and Nasdaq falls 42 as AOL and
Citigroup probes worry investors. For the week, major indexes rise
again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN and JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sharp sell-off Friday interrupted the recent stock rally, as two
high-profile corporate investigations reignited fears of more
corruption and gloomy brokerage reports dragged down tech shares and
highlighted the unsure state of the U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index notched their fifth straight weekly gains, but it wasn't
pretty: They lost 2% and 2.3%, respectively, Friday as Citigroup and
AOL Time Warner were rocked by reports of separate regulatory
inquiries.</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite index staggered to the close of its third
straight positive week as Intel and other tech shares slid after
reports warned of weaker-than-expected earnings for chip companies
and equipment makers.</LD>
<TE>   "The rally is still intact, but there are plenty of things to
worry about and there will be times when our emotions get the best of
us, just like they did in July," said Mark Keller, investment
strategist at brokerage and asset manager A.G. Edwards in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq tumbled 42.33 points Friday, or 3%, to 1,380.62. The Dow
slid 180.68 points to 8,872.96, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost
21.84 points to 940.86.</TE>
<TE>   Losers topped winners by about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq. Trading volume was light, however, even by the
standards of late August, when many traders take vacations and the
pace on Wall Street slows considerably.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, Nasdaq rose 1.4%, the Dow 1.1% and the S&amp;P 500 1.3%.
The last time the S&amp;P 500 strung together five winning weeks was in
the period ended Sept. 1, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A security scare also rattled investors Friday as aviation
officials cleared passengers from a main terminal at New York's
LaGuardia Airport and delayed flights after word of a possible
security breach.</TE>
<TE>   The SOX index of semiconductor-related stocks fell 5.9% on the
day, with all 17 members losing ground. The decline was paced by
Intel after an analyst scaled back his projection for the top chip
maker's sales to computer makers. Intel lost $1.19 to $17.96.</TE>
<TE>   "Back-to-school demand [for computers] was relatively weak," Bear
Stearns analyst Charles Boucher wrote. "Corporate PC demand is
unlikely to show much improvement, leaving the burden on the consumer
and the developing markets" this quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher kept his "buy" rating on Intel but cut his per-share
profit estimates for 2003 from 85 cents to 82 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Intel couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a Banc of America Securities analyst cut profit estimates
for chip equipment maker Applied Materials and four of its rivals.
Applied Materials fell $1.09 to $15.08.</TE>
<TE>   Dow component Citigroup fell $1.18 to $34 amid reports that New
York's attorney general is investigating whether Jack Grubman, a
former analyst at the company's Salomon Smith Barney brokerage unit,
was pressured by Citigroup Chief Executive Sanford Weill to raise his
rating on AT&amp;T stock to help the firm win an investment banking deal.
Citigroup said Weill didn't influence Grubman's ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, S&amp;P 500 component AOL Time Warner sank $1.31 to $12.76
as the Securities and Exchange Commission examines whether
transactions the company did with Qwest Communications International
and WorldCom may have inflated its revenue, according to published
reports.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts saw the sell-off as a temporary setback for a
recovering market. Even after Friday's loss, the S&amp;P 500 is up 17.9%
from its July 23 low.</TE>
<TE>   A.G. Edwards' Keller said he believes the July jump in stock
mutual fund redemptions, which has been estimated at a net $40
billion to $50 billion, probably marked "an important bottom" for the
market. Net redemptions of more than 1% of stock fund assets have
marked previous bottoms in 1982, 1987 and 1990 when fear has peaked,
he said, and last month's withdrawals could be in the 1.5% range.</TE>
<TE>   On light trading days such as Friday, the market is especially
susceptible to any bad news, Keller said, adding that he believes
corporate scandal has largely been "priced into" the market.</TE>
<TE>   In next week's trading, however, home sales data due out Monday
and consumer confidence numbers expected Tuesday could have an effect
on the market, he said, as investors are eager to see whether U.S.
consumers still are supporting the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Among other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * A rally in the Treasury market pushed down yields as investors
sought fixed income as an alternative to stocks. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year T-note eased to 4.24% from 4.32% on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   * The slide in stocks also weakened the U.S. dollar in trading
against major currencies, including the euro and the Japanese yen.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil prices continued to retreat from recent highs, sliding 21
cents to $28.63 a barrel. An index of 15 oil service stocks slid
2.7%.</TE>

<HD>Judge Stays Order Halting Paxil Ads</HD>
<DH>Courts: She wants more FDA data and does not address claims
she had no authority to rule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal judge who ordered pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline to
halt television ads that claim its bestselling anti-depression drug
is not habit-forming has issued a stay of her ruling, pending
additional information from the Food and Drug Administration.</LD>
<LD>   But Judge Mariana Pfaelzer of the U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles did not address assertions by the FDA and the Justice
Department that she had no authority to rule in the matter, according
to lawyers involved in the case.</LD>
<LD>   Pfaelzer said in issuing the stay late Thursday that she wanted
more information from the FDA on how it reviewed the GlaxoSmithKline
advertisements for Paxil, one of the biggest drugs on the market,
with sales of $2.7 billion in 2001. The FDA had reviewed and approved
the ads before they aired.</LD>
<TE>   The stay leaves unresolved a potential conflict over who has
ultimate authority to regulate the pharmaceutical industry's
multibillion-dollar advertising campaigns, the FDA or federal judges.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, there is a question of jurisdiction," said Ernst R. Berndt
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of
Management, an expert on direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns. Who
has the authority to determine whether a drug advertisement is honest
or untruthful, "the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission or the
courts? And that will probably take at least a year to figure out."</TE>
<TE>   The parties in the case--a suit brought by 35 patients who say
they suffered extreme withdrawal symptoms when they stopped taking
the drug--said they believe this is the first time a judge has tried
to block a TV advertisement that had satisfied FDA officials.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Karen Barth, representing the plaintiffs, said the
federal courts are the true arbiters of commercial speech. Justice
Department lawyers argue that the FDA has sole jurisdiction over drug
advertisements.</TE>
<TE>   Pfaelzer's injunction against the ads, which was to have begun
Sept. 1, now will be delayed by at least two weeks. A GlaxoSmithKline
spokeswoman said that the ads in question continue to air.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares fell 76 cents to $40.13 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Qwest Says It Will Clear Up COO's Conflicting Testimony</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB URBAN</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. said Friday that it would
resolve conflicting testimony on the telephone company's accounting
given to Congress by Chief Operating Officer Afshin Mohebbi.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest agreed to submit amended testimony Monday at the request of
Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Financial
Services Committee. His panel approached the company after spotting
conflicts in testimony Mohebbi gave to the House and Senate about
accounting for swaps with other companies of fiber-optic network
capacity.</LD>
<LD>   "We are reasonably satisfied that most of the dirt that was under
the carpet has been exposed, if not cleaned up," said Bob Smith,
president and chief investment officer of Sage Advisory Services
Ltd., which has $2 billion in fixed-income assets, including Qwest
bonds. "In times like this, any word that anyone utters becomes a
potential liability."</LD>
<TE>   Questions about Mohebbi's testimony come as the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Justice Department investigate Qwest's
bookkeeping. The Denver-based company, whose former Chief Executive
Joseph Nacchio resigned in June and was replaced by Richard
Notebaert, said it will restate results after misreporting at least
$1.16 billion in fiber-optic network capacity sales from 1999 to
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We put the written testimony against what he said in the Senate
and there were discrepancies in the testimony about the swaps
accounting," said Peggy Peterson, a spokeswoman for Oxley. "Given
that they have a new CEO, a new management team, a new auditor, we
agreed that they could provide amended testimony."</TE>
<TE>   Qwest shares fell 22 cents to $2.69 in New York Stock Exchange
trading Friday. The shares have fallen 81% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Mohebbi testified before the House panel's investigation
subcommittee on March 21 and before the Senate Commerce Committee on
July 30.</TE>
<TE>   In his House testimony, Mohebbi said Qwest's accounting for the
swap transactions, including exchanges of capacity with Global
Crossing Ltd., "complies with generally accepted accounting
principles."</TE>
<TE>   Mohebbi's Senate testimony came two days after Qwest said it would
restate previous years' earnings, in part to reduce the revenue from
swap transactions, including sales known as indefeasible rights of
use, or IRUs. Qwest, which dismissed auditor Arthur Andersen this
year, also said it improperly accounted for equipment sales and some
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Any discrepancy between Mohebbi's two statements "would be a
result of our internal review that we may have misapplied the
accounting for some of those [IRU] transactions," said Qwest
spokesman Tyler Gronbach.</TE>
<TE>   Mohebbi, who remains Qwest's COO, didn't respond to requests for
comment.</TE>

<LD>Lucent Technologies Inc. denied a report that the telephone equipment
company would eliminate as many as 15,000 more jobs than planned, and

<LD>   TheStreet.com reported that Lucent, the biggest U.S. maker of
phone gear, is preparing to reduce its work force to 30,000 to 35,000
people. Lucent has said it plans to pare the work force to 45,000 by
year's end. A Wall Street Journal report said additional cuts, taken
next year, would total 5,000.</LD>

<LD>The Bush administration announced it had resolved a trade dispute
that since March had seriously disrupted exports of American chicken
products to Russia, the biggest foreign market for U.S. poultry
farmers.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute was resolved when negotiators reached agreement on a

Moscow.</LD>
<LD>   Russia was concerned about how the chickens were being processed.
The U.S. poultry industry maintained that the chicken met the same

<DL></DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, named a new chief
of its Sam's Club unit, which is struggling in the face of tough
competition from Costco Wholesale Corp. and BJ's Wholesale Club Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart promoted its chief information officer, Kevin Turner, 37,
to replace Tom Grimm, who is retiring.</LD>
<LD>   Growth at Sam's Club has lagged behind Wal-Mart's other units.
Earlier this month, the warehouse segment posted operating profit
growth of just 3% for the second quarter. By comparison, operating
profit at the flagship Wal-Mart Stores segment was up 17%.</LD>
<TE>   Turner joined Wal-Mart in 1986 as an hourly associate and was
named CIO in 2000.</TE>

<LD>Delta Air Lines Inc., the nation's third-largest airline, plans to
join Continental Airlines Inc. and Northwest Airlines Corp. in a
broad new partnership aimed at protecting revenue from a proposed
rival alliance.</LD>
<LD>   The airlines plan to sell seats on one another's flights and
coordinate schedules and frequent-flier benefits under a "code-share"
agreement. The term comes from the practice of putting an airline's
two-letter industry code onto another's flights. The proposal must be
approved by federal regulators and pilots' unions.</LD>
<LD>   Atlanta-based Delta, Houston-based Continental and Northwest,
based in Eagan, Minn., hope to have the agreement in place by the
spring.</LD>
<TE>   The partnership comes in response to a similar relationship
between United Airlines and US Airways that was announced last month.</TE>
<TE>   Delta shares fell $1.03 to $18.97 on the NYSE. Continental fell 21
cents to $10.80, also on the NYSE. Northwest fell 55 cents to $10.90
on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>Joseph Dorilio, head of trading at ING Financial Markets, was
arrested on charges of attempting to extort between $25,000 and

<LD>Antivirus company McAfee.com Corp. recommended its stockholders
approve Network Associates Inc.'s $825-million bid for the 25% of
McAfee not already owned by the network security firm.</LD>

Network Associates' price Friday. It's an 81% increase over the

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., which has applied to sell a low-cost
version of the anti-fungal medicine Lamisil, filed court papers in
New York seeking to invalidate a patent for Lamisil owned by
Novartis.</LD>
<LD>   Novartis filed suit in July against Dr. Reddy's, saying the
generic-drug maker's application before the Food and Drug
Administration was a violation of a Novartis patent. Global sales of
Lamisil reached $350 million in the first half of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Reddy's claims the Novartis patent is invalid because the
compound was disclosed more than a year before the patent application
was filed.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Reddy's is based in Hyderabad, India, with offices in Upper
Saddle River, N.J. Novartis is based in Basel, Switzerland, with
offices in East Hanover, N.J.</TE>

<LD>Japan and the European Union welcomed a decision by the Bush

tariffs but said they would still pursue complaints against U.S.
policy at the World Trade Organization's meeting next month.</LD>
<LD>   "This is at first sight a positive action," said EU Trade
Commissioner Pascal Lamy, but the United States should "withdraw the
remaining WTO illegal measures soonest."</LD>
<LD>   A Japanese government official said Tokyo hadn't decided whether
to avert a trade war with its closest ally by shelving plans to slap
retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel products.</LD>

<HD>N.Y. Widens Salomon Investigation</HD>
<DH>Securities: AT&amp;T records are subpoenaed. Sources say
inquiry involves Citigroup chief. The firm denies he urged an analyst
to change a rating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Corp. said Friday that New York's attorney general has
subpoenaed documents and correspondence between the phone giant and
Citigroup Inc. to determine if a former Citigroup analyst raised his
rating of AT&amp;T to help his firm land large fees in a $10.6-billion
stock offering.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T spokeswoman Eileen Connolly said the company is providing New
York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer with information related to its April
2000 offering of AT&amp;T Wireless tracking shares.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup was one of the lead underwriters on that record-setting
offering, and split about $45 million in fees with Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. The wireless sale came about five
months after Jack Grubman, an influential analyst at Citigroup's
Salomon Smith Barney unit, abandoned his bearish view of AT&amp;T and
raised his rating.</LD>
<TE>   Salomon and AT&amp;T say the rating change was not linked to the
underwriting selection. Still, news of the expanded
investigation--and the suggestion of involvement by Citigroup Chief
Executive Sanford I. Weill--sent Citigroup shares down 3.4% to $34 in
New York Stock Exchange trading Friday.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Spitzer declined to comment Friday, but sources
said the attorney general is probing whether Weill urged Grubman to
change his AT&amp;T rating in advance of the wireless offering.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer is conducting a wide-ranging investigation of Wall Street
stock analysts, examining whether they intentionally misled investors
during the bull market by issuing overly rosy reports that were meant
to curry favor with investment banking clients.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer also sent a request for information to Global Crossing
Ltd., the giant fiber-optic network operator that filed for
bankruptcy reorganization in January.</TE>
<TE>   Global is one of several telecommunications companies whose
relationships with securities firms are under scrutiny by regulators.
Salomon, along with Merrill Lynch, handled Global Crossing's initial
public stock offering in August 1998.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Salomon advised Global Crossing on its purchase of
Frontier Corp. and its failed attempt to merge with US West Inc.,
which was later purchased by Qwest Communications International Inc.</TE>
<TE>   A Global Crossing spokesman said the company was reviewing
Spitzer's request. She declined to say what information he was
seeking.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Spitzer released a series of embarrassing e-mails
written by Merrill Lynch analysts in which they privately disparaged
some stocks as they touted them publicly. After taking a public
relations hit, Merrill preempted further legal action by Spitzer by
agreeing to pay a $100-million fine and institute reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman, once among the most influential analysts on Wall Street,
has been a target of dozens of lawsuits as well as investigations by
Spitzer, congressional committees and the Securities and Exchange
Commission. He resigned from Salomon last week, taking with him $13.2
million in severance compensation.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack Grubman has been the poster child for the improprieties of
Wall Street analysts," said David Spika, a senior portfolio manager
at Banc of America Capital Management who oversees a $288-billion
portfolio that includes Citigroup shares. "If they can prove that
Sandy Weill had influenced Grubman to change his opinion on AT&amp;T so
that they could do their investment banking, that would be
significant."</TE>
<TE>   Several analysts don't see that happening.</TE>
<TE>   It is well-known that Weill and AT&amp;T Chairman Michael Armstrong
are friends and served on each other's corporate boards, said Craig
Woker, financial services analyst at investment data firm Morningstar
Inc. in Chicago. "But it's a little bit of a stretch to think that
there is a grand conspiracy here."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Thomson, spokeswoman for Salomon, rejected the notion. "Mr.
Weill never told any analyst what to write, and any suggestion that
he did is outrageous and untrue," she said, adding that the firm is
continuing to cooperate with Spitzer's investigation.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T spokeswoman Connolly also dismissed the allegation, saying
that the company's securities underwriters are selected based on a
list of criteria, but that "it's always about getting the job done."</TE>
<TE>   Woker said he doubts Salomon would have been desperate to get a
portion of about $45 million in fees on the wireless offering. He
noted that Citigroup earns nearly $4 billion each quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Weill "wouldn't have staked the reputation of the firm on what is
essentially chump change," said Woker, who does not own Citigroup
shares.</TE>

<HD>Tenet Plans $1-Billion Expansion</HD>
<DH>Health care: Chain says capital improvements are needed to
meet needs of aging baby boomers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare Corp. on Friday announced what it called its most
ambitious capital investment program to date: about $1 billion by
June 2003 on new facilities, hospital beds and improved services,
much of it to meet the coming "age wave" of baby boomers requiring
increased care.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Barbara-based hospital chain unveiled its fiscal 2003
capital plan in an atmosphere of growing unease over hospital mergers
and acquisitions and their effect on patients.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement also comes at a time when California officials
are concerned about a shortage of beds from a new surge in demand.</LD>
<TE>   Tenet has found increasing resistance to some of its acquisition
efforts in other parts of the nation and has come under fire locally
for trying to close the recently acquired Daniel Freeman Marina
Hospital in Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those same critics questioned Tenet's staying power in
meeting its claims and its commitment to serving local communities.</TE>
<TE>   "They have not kept their promises," said Laurie Sobel, staff
attorney for the San Francisco office of Consumers Union. "Some of
this is probably to deflect criticism."</TE>
<TE>   Other critics questioned Tenet's commitment to the Los Angeles
area, saying that the company announced a $7-million plan to rebuild
the pediatrics unit, upgrade the neurosciences program and expand the
emergency room at the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood,
while committing to spend much larger sums in other parts of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson dismissed the criticisms, saying
that Tenet was one of the few chains expanding capacity and services.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say that Tenet, as one of the nation's dominant
hospital chains, has no choice but to funnel more money into its
facilities to keep them competitive.</TE>
<TE>   "For hospital chains, it's always like an arms race. They have to
continually upgrade and improve their facilities," said health-care
expert Peter Boland.</TE>
<TE>   Boland said increased capital spending is the price for trying to
remain a top and innovative hospital chain where doctors want to
bring their patients.</TE>
<TE>   Added Wanda Jones, president of New Century Healthcare Institute,
which specializes in redesigning health-care systems: "The technical
base for hospitals change very quickly. There is a new wave of
technology every five to seven years.</TE>
<TE>   "Along with that have come new patient standards, such as single
private rooms instead of semi-private rooms and neonatal facilities
that are more private and allow for parents to interact with their
newborn," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's latest capital projects in California include a new
$90-million, 10-story patient tower at USC University Hospital,
including new acute-care space, operating rooms and inpatient beds; a
$44-million construction project at Twin Cities Community Hospital in
Templeton for expanded emergency room, obstetrics and intensive care
facilities; and $16 million for operating rooms and a new medical
office building at the Redding Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet shares fell 96 cents to $47.79 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock is up 22% this year.</TE>

<HD>Theme Parks Still Looking for Visitors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eighteen months after its grand opening, Walt Disney Co.'s California
Adventure is struggling more than its counterparts, still trying to
find an audience at a time when the nation's theme parks are
grappling with how to attract patrons in a weak economy.</LD>
<LD>   Figuring that Americans would take more driving vacations and
shorter trips closer to home and thereby boost attendance, many theme
parks confidently headed into the summer--only to realize the
anticipated throngs of local visitors didn't fully materialize and
heavy discounting would be needed to keep turnstiles cranking.</LD>
<LD>   Nationwide, attendance this year at theme parks is expected to be
down about 15%, analysts said. At Disney's California Adventure,
attendance is forecast to be off 20%, while its companion park,
Disneyland, probably will see no change in attendance figures.</LD>
<TE>   At California Adventure, which has never reached its original
target capacity of 30,000 guests in one day, a summer promotion
touting free admission for Southern California children was rolled
out for the second year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "People still don't get what [California Adventure] is about,"
said Tim O'Brien, a senior editor at Amusement Business, which tracks
attendance and other industry trends. "And that's an extra dose of
hurt on top of all the external factors everyone else is dealing
with, like Sept. 11 and the weak economy."</TE>
<TE>   The 55-acre park opened in February 2001 as part of Disney's
$1.4-billion expansion of its Anaheim property around Disneyland.
Beset by the recession, the tourism slump after Sept. 11 and some
problems of its own making, California Adventure has yet to come
close to meeting original attendance projections of 7 million
visitors a year.</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives quickly made changes to the park by removing
some of the edge from what was billed as an edgier, hipper
alternative to Disneyland and making Disney characters more
visible--something they originally said they wouldn't do.</TE>
<TE>   Answering Complaints</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pressler, chairman of Walt Disney Co.'s Parks &amp; Resorts
Division, said California Adventure has responded to some visitors'
complaints, including that there isn't enough for small children to
do and that it is short on thrills. Four kiddie rides will debut in
October, and a Tower of Terror attraction--copied from the popular
ride at Walt Disney World in Florida--will arrive in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't anticipate some of the changes we'd need to make, but
we've listened closely to our guests," Pressler said. "We had some
perception problems in the beginning, and we're still trying to
overcome them."</TE>
<TE>   Now almost through its second summer season, the cost cutting at
the park, spurred by low attendance, is more apparent than ever. The
largest food court there has been closed since Christmas, as have one
other food area and a restaurant. Hours have been cut at other
restaurants, with some open only on weekends, making it difficult to
find places to eat.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler said a lack of demand this summer has prompted the
closures of some restaurants inside California Adventure, which also
has shorter operating hours than Disneyland and tends to clear out
after the Main Street Electrical Parade as guests flock back to
Disneyland for an additional two or three hours. The wildly popular
event was pulled from retirement last year; park sources said the
initial boost in attendance it garnered has begun to taper off.</TE>
<TE>   'Go in, Get out'</TE>
<TE>   "If we come over here for anything, it's just to see the parade
and then we're out of here," said Tony Quinn, a longtime annual
passport holder who lined up for the nightly show in California
Adventure with his wife and two small children. "They don't have the
big family rides, the fireworks or anything close to the Fantasmic
[light show] that we can get over at Disneyland. Here, it's go in,
get out. Disneyland still holds us all day long."</TE>
<TE>   Pressler blames some of the attendance issues on the drop-off in
international tourists--which make up 20% of the two Disney theme
parks' overall visitors--and guests being more careful this summer
with their spending.</TE>
<TE>   But Disneyland continues to perform solidly. Last weekend,
Disneyland's attendance topped 50,000 on Saturday, while California
Adventure's skimmed the 17,000 mark, said management sources.
Disneyland has never discounted admission during the summer, nor has
it offered free admission for children.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still struggling with getting awareness up" for California
Adventure, Pressler said. "Once people go, our feedback is always
very positive. We just need to bring in some added horsepower, and I
think the new things we're doing like Tower of Terror will really
help get us where we want to be."</TE>
<TE>   New Attractions Key</TE>
<TE>   Especially in tough economic times, industry experts said keeping
new attractions brewing is the key to strong attendance--a lesson Six
Flags Inc. learned the hard way this summer. The company's chief
executive last week said sagging attendance at the company's three
biggest parks in New Jersey, Texas and Ohio--where no new attractions
debuted this summer--reduced revenue by $25 million in the second
quarter compared with a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Confident that the summer would be brighter for the company, which
operates more than 30 parks worldwide, Six Flags also cut discounts
that probably contributed to the 11% drop in attendance, said Glen
Reid, an analyst with Bear Stearns in New York. Six Flags Magic
Mountain in Valencia enjoyed slightly better attendance over last
year, mostly because of the opening of X, an extreme roller coaster.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was a bit surprised at the poor performance because we
all thought being in the regional theme park market, Six Flags would
be more insulated from this kind of economic downturn," Reid said,
noting that the company's stock tumbled 57% after its earnings
announcement. "Everyone was wrong, and now it's a matter of waiting
it out."</TE>
<TE>   Deep Discounts</TE>
<TE>   Other theme parks have kept attendance somewhat steady this summer
by offering deep discounts. Sea World in San Diego and Busch Gardens
in Tampa, Fla., for example, have offered free admission for the rest
of the year to guests who purchased one full-price ticket in the
spring.</TE>
<TE>   At Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, where healthy crowds are
turning out for a new roller coaster, discount coupons routinely are
offered through grocery stores and fast-food chains. At times,
Knott's gives discounts to guests who bring a Coca-Cola product.</TE>
<TE>   Similar offers have helped boost attendance by as much as 28% at
Universal Studios, which since mid-June has allowed kids 15 and under
free admission with a paying adult. Spokesman Eliot Sekular said the
summer has been one of the strongest as a result, with the park also
opening two attractions, including one featuring Spider-Man.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see such large-scale campaigns for discounts to locals,
you know there's still plenty of room to fill inside that park," said
Carl Winston, director of the hospitality and tourism management
program at San Diego State University. "They simply wouldn't be
giving away free tickets if they didn't have to, and this summer they
all pretty much had to."</TE>

<HD>TRW Wins Weather Satellite Bid</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: The 15-year, $6.5-billion contract will create a
monitoring system for military and civilian use. The deal could boost
area jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TRW Inc. won the largest satellite production contract in its history
Friday, a $6.5-billion program to build the nation's primary
weather-monitoring system for joint military and civil use.</LD>
<LD>   The 15-year contract--jointly awarded by the Defense and Commerce
departments and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--is
the latest key win for TRW's burgeoning space and electronics unit,
which employs 8,700 in Redondo Beach. The new contract will employ
400 to 600 workers, some of whom will be new hires.</LD>
<LD>   The contract is TRW's third major satellite award in the last 12
months. In April, the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency selected TRW
to oversee a $6-billion satellite system to track enemy missiles,
though TRW's portion of the work is less than the value of the
weather satellite program. In November, TRW won a $1.3-billion
Defense Department contract to build the instruments for a
communications satellite system. The company finalized both contracts
this week.</LD>
<TE>   "This has been a remarkable week for us," said Tim Hannemann,
chief executive of TRW's Space &amp; Electronics unit. "When we exited
2001, we had $4 billion worth of contracts to fulfill. As we head out
of 2002, that will roughly double to $8 billion."</TE>
<TE>   The satellites, scheduled for launch in 2008, will gather
meteorological data such as soil moisture, sea temperature and wind
speed. Such data will help the nation's scientists forecast weather
and monitor Earth's environmental changes.</TE>
<TE>   The initial contract would be for $2.9 billion for two satellites
and data recovery equipment with a $1.6-billion option for four
additional satellites. The entire $6.5-billion program includes
launch and administrative costs.</TE>
<TE>   About the size of a school bus, the spacecraft will carry 11
different sensor systems and perform a wider range of missions than
previous generations of weather satellites. They would be placed in
polar orbits, allowing them to observe the entire globe during their
orbits.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big plus for the Los Angeles area," said Marshall
Kaplan, director of space programs for Strategic Insight Ltd., based
in Arlington, Va. "This is a big step up for TRW. They've built
satellites before, but nothing of this magnitude. So this is a pretty
big feather in their cap."</TE>
<TE>   TRW edged out its larger rival, Lockheed Martin Corp., in a
bidding process that took four years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're sad this didn't happen," said Lockheed spokesman Buddy
Nelson. "It's a competitive business. You go into it expecting to win
some, but you know you'll lose some now and then."</TE>
<TE>   TRW shares gained 50 cents, or nearly 1%, to $55.68 on the New
York Stock Exchange, while Lockheed lost $2.45, or 4%, to $59.71 on
the NYSE, before the deal was announced. Shares of Northrop Grumman
Corp., which is buying TRW for $7.8 billion, primarily for the
satellite business, rose 77 cents to $115.73 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Raytheon Co., TRW's primary subcontractor on the bid, will create
the system's $1-billion ground-based data processing equipment from
its Aurora, Colo., facility.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's Space &amp; Electronics unit reported $2.02 billion in revenue
last year, up from $1.88 billion in 2000. The unit contributed 12.3%
of the Cleveland company's revenue in 2001, up from 10.9% the year
before.</TE>
<TE>   Hannemann said that revenue for 2002 will increase slightly but
that the bulk of the payments from these contracts won't begin until
2003, boosting the unit's revenue by more than 10%.</TE>
<TE>   The newest program--called the National Polar-Orbiting Operational
Environmental Satellite System--would replace two separate programs
independently operated by the military and civilian branches of
government.</TE>
<TE>   The new system would ostensibly save the government $1.6 billion
in operating and equipment costs, said John Cunningham, program
director for the Integrated Programs Office, which administers the
contract.</TE>

<LD>Habits can be murder to quit. Here, two Angelenos talk about coming
to terms with their personal compulsions.</LD>
<LD>   James Loughrie,</LD>
<LD>   22, political aide</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I can't remember the day I began smoking, but I remember why. It
was during final exams of my junior year in college. Big stress. I
had smoked a few times, but always mooching from friends.</TE>
<TE>   Soon I found myself buying cigarettes, and now it is all a blur.</TE>
<TE>   I give myself regular lectures about quitting, but here's what
happened when I last tried:</TE>
<TE>   I smoked my last cigarette at 6 a.m. Monday. Not until noon did I
want a cigarette more than anything in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Giving up is easily the most difficult thing I have ever
attempted. People could at least refrain from being stupid.</TE>
<TE>   Every moron has his or her own unique way of outshining the moron
before them. Like a friend who in a happy-go-lucky voice said, "Don't
smoke."</TE>
<TE>   Oh thank you, because I didn't know that all I had to do was
listen to you and any desire for a cigarette would be gone.</TE>
<TE>   Or the priceless idiot, another friend, who said, two days after I
quit, "You need to quit this."</TE>
<TE>   These were two people who, in two days with two stupid comments,
made me desperately want a cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   The third day, I was lamenting to a friend how badly I wanted a
cigarette, and he said, "All it takes is some self-control."</TE>
<TE>   Wow, is that all? Why is such brilliance wasted with my smoking
instead of solving problems in the Middle East?</TE>
<TE>   It's a battle that nonsmokers do not understand. Their idiocy
makes smoking look intellectual.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it isn't just a human problem. For example, I have been
chewing nicotine gum to help me quit. It is not actually gum, and it
comes with a 15-page instruction book. On top of the annoying
instructions like "bite down on the piece of gum about 15 times then
park it between your cheek and gum," the package for each piece is
the hardest thing in the world to open.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine a desperate addict fighting with a small piece of foil and
tightly glued plastic, desperate for a moment of relief. Opening a
piece makes me want a cigarette more.</TE>
<TE>   The quitting process makes me want a cigarette not simply because
I miss the smoking, but because life is so frustrating without one.
So then I go through moments of justifying smoking. I tell myself,
"I'm only hurting myself," which is true because California has laws
that prohibit smoking indoors.</TE>
<TE>   Besides that, with all the evils going on in the world, from
priestly scandals to the next round of terrorism, a cigarette is a
small thing to fuss over. And it's not as though my cigarette funds
the terrorist operations, as heroin does.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, I am supporting the economy by smoking, and in more ways
than the $4.50 a pack I pay for cigarettes. Think what tobacco
company lawsuit settlements do for cities and counties. It makes me
feel guilty about wanting to quit because if I did I would be
depriving a child of badly needed resources.</TE>
<TE>   And now here I am, fighting with a piece of non-gum that is still
called gum, angry and bitter at all of my friends.</TE>
<TE>   My absurdity is leaking through, and it is time for a cigarette--I
mean nicotine gum.</TE>
<TE>   How much longer will it be before I am rid of the metabolic need
for nicotine? How much longer until the cheery young fellow comes
back and evicts the cranky miser I currently am?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Postscript: After two weeks of fighting myself and living in a
nightmare, I broke. I was back outside taking smoke breaks. But I am
attempting to quit again.</TE>
<TE>   If you see me, be silent and walk away.</TE>

<HD>She's Got a Lot to Chew On While Attempting to Abstain</HD>
<DH>Nail-biting is a gnawing problem, but it's a sure-fire
stress buster for one aficionado.</DH>

<TE>   I bite my nails. That's my bad habit, and I've tried everything to
stop it. My mother concocted sure-fire recipes of the most wretched
ingredients, which she lathered onto my nails, and I still bit them.
I've tried lemon juice, pepper flakes, soap, bitter nail polish,
Band-Aids, sitting on my hands, anything.</TE>
<TE>   But I can't stop.</TE>
<TE>   Deep down I can't bring myself to give up my companion of 12
years.</TE>
<TE>   Biting my nails is neither healthy nor ladylike. It's a child's
habit and a disgusting one, if you contemplate all the germs building
up on your fingers and under your nails.</TE>
<TE>   But it is also extremely comforting. Why? I can't really say.
Maybe it's the rhythm of the chewing. Or the sound of my nails click,
click, clicking against my teeth. Or, possibly, it's the neutrality
of the taste that gives me some warped sense of security.</TE>
<TE>   Part of me wishes I could stop. I look at my worn, stubby fingers,
ripped cuticles and jagged nails and detest my hands. I keep them
folded in my lap and make a conscious effort to keep people from
catching more than a glimpse of my gnawed fingers. Friends and family
tell me that my image as a graceful, young woman is shattered when I
start masticating my thumb. But I go on biting.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder sometimes if bad habits aren't necessary. If I didn't
bite my nails, would I chew my lip? Would I spend too much time at
the gym? Would I smoke a pack of cigarettes every day? Would I go on
chocolate binges? Drinking binges? If I didn't hold onto this bad
habit, what would prevent me from picking up another? They're all
nothing more than unhealthy but sure-fire stress relievers.</TE>
<TE>   And don't we all have bad habits? I guess in my case, the only
person who gets hurt is myself--or my hands. I've tried to find
alternate methods of stress relief. On my better days, I'll play a
Chopin nocturne on the piano to calm myself. Often, I'll start
writing and vent feelings through my words. Like this.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no substitute for the immediacy of biting my nails. If
I'm in the car, late for an appointment, angry at traffic,
contemplating an argument with my parents or getting a bad grade,
only biting my nails takes my mind off those issues.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes I tell myself that the habit will pass. It's only a
phase. But what would I do in its place? I would need to pick up
another habit. Having a habit gives me a routine.</TE>
<TE>   My mother, in her efforts to mold me into a flawless creature,
doesn't understand that concept. It's not logical, she says. It's
natural to want to improve oneself, she says. It goes against nature
to bite your nails or work out constantly, she says. All things in
moderation, she says.</TE>
<TE>   My mom is a clean freak. I tell her that when she stops worrying
about everything being neat and organized, I'll stop biting my nails.
She looks shocked, as if being overly tidy is perfectly normal. But
I'm not going to stop biting my nails any time soon because I don't
want to. Whether I'm lazy or lack willpower, I have come to the
realization that I can't stop. I have a way to deal with that
depressing realization--I raise my hand and start nibbling.</TE>

<HD>Respect Tribe's Water Rights</HD>
<DH>The Hoopa people deserve the fair share of the Trinity
River's flow that they were promised in 1955. This is more than just
a matter of crops versus fish.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Broken promises were the hallmark of relations between the U.S.
government and the Indian tribes of the West in the 19th and early
20th centuries. Then the issue was land. Now, with a small tribe in
California's far north, it's water. As with many water issues, the
issue of who's right is being tromped by whoever has the water.</LD>
<LD>   In 1955, Congress approved the diversion of water from the Trinity
River, which rises in the Trinity Alps and, joining the Klamath
River, flows into the Pacific north of Eureka. The Trinity runs
through the 90,000-acre Hoopa Valley reservation just upstream from
its junction with the Klamath.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1964, however, water stored behind Trinity Dam has flowed
through a tunnel to the Sacramento River. Then it traverses the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to the Westlands Water District nearly
300 miles south of the dam.</LD>
<TE>   Congress promised the Hoopa back then that their water needs would
always come before those of San Joaquin Valley farmers. In 1955, Rep.
Clair Engle, the local Democratic congressman, promised that "not one
bucketful" of water needed by the Hoopa tribe and other local users
would be taken.</TE>
<TE>   The Trinity River basin and its rich salmon run was critical to
the 2,200-member tribe's culture, religion and economy. Congress
envisioned diverting 56% of the Trinity's flows in normal years,
leaving the rest in the river. But actual diversions have averaged
72% a year and have gone as high as 90% in some years.</TE>
<TE>   The reduced flow has devastated the salmon and steelhead runs and
left spawning grounds silted over because of the lack of flood flows
during the spring, flows that instead have gone to filling Trinity
Reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Congress passed a new law to fix environmental damage
caused by the Central Valley Project, including the Trinity
diversion. A study ordered by that act concluded in 1999 that only
53% of the Trinity waters should usually be sent south, and much less
in dry years. The rest was needed for fish and wildlife restoration
in the Trinity basin. The finding was ratified in 2000 by Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt.</TE>
<TE>   But Westlands feared losing water and sued to overturn the Babbitt
order. The suit is pending in federal court in Fresno. The Hoopa have
joined the federal government in defending the order. The tribe also
is sponsoring an amendment to a Senate bill dealing with Indian
affairs to uphold the Babbitt decree.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing this as just a matter of crops versus fish is not quite
right. The irony at the bottom of the dispute is that the federal
government wants to fallow thousands of acres in the Westlands
district because the soil does not drain well. It is becoming
saturated with salts and impossible to farm. In time the Westlands
district probably will have no use for the water it is fighting for.
That should make it easier to cut Trinity River diversions and
finally fulfill the 1955 promise to the Hoopa.</TE>

<LD>It's another one of those eye-rolling, only-in-Berkeley things.</LD>
<LD>   Students teach university classes in "Deconstructing Professional
Wrestling." Or, you could opt to take a closer look at the original
"Star Wars" trilogy through the eyes of fans or a course that
promises to "help you to love your body." All for college credit.</LD>
<LD>   But sex is always the downfall. In this case, it was allegations
of a sexual orgy and other improprieties that caused officials to
suspend a course on male sexuality in February and launch an
investigation. They determined that the sex activities were not part
of the course, but the whole roiling debate cast a shadow on UC
Berkeley's "democratic education at Cal," or "de-cal," program.
Students, supposedly overseen by faculty, teach classes that can't be
found elsewhere at the university--or most other places in the
universe.</LD>
<TE>   The debate will rise again starting Monday when the fall season's
crop of classes begins to be posted online at de-cal's Web site,
www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~decal. The list is awaited equally by critics
and fans.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 100 or so classes in its online schedule last semester,
many were engaging. Some were downright rigorous. The course on the
history of Afghanistan was full. Other courses examined prison issues
or psychology in modern American film. It's a world of the tempting
and the original, made all the more so by the realization that the
instructors are students themselves who go unpaid for their efforts,
teaching for the love of it.</TE>
<TE>   But what about that interdisciplinary look at the Grateful Dead? A
beginning Greek folk-dancing class that counts as comparative
literature rather than physical education? Clearly, something was
awry when students got credit toward graduation for learning how to
gamble better in a casino. A college cannot just set up a student-led
academic program, ask faculty to keep an eye on it and let the thing
run every which way.</TE>
<TE>   With closer monitoring and uniform standards, de-cal could be a
model addition to higher education, not to mention to the study of
Darth Vader. Berkeley could learn plenty from another de-cal class
taught last spring: "American Public Universities--Is the Goal of
Learning Being Met?"</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley plans to keep de-cal but have a working group oversee
the courses and train the student instructors. Too bad it won't have
that together in time for the fall class schedule, but the online
kibitzers will no doubt have plenty to say.</TE>

<LD>Massachusetts has a minuteman, New York the Statue of Liberty, New
Jersey shows Washington crossing the Delaware and Indiana depicts the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. These are designs on quarters issued so
far in the 50-state quarters program launched by the U.S. Mint in
1999.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's California's turn. The coin won't come out until 2005,
but Gov. Gray Davis has begun a process to select the appropriate
design for the Golden State. This will not be easy. Many other
states' designs have been fairly obvious--consider Georgia's peach
and Vermont's maple tree. California's size and history offer scores
of possibilities. There's bound to be controversy. And everyone has a
chance to participate.</LD>
<LD>   The Mint has issued five new quarters a year, in order of the
states' admission to the Union. California joined Sept. 9, 1850, as
the 31st state. Davis is calling on Californians to submit proposed
designs from Sept. 9 to Nov. 9. A committee will select a minimum of
20 proposals, from which Davis--if he is reelected this fall--will
pick five finalists for review by the Mint. Then the governor makes
the final choice.</LD>
<TE>   Some early ideas: the California poppy, a grizzly bear, the San
Francisco Bay Bridge, a surfer. Davis' Web site has a long list of
potential subjects, ranging from forts and military bases to airports
and freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Others are coast redwoods, Yosemite Valley, Big Sur, Death Valley,
Mt. Whitney, the old Spanish missions, the Gold Rush, the golden
trout, agriculture and Lake Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   What about Napa Valley, the Hollywood sign, Alcatraz? State
Librarian Kevin Starr says the symbol should be universal and not
specifically Northern, Central or Southern California. He likes Queen
Califia, for whom the state is named. In 16th century Spanish
literature, she was the monarch of a remote, fabled island. But
Califia is pretty obscure. Better might be a version of the state
seal with the goddess Minerva and the motto "Eureka." Too bad, state
flags and seals are disallowed, but mottoes seem to be acceptable.
Starr also likes Yosemite as a place belonging to the entire state.</TE>
<TE>   The final selection no doubt will be a difficult one. But perhaps
one design will stand out and seem to be so right that the governor
will declare "Eureka!" and choose it.</TE>
<TE>   Information on the California quarter, design criteria and entry
forms can be found on the Web at www.governor.ca.gov.</TE>

<HD>ID Badges for Safety, Discipline</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Back to School With Photo ID Badges," Aug. 1: As an English
teacher at Nogales High School in La Puente, I want to commend the
leadership at Murrieta Valley High School for implementing this
increasingly necessary school policy. The use of clearly visible
identification will facilitate safety and discipline on its campus.
The use of ID badges will help alleviate the kinds of problems that
many teachers experience: On numerous occasions, students have
ignored teachers' instructions for one simple reason: Teachers often
do not know the name of the offending students.</LD>
<LD>   Several times, students have turned their backs on me and run away
when I have tried to take them to the office. When students are asked
for their IDs the response is frequently, "I forgot it." Yet halfway
to the office, the student pipes up, "Oh! I guess I have my ID after
all."</LD>
<LD>   There is a positive and even more important reason to implement a
photo ID policy. While privacy may be the concern of some, I believe
that we should welcome the opportunity to become acquainted with our
children. I asked my students in several classes if anyone knew the
name of every other person in any of their classes. Only one student
answered yes. That was in his advanced-placement calculus class,
which had very few students.</LD>
<TE>   If readers were to ask their children the name of every other
student in any of their high school classes, they might be amazed at
how few could say yes. Remember, many of these students have been
attending classes together since elementary school! I welcome the
opportunity to say good morning to a student as I mention his or her
name. And we wonder why many teenagers do not feel comfortable at
school. Could it be because no one knows who they are?</TE>

<TE>   I'm not sure what sort of security can be offered the teenage girl
whose school ID badge is just about even with her bare bellybutton.
And I love the comment of Assistant Principal Mick Wager, who refers
to wearing a security badge as the same thing as a dress code. What
dress code?</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I don't know how there can be a concern for privacy; there should
be a concern for legislating a dress code. Murrieta Valley High
School surely needs one. I couldn't believe the pictures. One
student's ID was just a little smaller than her outfit.</TE>

<LD>Sam Bell's argument ("Federal Sports Quotas Kill Young Men's Dreams,"
Commentary, Aug. 19) that, somehow, half-hearted compliance with
Title IX is killing men's (minor) sports is nonsense. The facts are
undisputable: (1) the lion's share of colleges and universities still
are not complying with Title IX, even though it became the law of the
land 30 years ago; (2) long before Title IX, university
administrators and athletic directors were at their best and most
creative when axing men's minor sports--everything from crew and
lacrosse to tennis, track and soccer--to funnel public resources to
the revenue-generating sports; (3) this tired, pathetic, cynical,
laughable excuse unfairly blames our daughters and our sisters for
the simple bias, foot-dragging, folly, waste and ineptitude that
permeates far too many of our public (and private) institutions of
higher learning.</LD>
<LD>   The gentlemen who are peddling this pablum are the same
visionaries who were deathly slow to integrate sports, are
responsible for shameful athlete graduation rates, put Astroturf (and
money) ahead of student athlete safety--and now give us the Bowl
Championship Series.</LD>

<TE>   As a male coach of a female intercollegiate club sport, I had to
laugh at Bell's commentary on the destructive nature of Title IX.
Granted, I am a coach of a sport that is on the outside looking in,
and am not fighting to keep my team at the trough of an athletic
department's largess, but gender is not the major issue with recent
athletic program cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is money and the horrific job many Division I athletic
departments have done budgeting for their various sports. Sane
financial management would make it painless for universities to field
women's sports without eliminating men's sports.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we have mega-conferences designed for TV audiences of
football and basketball causing deficit-producing sports to be forced
into long intra-conference journeys from Pullman, Wash., to Tucson,
Ariz., and Ames, Iowa, to Austin, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the University of Kansas dropped its men's tennis and
swimming teams, saving $400,000 and $250,000, respectively. Surely
there is enough money in the current women's rowing budget of
$550,000 to put women on the water, men in it, and have money left
over to let some guys use the women's tennis courts. Athletic
departments at the Division I level have only themselves to blame
when expenses spiral out of control. Instead of listening to the
likes of Bell and the outraged swim-mothers he mentions, maybe we
should listen to the athletic directors at Division II and III
schools that are not cutting sports and that boast participation
rates as high as 50% of their campus populations. They must be doing
something right.</TE>

<TE>   Thank you for a well-reasoned opinion stressing the unfairness to
male athletes that has been the byproduct of the current
implementation of Title IX. If several universities are forced to
abandon a men's athletic program, such as swimming, the net effect is
to deprive some qualified athletes of the ability to earn an athletic
grant-in-aid, since it reduces the total number of scholarships among
all National Collegiate Athletic Assn. schools in that sport.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration could do more than merely announce the
formation of a committee to study how the law is being enforced. No
committees are needed, just some common sense.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is driven at most schools by the large number of
scholarships necessary to field a football team, since those
necessarily reduce the number of men's grants-in-aid available in
other sports. If football was taken out of the equation, most of the
Title IX pain, if not all, could be eliminated.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "French Quarter Icon Loses Je Ne Sais Quoi," Aug. 19: My family,
from Baton Rouge, La., has eaten exclusively at Galatoire's since
World War II when we visit New Orleans. It is a tradition. My sister
and I returned there July 5 this year for an early dinner. As we
rounded the corner onto Bourbon Street, I felt as though we had
entered another world with the noise, the filth and the smells. We
were whisked off the street by doormen and escorted to our table next
to tourists--dressed as such!</LD>
<LD>   Our waitress (men were the only staff in the old days) took our
trout almondine order, our favorite over the years. She informed us
that they were unable to get trout anymore, but had substituted
another white fish I'd never heard of. It was not the same. Surely
trout must be available somewhere along the Gulf Coast. Our meal was
not the dining experience we remembered. However, as a tribute to its
famous bar drinks, my sister's "old fashioned" provided us with the
only link to the wonderful meals we have enjoyed there over the
years.</LD>

<TE>   I must share with you my magical experience of my one and only
visit to Galatoire's years ago. Being born and raised in Southern
California, the whole New Orleans experience was new and
exciting--especially during Mardi Gras. We had dinner reservations
several days before Mardi Gras. Through a nondescript door (as I
recall it) we entered into a different land. I have never experienced
anything like it.</TE>
<TE>   No pretty greeter was there to help us, and I stood there feeling
a little lost while I marveled at the mood of the room. Barely half
of the customers were in their seats. Everyone was laughing and
talking and eating and drinking. The whole room was an explosion of
festivity and gaiety. The feel of the room was so different and so
joyful I felt like I had just stepped into the screen and become a
character in a movie. I had traveled through the looking glass and
discovered the opening in the back of the wardrobe. It was a feeling
I will never forget.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Cathedral to Tap Solar Power for Electricity," Aug. 16: It
strikes me as incredible that the $600,000 solar panel will only
generate 10% to 15% of the electricity for Cardinal Roger Mahony's
cathedral. It is reported that the solar panels will generate 66
kilowatts, an amount equivalent to the power used by 66 single-family
homes. By that figuring, the cathedral's electric needs are
equivalent to at least 500 single-family homes.</LD>
<LD>   While I applaud the efforts of large organizations to go (partly)
solar and eliminate the need for grid power, what has happened to
conservation? Surely lights, small appliances and electronics would
not consume so many kilowatts. In my experience it is 24-hour
refrigeration and heating that are the big draws. And solar
electricity is not generally considered a good source for space
heating. I hope it isn't being used for that.</LD>

<LD>Enough already! Every issue of The Times seems to contain at least
one use of that hackneyed term "politically correct." It surfaces
repeatedly in readers' letters--and not just editorial letters in the
California section but also the public forums in Living, Calendar and
Sports. Heck, it's even popped up on the comics pages.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever meaning was originally attached to this worn-out, banal
bromide has been completely diluted, and it's time to do away with it
altogether. Tossing off a trite expression like this is
intellectually lazy and allows the writer to avoid the exertion of
using critical thought to bolster an argument. Considering the
laughable overuse of "politically correct," the comics pages may be
the only relevant place for it.</LD>

<LD>It's quite ironic that The Times' quasi-endorsement of removing the
O'Shaughnessy Dam ("Another Yosemite, Maybe," editorial, Aug. 17) was
pages behind the headline "Thieves, Vandals Chipping Away at
Hard-Pressed National Parks," which, evident to anyone who enjoys the
outdoors, is rampant on all our public lands.</LD>
<LD>   While spending billions to right a past wrong done to a wondrous
valley may seem noble, it also ignores the present problem of
neglect, vandalism and mismanagement of what natural beauty we have
left.</LD>
<LD>   It would be better for future generations if the flooded Hetch
Hetchy Valley was made a flagrant, public example of "never again"
and have billions spent on positive, proactive management of all our
public lands before they've all been debased. Think beyond quality
over quantity--because as our population grows, a quantity of
tranquil open space will be a rare quality indeed.</LD>

<TE>   Whatever one may think of the idea of restoring John Muir's
beloved Hetch Hetchy to its original state, your editorial on the
subject was the usual hypocritical claptrap.</TE>
<TE>   Your inane comment that the Owens Valley was preserved as a
"recreational paradise" because the land is owned by Los Angeles was
incredibly offensive and an insult to the hundreds of people who have
suffered decades of serious respiratory ailments as a result of the
Department of Water and Power's grand theft of the water from that
area. This outrageous conduct was spurred by good old "there it is,
take it" William Mulholland, his supporters and the ownership of your
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   If the Hetch Hetchy dam was in Southern California, feeding the
thirsty lawns of L.A., would you be so eager to tear it down? We all

<LD>There is nothing humorous about a child's suffering. On Aug. 6, two
children underwent a 22-hour operation and one of them has undergone
two subsequent procedures and remains in critical condition. My
colleagues and I have cared for and prayed for these children daily.
To see them portrayed in such a cruel and insensitive manner in
Michael Ramirez's political satire is truly intolerable (editorial
cartoon, Aug. 18).</LD>
<LD>   Ramirez carefully illustrated the intravenous lines and monitoring
equipment of the intensive care unit; but what could he have been
thinking when he drew elephant and donkey heads on the children's
bodies?</LD>
<LD>   One of the children remains in the ICU quietly fighting for her
life, while her parents pray at her bedside and hold her small hands.
That is the real picture, Mr. Ramirez.</LD>

<LD>As a public school teacher who attended private schools through
eighth grade, I was confused by Vickie Oddino's selection of the top
private school stereotypes (Voices, Aug. 17).</LD>
<LD>   Rich parents, lack of cultural and religious diversity and
exemption from the Americans With Disabilities Act aren't the "bum
raps" that immediately spring to my mind. I would have picked
exclusive admissions, nonadherence to state education codes and lack
of public accountability as my main beefs.</LD>
<LD>   Still, private schools have every right to conduct business any
way they choose since they are privately financed. However, when it
is proposed that public tax money (vouchers) be used to send students
to private schools, these stereotypes or bum raps take on new
importance.</LD>
<TE>   If a private school accepts public money, is it still private?
Could it continue to exclude or remove certain students, include
religious instruction, withhold standardized testing results from
public scrutiny and remain exempt from state education codes?</TE>
<TE>   Would public schools still be required to accept all students,
provide an array of special education services and make test results
public? After all, private schools wouldn't have to follow these
requirements but would still be receiving public funding.</TE>

<LD>As I read Dina Khayat's Aug. 18 Opinion column, "Passport to a
Future," my mind was nodding in agreement. The Bush administration
and Congress should take her eloquent arguments in support of foreign
students studying at U.S. universities to heart. "Education is one of
the most effective tools in the fight against terrorism." It would be
shortsighted to place restrictions on foreign student visas.</LD>
<LD>   As a former Peace Corps volunteer, I have strong positive feelings
about exchange programs. Two of the Peace Corps goals are to help
promote a better understanding of the American people on the part of
the peoples served and a better understanding of other peoples on the
part of the American people. Khayat proves the importance of her time
at Columbia University with her statement, "When the Sept. 11 attacks
took place ... [they] destroyed a piece of me. Because in the end ...
I carry indelibly a piece of America in me." We need more
international students attending our colleges and universities, not
fewer.</LD>

<LD>Re your Aug. 19 article on converting ocean water to fresh water:
Desalinization is not a matter of if, but when. I have long felt that
California should be split regionally in terms of where we receive
our water. Since California agriculture utilizes the lion's share of
water, the fertile San Joaquin Valley should use most of the Sierra
snowpack. Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial counties could use
California's share of Colorado River water.</LD>
<LD>   For the great majority of us who live within 50 miles or so from
the ocean, we need to build numerous desalinization plants from the
Mexican border to San Francisco. Use the best technology (costs are
coming way down); tidal motion might be considered as a clean,
renewable energy source. Utilizing the ocean for fresh water is a
win-win situation. We would not have to search farther and farther
out for more water sources. We would not have to build more dams.</LD>
<LD>   It is better for the few remaining rivers, better for the
environment and it is a source that will never run dry.</LD>
<TE>   David Shibley</TE>
<TE>   La Verne</TE>
<TE>   The cost of taking the salt out of sea water is only one of many
problems of desalinization. The ocean is a solution of salts of all
sorts and suspended metals, and many are quite toxic. When ocean
water is processed by reverse osmosis and filtered many times, there
is a waste component that must be disposed of like any other
hazardous material. This waste component is the brine. This brine
contains all of the nasty stuff that is suspended in the water at
very dilute amounts, but becomes concentrated by the desalinization
process. Smaller cities have ideas to dump it in the ocean. This
would be bad for the ocean organisms.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that do desalinization say they water golf courses. Can
a desert with water problems like the Los Angeles Basin support
enough golf courses to continually spread this brine on thirsty
grass? So, if Los Angeles, with all of its various pollution
problems, adds the concentrated toxic ocean salts and heavy metals
from reverse osmosis, we will be severely limiting our ability to
feed and water the community that lives in this basin.</TE>

<LD>Re "Thieves, Vandals Chipping Away at Hard-Pressed National Parks,"
Aug. 17: As I gazed in wonder two weeks ago at perhaps the most
awesome sight this Earth affords, I overheard an Austrian tourist ask
an American young man not to throw a stone over the Grand Canyon
because the falling rock might accidentally hit a hiker. The American
dropped the rock on the ground and said he didn't realize that could
happen.</LD>
<LD>   Later I saw a father helping his two children scrawl their names
on a rock near one of the observation areas, and I also saw other
tourists--Americans mostly--tossing rocks over canyon walls or
feeding ground squirrels. There are signs posted throughout the park
asking that visitors not deface the grounds, feed the wild animals,
litter, throw rocks or take plants or stones. But that's what many
visitors do. And most of them are Americans.</LD>
<LD>   I can only conclude that many of my fellow countrymen can't read
or have poor values or both. The only things my wife and I took from
the Grand Canyon are the dust on our shoes, scores of photos, some
souvenirs purchased at gift shops and memories of the grandest views
we will probably ever see. That's all any visitor should take.</LD>

<TE>   Your article was disturbing but not surprising. While there will
always be a few rebellious, angry individuals who wantonly destroy
the property of others, most people would never consider stealing or
desecrating the property of a neighbor whose home they visit. So
fortunately most of us don't need to hire a staff to continually
patrol our property.</TE>
<TE>   But as long as we consider nature to be an unlimited resource to
use at our disposal for whatever we see fit, instead of as a neighbor
with whom we need to live respectfully, we will continue to have
growing numbers of people who consider it their right to litter,
deface and confiscate whatever they please from our national parks,
forests and monuments.</TE>
<TE>   After all, not a day goes by that our culture doesn't demonstrate
that we consider ourselves to have dominion over nature and can raze
it, lease it, sell it, drill it, pave it over or exploit it however
best serves our purposes.</TE>

<TE>   Your article struck at the heart of my very soul. You see, I'm a
baby boomer with fond memories of my dad taking our East Coast family
in our '57 Chevy to visit the great national parks. Touring more than
100 national parks and sites across the country by car during my
childhood--from the Grand Canyon to Mt. Rushmore to Yellowstone, Mesa
Verde, the Black Hills and Bryce--I never tired of the beauty of
these places. I promised myself one day I would return with my own
children so they could see this same splendor. I remember the parks
were pristine and well-kept back then.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as a college student in 1977, I returned to Yellowstone to
work for a summer. Again, I was in awe of the sights I would see each
day. I went back to many locales I'd visited with my family a decade
earlier, but something was different. The park had begun to show some
signs of wear and tear. Since then, I've been blessed with a husband
and children. When they're old enough, I had hoped to take our
triplets (age 5) and son (age 6) to visit our national parks. What
will I tell them when they ask who vandalized an old mine shaft or
why they can't see some ancient fossils because someone stole them?
What can I say when they see the same graffiti in the parks that we
left behind back in Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   The National Park Act of 1924 states that our parks were created
for the enjoyment of present and future generations. It is the duty
and responsibility of every American who has ever enjoyed even one of
our national crown jewels to protect them and to teach our children
to respect and treasure what our forefathers have worked so hard for.
America has more natural beauty than any other nation on Earth--why
would we want to throw it all away? Education begins in the home,
teaching our children values and national pride--not self-hate and
destruction of our homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Janis Elspas</TE>

<TE>   The solution to the parks' problem is to charge more to enter
them. Oh, I know the powers that be say they are for the people and
some could not afford to go, but these same people can afford trips
to Disneyland, color TVs, VCRs, SUVs and even the wonder of beepers
and cell phones. The last time I went to Yosemite we were charged
under $10 for a carful. I told the ranger I would be willing to pay
$50. I think most would. It would make them think about where they
are, too. Maybe the worth of the park is the worth of the ticket.</TE>

<HD>Seeking a Renewal of Arroyo Seco</HD>
<DH>Plan: A proposal eyed by government agencies and private
groups would remove some of the stream's concrete lining and boost
its flood plain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been more than 60 years since flood control engineers converted
the Arroyo Seco stream into a concrete flood channel. Now, a group of
nonprofits suggests, the time has come to restore the channel to its
natural state.</LD>
<LD>   A new study outlines how local, state and federal agencies, in
partnership with private organizations, could restore the Arroyo Seco
and its tributaries.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal suggests the creation of a flood plain system to
handle periodic flooding, protecting native habitat and improving
recreational opportunities along the corridor.</LD>
<TE>   "While we all realize that we are not going to return this area to
what it was before European settlement," said Arthur Golding, an
architect and urban planner with the Los Angeles and San Gabriel
Streams Watershed Council, "balance can be achieved."</TE>
<TE>   The Arroyo Seco Watershed Restoration Feasibility Study, in the
works for two years, was produced by North East Trees and the Arroyo
Seco Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   During a meeting at Caltech late Wednesday to introduce the plan,
Tim Brick, director of the foundation, said the study was "setting
the course for the future of the Arroyo Seco."</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo Seco refers to the stream that, depending on the season,
often trickles and occasionally roars for 22 miles from its beginning
in the Angeles National Forest to the Los Angeles River. It is also
used to describe the long, winding canyon carved by the stream.</TE>
<TE>   According to Brick, the Tongva tribe, the first inhabitants of the
area, called the area Hahamongna, or "flowing water, fruitful
valley."</TE>
<TE>   The Spaniards, who Brick joked must have found it in late summer,
named it Arroyo Seco: dry gulch.</TE>
<TE>   The watershed, the area that drains into the Arroyo Seco,
encompasses 46.6 square miles--almost twice the size of Pasadena--and
includes parts of the Angeles National Forest, Altadena, La
Canada-Flintridge, Pasadena, South Pasadena and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the tributaries that once fed into the Arroyo Seco have
long been buried by development and efforts to control the often
unpredictable stream. The watershed includes residential
neighborhoods and public parks that many environmentalists hope
eventually will be connected into a greenbelt along the arroyo.</TE>
<TE>   Can the Arroyo Seco be restored? That was the question Wednesday
evening. The answer: a qualified yes.</TE>
<TE>   "It is time," the study concludes, "to make urban stream
restoration a reality, in a place many thought it impossible--the
largest metropolitan region in the United States with the most
extensively engineered flood control system anywhere in the
world--Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   The report, which was funded in part by the California Coastal
Conservancy and the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority,
lists 11 pages of recommendations including almost 80 proposed
projects.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the plan to remove the concrete from the Arroyo
Seco south of Devil's Gate Dam in Pasadena and replace it with a
natural stream and flood plain system, some notable projects include:</TE>
<TE>   * Linking trails between Millard Canyon in Altadena and Hahamongna
Watershed Park in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   * Renovating the Brookside Golf Course in Pasadena with native
vegetation and a natural stream bed.</TE>
<TE>   * Improving the network of trails and bikeways in the lower
arroyo.</TE>
<TE>   * Enhancing wildlife habitat and passive recreational uses of
Ernest E. Debs Regional Park in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   * Creating a system of pedestrian walkways to connect the
Southwest Museum, the Lummis Home, Heritage Square and the Casa de
Adobe in Los Angeles in a cultural corridor.</TE>
<TE>   * Establishing a public open space in the vicinity of the
confluence of the Arroyo Seco and the Los Angeles River.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first study to look at the Arroyo Seco watershed as a
whole, Brick said. Related plans by the U.S. Forest Service, Pasadena
and Caltrans focus on parts of the watershed.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena introduced a five-volume Arroyo Seco Master Plan for the
1,000 acres of the arroyo within city boundaries in May. It has drawn
criticism from citizens groups, which say the plan favors
infrastructure development and recreation to the exclusion of
conservation.</TE>
<TE>   The city has extended the public review period for the plan's
draft Master Environmental Impact Report to Sept. 16 to allow the
public time to study the document.</TE>
<TE>   Brick said Wednesday that it is up to members of the public to
decide how the Pasadena plan and the watershed study should be
integrated.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Arroyo Seco stream can be returned to its former state
safely is a question that may be answered by the Army Corps of
Engineers. The corps is finishing its own study of the Arroyo Seco.
The next step, according to a spokeswoman, would be to study whether
the watershed plan is feasible.</TE>
<TE>   There are many other hoops to clear before full restoration of the
watershed becomes a reality--including obtaining funding and getting
a number of government agencies to sign off on the projects suggested
by the study.</TE>
<TE>   The two-volume Arroyo Seco Watershed Restoration Feasibility Study
is available on the Arroyo Seco Foundation Web site:</TE>

<HD>Women Who Pray: Voices From the Past Come Alive</HD>
<DH>Literature: Four new books probe history for fresh insights
into how the feminine spiritual experience differs from men's.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CECILE S. HOLMES</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At prayer, at work and at play, a woman's experience of the divine is
distinctive. What is changing, according to four new books on women's
spirituality, is that voices silenced for centuries finally are being
heard.</LD>
<LD>   Sifting through women's writings over those centuries means
uncovering a wisdom, clarity, beauty and distinctiveness reflecting
their corporate faith and experience, says Lucinda Vardley, editor of
"The Flowering of the Soul, A Book of Prayers by Women" (Beacon
Press).</LD>
<LD>   Themes and symbols in women's prayers "are different from prayers
by men, and therefore these prayers speak to our experience of life
and the great love of the divine," Vardley said. "Most traditional
prayers don't speak to women's experience, so I was hoping that this
book could fill that gap, introduce the feminine aspect of devotion
in all its elements."</LD>
<TE>   Her book, which features prayers addressed directly to God,
showcases prayers by such women as Sun Bu-er, Sappho, Julian of
Norwich, Christina Rosetti, Emily Dickinson, Annie Dillard and Marion
Woodman. Vardley, a writer and spiritual teacher, weaves in the
teachings on prayer of such spiritual giants as St. Teresa of Avila
and Hildegaard of Bingen. Then she introduces the ideas of noteworthy
writers including Simone Weil and Evelyn Underhill.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a history of women's teachings on prayers and a
common spiritual reader crossing religious traditions. She explores
the virtues of women who pray, including relatedness and
connectedness. In so doing, she bridges the usual separations between
Buddhists and Christians, Muslims and Hindus.</TE>
<TE>   In a different but related volume, journalist Pythia Peay uses the
stories of women from the past and present to offer models for how
women can cultivate five divine qualities within themselves. She
identifies those qualities as courage, faith, beauty, love and magic.</TE>
<TE>   A Spiritual Workbook</TE>
<TE>   Peay's book, "Soul Sisters: The Five Divine Qualities of a Woman's
Soul" (Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam) provides a spiritual workbook for
women seekers. She argues that women act as "faith-holders" for one
another. In other words, to strengthen the quality of faith in her
life, a woman might seek out a close woman friend to offer
inspiration and hope in times of darkness. She might also practice
"giving the gift of faith" to another woman.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps you have a friend who is struggling to hold her marriage
together, get her doctorate, paint or start her own business," Peay
writes.</TE>
<TE>   "Let her know that you are proud of her efforts--that you have no
doubt she will one day succeed, and that you are there for her. As I
have discovered, to have just one friend who never doubts the
successful outcome of your efforts--whatever form that might take--is
a priceless treasure beyond measure."</TE>
<TE>   Though her life had been dominated by spiritual exploration since
childhood, Peay did not understand how deeply gender had shaped her
journey until she wrote the book. She discovered how history had
shaped her, how patriarchy had influenced her outlook on the divine.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I had been aware of the recent archeological
discoveries of goddess statues, I didn't fully understand the impact
these discoveries would have on my unconscious perceptions," Peay
noted.</TE>
<TE>   "The image of God as a man is firmly embedded in our cultural
psyche--so just to image God as a woman, or to pray to 'her' rather
than 'him' had a revolutionary effect on my inner life. It
precipitated a transformation in values toward an ethic based more in
nurturing and tolerance and compassion in the here and now rather
than a transcendent heaven."</TE>
<TE>   She also began to realize that the rediscovery of the Goddess
"doesn't mean that the masculine image of God is wrong, but that our
religious history up until now has been imbalanced," Peay said.</TE>
<TE>   "A part of all our history and a part of all our souls--both men's
and women's--has been missing. And the women's spirituality movement
has been about righting that imbalance and restoring wholeness. As
the mother of three sons, I feel that in many ways women's
spirituality is just as important for men as for women."</TE>

<TE>   Working on different continents, two other female scholars have
written books providing perspective on how women's inner lives differ
from men's.</TE>
<TE>   "Women Pray: Voices Through the Ages, From Many Faiths, Cultures
and Traditions" (SkyLight Paths) by Monica Furlong, a journalist and
author in London, celebrates the diverse ways women worldwide have
called out to the divine.</TE>
<TE>   "Sacred Voices: Essential Women's Wisdom Through the Ages"
(HarperSanFrancisco) by scholar, teacher and writer Mary
Ford-Grabowsky explores selections from 150 female sages.</TE>
<TE>   Furlong's book, a creative collection packaged like a prayer book
with a ribbon to mark one's place, seeks to span continents and
cultures.</TE>
<TE>   In her introduction, Furlong writes that mystics of all cultures
have shared a sense of wonder and vastness as they contemplated the
presence of God. Everyone is somewhat limited by her own perspective,
she writes. Prayer, no matter what the tradition, may help to broaden
one's outlook.</TE>
<TE>   For "prayer is about a new perspective on the world about us, or
perhaps the recovery of an earlier perspective," she writes. "It is
about a rediscovery of awe and wonder, of love and joy, of a
transforming of grief and pain and loss, of a turning to one another
and to the world in which we find ourselves. All this is its
territory."</TE>
<TE>   In "Sacred Voices," Ford-Grabowsky compiles one of the most
far-reaching anthologies of women's voices. Her work presents the
long-suppressed laments, yearnings and praises of women across the
last five millenniums, including prayers from ancient Mesopotamia to
present-day America.</TE>
<TE>   In prose, poetry, chants and other writings, we hear from women as
different as Sufi poet Rabia and author Alice Walker.</TE>
<TE>   The exploration that led to the book began when Ford-Grabowsky was
a 17-year-old college freshman. The house mother in her dorm, a nun
and French literature professor, told her how she would copy quotes
from her favorite books onto small strips of paper and then tape them
inside her closet door.</TE>
<TE>   On waking each morning, she would open the door for inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   Ford-Grabowsky adopted the practice, eventually realizing most of
her quotes came from men. An accomplished theologian, she is
associate professor of spirituality and on the board of trustees at
Matthew Fox's University in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The extensive collection of writing and stories she compiled
through the years now fills 37 computer disks, containing works by
women mystics, contemplatives, hermits, healers, rabbis, homemakers,
founders of movements and others.</TE>
<TE>   In an era of economic downturn and escalating violence, these four
authors offer ideas, teachings, meditations and prayers that they
hope will bring change.</TE>
<TE>   Their outlook feeds into the sort of paradigm shift called for by
some feminists: a rebirth of the feminine principle in faith and
life, and a corresponding global increase in women's influence and
leadership.</TE>

<HD>Adelina Domingues, 114; Oldest Person in the U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelina Domingues, considered the oldest person in the United States
by the Guinness Book of World Records, has died. She was 114.</LD>
<LD>   Domingues died of congestive heart failure Wednesday afternoon at
a San Diego-area nursing home, family members said.</LD>
<LD>   A naturalized citizen of fiercely independent temperament and deep
religious faith, she outlived her sea captain husband and four
children and carried on a correspondence with Ronald Reagan while he
was president.</LD>
<TE>   "She believed in the American dream," said grandson Stephen
Domingues. "If you gave her a microphone or an audience, she was
ready to go."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1888 in modest circumstances on the Cape Verde Islands off
West Africa, Domingues attributed her longevity to her daily regimen
of eating vegetables and beans and her lifelong avoidance of alcohol
and tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   "She also thought she lived longer because she never played cards
or went to a beauty parlor," said Bob Silva, a Palm Desert artist and
friend of Domingues'. "She was very proud of that."</TE>
<TE>   She did missionary work for the Church of the Nazarene in Africa
and the Cape Verde Islands and was a vigorous street-corner preacher
during her years in Boston and New Bedford, Mass. She occasionally
sailed with her husband, Jose, on his voyages as the captain of
merchant ships. He died of cancer in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   On her 100th birthday, in heavily accented English, Domingues
lectured a public gathering that too many Americans take freedom for
granted.</TE>
<TE>   "She believed people should be thankful that America was a place
of such opportunity," said her grandson Stephen Domingues, who runs a
program assisting low-income and disadvantaged students at UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   She lived alone until she was 107, when she moved into a
retirement facility. In recent years she used a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a woman of passion and conviction," said granddaughter
Debbie Murphy in Hookstown, Pa. Among other things, she refused to
take medication. "I gave her some [sleeping medicine] once, and you
would have thought I was trying to poison her," Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Politically conservative, she became a pen pal of President
Reagan. "She wasn't too pleased with President Clinton," Murphy said.
"But she always said: 'I respect the office and will pray for the
man.' "</TE>
<TE>   Of her four children, only one lived beyond the teenage years.
Frank Domingues, 71, died in 1998. "After my father died, she began
to decline," Murphy said. "She believed God had a reason for
everything he did."</TE>
<TE>   Her father was an Italian harbor pilot, her mother of Portuguese
ancestry. She married at age 19 and in 1907 traveled to America
aboard the sailing schooner David Story. She helped found the
Nazarene church in New Bedford and was an expert seamstress.</TE>
<TE>   Her age was a matter of dispute. Based on wedding documents, she
would have been 115. But her family, helped by diplomats from the
Cape Verde Islands, established that her true age was 114. After the
death this year of Maud Farris-Luse, 115, in Michigan, the Guinness
Book of World Records bestowed on Domingues the title of oldest
living American. She was also the second-oldest person in the world,
according to Guinness.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is being planned.</TE>

<HD>Ethnic Groups Lose Ties to the Past as Their Churches Close</HD>
<DH>Culture: Catholic parishes vanish in the Steel Belt as
laid-off workers go elsewhere and a new generation forsakes
traditions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN NEPHIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>FORD CITY, Pa.</DL>
<LD>There were a host of reasons for closing Holy Trinity--a shrinking
community, a shortage of priests, the finances--but what Rose Bloser
knows is that a big chunk of her past was lost when the predominantly
Slovak church shut its doors.</LD>
<LD>   She was baptized there, and later walked down its aisle to be
married. She made a life in that church.</LD>
<LD>   "When everything boils down, all you have left is your roots,"
said Bloser, 51, whose Roman Catholic church closed several Sundays
ago. "I realize we're all in a melting pot, but you always keep some
ties to where you came from."</LD>
<TE>   In the 1800s and 1900s, Eastern European immigrants flooded into
southwestern Pennsylvania to work in the coal mines and steel mills.
Neighborhoods in and around Pittsburgh swelled with their numbers.</TE>
<TE>   The immigrants brought with them their work ethic, languages and
religions. Churches--many of them Catholic--sprang up, statues of
patron saints watched over them in the New World, Masses were held in
their native tongues.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in Pittsburgh and across the nation, many of those ethnic
churches are gone, and parishioners worry that their cultural past
could be lost.</TE>
<TE>   On the same day Holy Trinity shut its doors in Ford City, 35 miles
northeast of Pittsburgh, two other ethnic parishes did the same: St.
Francis of Paola, a predominantly Polish church, and St. Mary's,
attended by German families. Church officials said there were too few
people to support keeping all three.</TE>
<TE>   It was the same story a month earlier in McKeesport, where St.
Stephen's closed after ministering to Hungarian immigrants for more
than a century. It had gone as far in its early history as to import
a priest from Hungary to serve Mass; there were 13 oaken statues
inside the church, each representing an aspect of Hungarian history
and religion.</TE>
<TE>   "I was baptized there, made my first Communion there and was
confirmed there," Zoltan Toth recalled. "We are like a family because
we all grew up there."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere St. Jehoshaphat's, a Polish parish in Cleveland, closed
two years ago. In March, a Roman Catholic church in Gary, Ind., that
once drew nearly 1,000 Polish, Czech and Lithuanian parishioners
closed after attendance dwindled to about 200.</TE>
<TE>   From 1988 to 1995, Pittsburgh's Roman Catholic diocese closed 19
ethnic parishes; at the same time, 19 territorial parishes--those
serving people within established boundaries--closed because of costs
and a declining number of congregants.</TE>
<TE>   Priests said steel mills, coal mines and other businesses were hit
hard in the 1980s, and people left the older ethnic centers to find
work elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   For many others, the immigrant churches carried a connection to
the past that they thought they no longer needed.</TE>
<TE>   "That ethnic heritage is not as important to the younger
generation," said Father John Rushofsky, who has worked at several
defunct parishes serving various ethnic groups in the Pittsburgh
diocese. He said the loss of those churches left many older members
resentful.</TE>
<TE>   "It's painful for them because I think what it means to them is
that a lot of their ethnic heritage seems to be being disregarded,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Pittsburgh's Polish Hill neighborhood, Immaculate Heart of Mary
still holds Mass in Polish at 8 a.m. every Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   But the church school, where Polish was taught, has been closed
for years.</TE>
<TE>   And the Mass attracts only about 50 people in a church that could
easily hold many times that number.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the people who attend are middle-aged or older.</TE>
<TE>   Olaf Saykiewicz, a 30-year-old Polish immigrant, goes to
Immaculate Heart of Mary to keep his traditions alive.</TE>
<TE>   "We're becoming more integrated, which is good, but at the same
time, we're losing our identity," he said.</TE>

<HD>Hugh Lytle, 100; First to Tell of Pearl Harbor Hit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hugh Lytle, the journalist whose teletype message provided Associated
Press and the world with the first account of the Japanese attack on
Pearl Harbor, died Aug. 16. He was 100.</LD>
<LD>   Lytle died at an assisted living facility in the Northern
California community of Novato, according to his son, David.</LD>
<LD>   The senior Lytle, AP's Honolulu correspondent and a reserve Army
officer, was awakened at home by the Army on Dec. 7, 1941, as
Japanese planes bombed the U.S. fleet, according to David Lytle.</LD>
<TE>   "I heard the phone ring, and I heard the conversation," David
Lytle recalled. "[My father] said, 'They've bombed Pearl Harbor. I'm
out of here.' I didn't see him for two weeks."</TE>
<TE>   The senior Lytle quickly left for his AP office at the Honolulu
Star-Bulletin, where he filed a brief account of the attack in
progress, then reported for military duty with the Army.</TE>
<TE>   Military censors clamped down shortly after Lytle transmitted his
dispatch, and virtually no official accounts of the Japanese attack
were sent from Hawaii until much later that Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Lytle joined the Army's intelligence unit, and spent much of the
war as a military censor on the island of Oahu, filtering information
to the media and authorizing articles to be printed, his son said.</TE>
<TE>   Hugh Lytle later earned a Bronze Star for risking his life when he
led the 10th Army Information and Historical Service on Okinawa, a
covert project documenting American military strategies.</TE>
<TE>   He also served as the co-administrator of the Hawaiian territory
with Harry Albright, who became a longtime friend.</TE>
<TE>   In 1945, Lytle and Albright joined the Honolulu Advertiser as
co-managing editors.</TE>
<TE>   Lytle was considered a conservative voice as opinion page editor
until the early 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   He left the paper to become press secretary for Gov. William
Quinn, and then retired in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to the Big Island of Hawaii with his wife, Druzella
"Drue" Lytle, who was editor of the women's section of the Advertiser
from 1953 to 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New Philadelphia, Ill., Lytle moved around the country
growing up, following his stepfather, who worked for Western Pacific
Railroad.</TE>
<TE>   Lytle graduated from high school in San Francisco, earned a
bachelor's degree from UC Berkeley and joined the Chico Record
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Honolulu in 1938 to work for Associated Press. He
moved back to the mainland in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to son David of Sea Ranch, Calif., he is survived by a
grandson, Douglas; and two great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Dean Riesner, 83; Film and TV Scriptwriter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dean Riesner, who wrote screenplays for several of Clint Eastwood's
early films and later for the hit television miniseries "Rich Man,
Poor Man," has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Riesner died of natural causes on Sunday at his Encino home,
friends said.</LD>
<LD>   "He was able to bring an economy of language and make scenes come
alive," said director and longtime friend Sean Cunningham. "He left
room for the actors and the director to function, but he always drove
the story forward."</LD>
<TE>   Riesner was born in New York City, the son of silent film director
Charles Riesner. He started his motion picture career at age 5,
playing roles in his father's films. Under the name Dinky Riesner, he
appeared in the Charlie Chaplin film "The Pilgrim."</TE>
<TE>   He turned to writing as a young man, earning his first screen
credit in 1939 under the name Dean Franklin for "Code of the Secret
Service," which was perhaps most memorable for starring a young actor
named Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Riesner, again writing as Franklin, wrote "The
Fighting 69th," a rousing World War I action film about a well-known
Irish regiment, which starred Pat O'Brien and James Cagney.</TE>
<TE>   Riesner himself served in the Coast Guard in the Pacific during
World War II before returning to screenwriting and acting.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote and directed "Bill and Coo," a live-action film that told
the story of two birds terrorized by a black crow. Produced and
narrated by Ken Murray, the film won a special citation from the
motion picture academy in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s and '60s, he wrote the screenplays for the biopic of
1920s and '30s torch singer Helen Morgan, "The Helen Morgan Story,"
and for "Paris Holiday," a Bob Hope vehicle that also featured
director Preston Sturges in an acting role.</TE>
<TE>   Riesner moved on to television, writing scripts for such popular
series as "Lawman," "Ben Casey," "The Outer Limits" and "Rawhide,"
where he first encountered Eastwood.</TE>
<TE>   His first film starring Eastwood was the 1968 detective feature
"Coogan's Bluff," directed by Don Siegel. Riesner went on to write
"Play Misty for Me" and "Dirty Harry." He also wrote the screenplay
for the next segment in the Harry Callahan saga, "The Enforcer."</TE>
<TE>   He was an uncredited contributor to the script for "High Plains
Drifter." He also wrote the script for another Siegel film, "Charley
Varrick," starring Walter Matthau.</TE>
<TE>   Riesner's main characters reflected his "man's man" personality
and conception of masculinity, a colleague said Friday.  " 'Dirty
Harry' and 'Charley Varrick' were flawed characters but heroic, too,"
said screenwriter Todd Farmer. "Dean helped bring the idea of that
kind of characterization to film."</TE>
<TE>   Working in television in the 1970s, Riesner adapted for the small
screen Irwin Shaw's popular novel "Rich Man, Poor Man," the first
book, and Arthur Hailey's "The Moneychangers."</TE>
<TE>   Riesner's wife, Marie, died several years ago. He is survived by
several nieces and nephews. A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m.
Tuesday at the Writer's Guild Theater, 135 S. Doheny Drive, Beverly
Hills.</TE>

<HD>'Signs' Offers Plenty to Think About</HD>
<DH>Beliefs: The film's mix of 'anger, confusion and faith'
addresses spiritual questions in an entertaining way.</DH>

<LD>Amid the blockbuster thrillers of lazy summer, the last thing you may
expect is to find yourself pondering life's big questions as you
scream from the edge of your movie seat. Unless you've seen "Signs,"
that is, by director M. Night Shyamalan.</LD>
<LD>   "What a profound and prescient mixture of anger, confusion and
faith to pop up in the midst of a summer of silly sequels," said
Craig Detweiler, a screenwriter and the director of Reel
Spirituality, an institute at Fuller Theological Seminary in
Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   "For raising eternal questions in a hugely entertaining manner,"
Detweiler added, "M. Night Shyamalan deserves all the boffo box
office 'Signs' is definitely getting."</LD>
<TE>   Besides enhancing the fame of its director, whose credits include
the Oscar-nominated "The Sixth Sense," Shyamalan's latest film has
brought plenty of the signs Hollywood loves most--the ones that go
with dollars. During its opening the first weekend in August, the
movie earned more than $60 million.</TE>
<TE>   All this for a story about a priest, presumably Episcopal, who
loses his wife, then his faith, only to regain his belief after
confronting aliens who leave strange patterns in the cornfields
outside his rural home.</TE>
<TE>   "Signs" tells its otherworldly story in a down-to-earth way.
Rather than showing epic vistas of alien hordes, "Signs" concentrates
on the life of one family in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   When the film opens, the priest, Graham Hess, played by Mel
Gibson, is grieving for his wife. The father has two children: the
severely asthmatic Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin), a
little girl with a strange obsession about the water she drinks.</TE>
<TE>   Hess and his children are accompanied by Merrill (Joaquin
Phoenix), the priest's younger brother, who has moved back to the
farm to help after the wife's death.</TE>
<TE>   The intensifying threat from another world unfolds indirectly. The
family watches television reports, hears strange signals on an old
baby monitor and reads a book about aliens. The audience experiences
the horror of alien invasion through the interactions of four people.
Those interactions also reveal Hess' crisis of faith.</TE>
<TE>   When reports of mysterious lights in the skies above Mexico City
appear on TV, Hess tells Merrill the world has two kinds of people,
those who believe someone is behind everything that happens, and
those who don't.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill asks his brother which group he places himself in. "There
is no one watching out for us, Merrill," the doubting priest replies.
"We are all on our own." With the story of how Hess' wife died
related in a series of dreamed flashbacks, the priest interprets the
death as simply a random event in an unguided, uncaring universe.</TE>
<TE>   But the movie insists on tying up every loose end. Morgan's asthma
and Bo's water obsession are transformed from incidental afflictions
to key elements in the story and clear signs of a providential plan
at the film's surprising conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the obviously Christian elements in the movie, Christian
critics have not been unanimous in praising "Signs" as a clear
pointer to the faith.</TE>
<TE>   On his Movieguide Web site, conservative Christian critic Ted
Baehr finds the film to be "slightly syncretistic" with a "false
Hindu worldview and some moral elements and ambiguous Christian
ones." On the Movieguide scale of "Moral Acceptability," where
categories range from "exemplary" to "abhorrent," Baehr and fellow
reviewer Tom Snyder gave "Signs" a "caution" rating.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the reservations about theology, Baehr praises Shyamalan
as a moviemaker, calling "Signs" a "riveting suspense movie that
effectively combines both the horror and science fiction genres." And
Baehr said he appreciates the faith-friendly issues the movie raises,
describing it as "a very subtle, very well-conceived exposition of
... spiritual questions."</TE>
<TE>   Detweiler, however, applauded the film's affirmation of a presence
above and beyond the observable. "Like a lot of postmodern
filmmakers, I think Shyamalan clearly believes in the supernatural
... and approaches life with a strong sense of wonder," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The movie looks at "the fundamental questions of whether we are
alone in the universe ... or whether there is a possibility of divine
intervention and intelligent design."</TE>
<TE>   While making every detail make sense could be a reflection of
theology, it is also great screenwriting, Detweiler said.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways, I might argue that God is sort of the ultimate
screenwriter, bringing all the loose ends, the seemingly random
occurrences of our lives, into some great purpose."</TE>

<HD>Somporn Saekow, 62; Pioneer Monkey Trainer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somporn Saekow, founder of Thailand's first monkey-training school
and a pioneer in using monkeys to pick coconuts commercially, has
died. He was 62.</LD>
<LD>   Somporn died Tuesday of an apparent heart attack, soon after
demonstrating his craft to a group of tourists at his school in the
southern Thai province of Surat Thani.</LD>
<LD>   Somporn's daughter, Somjai, said her father had complained that he
was not feeling well before the demonstration but had "forced himself
to smile and carried on with the show."</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, she found him lying on the floor. He died later at a
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Somporn began teaching monkeys in 1957, but didn't open his school
until 1993.</TE>
<TE>   He quickly found a niche market during the economic boom years
when human labor was scarce and expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Though a human is unable to pick more than 100 coconuts a day,
monkeys can collect at least five times as many because of their
agility and dexterity.</TE>
<TE>   The animals are used elsewhere in Southeast Asia to pick coconuts.</TE>
<TE>   Somporn taught a six-week course for those who wanted their
monkeys trained. The owners then rented their animals to coconut
orchard managers for a fee.</TE>
<TE>   Somporn became a household name when his favorite monkey, Khai
Nui, carried the Surat Thani provincial flag during the opening
ceremony of the National Games in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Khai Nui, who has appeared in several television commercials, was
with Somporn until his last moments, Somjai said, adding that the
monkey seemed to know his master had died and was very depressed.</TE>
<TE>   Somporn will be buried Monday with royal honors in Surat Thani,
330 miles southwest of Bangkok.</TE>

<HD>Screenwriters Try to Be Good While Doing Well</HD>
<DH>Faith: A support group helps its members reconcile career
success in a secular business with honoring God.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIN CHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The check for the script promised five figures--a dream for a young
screenwriter scrambling to avoid eviction--and the movie, the fifth
in a horror series, seemed assured a cult following. But it also
would have meant surrendering to gratuitous gore.</LD>
<LD>   Annmarie Morais wasn't sure she could write the script that was
being tentatively offered to her, even with the $50,000 payment. But
she rented the series on video, just to make sure. She made it
through the first installment of the series (whose name she doesn't
want mentioned) without getting too queasy.</LD>
<LD>   Then, minutes into the sequel, she hit the fast-forward
button--and held it down for almost the entire movie.</LD>
<TE>   "It was blood for blood's sake and violence for violence's sake,"
said Morais, 29. "At the end of my life, I can't stand up and say, 'I
did that' and feel proud. There's nothing honorable to me in that."
She rejected even an offer to use a pseudonym in the credits. "You
can't be anonymous, because I know and God knows. I just couldn't go
there."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, friends and fellow writers Tirralan Davis and Emily
Glisson, who saw in Morais the strength of a grounded Christian, sat
with her at Champions Cafe, a coffee shop run by the Los
Angeles-based Oasis Christian Center. Over a doughnut and a latte,
they urged Morais to start a support group of Christian screenwriters
that dealt with the pressures of succeeding commercially while
honoring God.</TE>
<TE>   By this time, Morais had received a $25,000 Nicholl Screenwriting
Fellowship, sponsored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, and thousands of dollars more from selling other scripts.
But the memory of the horror series lingered.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks later, the support group, Write On, materialized.</TE>
<TE>   Every other Thursday, six to 20 screenwriters climb wooden stairs
to an apartment in Beverly Hills, slapping high fives and exchanging
embraces.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all attend services at the Oasis Christian Center, which
tries to organize its members in "common interest groups" rather than
traditional Bible study clusters in hopes that people will connect
through hobbies or professions. Because of seasonal activities, such
as surfing and beach volleyball, most groups get reorganized after
three months. Write On has continued for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Its members consider the fellowship too important to let go.
There's the fun of critiquing scripts, snacking on chocolate chip
cookies and screening films. But it's also about discussing the
necessity of a personal vision anchored in the Bible. It's about
setting standards and discovering that they're not monolithic, even
among a bunch of Christians.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Davis, 31, assistant group leader and meeting host,
shies away from certain language in her scripts, which she primarily
writes for children. But her boyfriend, Devon Greggory, whom she met
at Write On's first meeting, feels comfortable with using some
expletives, as long as his screenplay contains a deeper, more
meaningful message.</TE>
<TE>   "Her vision is frontal. Mine is more counterattack," said
Greggory, also 31. "With violence and sex [in my scripts], nothing is
gratuitous ... but it might ultimately show good and evil."</TE>
<TE>   It's the difference between C.S. Lewis' "The Lion, the Witch and
the Wardrobe," a clear Christian allegory, and J.R.R. Tolkien's "The
Lord of the Rings," in which the struggle between righteousness and
sin seems more subtle, said Lee Brandt, 32, a Los Angeles
screenwriter.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Tolkien's approach resonates more deeply with
this group of Christian screenwriters, many of whom cringe just as
much at the believe-or-go-to-hell approach of some Christian films as
they do at the explicit eroticism in some mainstream movies.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't write what will weaken my faith or someone else's faith,"
Morais said. "But that doesn't mean that I'll steer away from
controversy."</TE>
<TE>   The script that clinched her Nicholl fellowship in 1999 centered
on a girl's obsession with self-mutilation, instigated by a mystery
surrounding her stepfather's alleged sexual abuse. Titled "Bleeding,"
the script featured an older sister who wouldn't give up on delving
into the truth behind her sibling's masochism. It was a gruesome
subject, Morais said, but magnified a loyalty between siblings that
reflected God's love for humanity.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the ultimate end of my writing?" she asked. "It's not
about making Annmarie famous. At the end of the day, it's: 'God, this
is my gift that I'm giving back to you by being a person who writes a
story that can plant a seed of hope.'</TE>
<TE>   "It's leaving that seed, leaving that trail no matter where you
are, that people out there know there's a difference about you. It
opens the door to sharing your faith. Sometimes, a person might never
come to God, and that's OK. But lives are touched because of who you
are and what you stand for."</TE>

<LD>Over defense objections, prosecutors asked a judge Friday to set a
preliminary hearing for actor Robert Blake in early September.</LD>
<LD>   Blake's attorney, Harland W. Braun, wants the hearing delayed
until November. He said prosecutors turned over an additional 7,000
pages of evidence this week, and he needs time to read and evaluate
the material.</LD>
<LD>   Blake, 68, is charged with killing his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, 44,
near a Studio City restaurant May 4, 2001. He is being held without
bail at Men's Central Jail.</LD>

<HD>Senate Leader Calls On Davis to Sign Farm Worker Bill</HD>
<DH>Labor: Burton warns him not to give in to growers and veto
the binding arbitration measure. The governor's aides restate his
concern for its effect on the state's economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Holding a Bible aloft and pounding on a lectern, Senate leader John
L. Burton warned Gov. Gray Davis on Friday that it would be the
"biggest mistake" he has ever made to veto a binding arbitration bill
sponsored by unionized farm workers.</LD>
<LD>   For the Democratic governor to reject the bill at the behest of
powerful growers and to the detriment of the "lowest of our
workforce" would be a "political and moral" decision that would haunt
him for the "rest of his political career ... [and] the rest of his
life," Burton said.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it would be the biggest mistake he has ever made in his
political life [and] the biggest moral mistake he's ever made," the
liberal Democrat from San Francisco said at a news conference.</LD>
<TE>   Burton, who often spars with Davis, introduced the bill on behalf
of the United Farm Workers of America, AFL-CIO.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, a third-party arbitrator would impose a binding
settlement on growers and organized farm laborers when contract
negotiations reached a deadlock.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has signed binding arbitration bills sponsored by police
officers, firefighters and racetrack workers.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the UFW believe growers would settle rather than risk
having a contract forced on them. Growers argue that the union is
trying to get from the Legislature what it cannot win at the
bargaining table, and would deliberately tie up contract negotiations
as a tactic to force an imposed settlement.</TE>
<TE>   If signed, the bill would be the first time that the state's
agricultural labor relations law of 1975 has been amended.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has not said what action he will take on the bill, but from
the outset, aides reported he was concerned that it may have an
adverse impact on the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Davis riled supporters of the UFW bill earlier in the month
because the night before it was passed, he attended a fund-raiser
sponsored by growers.  During the first three weeks of this month, he
has received $184,000 in campaign donations from farm interests.</TE>
<TE>   Later Friday, Davis fired back at Burton, announcing a lengthy
list of actions he has taken over the years that benefited organized
labor, including farm workers, and Latino populations in California.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor doesn't really need any lesson from Sen. Burton on
farm workers. He's been there," said spokesman Steve Maviglio.</TE>
<TE>   He said members of Davis' staff met at least five times on the
bill with Burton's staff or with UFW officials between March and this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   One year ago, Davis reminded the Legislature that he had signed
several farm labor bills, but imposed a little-noticed moratorium on
signing any more substantive bills. "I will not consider any major
additional legislation in this area until these measures are fully
implemented and their impacts understood by all of the parties
involved," he warned.</TE>

<HD>Cities Grab Land for Revenue, but Judges Are Slapping Their
Hands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A stinging federal court decision that rebuked Cypress earlier this
month for trying to take a church's land for a Costco store is only
the latest signal that judges are losing patience with cities they
suspect of taking over private property just to increase tax revenue.</LD>
<LD>   State law allows cities to force landowners to sell property in
redevelopment areas, but not if the only goal is to accommodate
businesses that will boost tax revenue. "The whole purpose of
redevelopment law is to get rid of urban blight," said Mike Berger,
an attorney who battled the city of Lancaster in a similar case. "It
is not supposed to be used just to make a buck."</LD>
<LD>   The decisions come as cities grow increasingly desperate to raise
revenue through sales taxes. Proposition 13, the landmark tax reform
initiative passed by voters in 1978, restricts cities from raising
property taxes, so many see bringing a big retailer--such as Costco
or Wal-Mart--to town as the only way to increase their budget. And
that often means assembling a large property by forcing owners of
several small parcels to sell their land.</LD>
<TE>   "The whole problem is cities are in a mad race for revenues," said
George Lefcoe, professor of real estate law at USC. "But
redevelopment is not supposed to be used for that. So in
redevelopment, it is always Halloween. Cities wear a 'blight' costume
to hide the ugly face of tax dollars."</TE>
<TE>   The Cypress ruling on Aug. 6 was the latest in a long-running
battle between the city and Cottonwood Christian Center. Cottonwood
bought an 18-acre property in 1999 with plans to build a new church,
but the city--using its powers under redevelopment law to fight
blight--sought to use the land for a Costco instead. The church sued,
setting off a struggle that became a nationally watched test case of
a 2000 law that exempts churches from most local zoning regulations.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter called Cypress' concerns
about blight "suspect." He made a simple point: If the city wants to
erase blight on the vacant asphalt lot, it should simply allow
Cottonwood to build its 300,000-square-foot church and community
center there.</TE>
<TE>   As for the city's claim that it needs Cottonwood's land to build a
retail center that would generate much-needed sales tax dollars?
"Revenue generation is not the type of activity that is needed to
protect public health or safety," Carter wrote, and therefore does
not justify forcing private property owners to sell their land.
Carter ordered Cypress to halt eminent domain action against the
church until the case can be tried--a trial over which he would
preside.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling follows a similar decision in Lancaster, where a judge
ruled that the city could not force a 99 Cents Only store off its
land so Costco could expand. Lancaster argued that keeping Costco in
town represented a legitimate "public use" worthy of taking land away
from another business. U.S. District Court Judge Stephen J. Wilson
called that a "naked transfer of property from one private party to
another" in striking down the city's plan.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of courts recently that are looking much more
skeptically at what government agencies say is a valid public use,"
said Berger, the attorney who represented the 99 Cents Only chain</TE>
<TE>   Paul Shigley, managing editor for California Planning and
Development Report, tracks redevelopment disputes in the courts. One
fact, he said, is undeniable: "Cities keep getting crushed. They
aren't proving their redevelopment areas are blighted."</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts say cities' problems are rooted in a 1993 state law
that requires local officials to prove that areas they are trying to
redevelop show such intense physical and economic blight that they
burden the whole community. No longer can an area be designated as
blighted merely because a city says it is.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most notable examples has been Diamond Bar. City leaders
felt they were losing revenue to other communities by confining their
retail district to strip malls and small retail centers with a high
vacancy rate and little parking. A 1995 city study concluded that 86%
of residents did most of their shopping outside Diamond Bar.</TE>
<TE>   The city adopted a redevelopment plan in 1997 intended to lure
retail "power centers" and major retailers to town. The plan was
challenged by a group of residents who presented a videotape of the
supposedly blighted area. A state appeals court ruled that the tape
showed the project area lacked "anything remotely resembling blight."
The decision had an even wider impact than just striking down Diamond
Bar's plan: It also chipped away much of the flexibility cities once
had in creating redevelopment zones.</TE>
<TE>   A case in Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada further eroded that
flexibility. In trying to transform itself from a quiet ski town to a
year-round destination resort, the city created a redevelopment zone
that included an airport, resort area and retail center. Yet a state
appeals court was unconvinced there was sufficient blight on a local
golf course, community college campus and other parts of town
included in the plan and killed the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Redevelopment advocates caution against making too much of recent
court decisions. They say redevelopment has always been messy, and
such disputes are not necessarily new.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an exact process," said John Shirey, executive
director of the California Redevelopment Assn. "I look at these
things philosophically and point out that the controversy is proof
the process works. It shows people are able to have a say, raise
challenges, and get things moving in a different direction."</TE>
<TE>   He cites Cypress as a perfect example. After all the controversy,
the city and the church appear close to a land-swap settlement in
which the church would get a suitable site and the city could work
toward building the retail center it envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   USC's Lefcoe is more cynical. He says many cities push ahead with
legally questionable plans hoping they won't get challenged.
Opponents have only 30 days to sue after a redevelopment zone is
established, and Lefcoe says cities often try to move swiftly and
quietly enough to go unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like making an illegal U-turn," he said. "The cop isn't
always there to pull you over."</TE>

<HD>Judge's Feud With Media Continues Into Penalty Phase of
Westerfield Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The judge in the David Westerfield trial began the penalty phase
Friday the same way he ended the evidence phase: feuding with the
media.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge William Mudd announced that he plans to ban
the photographer in the pool for print media for breaking what Mudd
said is a rule against taking pictures of people sitting in the
courtroom's gallery section.</LD>
<LD>   A picture taken by San Diego Union-Tribune photographer Dan Trevan
showed Brenda van Dam sobbing on the shoulder of her husband, Damon,
as Westerfield was declared guilty of kidnapping and killing their
7-year-old daughter, Danielle. The picture was widely used and
appeared on the front page of the Los Angeles Times.</LD>
<TE>   "There has been a direct violation of the rules of the court,"
Mudd said.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd said he will hold a hearing Tuesday before finalizing his
ban. He did not mention banning television cameras from the penalty
phase, in which the jury must decide between recommending that
Westerfield be executed or sent to prison for life.</TE>
<TE>   Union-Tribune Editor Karin Winner said the newspaper did not feel
it broke any court rule because the Van Dams were not spectators but
former witnesses. Rule 980 of the California Rules of Court forbids
pictures of spectators or jurors but does not mention witnesses who
return to the court to watch the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Winner said that Trevan was "following the rule as it has been
interpreted by many local judges, that is, once witnesses, such as
the Van Dams, have testified and later seat themselves in the
gallery, there is no objection" to pictures.</TE>
<TE>   She added that she hopes "this apparent misunderstanding can be
cleared up" at the Tuesday hearing before the penalty phase resumes
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd and the media have had a series of confrontations. He
banished the field producer for a radio talk show, refused to release
transcripts of closed sessions and sealed search warrants. He also
has lectured the media on several occasions.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of the evidence phase, Mudd said he was once the
staunchest advocate on the San Diego bench in favor of allowing
television cameras and newspaper photographers at trials but that his
opinion has shifted 180 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   The Union-Tribune editorial page and others have criticized Mudd,
particularly for the ouster of the producer of the radio talk show
that used information leaked from a closed session.</TE>
<TE>   "Judge Mudd is trying hard not to be Judge [Lance] Ito," the judge
in the O.J. Simpson case who was criticized for allegedly losing
control of the courtroom, said Dean Nelson, journalism professor at
Point Loma Nazarene University. "But now it looks like it's Judge
Mudd who's out of control."</TE>

<HD>Judge Accuses O.C. of Hiding Work on Detention Center</HD>
<DH>Land use: In her opinion on the Joplin youth facility suit,
she takes the planning department to task on zoning and bulldozing of
sensitive land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge this week accused Orange County's planning department of
ignoring its own zoning guidelines and hiding details about a grading
project from the public.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego County Superior Court Judge Lisa Guy-Schall's assessment
is contained in a written opinion in which she derailed the county's
proposal to expand a juvenile detention center in Trabuco Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   The county wants to build the 90-bed Rancho Potrero Leadership
Academy on property next to the existing 64-bed Joplin Youth Center.
Nearby residents sued to block the project, fearing it would increase
traffic and harm the rustic surroundings.</LD>
<TE>   Their suit claimed that the project violates zoning rules for
Trabuco Canyon and that the county illegally graded the
environmentally sensitive land.</TE>
<TE>   Guy-Schall concluded that when the grading project was approved by
the Board of Supervisors last year, nothing was mentioned about using
bulldozers to clear land.</TE>
<TE>   "No public hearing was noticed or held as to the actual scope and
nature" of the grading project, wrote Guy-Schall. In fact, the board
agenda had only a vague description of maintenance and repair
projects at Joplin and "made no mention of grading or clearing," she
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Guy-Schall said the grading was carried out "without notice and
without proper permits." It destroyed the habitat of a threatened
species without compliance with state environmental laws, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also faulted the county for bypassing the
Foothill/Trabuco Specific Plan, created by the county to review new
construction in Trabuco Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the county designated Joplin as its own special district
and declared it exempt from the specific plan committee. The judge
called this strategy "misplaced."</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the Orange County Planning and Development Services
Department said they have not analyzed the judge's ruling and would
not comment. At the Probation Department, which is spearheading the
Joplin expansion, officials said they relied on county planners and
public works officials for technical information.</TE>
<TE>   The county must complete the $18-million expansion by the end of
2003 or lose an $8.4-million state grant. Officials said Friday that
they have presented the Board of Supervisors with a list of options.</TE>
<TE>   Activists who sued the county over Joplin said the judge's ruling
raises larger questions.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody should have been asking questions," said Richard Gomez,
a spokesman for the Saddleback Canyons Conservancy. "It smacks of a
fundamental violation of the public trust. How are we ever going to
believe that what they tell us is the right thing?"</TE>

<HD>Assembly Passes Voting, Foreign Prisoner Bills</HD>
<DH>Legislature: One measure would allow new citizens to
register on election day. The other would let inmates serve terms in
home countries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Over the objections of critics who called it an invitation to voter
fraud, the California Assembly passed legislation Friday that would
allow new citizens to register to vote on election day.</LD>
<LD>   The Assembly also approved a measure that would allow authorities
to send foreign prisoners convicted in California back to their home
countries. Those votes and others came as the state lawmakers
continued to debate dozens of bills before the end of the legislative
session next week.</LD>
<LD>   The voting bill, AB 51 by Democrat Jenny Oropeza of Long Beach,
would allow immigrants who are sworn in as American citizens seven
days before an election to register to vote on election day.</LD>
<TE>   It was supported by immigrant rights groups and officials,
including Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones. But some GOP
legislators said it would burden already strapped elections workers
and lead to voter fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important that we vote," said Assembly Republican Leader
Dave Cox of Fair Oaks, "but it is also important that the person that
votes be the person they say they are."</TE>
<TE>   Cox made his remarks after Democrat Kevin Shelley of San
Francisco, the Democratic nominee for secretary of state, encouraged
support for the bill, noting the historic decline in participation
among California voters.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly passed the measure on a 45-23 vote. It now goes to
the desk of Gov. Gray Davis, who has not taken a position on it,
according to a spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 52, a measure on the November ballot, would allow all
prospective voters to register on election day. If it passed, the
Oropeza bill would become moot.</TE>
<TE>   The foreign prisoner bill, SB 1544 by Democrat Betty Karnette of
Long Beach, would allow for noncitizens convicted of crimes in
California to be returned to their home country to serve the term
there if certain conditions are met. The prisoners could not be death
row inmates or be serving life terms; state and federal officials, as
well as officials in the inmate's home country, would have to agree
to the transfer.</TE>
<TE>   "The advantage of this is really fiscal," said Democrat Fred
Keeley of Boulder Creek, noting that roughly 5,000 prisoners would be
eligible, a number that would ease the burden on the state's
overcrowded prisons.</TE>
<TE>   But some Republican lawmakers expressed concerns that drug
kingpins and other politically connected prisoners would abuse the
law to get out of prison faster.</TE>
<TE>   "I am just suspicious that this will allow people who are serving
long terms but have political pull in their home country" to exploit
the situation, said Republican Phil Wyman of Tehachapi.</TE>
<TE>   The measure passed 49 to 13. It still needs final Senate approval.</TE>
<TE>   In other action:</TE>
<TE>   * The Assembly passed legislation by Keeley that gives gay and
lesbian domestic partners who are registered with the state
inheritance rights to their deceased partner's possessions in cases
where there is no will. AB 2216 was approved on a 43-27 vote and now
goes to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   * The Assembly Judiciary Committee approved a measure to
strengthen Californians' control over how banks and other financial
firms can use their financial information. SB 773 by Democrat Jackie
Speier of Daly City now goes to the Assembly floor.</TE>

<LD>My colleague Pat Rathbun was bound for Union Station in a DASH bus
the other evening when the driver appeared to run a red light, nearly
hitting a car crossing the intersection.</LD>
<LD>   A police officer walking the beat saw the incident. The cop hopped
on board the bus and scolded the driver. But before he could whip out
his ticket book, the passengers started to protest. Many were in a
rush to connect with Metrolink trains leaving Union Station.</LD>
<LD>   The riled riders told the officer to leave, including one woman
who stated she worked at City Hall. Sensing a mutiny, the cop let the
driver off with a (quick) warning.</LD>

<TE>   Unclear on the concept: In their never-ending search for the
little contradictions of life, readers submit the following (see
accompanying):</TE>
<TE>   * A six-pack in name only (spotted by Dean Terlinden).</TE>
<TE>   * A drinking glass that doesn't measure up to its billing
(Terlinden).</TE>
<TE>   * One place where you wouldn't expect to see a ban on drinking

<TE>   * And finally, evidence of more poaching in California by Florida,
which, as you know, previously stole such concepts as Universal
Studios and Disneyland from this state (Joe Dymkowski).</TE>
<TE>   Take me out to the poetry reading: Baseball fans who are angry
about the possibility of a strike might consider a change of pace:
the Monrovia-based Baseball Reliquary, a whimsical traveling museum.
Over the years, the Reliquary has displayed such items as a
"partially smoked cigar" supposedly left behind at a brothel by Babe
Ruth, hair curlers worn during a game by pitcher Dock Ellis, and a
baseball bearing the forged signature of Mother Teresa (it was seized
by federal agents).</TE>
<TE>   The Reliquary's next show is Sunday, when it will present a
reading of baseball poetry and prose at the Pasadena Central Library.
And, of course, there will be exhibits, most prominently "a tortilla
that bears an image with an uncanny resemblance to the late Dodgers
owner Walter O'Malley."</TE>
<TE>   Reliquary exhibit (cont.): One thing you don't have to worry
about: If you do attend, you won't be throwing more money in the
direction of major league players and owners. They have nothing to do
with this show.</TE>
<TE>   That's why it's free.</TE>
<TE>   Dicey timing: I just heard a new radio ad by Alaska Airlines,
which makes its pitch by incorporating new lyrics into "Take Me Out
to the Ballgame." Wonder what Alaska will do if the baseball players
strike Friday, outraging fans everywhere? Could be one, two, three
strikes you're out for that commercial.</TE>

<HD>Deliberations to Begin in Bias Trial</HD>
<DH>Court: LAPD officers and leaders are sued by blacks
claiming racial profiling on roadway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police officers acted properly when they ordered three
blacks, including a Virginia judge, out of a car at gunpoint and
forced them to lie face down on a street while handcuffed, a city
lawyer said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "None of the officers did anything wrong," Assistant City Atty.
Don Vincent told a federal jury in a racial profiling lawsuit against
the city. "They were following the policies and tactics of the
department, tactics that over the years have saved many, many lives."</LD>
<LD>   Alotha C. Willis, a judge from Portsmouth, Va.; her husband, Wayne
Person, a civilian contract manager for the Navy; and Sheryl Crayton,
an assistant principal at a Carson middle school, are suing 10 police
officers involved in the July 3, 1999, episode in Venice, as well as
top Los Angeles Police Department officials.</LD>
<TE>   In his closing argument to the jury, civil rights lawyer Stephen
Yagman claimed that the three were pulled over and subjected to a
so-called "high-risk felony prone" search solely because they were
African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   He also accused LAPD brass of fostering a "xenophobic" and
"paramilitary" culture that permits racial profiling of black
motorists.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been going on forever," Yagman said. "It was going on
under Chief [Daryl F.] Gates. It is going on now."</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of the monthlong trial, Yagman subpoenaed a parade
of present and former police chiefs and members of the Board of
Police Commissioners to support his claim that the department
maintained a custom and practice of tolerating racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   They included Gates, former Chief Bernard C. Parks, current
interim Chief Martin Pomeroy, 12 present and former police
commissioners, and two LAPD inspectors general.</TE>
<TE>   Most said that they had no personal knowledge of any racial
profiling incidents, and that any such conduct would have been
improper under the department's policy banning racial discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Last August, Parks issued a special order outlawing racial
profiling.</TE>
<TE>   Yagman accused Parks in particular of resisting efforts by the
police commission and the inspector general to exercise civilian
control over the department. Parks resigned this year when the police
commission voted against renewing his contract.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing remarks, Vincent defended Parks and his
predecessors, contending that they maintained a "zero tolerance"
policy on racial discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   He urged jurors to focus their attention on the incident that
triggered the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Officers Luis Navarette and Manuel Ibarra testified that they
spotted Crayton's red Volvo making an illegal right turn at an
intersection in Venice while they were on traffic patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Navarette said he ran a computer check and was advised that the
license plate on the Volvo belonged to another vehicle. After getting
the same response a second time, Navarette said, he and his partner
figured the Volvo might have been stolen, and could have been used by
someone planning to commit a robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The officer testified that he radioed for additional patrol cars
and a police helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   But Yagman argued Friday that Navarette called for backup even
before he had run the car's plates.</TE>
<TE>   "The only information Officer Navarette had at the time was that
the occupants of the Volvo were black, and that there was a traffic
infraction. That's racial profiling," he contended.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent countered that Yagman was confused about the timing of
events, and that the officers acted only after they ran the license
plate number.</TE>
<TE>   "Their mind set was [that] this was a possible felony or a felony
in the making," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a tactic, he said, forcing someone to lie prone in the street
"is not pretty, but it's the safest way to handle an unpredictable
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Willis, Person and Crayton testified that they were on the ground
five to 10 minutes. They were then helped to their feet by officers,
led to a sidewalk and frisked.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later, their handcuffs were removed and they were
allowed to go without being cited. A sergeant at the scene told them

<HD>Blaze in San Jose Another Blow to Struggling Area</HD>
<DH>Recovery: Developers vow to rebuild after fire ravages
ambitious 42-acre project. Critics question property's potential in
wake of high-tech slowdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Its cause still unknown, the fire that ripped through the
construction site of a new upscale development in San Jose on Monday
was yet another glaring setback to a region that is already smarting
from the high-tech economic slowdown.</LD>
<LD>   "This probably had more of an impact on the psyche of the city
than on its financial situation," San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales said of
the blaze, which destroyed 246 luxury apartment units and damaged 36
businesses at Santana Row, the most ambitious mixed-use development
project in the city's history. "This was a very exciting project, and
there are thousands of people who were going to be employed there and
are now unemployed. In that sense, it's a blow and it's hard to
take."</LD>
<LD>   Embers from the 11-alarm fire also ignited fires that damaged or
destroyed 43 apartments and homes nearby, forcing about 130 people
from their residences.</LD>
<TE>   The building that burned was the largest structure in the
538,000-square-foot first phase of an ambitious 42-acre project. The
lower levels--including retail stores, five restaurants and 940
parking spots--were left standing. The apartment units that comprised
the top levels of the structure were completely destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The first phase of Santana Row had been scheduled to open Sept.
19. Developers vow to rebuild, but a new opening date has not been
set. In all, an estimated 20% of the development was damaged.
Executives of the project's Maryland-based developer, Federal Realty
Investment Trust, pledged to have many of the stores open in time for
the holiday shopping season.</TE>
<TE>   Conceived in the Silicon Valley boom times of the late 1990s, the
audacious Mediterranean-style project is to include 1,200 units of
luxury rental housing, 680,000 square feet of retail space and a
213-room hotel. Touted as a very high-end shopping destination, it
has risen conspicuously in the heart of an otherwise working class
neighborhood in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of the commercial space at Santana Row has been rented
so far, and none of the planned tenants have pulled out in the wake
of the fire, said Tom Miles, the property's general manager.</TE>
<TE>   Though Santana Row has garnered attention from urban planners for
the project's innovative mixed-use blend of residential and
commercial space, retail and real estate experts have expressed
reservations about its prospects since the region's economic slowdown
began about two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Santana Row is situated directly across from Valley Fair, another
high-end shopping mall owned by the Westfield Group. Observers
questioned whether the giant new project would be able to draw enough
retailers--and customers--to make the sprawling development
profitable.</TE>
<TE>   "This project was past the point of no return before the downturn
happened," said Matthew Ostrower, a retail real estate investment
trust analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "I think there is still
[an] attractive demographic base that will use the type of space and
the type of tenants that Santana Row is going to produce. The
question is, is there enough of them to satisfy the needs of
retailers in both Valley Fair and Santana Row?"</TE>
<TE>   "All the planning took place in the bubble period when the money
was flowing and the sky was the limit. That's not happening anymore,"
said business professor Dale Achabal, director of Retail Management
Institute at Santa Clara University. South bay retail has been hit
pretty hard by the recession, and the area is not experiencing a lot
of growth, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, retail sales in the region have dropped precipitously in
the last couple of years, leaving many cities in and around Silicon
Valley with unexpected deficits. In San Jose, sales tax revenues in
the last quarter were 20% less than in the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have taken a tremendous hit," Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   He attributes most of the decline to a steep drop in
business-to-business sales revenue, not a slowdown in retail.</TE>
<TE>   Residents and city officials had high hopes that Santana Row would
bring a much-needed economic boost. The project was expected to bring
about 1,200 jobs by the time of the planned September opening. Over
the next two years, the city was projecting about $1.5 million a year
in new sales tax revenue from the project, out of a total revenue
stream of $144 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been a bump that we could use as a city," said San
Jose Councilman Ken Yeager, whose district includes Santana Row.</TE>
<TE>   Fire investigators turned control of the fire-ravaged property
back to the developer Friday. So far, they don't know what caused the
blaze. Although there is no indication of foul play, an anonymous tip
line has been established, and a $5,000 reward is being offered for
conclusive information about how the fire started.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 witnesses and construction workers have been
interviewed, said Battalion Chief Greg Spence of the San Jose Fire
Department. "If you ask them a question, they give you an answer. But
there's nothing extra. We feel that if there's someone who knows
more, maybe they are afraid to come forward."</TE>

<HD>Boat Carrying Tons of Illegal Shark Fins Held by Coast
Guard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The Coast Guard announced Friday that it has seized a fishing vessel
containing an estimated 20 to 35 tons of illegal shark fins, the
largest seizure made under a new law banning the practice of
shark-finning.</LD>
<LD>   The 82-foot, Honolulu-based King Diamond II was spotted 350 miles
southeast of Acapulco by Coast Guard personnel operating from the
Navy destroyer Fife.</LD>
<LD>   After an inspection, Coast Guard personnel took control of the
boat, which was brought into San Diego Harbor on Friday escorted by
the Coast Guard cutter Tybee.</LD>
<TE>   Two other vessels were seized this week off the American territory
of Guam in the Western Pacific as part of a worldwide crackdown,
according to Paul Ortiz, senior enforcement counsel for the National
Marine Fisheries Service.</TE>
<TE>   Under a December 2000 federal law, it is illegal for U.S.
fishermen or U.S. vessels to possess shark fins without the
carcasses, an attempt to end the practice of killing sharks solely
for the purpose of removing their fins.</TE>
<TE>   Shark fin soup is a delicacy in Asia, where a bowl can cost $100.
But environmentalists say finning is a cruel and wasteful practice
that threatens to devastate the shark population.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are no criminal penalties, fishermen caught with
illegal shark fins can face loss of their boat and penalties of
$120,000 per violation.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz said the King Diamond's captain and four crew members were
being interviewed in San Diego through a Vietnamese translator. He
said their nationality is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The Fife was on drug interdiction duty off Mexico when it was
diverted to intercept the King Diamond II.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz said that federal officials had developed information
through intelligence sources that the vessel had the illegal shark
fins.</TE>
<TE>   He said the vessel is suspected of buying the fins from tuna
fishermen. Sharks, he said, are a "by-catch" of tuna; boats use
hundreds of hooks at the same time to catch tuna.</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Saudis to Pay $223 Million to Sheik's Ex-Wife</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ruling in long- running case is leveled at two
members of the royal family, but also holds kingdom liable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a ruling that seeks to dip into the Saudi royal family's coffers,
a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday that a sheik and
his brother-in-law prince must pay $223 million to the sheik's former
wife.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike previous judgments in the long-running case, the ruling by
Judge Alban Niles is the first to demand accountability from the
Saudi kingdom. The judgment was leveled against Sheika Dena Al
Fassi's ex-husband, Sheik Mohammed Al Fassi, and his brother-in-law,
Prince Turki bin Abdul Aziz, second in line to the throne of his
brother King Fahd. The suit also includes the kingdom of Saudi
Arabia.</LD>
<LD>   Dena Al Fassi was originally awarded $81 million in 1983. Aside
from proceeds from the sale of the Beverly Hills property the couple
once shared, the sheika has never been able to collect on the
judgment, said her attorney, Marvin Mitchelson. The ruling in Los
Angeles this week takes into account two decades of accrued interest.</LD>
<TE>   The attorney said he hasn't received a response from the Saudi
royal family, "but I expect one."</TE>
<TE>   According to Mitchelson, the tradition of the royal family is to
financially support their immediate and extended family. On a daily
basis, the king gives millions of dollars to members of the royal
family to spend, especially his brothers, the attorney said, adding
that Al Fassi directly benefits from his relationship to the royal
family.</TE>
<TE>   "The king says, 'I'm giving each of you money. You are to take
care of your families....' That is the protocol for that country and
the basis for our lawsuit," Mitchelson said. "They have billions of
dollars. We expect to collect."</TE>
<TE>   According to the attorney and court records, the king and Prince
Turki also helped Mohammed Al Fassi "kidnap" the couple's four
children shortly after the initial judgment, despite a court order
granting custody to Dena Al Fassi.</TE>
<TE>   She now lives in Venice, Italy. Her ex-husband lives with their
four grown children in Cairo. Mitchelson said his client has seen her
children only a few times since her husband left with them.</TE>
<TE>   Before the couple's Beverly Hills mansion fell victim to arson in
1980--to neighbors' cries of "Burn, burn, burn!"--it was the talk of
the town. They had painted the white Italianate home green, filled
outdoor urns with plastic flowers and painted white plaster nudes in
natural skin and hair tones.</TE>

<HD>104 Airport Workers Charged in Crackdown on False IDs</HD>
<DH>Probe: Fraudulently obtained security badges allowed access
to sensitive areas. Protesters say the undocumented immigrants are
being treated like terrorists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL and JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials in charge of an anti-terrorism investigation launched after
Sept. 11 at Southern California airports said Friday that their
effort has culminated in federal charges against 104 workers.</LD>
<LD>   Local authorities had withheld details Thursday when word first
leaked out of an unspecified number of arrests made as part of a
nationwide crackdown on workers who fraudulently obtained security
badges.</LD>
<LD>   The badges provide access to airplanes, runways, cargo holds and
other sensitive areas.</LD>
<TE>   The charges followed a nine-month inquiry that focused on the
employment records of tens of thousands of personnel at Los Angeles
International Airport, John Wayne Airport in Orange County, and
airports in Ontario, Long Beach and Palm Springs. The investigation
is part of a broader nationwide effort begun after last year's
terrorist attacks transformed airport and airline security into a
national priority.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, authorities had hit almost 100 airports in
Washington, D.C.; Salt Lake City; Boston; the San Francisco Bay area;
and elsewhere, but the more than 40,000 workers checked in Southern
California were believed to be the most to date in what the
Immigration and Naturalization Service has dubbed "Operation Tarmac."</TE>
<TE>   The predawn sweeps that began Thursday had resulted in 81 arrests
by midday Friday, authorities said. Officials were still seeking 23
fugitives.</TE>
<TE>   None of the suspects has any known link to terrorism. But
officials voiced concern that their sham status could have subjected
the workers to blackmail.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to take a proactive approach to identify those who may
pose a threat to public safety and national security,'' said U.S.
Atty. Debra W. Yang, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The majority staffed custodial, maintenance or food service jobs,
authorities said, though some were security screeners and baggage
handlers. A few worked directly for major airlines, including
Continental, Delta, American and United.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all of the suspects face charges of using phony Social
Security numbers to obtain their high-access badges, which allowed
many holders to bypass security checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Most charged are illegal immigrants, but some are legal U.S.
residents and even citizens who used identity theft--or lied on job
application forms--to conceal criminal records or for other reasons.</TE>
<TE>   A maintenance worker at LAX allegedly used a false Social Security
number so he could use his real Social Security number to collect
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Another LAX employee is charged with lying about a conviction for
carrying a concealed weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Offenders could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted on
federal charges of document fraud. In addition, noncitizens could be
subject to deportation.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the 104 people charged in federal court, a dozen other
airport workers face state charges for fraudulent use of Social
Security numbers on state Department of Motor Vehicle applications,
said Carole Peterson, assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of fraud in the nationwide investigation varied
considerably. At LAX, for instance, where investigators scrutinized
the employment records of almost 40,000 workers, only 46--about
0.1%--were charged.</TE>
<TE>   The percentage was considerably higher at John Wayne Airport in
Orange County, where 51 workers--2.3% of the 2,210 badge-holders
scrutinized--were accused of using fraudulent Social Security numbers
to obtain their positions.</TE>
<TE>   Six workers at Ontario International Airport were charged, and one
employee was charged at Long Beach Airport. No violators were found
at Palm Springs Regional Airport.</TE>
<TE>   As officials announced the charges Friday at the federal building
downtown, protesters gathered to condemn the arrests, arguing that
officials were treating undocumented workers like terrorists.</TE>

<HD>Wrecking Ball Feasts on Landmark Route 66 Cafe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Trails restaurant, one of the last remaining holdouts on the
Southern California end of famed Route 66, was demolished this week
in Duarte to make way for a subdivision after a last-ditch effort to
save the 50-year-old eatery failed.</LD>
<LD>   A cease-and-desist lawsuit filed by preservationists Aug. 9
attempted to halt the bulldozers, but it was denied by Superior Court
Judge David Yaffe on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Duarte City Council voted unanimously July 9 to allow Bowden
Development to raze The Trails, which closed last year, and build a
29-unit residential tract on the 2 1/2-acre lot on Huntington Drive.</LD>
<TE>   During the meeting, council members listened to arguments from
Bowden Development and residents who wanted to make way for the
homes, and from preservationists who wanted the restaurant saved.</TE>
<TE>   Residents described The Trails fondly--known for its rib-eye
steaks and saucy waitresses--but many said the building had become an
eyesore.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Leib, who led the preservation effort, was unavailable for
comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy that it's over," said Bowden project manager Richard
Tipping. "But we're frustrated that [preservationists] cost the city
and us a lot of extra money."</TE>
<TE>   He declined to say how much was spent on legal and delayed
construction costs. He said the project was stalled about 45 days.</TE>
<TE>   Most of The Trails' equipment and furnishings were auctioned off.
The restaurant's trademark sign will be donated to the Duarte
Historical Society.</TE>

<HD>A Big, Fat Windfall at the Box Office</HD>
<DH>Film: Low-budget, low-profile, low-tech 'Greek Wedding' has
exceeded expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first, all they wanted was for their little movie to survive
through the cinematic onslaught of Memorial Day. Four months and more
than $57 million later, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" has turned into
Hollywood's unlikely success story of the summer.</LD>
<LD>   Without the benefit of lightsabers, car chases, special effects or
marquee stars, the movie, which cost a mere $5 million to make, is on
track to gross more than $100 million worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   Its low-budget, grass-roots marketing campaign--pitched initially
at Greek Americans nationwide--is almost laughable by current
standards of the industry, in which mass-marketed mega-movies like
"Spider-Man" and "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" open on
thousands of screens in their first weekends and cost many millions
to promote. Those films have grossed $404 million and $300 million,
respectively, in the U.S. alone, leading the way for a
record-breaking season at the box office.</LD>
<TE>   But while some adult moviegoers despaired this summer about the
hyped-up, dumbed-down state of Hollywood, "Greek Wedding" offered
hope that small, character-driven films, powered primarily by word of
mouth, could break through.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been other indie hits, like 'The Full Monty,' 'Blair
Witch Project,' these touchstone films that represent
independent-film benchmarks," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of
Exhibitor Relations Co., a box-office tracking firm. "But this is in
a class by itself, because it is a really low-budget film, it is a
comedy, and it is out in the summer."</TE>
<TE>   Since it was released April 19, "Greek Wedding," which was
directed by Joel Zwick, has been steadily climbing the charts this
month and has out-grossed many studio releases on a per-screen
average. It is now the highest-grossing independently produced
romantic comedy ever made, outpacing even "Four Weddings and a
Funeral," which in 1994 took in $52.7 million in domestic sales and
launched Hugh Grant's career in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why it has hit this chord in America, other than we
are all immigrants," said actress Rita Wilson, who produced the movie
through Playtone, the company she owns with her husband, Tom Hanks.
"I remember a distributor in New York telling me early on: 'This is
just what the country needs right now. They just want to laugh and
have a good time.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Greek Wedding" wasn't the only small movie to succeed this year;
others include the racy Mexican film "Y Tu MamaTambien" and the
Indian film "Monsoon Wedding." The new quirky independent comedy "The
Good Girl," starring Jennifer Aniston, is doing strong business, and
even "The Fast Runner," a three-hour epic in the Inuit language about
feuding brothers in the Arctic Circle, grossed $2.6 million playing
in only 56 theaters nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the independents, a few of the big studios saw some success
this year from their smaller films, such as Warner Bros.' "Insomnia"
and "The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood" and 20th Century
Fox's steamy "Unfaithful." Each grossed more than $50 million
domestically.</TE>
<TE>   "What these movies have in common is a very strong individual
filmmaker point of view, while the big studio movies are industrial
commodities," said Steve Gilula, president of distribution for Fox
Searchlight, which released "The Good Girl." "These movies are
character-driven and about real people. And they are very, very
relatable."</TE>
<TE>   The summer movie season, which began with the release of
"Spider-Man" on May 3, is expected to surpass $3.8 billion in ticket
sales by Labor Day, up 10% from last summer, according to Exhibitor
Relations. That record-breaking number was fueled not only by
colossal openings from "Spider-Man" and "Star Wars," but by a mix of
movies playing side by side in the nation's megaplexes, said Jeff
Blake, head of marketing and distribution for Sony Pictures, which
released "Spider-Man" and leads the summer box office with $1.3
billion in ticket sales to date.</TE>
<TE>   "Greek Wedding" showed that small movies can be moneymakers too.
Proportionally, "Greek Wedding" will probably net more money for its
distributor, producers and investors than either "Spider-Man" or
"Star Wars" did--because the costs associated with the blockbusters'
production and marketing are so high, according to industry sources.</TE>
<TE>   Stage-Show Roots</TE>
<TE>   But "Greek Wedding" is more than a box-office smash. It has become
a cultural phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened with 'Greek Wedding' was that every self-respecting
Greek in the country showed up," said Jim Gianopolus, co-chairman of
20th Century Fox, who is Greek. "But then the charm and the sweetness
of the film spoke for itself. It is truly the box-office phenomenon
of the year, without question."</TE>
<TE>   "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," which is based on Nia Vardalos'
one-woman stage show, is about a young woman caught between pleasing
her traditional Greek family and trying to find her identity as a
modern American--including marrying a non-Greek. Despite tepid
reviews from some critics, the film has become the talk of dinner
parties, hair salons, cafes and retirement communities.</TE>
<TE>   "Our demographic is anybody with a family that drives them crazy,
or anybody who has ever had to plan a wedding, a funeral or a
vacation," said Vardalos, who wrote the screenplay and stars in the
movie.</TE>
<TE>   The movie, which co-stars "Sex and the City's" John Corbett, has
also become a favorite of the children of immigrants, such as Wilson,
who is Greek on her mother's side. Growing up, she identified
strongly with feeling as if she was "Greek at home and American at
school." She approached Vardalos about producing the film immediately
after seeing her show.</TE>
<TE>   Audiences ranging from Armenian American retirees in Orange County
to Mexican Americans in Los Angeles are turning up at sold-out shows,
according to Vardalos, who says she was in a Montreal cafe when a
Chinese family came up to her table.</TE>
<TE>   "The girl said, 'Oh my God, we are from Detroit and my mom is
exactly like your dad,' and the mom was behind her nodding her head
and laughing," Vardalos recalled.</TE>
<TE>   But nobody, including Vardalos or the film's distributor, IFC
Films, expected the overwhelming response. Initially, studios showed
some interest in the script, but none would sign a deal with an
"unknown" like Vardalos as the star--one studio suggested replacing
her with Sandra Bullock. Some studios wanted to change the ethnicity
of the characters to Latino, Jewish or Italian. Wilson had to
independently finance the film.</TE>
<TE>   But Vardalos said the film's success is not necessarily a textbook
example of brilliant marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no secret trick" to it, she said. "We got lucky. You
can't manufacture word of mouth. You can't pay people to tell their
10 cousins."</TE>
<TE>   "This was built from word of mouth and became a project of
managing its success," said Bob Berney, who oversaw the film's
distribution at IFC. "We kept joking about making it through Memorial
Day and then Fourth of July, and now it's Labor Day--the movie might
make it to Christmas. We can barely keep up" with requests for
prints.</TE>
<TE>   Small Beginnings</TE>
<TE>   IFC's approach to releasing the film was cautious. It began small,
at 103 theaters. Over four months it built up to more than 1,300
theaters in 50 cities. By contrast, "Spider-Man" opened on 7,500
screens on its first weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Though blockbusters' box-office grosses typically drop sharply in
their second weekend--ticket sales for the heavily marketed "XXX,"
for example, fell 48% after its opening weekend--"Greek Wedding" shot
up 85% in its fourth month out.</TE>
<TE>   It has been climbing up the list of top 10 films, is currently
No. 6 and is expected to break $60 million domestically this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   But Berney is still being cautious, not wanting to distribute the
film too wide, noting that its funny romantic overtones play well to
packed movie houses.</TE>
<TE>   IFC has spent only $15 million on marketing--compared with the
average of $50 million a major studio will spend for a blockbuster.
Berney knew they had to initially zero in on their core audience--the
Greek community, women and older moviegoers. IFC made only spot
television buys on such shows as "Oprah" and "Regis" and the cable
network "Lifetime" to target the female audience.</TE>
<TE>   Paula Silver, whose company Beyond the Box was hired to handle the
grass-roots marketing for the film, said they decided to approach the
Greek community first.</TE>
<TE>   Silver, the former president of marketing for Columbia Pictures,
initially began with $1.2 million to plug the film. She started at
ground level in March at the annual Greek Folk Dance Festival, in
Spokane, Wash. At the festival she handed out 1,000 T-shirts and got
up on a stage to tell the crowd about the movie.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, Silver got the makers of Windex--a product featured
prominently in the film--to give money to the Hellenic Museum. The
museum, in turn, hosted a party with prominent Greeks in Chicago,
along with Second City Theater, of which Vardalos had been a member.
Silver also organized an e-mail network to get Greek Americans out to
see the film on its first weekend.</TE>
<TE>   At Greek parades around the nation they threw out T-shirts to the
crowds and then showed a looped "Greek Wedding" trailer at pubs,
where revelers finished the day.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Greek community got behind the film, others did too. And
once women began seeing it, they started dragging their husbands to
the theater with them, Vardalos said.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter where a film comes from, if there is a gap for
a certain audience, they will go," said Berney, who is now the
president of New Market Films, another independent distributor.</TE>
<TE>   At Le Petit Greek restaurant in Los Angeles, where Vardalos is a
regular, manager Tomy Maheras said customers rave about the movie and
even comment on some of the more memorable moments, like "the
spitting scene" and "the Windex situation."</TE>
<TE>   "I see a couple hundred people a day, and people come in and talk
about it on their own," he said. "I was surprised that people who are
not Greek found it funny also. And I have sent a good 30 people to
see it."</TE>
<TE>   It is also the talk of the Palmia senior community in
Mission Viejo. While playing chess in the community room, residents
raved about the movie, said resident Alice Ajamian. She went with a
group of female friends and has told relatives in Wisconsin to go see
it.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, "Greek Wedding," and "Monsoon Wedding" hark back to
Hollywood classics like the screwball comedies of the 1930s or the
more conventional 1950s hits like "Father of the Bride."</TE>
<TE>   "That is the one movie all the old ladies and senior citizens went
to. It brings back memories if you are from a family that is Italian
or Armenian or Jewish," said Ajamian, who is Armenian. "I think that
is what [the studios] should do more of instead of these bang-bang
and sex things. I like the old movies they used to do years ago. They
don't make those kind of movies anymore."</TE>
<TE>   She's right, for the most part. Despite the success of "My Big Fat
Greek Wedding," audiences can expect as many sequels and
adrenaline-fueled action films next summer as this, including Warner
Bros.' "The Matrix Reloaded," Fox's "X Men 2," Sony's "Charlie's
Angels 2" and Universal's sequel to "The Fast and the Furious."</TE>
<TE>   "When the audience displays less keen interest in the franchises,
then we certainly won't be doing it in this industry," said Marc
Shmuger, vice chairman of Universal Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   And inevitably, this being Hollywood, some are looking to turn
"Greek Wedding" into a kind of mini-franchise of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Offers for a sequel, a board game and a television show have come
rushing in. Vardalos said she has passed on all so far.</TE>
<TE>   But because of the movie's success, Vardalos said, some studio
executives are finally considering that perhaps "there are other
stories to be told and other leads to be cast."</TE>

<LD>President Vladimir V. Putin pressed North Korea to forge a new
Asia-Europe freight route by extending Russia's trans-Siberian
railway across the Korean peninsula, bypassing China.</LD>
<LD>   Putin, speaking after almost four hours of talks outside
Vladivostok with North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il, said
the new link would help revitalize Russia's depressed and
underpopulated far east.</LD>
<LD>   Moscow would also stand to reap billions of dollars in transit
fees.</LD>

<DH>Caucasus: Neighbors describe bombing in Georgia as a
cross-border attack or self-inflicted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>The president of Georgia accused Russia of bombing his nation Friday
and killing one person, in an escalation of long-running tensions
between the neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   Russian military officials shrugged off the protest by President
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, denying the incident and claiming that the
Georgians probably dropped the bombs themselves--although Russian
helicopters and planes have bombarded the country in the past.</LD>
<LD>   Georgian officials said the airstrike early Friday also wounded
five people. Georgian border guards reported that seven Russian
planes took part in the attack, and a shepherd told Russia's NTV
television that he saw eight planes flying from the direction of the
Russian border.</LD>
<TE>   The bombing occurred in the Ilto Gorge, near the town of Akhmeta
and nine miles west of the Pankisi Gorge. In November, Georgian
officials said Russian planes had dropped bombs in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between Russia and Georgia have been poor since the
countries emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, but
the presence of Chechen rebels in and near the Pankisi Gorge in the
mountainous region of northeastern Georgia is the harshest irritant.
The guerrillas are seeking independence for the nearby Russian
republic of Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's conflict underscores the frustrations on both sides:
Georgia's impotence in the face of its powerful northern neighbor and
Russia's inability to stop the rebels from using Georgia as a haven
and a base for launching attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is also concerned about the lawless Pankisi
area, amid reports last spring that some Arab mercenaries were hiding
there. U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers, or Green Berets, are in
Georgia training an anti-terrorist force to bring the gorge under
control.</TE>
<TE>   The first test will probably come Sunday, when the Georgian forces
are scheduled to hold an operation in and around Pankisi--the first
sign of the nation's willingness to tackle a problem that has angered
Russia for two years.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's bombing came a day after Georgia's Rustavi 2 television
network aired a report that dozens or hundreds of Chechen fighters
had taken shelter in an area near the Pankisi Gorge.</TE>
<TE>   The station showed footage of an abandoned campsite, a military
badge bearing the Chechen rebel colors and a fragment of a military
map of Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   "The bombing took place in the area of the deserted campsite we
were showing yesterday in our program," Akaki Gogichaishvili, a
senior producer at Rustavi 2, said in a telephone interview with The
Times. "What I don't understand is why they choose to bomb a place
that rebels had left a couple of days earlier, which was made clear
in our program."</TE>
<TE>   Tamaz Kaadze, chief doctor of the Akhmeta district hospital, said
six bombing victims were brought to the hospital early Friday. One
was dead and five were wounded, two critically, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are all local farmers who went to the woods in two trucks to
collect firewood when the bombing began," he said by telephone. "All
of them suffered heavy concussion caused by the blast wave. Some of
them have burns too."</TE>
<TE>   However, Russian air force spokesman Alexander Drobyshevsky
insisted the weather was unsuitable for flying Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "We know nothing about it," he said. "But we are absolutely sure
that our planes didn't make any flights in that area this morning and
didn't bomb anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Shevardnadze underscored a belief common in Tbilisi, the Georgian
capital, that Russian military elements hostile to his nation
sporadically attack, sometimes without the authority of their
superiors.</TE>
<TE>   "I ask all in Russia, and first of all President [Vladimir V.]
Putin, to stop this arbitrariness, to stop targeting Georgian
villages," Shevardnadze said, addressing a military regiment in
Tbilisi. "It is a different matter if the military doesn't obey
Putin. In this case, he must restore law and order."</TE>
<TE>   Shevardnadze called on Chechen men to leave Georgian territory.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this is the last accident and that it won't happen again,"
he said. "We don't want revenge. We don't want to fight against
Russia. But if it goes on, we will look for ways to defend
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   In reality, tiny Georgia--about the size of West Virginia--has no
military answer to its vast and powerful neighbor. Meanwhile, Russia
is unable to wipe out Chechen rebels in Georgia without
Shevardnadze's go-ahead, which he steadfastly refuses to give. Russia
would face severe Western condemnation if it mounted a unilateral
military operation in the Pankisi Gorge.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia has cultivated ties with the U.S., Europe and Turkey to
counter the pressure it feels from Russia.</TE>

<HD>India Accused of Assault on Kashmir</HD>
<DH>Asia: New Delhi denies that its military attacked a post on
Pakistani-held territory. A U.S. envoy visiting the region seeks to
calm tensions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CALCUTTA</DL>
<LD>Pakistan accused India on Friday of launching a heavy ground and air
attack on northern Kashmir, as a senior U.S. diplomat tried to calm
tensions between the two nuclear powers.</LD>
<LD>   The Indian government flatly denied charges that its warplanes and
artillery had pounded a military post on Pakistan's side of the
cease-fire line dividing the disputed Kashmir region.</LD>
<LD>   The escalation of charges and countercharges came as Indian
officials told Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage that
Pakistan has failed to stop guerrillas from entering Indian-held
southern Kashmir.</LD>
<TE>   Armitage did not speak to reporters after his meetings in New
Delhi, which included talks with Indian Defense Minister George
Fernandes. The U.S. envoy is to meet today with Pakistani leaders in
their capital, Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Fernandes called allegations of an Indian assault "an
outright lie."</TE>
<TE>   Although limited clashes along the cease-fire Line of Control
occur almost daily, claims of airstrikes are rare. If Friday's was
true, the bombing could mark a significant escalation in the
fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, Pakistan's military and presidential
spokesman, told reporters in Islamabad that Indian forces launched an
unprovoked attack Thursday night across the line.</TE>
<TE>   Qureshi said the assault on the Gultari sector did not kill any
Pakistani troops, and he said a counterattack lasting into Friday
morning inflicted heavy Indian casualties.</TE>
<TE>   "All efforts by the Indians to reinforce the attack were
frustrated by accurate Pakistani fire," Qureshi said, reading from a
statement. "Unable to make any headway whatsoever, and having lost
dozens of personnel, the Indians, in their frustration and
desperation, resorted to a highly escalatory act by bombing."</TE>
<TE>   The air assault involved three to five jets, he later said.</TE>
<TE>   India's military and Foreign Ministry called the charges "false
and baseless."</TE>
<TE>   "It appears to be the standard Pakistani antic," Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Nirupama Rao told a television interviewer. "It's true to
Pakistani form."</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Sushil Pramod Kumar Singh, a spokesman for the Indian
army's northern command, insisted that troops had not crossed the
Line of Control "nor attacked anyplace whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   There was no independent confirmation of the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the State Department said it had no information to
confirm or deny that any fighting had taken place. However, an
official expressed "our continuing concern about the dangers posed by
the ongoing mobilizations of Indian and Pakistani forces."</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 3, Qureshi accused Indian forces of carrying out a similar
attack in the Kupwara border district, northwest of Srinagar, the
summer capital of India's Jammu and Kashmir state. At the time, India
confirmed only that three of its soldiers had died in heavy fighting.
Despite months of international pressure to ease tensions over
Kashmir and move toward peace talks, India and Pakistan still have
about a million troops massed along the Line of Control and their
international border. The Bush administration sees the friction as a
drain on its war against terrorism. It views Pakistan as a front-line
ally in the effort to track down Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of all-out war also complicates U.S. planning for a
possible attack to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Critics of an
attack on Iraq have cited the threat of war in South Asia as one
reason military action in the Persian Gulf would be too risky.</TE>
<TE>   Armitage met with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in early
June and pressed India's demand for an end to what New Delhi calls
"cross-border terrorism." The diplomat said then that Musharraf had
promised to end infiltration from Pakistani territory into Jammu and
Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state.</TE>
<TE>   But Indian officials insist that guerrillas seeking to end Indian
control over southern Kashmir continue to cross the line.</TE>
<TE>   Suspected militants gunned down 12 Muslims inside their homes in
three villages in Jammu and Kashmir early today, police said. Eight
were slain in Duadasan Bhala, police said, and the rest in Manjakot
and Ganodh.</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi also charges that Musharraf has done little to dismantle
the guerrillas' training camps in Pakistani-held territory. On
Tuesday, the Indian army said it had killed at least 26 suspected
militants in three days as they attempted to cross the cease-fire
line.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian government accuses Pakistan of providing military
support to separatist guerrillas and says violence is escalating in
the run-up to elections in Jammu and Kashmir set to begin Sept. 16.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of separatist leaders, called the All Party Hurriyat
Conference, says it will not participate in the vote because it wants
India to accept that Kashmiris have the right to vote on
self-determination.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Tries to Keep Its Cool in Between Mideast Hot Spots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AMMAN, Jordan</DL>
<LD>With the Palestinian intifada raging to the west and the prospect of
a U.S. invasion of Iraq to the east, Jordan once again finds itself
trapped in the middle, aggravating the sense of gloom and anxiety
that grips the nation.</LD>
<LD>   For this resource-poor but strategically important country, having
to decide between its two main partners, the United States and Iraq,
is a lose-lose proposition. War, if it comes--and the general
sentiment here is that it will--threatens to further fray Jordan's
economic, social and political fabric.</LD>
<LD>   "We are caught between the two hottest spots in the region,
perhaps the world," said Labib Kamhawi, a businessman and political
analyst, echoing the fears of many of his colleagues and neighbors.
"This country is weak, vulnerable."</LD>
<TE>   It may be weak, but its politics and its geography have made it
invaluable to the United States, a reality that cost Jordan dearly
when it chose not to side with the U.S. in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
To the Western world, Jordan is seen as a moderate country with a
secular government, one of only two Arab nations to have signed a
peace treaty with Israel. And Jordan also provides valuable
intelligence information for Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But below the surface, the Jordanian currents are restive. Its
people are strongly anti-Israel--and, by extension, increasingly
anti-American--with more than half the population ethnically
Palestinian. An estimated 70% of the population is younger than 26 in
a debt-laden economy that cannot create enough jobs to ensure social
stability in a region where nationalists have toppled aristocrats.</TE>
<TE>   And young King Abdullah II is perceived by many at home and abroad
to be struggling for legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   Jordanian government officials and Western diplomats say
Washington is keenly aware of Jordan's bind and hasn't pushed the
kingdom into playing a major logistical role in any invasion of Iraq,
such as hosting large numbers of soldiers or tanks.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Jordan will be relied on to perhaps accept refugees
fleeing the battle or provide peripheral support to U.S. forces.
Publicly, Jordan has said that it will refuse to play even a limited
military role--a posture it must take because of the widespread
public sentiment in support of the Iraqi people, if not their
leader--and that it would expect the United Nations to carry the
burden of caring for the refugees.</TE>
<TE>   "There is very little pressure on Jordan," said one Western
diplomat based here in the capital, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. "Mostly there will be requests for overflights and search
and rescue. There is an understanding of the pressures Jordan is
under."</TE>
<TE>   Since ascending to the throne when his father, King Hussein, died
three years ago, Abdullah has struggled to consolidate his rule. In
June 2001, he suspended parliament and has again delayed elections
until spring.</TE>
<TE>   He has empowered the intelligence services in a way that his
father never did, relying on security officials to develop social
policy, a strategy partly designed to help ensure public order in the
event that Iraq flares up, according to analysts, academics and
opposition politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Many people say that a U.S. invasion of Iraq could prove to be the
fledgling king's greatest challenge as he tries to navigate the
minefield of public opinion, economic reality and political
necessity. The United States is Jordan's No. 2 trading partner--and
source of millions of dollars in aid and political currency. Iraq is
Jordan's No. 1 trading partner--and source of every barrel of its
oil.</TE>
<TE>   But more than that, Iraq is Jordan's spiritual partner. The people
here identify with the people there. They are both Arabs and for the
most part Muslims--and strongly anti-Israel. Jordanians deeply resent
the U.N. sanctions imposed on Baghdad after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, seeing them as unduly punishing Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, it will be a disaster," said Fahed Fanek, an economist
and political commentator. "Public sentiment will be against America.
We will have demonstrations and strikes. Stability would be at stake,
especially if America uses Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   That fear and anxiety can be felt in the streets of this capital,
a city where almost every building is made of the same white
limestone. Secret police are everywhere, watching, listening.</TE>
<TE>   "Today the intelligence community in Jordan has much more power
than I can ever remember," said Mustafa Hamarneh, director of the
Center for Strategic Studies at Amman University. "They are
everywhere, in the press, in the government, and the sad thing is,
everyone has caved in to them, so there is no debate about anything."</TE>
<TE>   On the streets, and even in their homes, people talk in whispers
and look over their shoulders. (Jordanian officials, however, point
out that the country is still far more open than its neighbors, such
as Syria.) Their anxiety predates Sept. 11 and the talk of war in
Iraq, but it has been magnified by those events, especially as the
public recoils at the thought of its leaders helping America.</TE>
<TE>   "For us to put our hands with America is unacceptable," said
Nwayer Naber, 38, who runs Amman's first supermarket. It is a modest
shop, with rows and rows of imported goods, most from Britain and
America. He speaks fluent English and carries a British passport, but
he's as vehement as Jordan's most outspoken Islamists. Supporting the
U.S. "will be a very big problem," he said. "No one will accept it."</TE>
<TE>   Carpet merchant Abdel Aziz Bakr, 46, is even more emphatic about
what will happen if his king sides with America. "There will be a
massacre," he said as he sat on a pile of U.S.-made rugs he said he
can't sell because no one will buy American. He has started telling
people that they're made in Belgium. "There will be demonstrations,
and people will end up getting killed" by the army.</TE>
<TE>   The regime understands this is the sentiment and has begun to
prepare. In addition to delaying elections again, it has stepped up a
policy of silencing the media, continued to outlaw all demonstrations
and increasingly turned to the intelligence services for advice in
running the country, according to analysts, business leaders and
people who have met with the king.</TE>
<TE>   And the king has started to lay the groundwork for casting blame
on Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to offer all we can for Iraq," Abdullah said in
a recent address to his nation. "But the decision in the end is that
of the Iraqi leadership. They bear the responsibility in front of
their people, nation and the world."</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty that Abdullah faces is far more treacherous than
merely having to navigate an emotional dispute involving Israel, the
Palestinians and the West. Iraq is Jordan's economic lifeline,
providing $600 million in oil that is delivered at half price, with
the other half paid in barter.</TE>
<TE>   If the oil stops, Jordan could cope for about two months, relying
on reserves to make up the loss. But after that, unless the United
States helps Jordan pay for its oil or successfully persuades another
oil producer to make up the difference--and there is no indication
that would occur--the country faces a financial catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan would have to pay $700 million annually at market prices
for the oil it gets now, and it would have to pay hard currency.
Jordanian businesses do about $400 million in business with Iraq
through the U.N.-administered "oil-for-food" program.</TE>
<TE>   "As usual, we will be at the forefront and we will pay the price,"
said Mohammed Halaiqa, Jordan's minister of state for economic
affairs. As soon as the United States started talking about invading
Iraq, he said, foreign investment began to dry up.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats said that Jordan's doomsday scenario is unlikely
to occur and that the country can expect help from its friends should
problems materialize.</TE>
<TE>   But there are many other concerns. Many Jordanians also fear that
Iraq may try to attack Israel, and either try to cut through Jordan
or lob a missile at Israel and miss, hitting Jordan instead.</TE>
<TE>   And there is the matter of Jordan's neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a major operation in Iraq, it won't just be a matter
of Jordan dealing with the Americans," a Western diplomat said. "They
will be dealing with the Saudis, the Syrians, Egyptians and others.
It's a complex set of calculations for the Jordanians."</TE>
<TE>   None of this anxiety, however, is to be mistaken for support for
Saddam Hussein. If it were possible to get rid of him quickly,
maintain stability, keep the oil and the exports flowing, few here
would complain. Not many think that can happen.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a war, many people here expect a blood bath in the
short term, if for no other reason than after decades of tyranny,
many people in Iraq have a score to settle with someone--and almost
everyone there has a gun.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear that all Jordanians are against a military invasion,"
Information Minister Mohammed Adwan said. "That does not mean support
for the Iraqi regime."</TE>
<TE>   So they are bracing for the worst.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation here feels very critical, and the future is
unknown," said Abdul Latif Arabiyat, former speaker of parliament and
president of the Islamic Action Front, the political party of the
Muslim Brotherhood. "We are in the middle. What will happen to Jordan
if anything happens in the area?"</TE>
<TE>   Still, many experts here believe that when push comes to shove,
Abdullah will choose the United States over Iraq, even if he denies
it to his own people. Jordan gets far more from America than the
approximately $400 million in aid received this year, officials said.
Washington helps bring legitimacy to the regime, analysts said, and
the king is unlikely to jeopardize that.</TE>
<TE>   When his father decided to back Iraq in the Gulf War--or, as
Jordanians say, "remain neutral"--the United States cut off financial
aid and Jordan found itself having to ration car use. Times were
different then: Economic ties to Iraq were even closer, there was no
peace treaty with Israel, and King Hussein thought that he could
negotiate a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the outcome for Jordan was disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   Its import-export businesses were pretty much shut down, and
400,000 Jordanians working in Gulf countries were kicked out and sent
home--depriving Jordan of their remittances and saddling it with the
cost of caring for them. Tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees further
strained Jordan's resources.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan is determined not to let anything like that happen again.</TE>
<TE>   "The message has been put forward to the people of Jordan," said
Adwan, the information minister. "At the very end, the Iraqi problem
will be the Iraqi problem. We cannot commit suicide for anyone."</TE>

<HD>Students Crossing the Korean Divide</HD>
<DH>Asia: An intensive summer program tries to integrate
defectors into Southern society.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The teachers had been warned that their summer school students might
have strange ideas, but science instructor Park Myong Suk was still
flabbergasted when several approached her with a particular concern.</LD>
<LD>   Was it true that the Earth could be split in two, the students
asked. When Park demanded to know where they had gotten such a
preposterous idea, they quoted a saying of North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il that his people, if united, could be strong enough to do
anything--even to divide the planet.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, these were no ordinary students and this no regular
summer school. The youths, ages 14 to 18, were North Koreans who had
recently defected from their homeland.</LD>
<TE>   During a three-week intensive program, 26 teachers and 32
volunteers coach a small number of students--the latest class
graduated just 22. It may seem like too much attention to lavish on
the group, but their success or failure is of importance here: The
school is, in effect, a laboratory for determining whether
Northerners can be integrated into South Korean society after more
than half a century of enmity between the nations.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the school held a graduation ceremony for the latest
class at a secluded conference center in Seoul. Normally secretive
because of concerns about security for defectors, the school made a
rare exception to a "no media" policy and permitted a reporter to
attend the ceremony on the condition that the students not be
interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   In their baggy jeans and sneakers, the youths looked like any
other students exchanging gifts and saying their goodbyes at the end
of a semester. But teachers and others said the teens are worlds
apart from their Westernized counterparts in South Korea and face an
extraordinary struggle to close the gap.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a lot of problems studying in regular [South Korean]
schools. They find it difficult to catch up with classmates and
difficult to make friends," said Benjamin H. Yoon, head of the
Citizens' Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, a nonprofit group
in Seoul that runs the school.</TE>
<TE>   The program was started three years ago after South Korea began
experiencing an influx of defectors--mostly families who had fled the
famine in the North by first crossing into China. Before the
mid-1990s, most defectors were unaccompanied men, often soldiers or
diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long before educators started remarking that the North
Korean children not only were smaller than their counterparts
here--the result of poor nutrition--but lagged behind in school in
virtually every subject.</TE>
<TE>   The educators had anticipated difficulties with subjects such as
political science and history because, as Yoon noted, "their
interpretation of history is different from South Korea's."</TE>
<TE>   But more surprising was how far apart the language had drifted in
the 50 years since the Korean peninsula was divided by politics and
war. The Northerners couldn't understand most of the borrowed English
words that now pepper speech in the South.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a very hard time with the language," Yoon said, "and
even in the sciences and math, there is a lot of terminology they do
not understand."</TE>
<TE>   Hwa Jeong Bum, a 26-year-old graduate student in Korean literature
who had volunteered at the summer school, added: "It's not just that
they don't understand us. I was surprised how difficult it is for us
to understand what they're saying. They use different words."</TE>
<TE>   Although North Korea boasts of free schooling and nearly universal
literacy, educators in the South discovered that many children had
skipped school during periods of severe famine to forage for food.
They lost more years of education after escaping to China, where many
lived clandestinely before coming to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the North Koreans now attending schools in the South
are usually placed in classes with students who are several years
younger. But Yoon, the program's chief, said many of the students are
extremely bright. He recalled one boy who got into one of South
Korea's top universities, despite missing five years of study while
in China.</TE>
<TE>   To help the students catch up, the summer school provides a
crammed agenda. Classes in science, math, history, Korean and English
run from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The students, who live on campus during the
term, spend much of their time outside of class studying.</TE>
<TE>   It is not only a matter of teaching the students, but of undoing
some of the damage caused by their spending their formative years in
a totalitarian state, educators say.</TE>
<TE>   "The ideology of North Korea is still deeply rooted in their
minds," said science teacher Park, recalling her befuddlement with
her students' questions about the Earth. "They lack the imagination
of the South Korean students. I blame that on the totalitarian way of
teaching."</TE>
<TE>   The teachers say the students are deeply conflicted, on the one
hand denouncing the North's Communist leadership but on the other
still believing much of what they were once taught. Staff members are
coached to be exceedingly careful about not saying anything that
could be construed as derogatory toward North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "If you insult Kim Jong Il, they will be offended," said Park Jin
Whan, who teaches ethics. "The ideology is very much intact.... They
will tell you that capitalism is corrupt, that the South Koreans are
dogs in the service of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the potential tensions between students and teachers,
staff members say they have been deeply affected by the youths. They
described the North Koreans as more disciplined, more respectful,
more honest and less spoiled than their South Korean counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   "They are hungry for love. If you are sincere with them and show
that you care, their reaction is genuine and pure," said science
teacher Park, fingering a thank-you note given to her by a student.</TE>
<TE>   Chu Eun Ah, 22, a mathematics graduate student who volunteers at
the school, said she was struck by how much less materialistic her
students are and how little they care about fashions and trends.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have this vanity you see with South Korean students,"
Chu said. "And they are very frank. If you do something to annoy
them, they will say, 'Hey, you're annoying me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the South Koreans are often bewildered by the students'
behavior, the North Koreans describe their adopted land as a cold and
confusing place to live.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly speaking, North Korea is not a good place to live. There
is no food, no money. However, the relations between people couldn't
be better. Even though we were all starving to death, we were all
helping each other," one 16-year-old boy wrote in a school essay. "It
has been seven months since I arrived [in South Korea], but I have
not been able to say hello to my new neighbors. I try to talk to them
when passing by, but they just ignore me, wearing an indifferent
face."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, when the students were asked to write essays about their
transition to a new lifestyle, they complained of how much they
missed North Korea. One 17-year-old girl even wrote with nostalgia
about her experiences foraging for wild plants to eat.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the homesickness and loneliness, the teachers noted, none
of the students said they want to go back.</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Reject Bid for an Arafat Foil</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: A U.S. proposal that a prime minister be elected
to balance power falls flat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian official said Friday that the Palestinian Authority has
rejected a U.S. proposal to have its parliament choose a prime
minister who could balance the power of its president, Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   Washington has been seeking to sideline Arafat, whom it accuses of
stoking violence that has torpedoed the Mideast peace process, while
calling for elections as part of efforts to persuade the Palestinian
Authority to undertake sweeping reforms.</LD>
<LD>   But Arafat, who remains popular among Palestinians, would probably
be reelected in an open vote.</LD>
<TE>   As an alternative to Arafat, U.S. Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice--in a meeting
in Washington with Palestinian officials two weeks ago--proposed that
the Palestinian parliament choose a prime minister, said Municipal
Affairs Minister Saeb Erekat.</TE>
<TE>   In a report Friday to an international task force in Paris on
Palestinian reform, the Palestinian Authority said it would not agree
to changes in the electoral system that was used by Palestinians in
1996 to confirm Arafat as leader.</TE>
<TE>   "We told [the United States] that this is not your business,"
Erekat said.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official contacted Friday refused to confirm the
disagreements over the election process.</TE>
<TE>   But Raanan Gissin, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's
spokesman, confirmed that the U.S. proposal was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has postponed a trip to the United States that had been
scheduled for next month, Israeli officials said.</TE>
<TE>   He had been scheduled to visit Florida on Sept. 9, the day before
a primary to decide the Democratic gubernatorial candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats said Sharon's presence would give a boost to
incumbent Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, President Bush's brother.</TE>
<TE>   David Douek, a spokesman for the Israeli Consulate in Los Angeles,
said Florida politics had nothing to do with the delay. Sharon had
also been scheduled to visit California.</TE>
<TE>   The trip was not immediately rescheduled.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the fragility of attempts to reduce tensions, Israeli
troops Friday killed two Palestinians disguised as Israeli soldiers,
who were trying to infiltrate a Jewish settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia linked to Arafat's Fatah
movement, claimed responsibility for the failed attack.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica announced Friday that he will
run in September for the presidency of Serbia, the country's dominant
republic.</LD>
<LD>   The move was widely expected because Kostunica's current job is
likely to disappear as part of constitutional changes that will give
greater power to the Serbian president.</LD>
<LD>   Serbia and Montenegro, the two remaining Yugoslav republics, have
agreed to redefine their relationship as part of a Western-backed
plan that foresees doing away with Yugoslavia and replacing it with a
loose confederation named Serbia and Montenegro. The post of Yugoslav
president is likely to be abolished as a result.</LD>
<TE>   Kostunica's announcement was expected to sharpen the rivalry
between himself and Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. Allies in
ousting Slobodan Milosevic from the Yugoslav presidency nearly two
years ago, the two are now bitter rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Djindjic is backing Miroljub Labus, a pro-Western economist and
deputy Yugoslav prime minister regarded as Kostunica's main
challenger in the race.</TE>
<TE>   Labus and Kostunica are expected to split the pro-democracy vote,
which would benefit opposition candidates.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Sudan's interim peace accord will lead to the secession of southern
Sudan, opposition leader Hassan Turabi said in remarks published
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "The agreement dealt a blow to Sudan, the Arab world and Islam,
and it will lead inevitably to the division of Sudan," Turabi told
Egypt's weekly magazine Al Ahram al Arabi.</LD>
<LD>   Turabi, a hard-line Islamist under house arrest, was speaking
about the framework accord signed July 20 in Machakos, Kenya, by the
state and the Sudan People's Liberation Army.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement provided for a referendum on self-determination for
southern Sudanese. It will also exempt southerners from the
Muslim-based legislation that applies in northern Sudan. The two
points had been major obstacles to brokering an end to Sudan's
19-year civil war.</TE>
<TE>   During the years Turabi was in government, from a 1989 coup until
1999, he was seen as unbending in negotiations with the southern
rebels, who have been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy for
the largely animist and Christian south.</TE>

<HD>A 'Red River' in Spain May Yield Clues to Life on the Red
Planet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALONG THE RIO TINTO, Spain</DL>
<LD>If there is life on Mars, scientists believe it's likely to be tiny
organisms that can survive below the planet's surface, without
sunlight or oxygen, nourished by the minerals available even in that
harsh environment.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, thinks Ricardo Amils Pibernat, a researcher at the
Center for Astrobiology in Madrid, past or present life on the red
planet could well resemble the unusual microbes that populate Spain's
Rio Tinto. The 58-mile-long river, which flows through one of the
world's largest deposits of pyrite, or fool's gold, has a pH similar
to that of automobile battery acid and contains virtually no oxygen
in its lower depths.</LD>
<LD>   Yet a team of Spanish and American scientists linked to NASA has
recently confirmed the presence in the river of an abundance of
microbes that not only survive but also thrive in the extreme
environment. Now the scientists hope that further study of these
so-called extremophiles will prove useful in the search for life on
Mars.</LD>
<TE>   The Rio Tinto is special because it provides an exceptionally good
environment for bacteria that live by turning fool's gold into
sulfuric acid and dissolved iron, Amils explains. The chemical
processes taking place in the river use up oxygen, leaving relatively
little to support more typical organisms. And photosynthesis--which
gives ordinary plants energy and produces oxygen--is limited, because
sunlight can hardly penetrate the water, tainted red by the iron.</TE>
<TE>   Yet to the scientists' surprise, hundreds of varieties of
microbes, including yeasts, other fungi, amoebas and algae, have
successfully adapted to life in the river, despite the acidity and
low oxygen. These findings were published this spring in the journal
Nature, in an article that focused on the unexpected diversity of Rio
Tinto life.</TE>
<TE>   Amils and his colleagues at NASA believe that some of these
extremophiles may also live deep in the damp, acidic soil that gives
rise to the river, as well as at the bottom of an acidic quarry lake
near its headwaters. These environments, with high iron and low
oxygen, are thought to be particularly Mars-like.</TE>
<TE>   The landscape along the Rio Tinto, where scientists believe mining
dates back 5,000 years, is rather otherworldly, with the iron in the
soil giving it a reddish hue and with little plant life.</TE>
<TE>   "If you remove the green, it looks like Mars," Amils noted.</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Astrobiology has built a yardlong,
remote-controlled submarine to explore the bottom of the
200-foot-deep lake.</TE>
<TE>   "This will put us near Mars ... because of the lack of oxygen,"
Amils explained.</TE>
<TE>   In an even more ambitious project, Amils and colleagues from the
NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, near San Francisco, have
applied for funding to test Mars drilling equipment at the Rio Tinto.
The idea is that this equipment, designed to search for underground
life on a future Mars mission, would be tried out in a microbe hunt
here.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Stoker, a scientist at NASA Ames who is one of Amils' key
collaborators on the drilling proposal, said her interest in the Rio
Tinto is primarily to search for "an underground ecosystem ... of
subsurface life living off of chemical energy."</TE>
<TE>   "There are certainly organisms in the Rio Tinto that are deriving
energy by chemical means, not from sunlight," Stoker said. "Iron and
sulfur are essentially the elements these organisms are taking
advantage of. In order for them to do this deep underground, they'd
need to be doing it anaerobically--without the presence of oxygen."</TE>
<TE>   The belief that such organisms might exist underground at the Rio
Tinto "is actually a hypothesis of Ricardo Amils'," Stoker said. "It
derives from the chemical constancy along the length of the river.
Basically, it's the fact that the chemistry, wherever you sample it,
is pretty much the same.... It implies that what you're sampling is
the tip of the iceberg, and the big part of the iceberg is
underground."</TE>
<TE>   What Stoker and Amils hope to do is bring to the Rio Tinto area
equipment designed for an unmanned Mars mission, then use it by
remote control to drill about 330 feet into the soil near the Rio
Tinto headwaters, Stoker said. The team would analyze samples both in
ordinary labs and with equipment designed for use on Mars, to test
the quality of the remote analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists believe that in the search for life on Mars, they might
have a better chance of finding signs of past life than of locating
living organisms, because conditions for life there might be worse
now than they were long ago.</TE>
<TE>   In this regard too, the Rio Tinto might provide clues, Amils said,
as he pointed out distinctive sedimentary patterns in small acidic
streams that feed the river.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably you will not get the bacteria, or whatever is there [on
Mars], in action," Amils said. "You might see the effects. Here you
have an example. These guys [the Rio Tinto mineral-eating bacteria]
chew rocks, and they leave behind the remains. These minerals are
new. They are not geologically produced. They are biologically
produced. These are signs of life."</TE>
<TE>   Underwater terraces and a buildup of crystals on rocks along the
streams, Amils continued, "are the consequences" of life in these
waters--"the fingerprint they leave behind."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists would much prefer to find living microbes on Mars. But
if they can find similar "fingerprints" there, "you can bet that this
type of life probably was involved in it," Amils said.</TE>
<TE>   He compared the deductive process to a crime investigation in
which police locate a murder victim but no suspect: "In the absence
of the criminal, if you find the body, you can say someone was
killed."</TE>

<HD>Burbank Halts Security Upgrades at Its Airport</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Stoppage is the latest in a long-running battle
between the city and the airfield.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burbank building and safety inspectors Friday halted efforts to make
federally mandated security upgrades at Burbank Airport, as city and
airport officials played out the latest moves in a years-long battle
over airport expansion.</LD>
<LD>   While both sides said they thought the immediate standoff over the
construction could be resolved soon, the dispute underlined the
stalemate that has marked virtually all efforts to modernize the
airport's runways and aging terminal building, which serve 4.5
million passengers a year.</LD>
<LD>   For at least two decades, Burbank, backed by vocal residents, has
opposed plans by the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority to
expand the facility.</LD>
<TE>   During the late 1990s, the city won a series of state court cases
giving it control over land-use decisions at the airport. Since then,
the airport authority has been forced to set aside plans to build a
new terminal to replace the current building, which is too close to
the east-west runway to meet modern safety standards, according to
federal officials.</TE>
<TE>   But airport authorities, citing federal security upgrades ordered
in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, have tried to move
ahead with a 40,000-square-foot expansion to the 173,000-square-foot
main terminal building. The airport must meet a Dec. 31 deadline to
upgrade airport security, including installation of
explosive-detection equipment and expanded baggage screening.</TE>
<TE>   The effort to expand the terminal has been stalled since October
by a voter-approved initiative known as Measure A. Under the measure,
the City Council is not allowed to approve any construction or
renovation of the airport unless a mandatory curfew is imposed and a
limit is set on the number of daily flights.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the airport authority won a victory when Los Angeles
County Superior Court Judge Richard Montes declared Measure A
unconstitutional. The voter measure violated state laws governing
airports, elections and the environment, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Voters cannot dictate how future city councils should act on
airport-related issues, and key provisions of the initiative were "so
overboard as to unconstitutionally interfere with the legitimate
exercise of the city's police power," the judge ruled. Even as Montes
was ruling, however, city officials dispatched the building and
safety inspectors to the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't doing anything with the airport that we wouldn't do
with any other large corporation or individual who didn't take out
permits," said Dennis Barlow, Burbank's city attorney. "It's a health
and safety issue."</TE>
<TE>   In an indication of the lack of trust that has developed between
the city and the airport authority, Burbank City Manager Robert R.
"Bud" Ovrom and other city officials speculated that airport
officials had rushed construction to foment a crisis that would end
up in federal court and ultimately weaken Burbank's power over
land-use decisions at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   But Victor Gill, spokesman for the airport authority, said that by
moving ahead with the construction, the airport's governing board was
making a good-faith effort to comply with federal rules.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously the authority was committed to going forward with the
project," Gill said. "But now that the project is shut down, the
authority will continue to pursue the options that are available
until those permits are obtained."</TE>
<TE>   Madelyn Sawyer, a security director for the federal Transportation
Security Administration who oversees Burbank and Long Beach airports,
said she was confident that the city and the airport officials could
work out their differences and meet the deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "The airport needs to have a building permit, and that's the
bottom line," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ovrom said building permits are expected to be issued within two
weeks. The project was shut down early Friday because "they started
before [Measure A] was struck down," Ovrom said.</TE>
<TE>   In anticipation of the court's order, the Burbank City Council on
Tuesday adopted interim regulations that permit the city staff to
approve construction "as long as we can make a determination that it
is all done for security purposes, not expansion."</TE>
<TE>   Those regulations also established a 45-day moratorium on
nonsecurity-related airport construction. Some exceptions include
widening corridors to meet local fire safety codes and enlarging
restrooms as required under the federal Americans with Disabilities
Act, Ovrom said.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank city officials had sought to have Measure A invalidated
because they felt it infringed on the authority of the city
government. Because the measure was a voter-passed initiative, the
city paid the roughly $100,000 in legal costs of a group of voters
who supported the measure in court. The city will not pay for an
appeal, however, Ovrom said.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of passenger traffic, Burbank Airport is the fourth
largest in the region. Its 4.5 million passengers annually compares
to 61 million at Los Angeles International Airport, 7.3 million at
Orange County's John Wayne Airport and 6.7 million at Ontario
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute over the Burbank terminal is one of the
longest-running public policy conflicts in the region. The debate has
continued since at least 1980, when the Federal Aviation
Administration said that the terminal structure was too close to the
east-west runway.</TE>
<TE>   After spending millions of dollars in legal and public relations
costs, the two sides agreed in 1999 to build a 14-gate,
330,000-square-foot replacement terminal on land formerly owned by
Lockheed Martin. The terminal would be expandable to 19 gates.</TE>
<TE>   In return, airport officials agreed to concessions including
closure of Burbank's passenger terminal between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Within weeks, however, the plan ran into bitter opposition from local
residents, political leaders, the airlines and the FAA, which called
the planned terminal closure a de-facto curfew, which is restricted
under federal law. With the proposed settlement falling apart, city
and airport officials tried to salvage a terminal replacement plan.
But a group called Restore Our Airport Rights led an effort to place
Measure A on the ballot to help control growth and aircraft noise at
the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Within days after the measure passed, Burbank sought a court
ruling on whether the city could legally enforce the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Lombardo, an airport authority commissioner, applauded
Montes' ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame that the residents of Burbank were misled into some
simplistic measure that did not address the reality of what needs to
be dealt with," Lombardo said. "These people would have you believe
by signing a piece of paper that you're going to get whatever you
want. You're not. And now we have to undo the damage that was done."</TE>

<HD>Lukewarm Backing for Simon</HD>
<DH>Politics: Bush, in California, endorses the beleaguered
candidate, but out of the public eye.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a day of decidedly mixed messages, President Bush on Friday gave
an arm's-length embrace to Republican gubernatorial hopeful Bill
Simon Jr., offering warm words in settings designed to limit their
reach.</LD>
<LD>   Stumping from the Central Valley to the coast of Orange County,
Bush raised upward of $2.5 million in badly needed cash for Simon's
struggling campaign. But the president offered a cursory, almost
generic endorsement for his party's standard-bearer--ignoring Simon
altogether at his only two public events of the day.</LD>
<LD>   Bush was more generous at a pair of private Simon fund-raisers.
Before an invitation-only luncheon crowd in Stockton, Bush praised
the first-time candidate as a "breath of fresh air for Sacramento"
and "a proven businessman" who would bring a frugal approach to state
government.</LD>
<TE>   "That's why I'm so proud to embrace his candidacy and urge the
people of California to work on his behalf," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   At a reception Friday night in Dana Point, the president
paraphrased a line from his 2000 election campaign. "Bill Simon is
committed to changing the tone in Sacramento," Bush said, "to get
things done not just for Republicans but for Democrats and
independents and people who don't give a darn about politics."</TE>
<TE>   Those testimonials, however, belied the tensions surrounding the
president's visit and its awkward timing, just a few weeks after a
Los Angeles jury returned a $78-million civil judgment against
Simon's family investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   The judgment, which stemmed from allegations of fraud by a former
investment partner, stunned the White House--and many inside in the
Simon campaign--and national Republican Party strategists briefly
considered calling off Bush's visit before deciding a cancellation
would be too politically damaging.</TE>
<TE>   So Bush came--but showed little enthusiasm once he arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Simon was the first to greet the president Friday morning, at the
head of a receiving line on the sunny tarmac at Stockton airport,
where Air Force One touched down from Oregon. Without breaking
stride, Bush descended from the jumbo jet, gave Simon a brisk
handshake, then quickly moved on, lingering at the end of the line
with a cluster of volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later, at Stockton's civic auditorium, Bush singled
out two of the area's Republican congressmen, hailing Reps. Doug Ose
of Sacramento and Richard Pombo of Stockton. But he made no mention
of Simon, who was not invited to the event.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to a raucous crowd of 3,500 supporters, packed to the
gilded ceiling, Bush offered a variant of his standard stump speech,
vowing to win the war on terrorism, extolling the virtues of free
trade and urging Congress to make permanent the 10-year tax cut
lawmakers passed last year.</TE>
<TE>   He also expressed pride at signing "the most comprehensive
corporate reform bill" since Franklin D. Roosevelt was president, not
mentioning his initially strong resistance to the crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   From the auditorium, it was a short motorcade back to the airport,
where an audience of about 2,000 Republican stalwarts paid $1,000 for
lunch in a curtained-off hangar named after one of Simon's biggest
political benefactors, local businessman Alex Spanos.</TE>
<TE>   A buoyant Simon thanked the president for coming and introduced
him by offering a pledge. "You have brought honor and respect back to
the Oval Office," Simon said. "And I want to make you a promise
today, Mr. President, that we are going to bring honor and respect
back to the governor's office in California."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in turn, offered an expansion of his earlier remarks,
omitting the part about corporate responsibility but sprinkling in a
few paragraphs referring to Simon and his wife, Cindy, who later flew
on Air Force One from Stockton to Orange County. "You need a change
in Sacramento," Bush said, and Simon is "the man to bring that
change."</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Ana, Bush made his second public appearance of the day,
meeting with Latino supporters at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art.
He announced a $133-million grant to California to improve
third-grade reading skills.</TE>
<TE>   And again Bush singled out local politicians and other dignitaries
in the crowd--including GOP Reps. Ed Royce of Fullerton and
Christopher Cox of Newport Beach--without mentioning Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Democrats sharply criticized the president for even showing
up on Simon's behalf. "Bush's hypocrisy is galling," said Jennifer
Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee,
referring to the president's stated policy of zero tolerance for
corporate wrongdoers.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis sought to stoke the issue
by signing into law a package of corporate reforms and announcing
other initiatives at a Culver City senior center. In response to a
reporter's question, Davis referred to Simon's legal difficulties but
insisted the measures were "not designed to embarrass anyone."</TE>
<TE>   "A free market does not mean free from ethical standards," Davis
said. "No CEO should have the right to abuse their own employees,
much less defraud the investing public."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the package, Davis said, the state is taking formal
steps to revoke the license of the scandal-tainted Arthur Andersen
accounting firm. But Patrick Dorton, an Andersen spokesman, said the
California action is "no surprise." The company sent the state a
letter on July 31 voluntarily surrendering its license, he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the president's appearance drew unwanted attention to matters
of malfeasance, it also resulted in some desperately needed dollars
for Simon's campaign. For weeks, Davis has flooded California's TV
airwaves with millions of dollars in unreciprocated ads.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Friday's events in Stockton and Orange County, Bush
will appear on behalf of Simon today at a breakfast fund-raiser in
Westwood before leaving California--probably for the remainder of the
campaign, according to White House political advisors.</TE>
<TE>   High in the balcony at Stockton's civic auditorium, Rick Sealy, a
52-year-old sheriff's captain, beamed at the mention of Bush but said
he knew little of Simon beyond "some trouble with his taxes"--a
reference to his disputed returns--and something about a soured
business deal.</TE>
<TE>   He has doubts about Davis. "It seems good things happen to the
people who donate to him," Sealy said. But Simon has yet to secure
his vote, and Bush's support will make no difference.</TE>
<TE>   "These things go on all the time, with presidents supporting
candidates," said Sealy, shouting to be heard over the lusty roar
that greeted Bush in the packed auditorium. "We love the guy, but
he's not the one running for governor."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unidentified palm prints and footprints found near the body of slain
child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey were made by relatives of the girl
and not by an intruder as some have speculated, the Rocky Mountain
News reported.</LD>
<LD>   Quoting an anonymous source, the newspaper said investigators have
known for some time that the footprint found near the body of the
6-year-old belonged to the girl's brother, Burke, and that a palm
print was left by the girl's adult half sister, Melinda, and were
unrelated to the unsolved murder.</LD>
<LD>   The body of JonBenet, a former Little Miss Colorado, was found
beaten and strangled in the basement of the Boulder home of her
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, on Dec. 26, 1996--leading to one of
the most notorious U.S. crime mysteries of the 1990s.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Reversing his own ruling in the face of public outrage, an Ohio judge
declared Friday that a poor rural county could afford to put an
accused murderer on trial for his life.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Jeffrey L. Simmons ruled this month that Vinton County did
not have the resources to hold an expensive death penalty trial. So
he struck the capital charges against Gregory McKnight and ordered a
simpler murder trial instead, with a maximum penalty of life in
prison.</LD>
<LD>   But local officials insisted they will find the money to conduct a
fair death penalty trial.</LD>
<TE>   Simmons then said his concern had been hypothetical and reinstated
the death penalty charges.</TE>
<TE>   McKnight, 25, is accused of kidnapping a college student and
shooting her in the head.</TE>
<TE>   His trial is scheduled to start Sept. 23.</TE>

<HD>Terror Inquiry Ruling Disputed</HD>
<DH>Courts: A Justice Department official says restrictions on
the sharing of intelligence have hindered U.S. efforts to protect
Americans from attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER and ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A senior Justice Department official said Friday that a ruling by a
secretive federal court that scales back the department's efforts to
share intelligence information with FBI agents has hurt the ability
of law enforcement to protect American citizens from ongoing
terrorist plots.</LD>
<LD>   The confidential May ruling by the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act court--made public Thursday--has had an unseen but
significant effect on the nation's war on terrorism, the official
said during a Justice Department briefing on the status of the
investigation into the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon and other terrorism-related matters. Also Friday, the
Justice Department released its appeal of the ruling, which it filed
late Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Several Democratic lawmakers praised the FISA court, as it is
known, saying its ruling was instrumental in protecting the civil
rights of Americans from undue spying by a Justice Department that
has become too aggressive in its self-declared war on terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Justice Department officials vehemently disagreed and warned that
unless the court ruling is overturned, they will be hamstrung in
their efforts to enact important counter-terrorism measures included
in the USA Patriot Act passed last year by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern, according to the senior official and others
in the Justice Department, is the court's order that federal
prosecutors, FBI agents and intelligence operatives keep intact a
wall between those investigating ongoing criminal activity and those
gathering intelligence on potential terrorist attacks and acts of
espionage.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, the court's ruling means "that in order to bring a
[criminal] case against someone, we have to shut down intelligence
channels and we're going to be blind" as to what suspected terrorists
are doing, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "Or it's the reverse, that in order to keep seeing what's going
on, we'll have to kind of sit with our hands tied and let people run
around and do bad things. So I do think it has impeded our ability to
get closer coordination.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are better than we were prior to Sept. 11" in terms of
ferreting out terrorist plots and stopping them, the official added.
"But we are not where we could be and where the American people have
a right to expect we will be if the law is fully deployed in the way
that we want."</TE>
<TE>   The looming legal battle over the FISA ruling underscores the
debate about how far the FBI and the Justice Department should be
able to go in gathering intelligence in the fight against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 was passed in
response to the Nixon administration's abuse of its
intelligence-gathering powers to spy on political enemies. It was
intended to distinguish between the government's efforts to fight
crime at home and its need to gather intelligence on suspected
foreign agents. Warrants to allow such searches required FISA court
approval.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno erected a firewall between
intelligence-gathering investigations and criminal probes to prevent
agents from overstepping their authority, because the warrants are so
secretive and the methods of investigation so invasive.</TE>
<TE>   Often, FISA-approved searches are conducted without having to
notify the suspect, unlike warrants in routine criminal probes. Reno
ordered that, to win approval for such warrants, intelligence agents
must meet higher legal standards to justify such covert searches.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
convinced Congress to loosen the rules for using FISA-approved secret
wiretaps and searches as part of the USA Patriot Act.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Ashcroft sought to diminish the barrier between
criminal probes and intelligence-gathering efforts by the
FBI--particularly when it comes to information developed from the use
of secret wiretaps and search warrants. Ashcroft said the effort to
expand the cooperative efforts among FBI agents, intelligence
operatives and prosecutors was a keystone in the effort to protect
the nation from terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But on May 17, the highly secretive court said it had grown so
concerned about Ashcroft's behind-the-scenes efforts to broaden the
Justice Department's spying abilities that it ordered Ashcroft to
scale back his efforts significantly.</TE>
<TE>   The court rejected a secret request by the Justice Department to
allow increased cooperation and information sharing among the two
camps, saying it was "not reasonably designed" to safeguard the
privacy of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The court specifically warned against efforts by prosecutors to
give more legal advice to agents in the field about how they could
use information gained under FISA-approved search warrants and
wiretaps in criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   The court also disclosed that its panel of federal judges has
voiced grave misgivings for years about the way the Justice
Department has handled top-secret wiretaps and searches in terrorism
cases. It reported, for instance, that under the Clinton
administration, the FBI gave false information in more than 75
requests for top-secret warrants in cases related to international
terrorism and espionage probes.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department's formal appeal of the FISA ruling was
signed by Ashcroft. The 78-page legal brief says the ruling
misinterprets the broader powers granted to the department under the
Patriot Act. It concludes by saying, "It is respectfully submitted
that the judgment of the [FISA court] in this case ... should be
vacated."</TE>
<TE>   The appeal marked the first time that the appellate panel has been
used to contest a ruling by the FISA court, which has approved all
but a handful of the thousands of requests for wiretaps and search
warrants requested by the FBI and the Justice Department since it was
established.</TE>
<TE>   Because of that ruling, and the FISA court's concerns about abuses
of the FISA laws, the Justice Department hasn't implemented important
aspects of the Patriot Act, the senior official said, and hasn't
engaged in the kind of information sharing and cooperation that it
wanted to under the Patriot Act.</TE>
<TE>   The official said some information sharing is occurring between
the criminal investigators and intelligence operatives but that "it
takes longer, and it is harder and it's more complicated and time is
important."</TE>
<TE>   "Time is of the essence," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are better than we were before, but it is still very
cumbersome."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), a member of the House Judiciary
Committee that oversees the Justice Department, said the FISA court's
ruling has helped protect Americans from undue intrusion into their
privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Since his appointment as attorney general, and certainly since
Sept. 11, Ashcroft has shown himself to be one of the attorney
generals most contemptuous of law and civil liberties. It's good to
see the courts are starting to rein him in," Nadler said.</TE>
<TE>   "We must wage a war against terror but we must not do so in a way
that destroys civil liberties and civil rights of Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Added Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles): "I think the court is
absolutely correct in reining him in. We gave [Ashcroft] more powers,
but he's going beyond that."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), the ranking member on the Judiciary
Committee, said he was not sure whether he would support the Justice
Department's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to look very carefully. Some sharing is OK and some
isn't," Frank said. "You shouldn't use a terrorism hook to drop the
standard for a garden variety crime. That's abusive."</TE>

<HD>A New Station in Life</HD>
<DH>Mohammed Arif spent two decades as a political and military
leader in Afghanistan. Now living modestly in the U.S., his family
comes first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SPRINGFIELD, Va.</DL>
<LD>Mohammed Shah Jahan Arif paces on the ornate red carpet in his living
room as yet another caller from Kabul--today it's the minister of
agriculture--pleads with him to return to Afghanistan and take his
place in the corridors of power.</LD>
<LD>   Arif already has turned down Afghanistan's president, Hamid
Karzai, who wanted him as deputy defense minister. He has declined a
slot as provincial governor. But the calls keep coming: He is a
medical doctor, a military hero, a tribal leader.</LD>
<LD>   "My people need me," he explains. "They want me to come back."</LD>
<TE>   But Arif isn't going: After two decades of fighting for his
country, he is fighting for his wife and nine children now. They live
off friends, food stamps and an $8-an-hour overnight shift at a Mobil
station near this blue-collar Washington suburb.</TE>
<TE>   If few Americans know of Arif's remarkable past, few Afghans know
of his desperate present. His is a riches-to-rags story.</TE>
<TE>   "My people think I am in the White House with President Bush,"
says Arif. "They don't know I am pumping gas in Virginia."</TE>
<TE>   Arif, 48, was born in Ghazni, an ancient Afghan trading town
southwest of Kabul. The area is home to the Hazaras, an ethnic
minority group and Shia Muslim sect that supposedly arrived with
Genghis Khan in the 13th century--and has been persecuted ever since.</TE>
<TE>   When Arif was 6, his teacher slapped him so hard he was knocked
off his feet. His crime: The Hazara boy had offered to show the Sunni
Muslim class how Shias pray. Later he would learn that Hazaras were
barred from Afghanistan's Sunni-run mosques, army and universities.</TE>
<TE>   "In school, I could not even say I am Hazara," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   But Arif, son of a wealthy Hazara chieftain, would not be
deterred. After attending high school in Kabul, he argued and bluffed
his way into college and medical school at the University of
Nangarhar in Jalalabad. He became one of the first Hazara doctors.</TE>
<TE>   War intervened when Soviet forces invaded in 1979 to impose a
communist regime. Like most Afghans, Arif saw the invaders as
infidels who were killing Muslims. Quitting his post at the Ghazni
hospital, the young physician grabbed a World War I bolt-action rifle
from his father's house and joined the holy war.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate war," he says. "But the communists killed so many people.
They bombed us, they invaded us, they burned our houses. We had to
defend ourselves. We had to fight back."</TE>
<TE>   Arif had no military training, but he was a natural leader, able
to organize and inspire men. He soon commanded the largest
moujahedeen force in the area, a Hazara army of 3,000 fighters and
followers based in mountains east of Ghazni.</TE>
<TE>   "We were guerrillas," he says. "At night, we would come into the
city and attack. We would hit their supply lines. We would ambush
their convoys."</TE>
<TE>   Soviet military accounts from the time cite heavy losses around
its Ghazni garrison. By Arif's account, he and his fighters stole or
captured 13 T-62 and T-54 tanks, heavy artillery, armored vehicles,
and thousands of mortars, machine guns and other Soviet weapons
during the war. They even traded a captured Soviet soldier to another
rebel group for 25 Kalashnikov assault rifles.</TE>
<TE>   But the cost was also high. In all, Arif lost about 1,300 men. He
was wounded twice, suffering a broken leg and shrapnel in his head.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very, very hard," Arif says. "We were cold and hungry.
Always hungry."</TE>
<TE>   A New Force Emerges</TE>
<TE>   Photos show Arif then as an oak-limbed man with regal bearing
under a mufti turban, posing by an antiaircraft gun, hiking with his
men in the snow, treating a bloodied child in the dirt. Then, as now,
he had a wide grin, piercing eyes and a bushy beard.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, the Soviets withdrew. Arif rejoiced with his men. The new
president in Kabul, Berhanuddin Rabbani, named him deputy defense
minister. Soon he joined the government ruling council, representing
the Hazaras' political party, and considered a new career.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I would be a politician," he says. "I worked for my
people. I was their representative."</TE>
<TE>   But a civil war erupted as rival warlords battled for power in the
post-Soviet vacuum. Rabbani ordered Arif to hold the line in Ghazni,
and in 1994, he gave Arif several satchels, each stuffed with $20,000
to $30,000 in cash, to deliver to a group of fundamentalist clerics
and fighters who had entered the war. It was the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "We liked them at first," Arif recalls. "We thought they would
fight with us against the warlords. The Taliban said they didn't want
power, or to take over the government. They wanted to end corruption
and cleanse society. They wanted to help people. We believed them."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't last. Taliban zealots soon seized control of Ghazni and
began arresting and torturing opponents, especially Hazara Shias.
Arif had met several times with Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban
leader who now is a fugitive, and he felt personally betrayed.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a brave man, but he was not educated," Arif says of Omar.
"He was not smart. He knows the Koran, but that's all. Nothing about
science, about medicine, about art, about the world."</TE>
<TE>   Arif soon led several hundred Hazaras back to the mountains to
take up arms against the Taliban. "We stayed there and fought," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban captured Kabul in September 1996. In Ghazni, a Taliban
emissary offered to let Arif and his men--the last armed rebel group
in the province--surrender without punishment. Deciding further
struggle was futile, they handed over their weapons and went home.
Arif joined the local ruling council, or shura, and resumed work as a
doctor.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was OK for the first two months, but then Taliban sent
me a message to close the school for girls," Arif says. "The next day
... they also said to make sure there are no women in our hospital."</TE>
<TE>   Arif quietly resumed his fight. He slipped out of the country to
attend anti-Taliban conferences in Pakistan, Turkey and Germany. Back
home, the Taliban made no secret of their reign of religious terror.</TE>
<TE>   Taliban "Voice of Sharia" radio announced when Ghazni authorities
jailed moneylenders, whipped "an adulteress" 100 times and stoned to
death an accused murderer "in front of thousands of people." The
radio also noted when Taliban troops smashed relics in the Ghazni
museum and used pickaxes to destroy a reclining stone Buddha.</TE>
<TE>   At the Ghazni hospital, doctors were ordered to amputate limbs
from accused thieves. Arif was horrified. "We became doctors to cure
the sick, not to maim people," he says he told the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, his resistance went too far. In April 1999, the
Taliban tried to arrest him. He hid, so Taliban troops instead beat
and jailed Arif's younger brother, Ghulam Ihya. That night, Arif
donned a black Taliban turban as a disguise and escaped on a
motorbike over the mountains to Pakistan. His family soon joined him
in Peshawar.</TE>
<TE>   That summer, fellow exile and future president Karzai called to
invite Arif to a six-week symposium he was helping to organize at the
Center for Afghan Studies at the University of Nebraska. Twelve
anti-Taliban leaders soon flew to Omaha to discuss a post-Taliban
future.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department's U.S. Information Agency paid most of the
bill, but the Clinton administration ignored the group's
recommendations. "No one was interested in Afghanistan," said Tom
Gouttierre, head of the Afghan studies center.</TE>
<TE>   When the session ended, Arif and three other Afghans applied for
political asylum in America.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, I cannot return to Afghanistan now," he wrote in
his application affidavit. "There is no possibility of peace and
there is no room for me in the Taliban regime. Taliban will kill me,
of that there is no doubt."</TE>
<TE>   He was granted asylum that fall. Still, it was not an easy
decision to stay. "In Afghanistan, I was a medical doctor, a
political leader, a rich man," he says. "I had the good life. When I
came to America, I had nothing. I was looking for shelter, for food,
for a job."</TE>
<TE>   Since his medical degree is not accepted here, he first waited
tables at an Afghan restaurant in Virginia. Then he went to New York
to join a friend at a Mama's fried chicken stand in Harlem. They
cooked behind bulletproof glass, he says, because robberies were so
common. He quit after three months.</TE>
<TE>   "It was too dangerous," he says. "I felt everyone had a gun except
me."</TE>
<TE>   He moved back to Virginia, and his wife, three girls and five boys
finally were granted visas and arrived in April 2001. Overjoyed to be
together again, they jammed into a three-bedroom house on a leafy
street of split-level homes. Friends donated sofas and beds, a nephew
lent a minivan, and the Arifs settled in as strangers in a strange
land--immigrants in America.</TE>
<TE>   Until Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Several days later, Arif received a letter from Zahir Shah, the
long-exiled Afghan king. He invited Arif to his villa in Rome, where
Afghan opposition leaders were gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Arif was torn--his wife, Rahima, was pregnant again and spoke no
English. His children had to go to school. But he couldn't stand idle
at a time of crisis. The nephew, who drives an airport taxi, promised
to help Rahima and the children. Arif caught the next plane.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph and James Ritchie, retired stock option traders from
Chicago, also went to Rome. The Ritchie brothers grew up in Kabul and
were obsessed with Afghanistan. They had begun bankrolling the Afghan
king and opposition in 1998, mostly because no one else would.</TE>
<TE>   The Ritchies had pleaded with senior officials at the CIA,
Pentagon, State Department and White House, as well as members of
Congress, for three years in a futile effort to win Washington's
support for anti-Taliban leaders. "No one would listen," says James
Ritchie.</TE>
<TE>   In Rome, after Sept. 11, the Ritchies gave $10,000 checks to Arif
and six other Afghan commanders to return to Afghanistan and join
forces against the Taliban. Arif was determined to topple the regime
before America could start its war.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to fight," he says. "That was very clear. I did not want
the United States to fight in Afghanistan. It would be dangerous for
them, dangerous for Afghans. Also, my people [the Hazaras] did not
have a military leader. They were lost. I had to help them.''</TE>
<TE>   5 Days in Jail</TE>
<TE>   Arif flew back to Virginia first to see his family. But when he
landed at Dulles International Airport, six FBI agents boarded the
plane, hustled him out the door and into a jail cell for five days.
The charge: a 1994 bank fraud case in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents came to the Alexandria jail each night to ask him
questions. "I was very angry," he says. "I told them I was in
Afghanistan in 1994."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI also called Joseph Ritchie to ask why Arif carried his
$10,000 check. "I gave them references from the CIA and the White
House," Ritchie says. "They said, 'Oh.' "</TE>
<TE>   Court records show Magistrate Barry Poretz ordered Arif released
on Oct. 3 after prosecutors admitted the FBI had erred.</TE>
<TE>   The Ritchies are skeptical; they suspect U.S. officials sought to
sabotage their freelance foreign policy operation. The FBI declines
to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Out of jail, Arif flew to Pakistan two weeks later and linked up
with another former commander supported by the Ritchies, Abdul Haq.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA had backed Haq in the 1980s, but the agency refused to
provide the helicopters and weapons he now wanted to fight the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Haq decided to go anyway, convinced that moderate Taliban leaders
were ready to defect. But the Taliban quickly captured and executed
him, prompting headlines in America.</TE>
<TE>   Arif believes Haq was betrayed. He would not make the same
mistake. "When I [left for] Afghanistan, nobody knows. I go alone. I
go on foot. I take back roads."</TE>
<TE>   He reached Ghazni in four days and quickly reassembled 200 Hazara
gunmen. They dug up caches of buried assault rifles, grenade
launchers and other weapons, and began scouting Taliban and Al Qaeda
positions. The war was raging farther north, but had not yet reached
Ghazni.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long. On Nov. 7, Al Jazeera TV broadcast video from
Ghazni's Naor District of what it said were four sons of Osama bin
Laden celebrating beside the wreckage of a U.S. helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Northern Alliance forces captured Kabul without a
fight. The Taliban abandoned Ghazni the same day but then turned and
made a stand west of the city.</TE>
<TE>   After a 13-hour battle, Arif's fighters captured 54 prisoners plus
hundreds of weapons and scores of vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt very good," he says. "The Taliban was finished."</TE>
<TE>   Arif's group commander, Mohammed Ismail, liberated the local jail.
To his surprise, he found eight Western aid workers, including two
American women, inside a shipping container. The Taliban had
imprisoned them for preaching Christianity, then abandoned them when
they fled.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail called Arif, who sent a message to the International Red
Cross. They in turn contacted U.S. authorities, who sent a helicopter
the next day to ferry the relieved women to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Mopping up took another month. On Dec. 9, a reporter for the
Independent, a British newspaper, interviewed Arif as he negotiated
the surrender of the last Taliban troops in the province.</TE>
<TE>   The story described Arif as "an avuncular man who seems amused by
the rapid change in his fortunes" from gas pump jockey to head of the
local shura, or council.</TE>
<TE>   The story was wrong. Arif was increasingly worried about his
family, alone and impoverished in a faraway land. Seven weeks later,
he flew back to Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Rahima was having a difficult pregnancy. Their ninth child,
Abdullah, was born in April. The infant had a lung infection, and
Arif shuttled to and from the hospital for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "In our culture, a man must stay with the baby," he explains. "So
I stay for the baby. I must do my duty."</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah is fine now, and most of Arif's other children are
studying English or are in summer classes. And Arif has found a new
duty: his family.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, his children attend schools with books and
computers. For the first time, they live in a land without war. Their
school portraits line the living room mantel: Each is posed before an
American flag.</TE>
<TE>   It is an apt symbol. Arif insists the children's future is in
America now, not Afghanistan. He wants them all to go to college.</TE>
<TE>   "For 20 years I worked only for my country," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I forgot my family. I never thought of my wife and children. But
in Afghanistan, it is OK. Others could help them for me. Now I must
help them. I have to work and make money for them."</TE>
<TE>   Adjusting to America</TE>
<TE>   The adjustment has not been easy. He always had a driver in
Afghanistan, so he had to learn to drive here. His wife, who had
servants, learned to cook and clean. A brother sends bundles of
clothes from Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Life in America is very difficult," Arif says. "Because everyone
is running for the dollar. All the time. And everyone is always
tired. They work so hard."</TE>
<TE>   Afghans don't. Arif pours aromatic tea slowly for a visitor and
shares a leisurely lunch of spicy lamb, chicken and naan at the
dining room table. At night, the family dines cross-legged on the
floor, the dishes spread across an elegant Afghan carpet. Then they
pray.</TE>
<TE>   Arif talks wistfully of going back to Afghanistan someday to help
the Hazaras. But he also talks of opening an Afghan restaurant here,
where his family could work.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he heads out at 9 each night for the graveyard shift at
the gas station, where he sits in a dingy booth and watches the pumps
and the clock. He knows he's better off than most Afghans and insists
he is not bitter.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Arif is writing his autobiography, about a life that was
and a life that might have been.</TE>
<TE>   "I call it '19 plus 20 equals 0,' " he explains. "I spent 19 years
in school and 20 years fighting. Now I am nothing."</TE>

<HD>Martha Graham Dance Center Wins Custody Battle</HD>
<DH>Court: A federal judge rules company, not heir of
choreography icon, owns landmark works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A U.S. District Court judge on Friday awarded ownership of the bulk
of the choreography by modern dance icon Martha Graham to the Martha
Graham Dance Center, rather than to her heir, Ron Protas.</LD>
<LD>   Until 2000, Protas served on the board of the center and as
artistic director of the Martha Graham Dance Company, one of the
institutions the center administered. After Protas was voted off the
board and removed as artistic director, the center voted to close the
school and company, citing financial difficulties. Protas sued to
prevent the center's use of the Graham name as they planned to
rebuild. That suit was decided against Protas, a decision that was
upheld in July by an appeals court.</LD>
<LD>   In the meantime, Protas filed a second suit, claiming sole
ownership of Graham's dances, as well as the sets and costumes needed
to produce them. The ruling Friday by U.S. District Judge Miriam
Goldman Cedarbaum held that from 1956 to her death in 1991, Graham
was an employee of the center and that works created by her during
that period constituted work-for-hire and thus belonged to her
employers. Cedarbaum ruled that earlier works had been assigned by
Graham to the center after its creation.</LD>
<TE>   Protas, who had been Graham's assistant and confidant at the end
of her life, had argued that, as heir to her estate, the dances
belonged to him.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the ruling gives Protas rights to only the 1955
masterpiece "Seraphic Dialogue," a dance drama about Joan of Arc, and
awards the Graham Center rights to 45 works, including such
milestones of modern dance as "Primitive Mysteries" (1931), "El
Penitente" (1940), "Letter to the World" (1941) and "Embattled
Garden" (1958).</TE>
<TE>   However, Cedarbaum also found that in the case of 24 other works
"neither side has shown whether any of those dances were published
with adequate notice of copyright."</TE>
<TE>   This category includes some of the most celebrated Graham
creations: "Lamentation" (1930), "Appalachian Spring" (1944), "Cave
of the Heart" (1946) and the full-evening epic "Clytemnestra" (1958)
among them. Cedarbaum's ruling placed 10 in the public domain, ruled
that five belonged to the people or institutions who commissioned
them and left nine others in legal limbo, their ownership
undetermined.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe these nine works are presumptively ours," center
lawyer Katherine Forrest said Friday. "There are complicated legal
issues relating to the law of publication, and there's a question of
whether those works might end up in the public domain, but there's
not enough evidence to determine that as yet."</TE>
<TE>   Ownership of sets designed for works that had their premieres
after 1957 also went to neither side, but the center got rights to
those created earlier.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Cedarbaum ruled that "Protas profited improperly at
[the center's] expense" and ordered him to pay the center $92,973 for
licensing of Graham works he didn't own and $87,000 for selling
center property to the Library of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "We are overjoyed that, with the exception of one dance, we
anticipate unconstrained access and use of all Martha Graham's
dances," said Marvin Preston, executive director of the dance center.
"And we are optimistic we can arrange for access and use of the other
dance."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Protas nor his attorneys could be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Publicist Pleads Guilty in Attack</HD>
<DH>Crime: Last summer, Elizabeth Grubman backed her SUV into a
Southampton crowd. Of the 16 people injured, at least eight have sued
her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In a case that dominated tabloid headlines last summer, Manhattan
publicist Elizabeth Grubman told a judge Friday that she was guilty
of backing her luxury sport utility vehicle into a crowd of people
outside a Southampton nightclub.</LD>
<LD>   Acting Supreme Court Judge Michael Mullen announced he would
sentence Grubman, 31, to two months in jail, 280 hours of community
service and five years' probation when she next appears in court Oct.
23.</LD>
<LD>   Grubman, who could have faced eight years in prison if she had
been convicted during a trial, admitted in court to the felony charge
of leaving the scene of an accident and a misdemeanor charge of
assault.</LD>
<TE>   At least eight of the 16 people who were injured in the incident
have filed civil lawsuits seeking millions of dollars from Grubman,
and her guilty plea clearly will be an important consideration by the
lawyers pressing for damages.</TE>
<TE>   During the brief hearing in Suffolk County Court in Riverhead on
Long Island, Grubman merely replied yes or no to most questions. She
apologized for her behavior and candidly told the judge, when she had
difficulty explaining what had happened, that she was "very nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, Grubman will spend two months in the Suffolk
County Jail. Prosecutor Joy Watson said she wouldn't receive special
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Watson, an assistant Nassau County district attorney, told the
judge that police didn't believe Grubman was intoxicated at the time
of the incident. The prosecutor also said witness descriptions that
Grubman was drunk were unreliable.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman quickly left the scene outside Conscience Point Inn in
another vehicle when the crash occurred July 7, 2001. But by the time
investigators contacted Grubman, it was too late to test her for
alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Conlon, the club's bouncer, told police Grubman became upset
when he asked her to move her Mercedes-Benz SUV from a fire lane.
Conlon said she called him "white trash," then put her SUV into
reverse and backed into the crowd. Some of the victims received cuts,
bruises and broken bones.</TE>
<TE>   Focusing not only on Friday's confession in court but also on the
pending civil suits, Stephen Scaring, one of Grubman's lawyers,
stressed that her plea established she wasn't intoxicated when what
he labeled the "accident" occurred. Scaring also said Grubman's
actions were "not intentional."</TE>
<TE>   Grubman paused briefly as she left court Friday with half a dozen
bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to say once again I'm sorry for the people that I hurt in
the accident and I apologize to their families," she told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Grubman, whose clients have included singer Britney
Spears, Sony Music Chairman Tommy Mottola and rappers Jay-Z and
Wu-Tang Clan, declared her innocence in the high-profile case's
26-count indictment.</TE>
<TE>   But it was no secret that discussions were underway between her
lawyers and prosecutors. And over the weekend, portions of the plea
bargain began to surface in the media.</TE>
<TE>   Watson said the agreement didn't represent preferential treatment
for Grubman.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know who she was when I took this case," she said.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Widow Charged With Murder in Deaths of Ailing Sons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GRIFFIN, Ga.</DL>
<LD>Despite community pleas for mercy, a Georgia grand jury handed up
murder charges Friday against a woman who fatally shot two adult sons
as they lay in a nursing home in advanced stages of Huntington's
disease.</LD>
<LD>   Carol Carr, 63, faces the possibility of life in prison if she is
convicted of the killings, which friends insist she carried out in a
desperate bid to end her sons' suffering. The case has generated
nationwide attention, winning Carr expressions of support from those
who know the ravages of Huntington's, a hereditary brain disorder
that leaves patients unable to walk, speak or think clearly and is
ultimately fatal.</LD>
<LD>   Carr's husband died of Huntington's and a third son, James Scott,
38, in is the early stages of the disease. The disorder also struck
the husband's mother, along with a sister and brother.</LD>
<TE>   James Scott labeled the indictments "the wrong decision."</TE>
<TE>   "I figured they should have dropped all the charges and let her
go. She's been in prison since 1958--taking care of someone with
Huntington's," he said, referring to the year his parents married and
his grandmother became ill.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had spoken to his mother by phone and that she was
"pretty upset."</TE>
<TE>   Carr's son Randy Scott was 42 at the time of the shooting. The
other son, Andy Scott, was 41.</TE>
<TE>   As the indictments were read in a Spalding County courtroom 40
miles south of Atlanta, Carr remained in the county jail where she
has been held without bail since her arrest June 8. Her attorneys
said the law gave the grand jury scant leeway in deciding whether
evidence was sufficient to charge Carr. Georgia does not have an
assisted-suicide law.</TE>
<TE>   The charges included murder with malice aforethought and murder in
the commission of a felony.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a total surprise. We had hoped the grand jury would
do away with [the case]. There were a lot of people that were hoping
that," defense lawyer Eric Hearn said.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen Carr supporters, holding signs urging that she
be freed, had gathered outside the courthouse a day earlier as the
grand jury began hearing evidence behind closed doors. None of the
demonstrators remained Friday, though.</TE>
<TE>   Spalding County Dist. Atty. William T. McBroom declined to comment
on the indictments. A court date has not been set.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn expressed confidence that jurors considering the case would
find Carr's motivations compelling.</TE>
<TE>   "There are circumstances here that all of us as people and
compassionate people can understand and relate to, although the
situation is so horrendous that I doubt there are many who can relate
to that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers cannot present a defense during grand jury proceedings,
but Hearn said McBroom allowed the panel to watch an informational
video about Huntington's disease.</TE>
<TE>   After her husband's death in 1995, Carr turned her energies to
caring for Randy and Andy, then in their 30s and already in the
disease's advanced stages. They needed help for the most basic tasks,
such as eating and going to the bathroom. The sons eventually were
placed in a Griffin nursing home, SunBridge Care and Rehabilitation,
where they shared a room.</TE>
<TE>   On June 8, Carr carried a .25-caliber pistol into the room and
shot her sons in the head. She then walked to the lobby and awaited
police.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters said Carr could not stand to see her children endure
more. She told one friend after the shooting that Andy was writhing
and tearfully tugging at his sheets when Carr entered the room that
day.</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington's Disease Society of America expressed sympathy
after the shootings, noting that "our HD families and friends can
well understand the enormous emotional trauma Carol Carr felt as she
watched her sons follow the same path that her husband had endured so
many years earlier."</TE>

<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>The violent demonstrations against President Bush caught White House
planners by surprise, a presidential spokesman said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   It's not unusual for presidents to be confronted by small protests
when visiting outside Washington. But demonstrations that result in
the kind of skirmishes with police that erupted here Thursday night
have been rare.</LD>
<LD>   "We did not have any inkling" that such a protest would occur,
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters.</LD>
<TE>   More than 1,000 people turned out to scream anti-Bush slogans, tag
buildings with graffiti and challenge police at barricades around the
hotel where the president held a fund-raiser for Sen. Gordon Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Among other issues, the protesters said they were upset with
Bush's plan to relax environmental standards for logging, a possible
war with Iraq, the U.S. stance on the Middle East and what they
called rampant government corruption.</TE>
<TE>   The group blocked buildings, and Republican donors trying to get
to the hotel were taunted and jostled. Many had to be escorted in by
police, who later used pepper spray and rubber bullets on the crowd.
Six people were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon, especially Portland and Eugene, have a tradition of
demonstrations. Bush's father, former President George Bush, used to
refer to Portland as "Little Beirut" because of the protesters he
encountered during his visits.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the National Lawyer's Guild asked Mayor Vera Katz
to fire Police Chief Mark Kroeker, claiming Thursday's actions by
police were "atrocities against humanity."</TE>

<HD>Coast Guard Lists Toward Security Duty</HD>
<DH>Analysis: The service's new anti-terrorism focus has come
at the expense of its traditional charges, a congressional study
concludes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Coast Guard spent 2,263 fewer duty hours on search and rescue
this spring and 4,322 fewer hours than last year on drug
interdiction, fanning concerns that port security duties will
diminish traditional missions.</LD>
<LD>   A congressional analysis--among the first to measure trade-offs
among competing priorities as a result of the war on terrorism--found
that Coast Guard boats and aircraft devoted 9% fewer operational
hours to rescue missions from April through June of this year,
compared with the same period last year.</LD>
<LD>   Other missions were squeezed harder, from drug interdiction, which
saw a 15% drop in hours, to environmental protection, which plunged
by 53%.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Coast Guard units spent 30,805 additional hours on port
security--more than an eightfold increase.</TE>
<TE>   "The traditional missions haven't disappeared," said Sen. Patty
Murray (D-Wash.). "We still need the Coast Guard to keep drugs and
illegal migrants off our shores, to protect our environment ... and
to protect the lives of our fishermen."</TE>
<TE>   Murray chairs the Senate transportation appropriations
subcommittee, and her staff analyzed the data, the most recent
available. An aide said the April-June period was picked to try to
establish some distance from the immediate aftermath of the terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Though port security has become a top responsibility since Sept.
11, Cmdr. Jim McPherson, a senior Coast Guard spokesman, said rescues
will always take precedence.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get a search-and-rescue case, we are going to prosecute it
to the end," McPherson said. "We would be able to shift assets from
port security." He also questioned whether comparing two three-month
periods is enough.</TE>
<TE>   No reports have emerged of lives lost at sea or rescue missions
jeopardized as a result of security duties. And these days, there is
hardly a federal agency that is not devoting more resources to
security.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard, however, has a unique reputation for
multi-tasking.</TE>
<TE>   The service is the ambulance squad, police department, game warden
and maintenance division of U.S. coastal waters, handling everything
from regular inspections of signal buoys to nighttime rescues in
pitching seas. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Coast Guard took on drug
and migrant interdiction. Now, it is protecting the nation's longest
border--more than 95,000 miles of coastline--from terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   The future of the Coast Guard has been one of the most contentious
issues in the debate over creating a new Homeland Security
Department. Some lawmakers oppose moving it from its home in the
Transportation Department, fearing that it will lose its ability to
handle several missions at a time. The new statistics are likely to
become fodder in that debate.</TE>
<TE>   "The Coast Guard operates in a zero-sum fashion.... [It] has been
drawing down on its other major responsibilities in order to ramp up
for port security," said Michael Sciulla, a spokesman for BoatU.S.,
which represents 535,000 recreational boaters.</TE>
<TE>   But Sciulla said a shift in priorities does not automatically have
to compromise safety. Equipment and technology upgrades that the
Coast Guard expects to receive for its anti-terrorism mission could
also help rescuers to more easily zero in on radio signals from
foundering boats.</TE>
<TE>   "Their budget has been squeezed for many years, and now money is
going to be thrown into homeland security," Sciulla said. "The Coast
Guard will have more manpower and newer equipment ... and that will
benefit recreational boaters."</TE>
<TE>   But Murray and other lawmakers worry that a fundamental shift has
already taken place in the way the Coast Guard sees itself.</TE>
<TE>   "The [appropriations] committee is greatly concerned that the new
emphasis on security ... means that the Coast Guard has no intention
of restoring missions like drug interdiction" to their pre-Sept. 11
levels, the analysis said. "The committee does not agree ... that the
taxpayer should be content with a diminished effort in the areas of
marine safety, marine environmental protection, drug interdiction and
fisheries enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   "In fairness, the Coast Guard responds to each and every call,"
said a staffer who helped prepare the committee analysis. "But there
are issues there. How well they respond has to do with how well their
boats and aircraft are located. There are gray areas in terms of
whether they are at their best."</TE>
<TE>   The panel approved a 20% increase in the Coast Guard's operating
budget and a 14% increase in procurement, but the funding bill is far
from final passage.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard's search-and-rescue program was facing
difficulties even before the attacks. An audit last year by the
Transportation Department inspector general found that rescue boat
stations were understaffed and crews were working with aging
equipment and little formal training. The inspector general launched
another audit this summer, partly because of concerns that security
duties would further erode the search-and-rescue program. Its
findings have not been released.</TE>
<TE>   McPherson and other Coast Guard officials said the service is
managing to juggle its responsibilities by calling up reservists and
enlisting the aid of local authorities and boaters.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary statistics this year indicate that the overall number
of search-and-rescue cases is down. But the Coast Guard is also
registering fewer false-alarm distress calls, and boaters have been
advised to try to assist one another with minor problems before
calling for help.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of cocaine seized in drug interdiction operations is
running behind last year's figures, but more marijuana has been
seized than in the previous federal fiscal year, which began Oct. 1,
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand people's concerns, but what has made the Coast
Guard successful is our flexibility," McPherson said. "An AC-130
[aircraft] taking off from Clearwater, Fla., looking for migrants can
easily shift into search and rescue, and if it sees a go-fast boat,
it can do a law enforcement stop. Everybody is cross-trained."</TE>

<HD>Bush to Meet With Saudi Ambassador</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DANA POINT</DL>
<LD>President Bush will meet Tuesday with Saudi Arabia's ambassador to
the United States, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, to discuss "a variety of
regional issues--and many other topics," the White House announced
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting, to be held at Bush's ranch near Crawford, Texas,
highlights the rising tensions between Washington and Riyadh in the
wake of the September terrorist attacks, in part because 15 of the 19
hijackers came from Saudi Arabia.</LD>
<LD>   Relations have been further strained as Bush in recent months has
spoken repeatedly of his intention to effect a "regime change" in
Iraq because he believes that President Saddam Hussein may acquire
weapons of mass destruction--and use them or make them available to
terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   In appearances in Northern and Southern California on Friday, the
president again talked of the threat posed by such leaders as
Hussein, although Bush did not mention Iraq or its president by name.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's invitation to Bandar was announced by White House spokesman
Ari Fleischer aboard Air Force One on Friday morning.</TE>

<HD>2 Siblings Slain in Knife Attack</HD>
<DH>Crime: Mother and an older daughter are wounded in
Kentucky. City clerk is arrested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WARSAW, Ky.</DL>
<LD>A young brother and sister died Friday of knife wounds in an attack
that injured a sibling and left their mother in critical condition.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested an acquaintance of the mother hours later in a
West Virginia town 270 miles away.</LD>
<LD>   Police offered no immediate motive for the early morning attack
that killed Cody Sharon, 6, and Chelbi Sharon, 7. Authorities charged
Marco Chapman, 30, of Warsaw, with murder, assault and burglary.</LD>
<TE>   The mother, Carolyn Marksberry, was in critical but stable
condition after surgery at University of Cincinnati Hospital.
Ten-year-old Courtney Sharon was in fair condition at Cincinnati's
Children's Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman was arrested in Shrewsbury, W.Va., about six hours after
police found the victims, said Sheriff David Tucker of Kanawha
County, W.Va. He was arraigned in a West Virginia courtroom Friday on
a fugitive charge.</TE>
<TE>   He was to be held in Charleston pending an extradition hearing,
prosecutor Michael Clifford said.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. John Bradley of the Kentucky State Police said Chapman was an
acquaintance of Marksberry's but would not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Marksberry had been appointed city clerk this month in Warsaw, an
Ohio River town of 1,800 about 45 miles southwest of Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Charles, had been in Spain training for his job at a
stainless steel production plant. A company spokeswoman said he was
on his way home Friday.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WILLARD, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Three mourners at a rural graveside funeral were killed Friday when
they were struck by lightning that crackled down a tree they took
shelter under during a thunderstorm.</LD>
<LD>   The three victims were Leroy Hendrix, 82; Billy J. Burgess, 66;
and Joretta Gray, 71, said Chief Deputy Tom Martin of the Greene
County sheriff's office. Gray's husband, Junior, 70, was in critical
condition.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Turk, who lives across from the cemetery, said he saw the
lightning and a "big ball of fire" that came down a tree.</LD>
<TE>   "I saw four people sort of fall over in slow motion, four elderly
people. It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen in my life,"
Turk told KTTS radio.</TE>
<TE>   Darryl Walker, pastor at nearby Tatum Chapel Baptist Church, said
about 30 to 40 people were at the graveside service.</TE>
<TE>   Strong storms that roared through other parts of Missouri and Iowa
also knocked out power and forced officials in some cities to cancel
school.</TE>
<TE>   Wind gusts of 85 mph were reported in Des Moines as the storms
rolled in about 12:30 a.m., said Marc Russell, a meteorologist with
the National Weather Service. As much as 4 inches of rain fell.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Waetke, a spokesman for Mid American Energy, said 50,000
customers were without power after the storm.</TE>
<TE>   Some may be without power until today.</TE>
<TE>   Des Moines schools closed after learning that power would not be
immediately restored.</TE>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The mayor tried to calm a neighborhood Friday that erupted in
violence after a 10-year-old boy was hit by a bullet that ricocheted
from a police officer's gun.</LD>
<LD>   Tensions between the community's black residents and police
already were high after an incident last week in which police shot a
19-year-old black man who allegedly pointed a gun at an officer.</LD>
<LD>   The boy's wounding unleashed a torrent of emotion. Dozens of
people shouted at police, smashed windows and assaulted members of
the media covering the shooting.</LD>
<TE>   "Certainly last night gave an example of the anger that is
involved in the community. We need to address that," Mayor R.T. Rybak
said Friday after meeting with community leaders and visiting the boy
in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The boy, who is black, was wounded Thursday night after an officer
shot at a pit bull that had been turned loose on police who were
serving a search warrant at a house. The bullet hit concrete and
ricocheted into the boy's arm.</TE>

<HD>Fla. Child Welfare Agency Nominee Assailed on '80s Articles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Gov. Jeb Bush's nominee to head the state's troubled child welfare
system wrote a 1988 article in which he condoned "manly" discipline
of children and urged women to work at home.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Regier drew immediate criticism Friday from Democrats, and
at least one Republican legislator, for the piece in Pastoral
Renewal, a now-defunct religious journal.</LD>
<LD>   In it, he argued for a restoration of family values based on
"biblical norms."</LD>
<TE>   The arguments are similar to those that appeared a year later in
an article that Regier distanced himself from last week. But the
authors in 1989 went further, condoning spanking even when it
produces bruises or welts.</TE>
<TE>   Regier, 57, said he was part of the group that released the 1989
paper but that he didn't write it and doesn't believe in such
punishment.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1988 article, Regier is listed as the sole author. He
acknowledged in an interview published in Friday's Miami Herald that
he wrote "The Not-So-Disposable Family," which appeared in the
July-August issue of Pastoral Renewal.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bible is not at all uncertain about value of discipline:
'Although you smite him with the rod, he will not die. Smite him with
the rod ... save the soul,' " the article says.</TE>
<TE>   About women, it says: "Scripture is clear in stating that women
are to be 'helpmates' to their husbands, that they are to bear and
nurture, that they are to be 'workers at home.' "</TE>
<TE>   Regier told the Herald his writings were meant to encourage
parents to take an active role in building character in their
children.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Friday, Regier said: "I spanked my kids, yes.
And I think that probably parents who give a swat to a 2-year-old
would agree with that. I think disciplining children is fine."</TE>
<TE>   After the article surfaced, the Democratic Party renewed its call
for Bush to withdraw the nomination, and even some Republicans were
beginning to question the appointment.</TE>
<TE>   "As a female legislator, I have deep concerns about his core
philosophies," said state Rep. Nancy Detert (R-Venice), who is a
member of the House committee that oversees Florida's Department of
Children and Families. "I'm hoping that these aren't true, and I'm
also hoping that the governor might want to rethink his choice if
they are true.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need now is a calming influence as an agency head, not a
further bumpy road.... Everyone I've spoken with shares my concern,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives from women's groups also united against Regier.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids don't count, women don't count with Jeb Bush," said Barbara
DeVane, who heads an organization called We All Count. "The true
radical, right-wing Jeb Bush ... has taken over the body of the Jeb
Bush he sold us in 1998."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Bush said attacks on Regier's qualifications were
unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "Going back and misinterpreting articles that were written 10 to
15 years ago as the basis for his departure just shows how it's time
to take a pause and a deep breath, maybe reflect on some of these
assertions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also discounted criticism over views on spanking.</TE>
<TE>   "If the mom or dad, out of love or discipline, want to use
corporal punishment as a tool to bring a sense of order in a child's
life--which is commonplace--do they think the DCF should be called
and kids should be yanked out of the home?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Regier, a former Oklahoma Cabinet secretary who also worked for
Bush's father as head of the National Office of Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention, was named to replace Kathleen A. Kearney as
head of the Florida agency.</TE>
<TE>   Kearney resigned amid a series of troubling cases, including the
disappearance of 5-year-old Rilya Wilson, who was missing from her
foster home 15 months before the agency noticed.</TE>
<TE>   She is still missing.</TE>

<LD>A study in mice suggests that a flawed gene may be the reason the
West Nile virus causes a life-threatening illness in some while
giving others only a relatively mild infection, according to French
researchers. Scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris reported
last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that
a strain of mice carrying a nonworking gene is quickly killed by the
West Nile virus, while mice with normal genes are not.</LD>
<LD>   If a similar gene variation is found in humans, it may lead to a
new understanding of why only about 1 in 5 people infected with the
virus develops a serious illness, the scientists said. American
experts said the research is an important step toward finding a drug
to treat West Nile infections.</LD>

<LD>The U.S. government is quietly advising that companies end some
controversial animal tests, saying laboratory alternatives exist that
are quicker and just as good. The tests look for corrosive chemicals
and involve shaving an animal, painting the compound onto its skin
and then waiting for up to two weeks to see if damage results.</LD>
<LD>   The recommendations, from a committee set up to find alternatives
to animal tests, go to federal agencies ranging from the
Environmental Protection Agency to the Department of Transportation,
which can choose whether to change their regulations. The North
Carolina-based Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation
of Alternative Methods, established to review animal tests, said
there are four alternative tests that do not require the use of live
animals.</LD>
<LD>   They are Episkin, based on human collagen; a human skin cell-based
test called EpiDerm; the Rat Skin TER assay, which uses disks of rat
skin; and Corrositex, which also uses layers of collagen--the
material that holds skin together.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Swedish scientists have found tiny, mysterious particles in the
spinal marrow fluid that could help explain the cause of
schizophrenia. They may be involved in the development of the disease
or may result from the disease process in brains of schizophrenic
patients, the Swedish researchers reported in the journal
Neuroscience Letters.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Lennart Wetterberg and his colleagues at Stockholm's St.
Goran's Hospital said the full significance of the findings was not
yet clear and more research was needed. "We have viruses, bacteria
and prions--this could be an entirely new form of life," he told
Reuters news service.</LD>
<LD>   But he said this was just one theory, and it was still uncertain
what form of life is represented by the particles, which are bigger
than ordinary viruses but smaller than bacteria.</LD>
<TE>   The team studied spinal fluid obtained by lumbar puncture from 22
schizophrenic patients and 38 control patients. The study found
spherical particles--only 1/100,000th of a millimeter in size--in the
spinal fluid of 20 of the 22 patients with schizophrenia against only
two of the 38 controls, they said.</TE>

<HD>Lady Lions Prefer Manes in Black</HD>
<DH>SCIENCE / IN BRIEF</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the Serengeti, the lady lion prefers a swain with a black mane.
That's the finding of a study analyzing how the dense collar of hair
about the neck of male lions affects the love life of the biggest
cat. Biologists Peyton M. West and Craig Packer of the University of
Minnesota reported in the Aug. 23 issue of Science that it is the
mane's color, not its length, that matters most to the female lions
of Tanzania.</LD>
<LD>   "We were completely surprised by this," West said. She said the
lionesses may instinctively be drawn to the black manes because males
with darker manes seem superior in a number of ways. "A dark mane is
apparently a marker the female uses to evaluate the fitness of a
male," she said. This suggests that lions' manes evolved over time
through sexual selection, she speculated. Dark-maned male lions
generally have a higher level of testosterone, "which means they are
more aggressive fighters," said West, and this can be key to raising
cubs successfully.</LD>
<LD>   West and Packer investigated the effects of mane color by setting
up life-sized models of lions near where the animals lived in the
Serengeti. Female lions, when given a choice, would try to seduce the
models that had the darker mane, ignoring those with blond hair. Male
lions tended more often to attack the lion models with short manes or
with light-colored manes, while avoiding the models with black manes.</LD>

<HD>Panic Over Virus May Exceed the Threat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The symptoms of West Nile virus are like portents from a vintage
Hitchcock film: There is the whine of mosquitoes. Crows fall dead
from the sky; horses sicken.</LD>
<LD>   Panic spreads and a tabloid fever grips the land. In Texas, the
virus left its calling card for the first time when an infected
grackle dropped dead last month near San Antonio. Within days, birds
in Oklahoma and South Dakota started dying. This week, horses in
Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and New Mexico were stricken.</LD>
<LD>   The virus--virtually unknown in the Western Hemisphere until three
years ago--is poised to leap the barrier of the Rocky Mountains into
California.</LD>
<TE>   As the largest outbreak yet of West Nile virus reaches its
anticipated peak in the next two weeks, medical authorities
acknowledge that the disease is spreading more quickly than expected.
The virus has infected birds and mammals in 41 states, nearly
doubling its known territory this year.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in the grand scheme of disease, West Nile virus may be a bit
player.</TE>
<TE>   Most people infected with the virus may never even realize they
are ill. A mild infection may confer lifelong immunity, researchers
said.</TE>
<TE>   In areas of Africa where the disease is endemic, it is a mild
childhood malady that almost never develops serious consequences,
said Dr. Lyle Petersen, an infectious disease expert at the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, public health officials in New York City, the epicenter of
the first U.S. outbreak of West Nile virus in 1999, so far have
reported only four cases of the disease this summer, suggesting that
people are becoming acclimated to it. So far this year, human cases
have been reported in 20 states plus the District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   As the national immune system adjusts, the virus may fall back
into the obscurity of wildlife diseases, several public health
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Just as thousands of tourists visiting the Channel Islands safely
coexist with deer mice infected with the deadly hantavirus, so people
may learn to live with the low risk of West Nile virus.</TE>
<TE>   Backpackers in California and 14 other states, mostly in the West,
routinely risk contact with flea-infested animals harboring the
bubonic plague or tularemia without worry. Only a handful of human
cases are reported each year.</TE>
<TE>   If the West Nile virus behaves like related diseases such as St.
Louis encephalitis and California encephalitis, which also are
harbored in birds and transmitted by mosquitoes, it will fade into
the sporadic background noise of public health.</TE>
<TE>   Consider St. Louis encephalitis. It has been common in the
Midwest, with 128 cases reported nationally in an average year. It
has been almost a generation since the last major human outbreak of
the disease.</TE>
<TE>   By that pattern, the next human outbreak of West Nile virus may
not be nearly so severe or so widespread, CDC experts said. It could
be a decade or more before the next notable outbreak occurs.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there were no major outbreaks of West Nile virus anywhere
in the world between 1975 and the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Then it suddenly reappeared in Israel, Romania and Russia.
Something about the virus had changed. It infected horses for the
first time and caused more severe health consequences when it
infected humans.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some evidence to suggest that this is a new and more
virulent strain of West Nile virus," said Duane Gubler, director of
vector-borne diseases at the National Center for Infectious Diseases
in Fort Collins, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary laboratory analysis at the CDC suggests that there are
significant genetic differences between the newer strain of West Nile
and those found in Africa that may account for its greater virulence.</TE>
<TE>   As a disease of birds, the West Nile virus is far more deadly than
the St. Louis virus, said wildlife disease expert Bob McLean at the
National Wildlife Research Center in Fort Collins. So far it has
infected more than 120 species of birds.</TE>
<TE>   "For birds, we have never seen a virulent virus like this before,"
McLean said.</TE>
<TE>   As a newcomer to the United States, the West Nile virus itself may
be a symptom of more fundamental ills.</TE>
<TE>   Changes in climate, local ecology, technology and lifestyle have
fostered the emergence of 30 serious diseases in recent decades,
aided in part by a dangerous indifference to the threat of
insect-borne diseases, said Dr. Paul Epstein, associate director of
the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard
University Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   "We are seeing new diseases emerge," Epstein said. "There is a
three-ring circus of causes. The carriers of disease are getting
boosted by ecological, sociological and climatological disturbances.</TE>
<TE>   "People are rightly concerned," he added. "The public is reading
this correctly as signs of instability."</TE>
<TE>   Where humankind sees the chaos and uncertainty of modern life,
nature sees an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   The bacterium that causes Legionnaire's disease, for example, took
advantage of the contemporary taste for air conditioning, spreading
through modern ventilation systems and cooling towers. AIDS and
hepatitis C were helped by innovations in medical care and spread, in
part, through unscreened blood transfusions.</TE>
<TE>   A national appetite for fast food created the opportunity for
salmonella and other food-borne illnesses to spread quickly through
centrally processed foods that are distributed to many states.</TE>
<TE>   But through the sustained vigilance of public health authorities
and new medical treatments, most of these diseases have been
controlled before they reached epidemic proportions. With the
exception of AIDS, the new diseases largely remain background
threats, not plagues.</TE>
<TE>   A virus such as West Nile is a fellow traveler of global commerce
and tourism, Gubler said.</TE>
<TE>   Several strains of the virus circulate worldwide, but only one has
reached the United States so far.</TE>
<TE>   It appears to have originated in the Middle East. No one knows how
it got here. But it has moved so quickly since it arrived that it has
stirred an unusually high level of fear in a public whose nerves were
already on edge this year after rounds of anthrax threats and the
specter of biological warfare.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a quick march across the country," said John Edman,
director of the Center for Vector-Borne Diseases at UC Davis. "The
spread westward has been faster than it was last year."</TE>
<TE>   So far, 371 people have gotten sick. Sixteen have died, officials
at the CDC said. There is no cure or effective treatment.</TE>
<TE>   In response, federal public health officials this week poured an
additional $4 million into the Southeastern states hardest hit,
bringing to $31 million the amount of federal emergency money
directed at the disease this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Such insect-borne diseases are likely to grow in importance as
international travel becomes easier and human populations move into
new areas, UC Davis entomologist Tom Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   In Louisiana, where almost half of this year's cases have been
reported, growing suburban development along swamplands may have
exposed people to infected mosquitoes, said tropical medicine expert
Dr. Susan McLellan at Tulane University.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a greater risk of what used to be wildlife diseases,"
McLean said.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife experts said Southern California can expect to see the
West Nile virus within a year as migrating birds carrying the
infection up the Pacific flyway from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, it is a familiar American story of public health, in
which an exotic virus finds a second chance in the New World.</TE>
<TE>   "West Nile virus has been brought to fertile ground in a new
hemisphere," said McLellan at Tulane.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a huge mistake to think the United States can escape the
medical consequences of being part of a larger world."</TE>

<LD>"This is absolutely insane."</LD>
<LD>   Kerry Malouf, a 34-year-old makeup artist, was standing at the
edge of a 75-foot drop in the Sequoia National Forest, her feet
planted firmly on the ground, a climbing harness cinched around her
waist.</LD>
<LD>   It was the eighth hour of a day that had begun before dawn for
Malouf and the 17 other women participating in GIRLteams, a three-day
adventure training camp. The women had already kayaked,
mountain-biked and hiked across rough terrain.</LD>
<TE>   They had demonstrated that they could use a compass, change a
bicycle tire and read a topographic map. They were tired, it was hot
and exhaustion was starting to set in. The cliff was the last
obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   As Malouf teetered at the edge, her team's chances rested on her
ability to lean back, move her feet and slowly begin to descend the
cliff. If she didn't get down, her teammates would not be allowed to
descend.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I had never been so scared in my life," Malouf
admitted later. "I knew I had to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Her teammates cheered her on from above.</TE>
<TE>   "You look good," one camper told Malouf.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as I look good," she shouted back with more than a hint
of irony. She hadn't showered in three days. "My god, I couldn't care
less."</TE>
<TE>   With that, she pushed off and began to rappel down. Less than a
half-hour later, Malouf and her five teammates--Team Black and Blue,
as its members had nicknamed themselves--safely returned to their
base camp, where they dunked themselves, fully clothed, in the Kern
River.</TE>
<TE>   GIRLteams--designed as part empowerment and part instruction for
the women who participate--is the brainchild of Scott Zagarino, a
former professional triathlete and adventure racer and the father of
two daughters.</TE>
<TE>   As adventure racing has grown in popularity, training camps have
sprung up in Southern California for both seasoned racers and
novices. Almost all of the camps use adventure racing as a metaphor
for overcoming obstacles in everyday life. Though some camps simulate
24-to 36-hour races, others help develop team dynamics; still others
teach particular skills.</TE>
<TE>   GIRLteams is the only local camp to cater exclusively to women.</TE>
<TE>   Zagarino promotes the camp as a way for women to overcome fears,
as well as to develop a sense of belonging to a larger community of
women.</TE>
<TE>   Ranging in age from 13 to 51, the 18 women attending the recent
camp arrived on a Friday morning from as far away as St. Louis. After
gathering in Santa Monica for a yoga class and climbing lessons at a
local gym, the group traveled by van to Keyesville, above Bakersfield
in the Kern River Valley.</TE>
<TE>   There they were schooled in mountain biking, kayaking and
following a course with compass and map, mostly by female
instructors. On the third day, they were divided into three teams to
demonstrate what they had learned in a mock adventure race.</TE>
<TE>   Participants, who paid $700 each to attend the camp, were screened
beforehand to ensure that they had the strength to move quickly from
one sport to the next, with only a few minutes between to change or
eat.</TE>
<TE>   When they did eat, they ate well: eggs, cereal, tortilla and toast
in the morning; pasta, sandwiches and stir-fry at midday; roasted
chicken and turkey Bolognese for dinner--and Gatorade and Red Bull in
between.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the three days, the participants found strength--and
humor--in one another.</TE>
<TE>   "There goes my chances for a leg wax on Monday," said Amy Sommer,
an independent producer, as she cheerily picked herself up after her
third attempt at getting down a steep incline on a mountain bike,
brushing dirt from a series of cuts and scrapes on her legs. She made
it down the hill on her fifth attempt as the other women cheered her
on.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of surprised and proud of myself that I did it," she
said later.</TE>
<TE>   There were many small triumphs along the way. For Julie Rhee, 30,
a financial analyst from Venice, success came when she was the first
among her teammates to read and understand a detailed topographic
map.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, so this is our road," she said, concentrating hard on the
gray line that squiggled across the page.</TE>
<TE>   "You line it up to the north," teammate Malouf prompted, handing
her the team's compass.</TE>
<TE>   "Like that?" Rhee asked, pointing to a spot on the map with a pine
needle. "So that means we are ... right here!"</TE>
<TE>   For Malouf, learning skills and especially summoning the courage
to rappel down a cliff helped her confront a very different sort of
challenge. From the outdoor camp, she took home a strengthened
resolve to mend a shaky marital relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "The trip taught me so much," she said. "I can be very clear about
how I feel. I came home and talked to my husband; I was able to
really talk to him, communicate with him. It's a whole new step in
our relationship."</TE>
<TE>   The camp gave Sommer an opportunity to reevaluate her self-image.
"The picture I carry around of myself is different," she said a week
later. "It's a little more confident. More bruised, more in need of
Advil, perhaps, but it's a stronger picture and I kind of like it."</TE>
<TE>   Only a handful of the women participating in GIRLteams planned to
enter real adventure races. But most said they had been inspired by
the skills they had acquired and the knowledge of how much they could
endure.</TE>
<TE>   Before the group left Keyesville, Isabelle Fox, a film director,
spoke of plans she had already formed to continue the climbing,
biking and kayaking after she returned home to Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   "This was such a great appetizer," Fox said. "My husband won't
know what hit him."</TE>

<HD>New Chief Puts Emphasis on Community</HD>
<DH>Police: Huntington Beach picks Daytona Beach official for
top department post.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Huntington Beach's designated police chief said Friday that he wants
his department to establish strong ties with the city's various
neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   "I like to spend a lot of time out of my office working with the
community," said Kenneth W. Small, who is leaving his post as chief
of the Daytona Beach, Fla., police department. "I think that's what
public service is all about."</LD>
<LD>   Small, chosen from a field of 50 candidates, will replace Chief
Ron Lowenberg, who is retiring after 13 years.</LD>
<TE>   Relations between Huntington Beach police and residents in some
heavily Latino neighborhoods were strained two years ago when an
officer shot a teenager who was holding a toy gun. The incident
prompted demonstrations at City Hall. Police officers also have been
criticized for what some consider heavy-handed treatment of July
Fourth revelers near the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the department remains popular with many residents, and
officials have instituted several community-policing programs and
created neighborhood substations.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Debbie Cook said, "Everybody [on the council] is pretty
excited about him. I think his style is going to fit in very well in
Huntington Beach."</TE>
<TE>   Small has won praise from community groups in Daytona Beach
despite some contentious issues. African American leaders sued the
police department over what it consider racial profiling by officers.
But the head of the local NAACP chapter was quoted in the Daytona
Beach News-Journal as praising Small for opening lines of
communication with the African American community.</TE>
<TE>   Small, 54, will be returning to his home state to head a
department with 374 employees and a budget of $40 million.</TE>
<TE>   Considered a very hands-on manager, Small said: "I don't consider
myself that special. I consider myself someone who is fortunate
enough to have a lot of good people working for me."</TE>
<TE>   Before Daytona Beach, Small worked for the Los Angeles Police
Department for 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Small and his wife, Susan, have been married 35 years. They have
three children and two grandchildren. He was born in Los Angeles and
grew up in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Small will receive a salary of $141,000 plus benefits. He will
start Oct. 14, pending a vote by the City Council on Sept. 3.</TE>

<HD>Judge Says County Hid Joplin Plans</HD>
<DH>Land use: The planning department is taken to task on
zoning and the bulldozing of sensitive land in jurist's opinion on
youth detention center suit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge this week accused Orange County's planning department of
ignoring its own zoning guidelines and hiding details about a grading
project from the public.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego County Superior Court Judge Lisa Guy-Schall's assessment
is contained in a written opinion in which she derailed the county's
proposal to expand a juvenile detention center in Trabuco Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   The county wants to build the 90-bed Rancho Potrero Leadership
Academy on property next to the existing 64-bed Joplin Youth Center.
Nearby residents sued to block the project, fearing it would increase
traffic and harm the rustic surroundings.</LD>
<TE>   Their suit claimed that the project violates zoning rules for
Trabuco Canyon and that the county illegally graded the
environmentally sensitive land.</TE>
<TE>   Guy-Schall concluded that when the grading project was approved by
the Board of Supervisors last year, nothing was mentioned about using
bulldozers to clear land.</TE>
<TE>   "No public hearing was noticed or held as to the actual scope and
nature" of the grading project, wrote Guy-Schall. In fact, the board
agenda had only a vague description of maintenance and repair
projects at Joplin and "made no mention of grading or clearing," she
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Guy-Schall said the grading was carried out "without notice and
without proper permits." It destroyed the habitat of a threatened
species without compliance with state environmental laws, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also faulted the county for bypassing the
Foothill/Trabuco Specific Plan, created by the county to review new
construction in Trabuco Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the county designated Joplin as its own special district
and declared it exempt from the specific plan committee. The judge
concluded that this strategy was "misplaced."</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the Orange County Planning and Development Services
Department said they have not analyzed the judge's ruling and would
not comment. At the Probation Department, which is spearheading the
Joplin expansion, officials said they relied on county planners and
public works officials for technical information.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in probation," said Chief Deputy Probation Officer Thomas G.
Wright. "I don't know from Shinola about engineering or about
[planning] laws. We had to rely on planning and [public works] for
those things."</TE>
<TE>   The county must complete the $18-million expansion by the end of
2003 or lose an $8.4-million state grant. Officials said Friday that
they have presented the Board of Supervisors with a list of options
as to whether the project should continue.</TE>
<TE>   Activists who sued the county over Joplin said the judge's ruling
raises larger questions.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody should have been asking questions," said Richard Gomez,
a spokesman for the Saddleback Canyons Conservancy. "It smacks of a
fundamental violation of the public trust. How are we ever going to
believe that what they tell us is the right thing?"</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Lichtman, an attorney representing canyon residents, said
he was especially concerned about the county's failure to inform
residents about the grading. Residents discovered the grading from
photos taken by a remote-controlled model airplane with a
35-millimeter camera strapped to it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was evident that [the county] slipped that in with no words to
signal what they really intended," Lichtman said. "It was a kind of
end run around the system."</TE>

<HD>Artist Going to Aid of Nomadic Tribes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It used to be so easy. Buy a camel, cow or goat and keep a nomad
wandering.</LD>
<LD>   But life has become more complicated for Leslie Clark, an Ojai
painter who set up the Nomad Foundation in 1997 to sustain the
lifestyle of some of Africa's traditional peoples.</LD>
<LD>   No longer happy to simply raise funds for livestock and paint
portraits of Saharan nomads, Clark has evolved into a one-woman aid
organization who has helped build the first school for Wodaabe nomads
in Niger and set up sewing cooperatives for nomadic women. She is
working on irrigation and medical projects for the Tuareg nomads of
West Africa.</LD>
<TE>   Clark recently bought a house in Agadez, Niger, in the Sahara
Desert, where she hopes to paint and teach nomads how to use sewing
machines. "It has water, electricity and trees," she said
enthusiastically.</TE>
<TE>   When not dealing with wandering people, Clark's mind is on
wandering animals. News has reached her that a herd of elephants is
plodding around Mali alongside Fulani and Tuareg nomadic tribesmen,
with all camping together at watering holes. Clark plans to find and
paint this harmonious interaction of man and pachyderm in March.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look all over Africa where the herds come in contact with
people, there are problems, and elephants generally lose out," Clark
said. "This herd has been coexisting with these nomads for
centuries."</TE>
<TE>   Clark, 54, spends at least three months a year with the nomads,
whose portraits she paints and sells at her Nomad Gallery in Ojai,
where she will hold a fund-raiser today.</TE>
<TE>   But after seven years of visiting Niger she has realized that the
nomadic way of life is imperiled by both too few animals and too
little education, which handicaps nomads in disputes with government
and landowners.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time there is a fight between a farmer and the nomads, the
nomads lose," Clark said. "If they can read and write French, they
can communicate with government officials."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, after a fund-raiser at her gallery, a school for the
Wodaabe tribe was funded and built around a tribal well. When she
visited Niger this year, Clark found the government had replaced the
reed hut school with a concrete one.</TE>
<TE>   "The government saw our commitment and built a school building,"
said Clark, surrounded by colorful paintings of African and Indian
nomads in her airy mountaintop home. "In all the years I've gone to
Niger, I never saw the government do that before."</TE>
<TE>   On her last visit, Wodaabe children ran to her, showing off their
counting, reading and French-speaking abilities.</TE>
<TE>   Clark wants to remedy another hardship facing the tribe of about
200,000 nomads. Each year the women travel throughout the region
selling traditional medicines, for an annual profit of less than
$100.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to use the skills they have, so we founded an embroidery
co-op," said Clark, who dresses in flowing African gowns.</TE>
<TE>   Clark hopes to sell clothes made by the women of the co-op at her
gallery and use the profits to form other cooperatives. She also
wants to provide irrigation for the Tuareg village of Tibelelik in
Niger through her "Adopt a Tuareg Village" campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The Tuareg, known as the "blue men of the desert" because their
indigo-dyed turbans stain their skins, are Muslims who herd camels
from Libya to Mauritania.</TE>
<TE>   "If they can get their gardens growing, they can have supplemental
income to get through the hard times," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, whose family has lived in Ojai for four generations, has
been painting people and landscapes in distant places for decades.</TE>
<TE>   She started out in the Mediterranean countries and moved on to
Central America, India, Mongolia, New Guinea and finally Africa.</TE>
<TE>   She met the cattle-herding Wodaabe in 1993 while traveling in
Niger, a poor, barren country in West Africa. The nomads' colorful
clothing, sense of humor and unique customs grabbed her attention.</TE>
<TE>   One such custom is the male beauty pageant, where men paint their
angular faces, bind their knees and show off their white teeth to win
over female judges.</TE>
<TE>   It was here that Clark met Peroji, who had just sold his last cow
in order to survive. He faced the prospect of leaving his traditional
nomadic life for an uncertain future in the city until Clark
intervened and gave him $200.</TE>
<TE>   "The next year [the villagers] told me the reason Peroji was still
a nomad was because of the $200," she said. "A light went off in my
head. A small amount of money could make their lives so much easier."</TE>
<TE>   Clark started the Nomad Foundation a few years later.</TE>
<TE>   For a $35 donation, a person can buy a goat for a nomadic family.
Larger donations can purchase cows, camels and donkeys. Donors get a
signed print from Clark and a certificate.</TE>
<TE>   "I have given a whole herd of goats," said Margaret Menninger of
Ojai. "Whenever someone has a birthday, I get a goat or a cow. People
want something with a long-term impact and they are always delighted.
Leslie's enthusiasm is contagious. I go to her gallery and her slide
shows and feel like I've been to Niger."</TE>
<TE>   Clark doesn't want to change nomadic culture, but hopes to provide
education should change be forced upon the tribes.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way I can stop time," she said. "If they have to make
a transition, they are at least prepared to make the transition with
pride in their traditions and culture rather than simply being
deprived of their land and ending up beggars in the city."</TE>
<TE>   In preparation for her latest fund-raiser at the gallery, Clark
has been giving slide shows and talks. Along with raising money to
buy livestock, she hopes to fund the cooperatives, teacher salaries,
a nurse and the irrigation project.</TE>
<TE>   She says she returns each year to the remotest parts of Africa
because the people and landscape offer something Western society
can't manufacture.</TE>
<TE>   "On the last trip, I went deep into the Sahara," she said. "Dunes
were rising up everywhere. It's the most powerful landscape
imaginable. You come across Neolithic sites, petroglyphs and dinosaur
bones. I have my best ideas there, the ones that transform my life.
Nothing else compares. It's living the kind of life we have lost."</TE>

<LD>A new postage stamp honoring surfing legend Duke Paoa Kahanamoku,
credited with popularizing the sport throughout the world, will be
dedicated Sunday at the Huntington Beach Pier on Pacific Coast
Highway.</LD>
<LD>   "The Duke Kahanamoku stamp reminds us of the lasting, positive
influence of a talented individual and relatively unknown hero in our
culture," said Huntington Beach Postmaster Jeanne Hannahs.</LD>
<LD>   A Honolulu native, Kahanamoku gained fame when he broke the record
for the 100-yard freestyle in the Amateur Athletic Union swim meet in
1911.</LD>
<TE>   He was also a member of the U.S. swimming team at the 1912 Olympic
Games, where he won a gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle and a
silver in the 800-meter relay. He also medaled in the 1920, '24 and
'32 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The stamp dedication is the centerpiece of a monthlong surfing
celebration sponsored by the International Surfing Museum in
Huntington Beach. The noon ceremony will be on the north side of the
pier.</TE>

<LD>A Westminster planning commissioner is back on the job a week after
being ousted at the request of a councilman who thought he was
disloyal.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought it would make things better for everybody," Councilman
Russell Paris said Thursday after persuading his colleagues to
reinstate Stephen Nevarez. "It's like Steve's never been off the
commission," Paris said. "He can go back to work."</LD>
<LD>   Paris, who had appointed Nevarez to the commission 19 months ago,
asked for his removal Aug. 14 after learning that the commissioner
planned to run for City Council in November. "I thought he was being
disloyal to me," the councilman said at the time. "To me, this is
personal."</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, however, Paris said he had changed his mind, in part
because of rumors that the ouster might be challenged legally. "I
didn't want to put the city through any additional cost," he said.
"Steve and I are friends--this way there are no hard feelings."</TE>

<HD>Wife of Santa Paula Mayor Won't Be Charged After DMV Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wife of Santa Paula's mayor will not be charged in connection
with an alleged driver's license scam uncovered by Department of
Motor Vehicles officials, prosecutors said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A 25-year employee at the DMV office in Santa Paula, Rosemarie
Mejia-Luna was accused by agency officials of selling driver's
licenses to illegal immigrants. But a six-month investigation by the
DMV was inconclusive, said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffrey Bennett.</LD>
<LD>   Acknowledging there was insufficient evidence for charges against
the drive-test examiner, Bennett said the case was returned to the
DMV. He would not elaborate on the investigation.</LD>
<TE>   A DMV spokesman declined comment on the district attorney's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Mejia-Luna has denied any wrongdoing. On Friday, her husband,
Mayor Ray Luna, said he and his wife "have moved on from that."</TE>
<TE>   "We knew all along she had done nothing wrong," he said. "She's
never done anything unethical here or anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   In February, investigators searched the Luna home to bolster their
case. Mejia-Luna was suspected in a conspiracy that involved peddling
driver's licenses for $1,000 to $1,800 each, according to court
documents. At least six times in 1999 and 2000, illegal immigrants
from Mexico were granted licenses after applying with phony documents
at various Southern California DMV offices and passing the driving
test in Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged payoffs to Mejia-Luna, the drive-test examiner in all
six cases, included $200 to $300 for each phony license, the
documents said.</TE>
<TE>   Affidavits used to obtain search warrants served at Mejia-Luna's
home and DMV workstation showed that two applicants for licenses told
DMV investigator Elva R. Godoy in December 2000 that they purchased
their licenses from two people identified as Leticia Martinez and
Carlos Salva. The documents did not state where Martinez and Salva
were based.</TE>
<TE>   According to the affidavits, Martinez and Salva arranged for
applicants to apply for licenses and take the written test at DMV
offices in Bakersfield, Hollywood and San Clemente using fake birth
certificates.</TE>

<HD>Latino Group Mixes Its Messages on Secession</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Mexican American Political Assn. officials
announce, then deny, their support of Valley cityhood plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dispute within a national Latino political group over San Fernando
Valley cityhood became public Friday, with a vice president
announcing the organization's support for secession and the president
saying no such endorsement had been made.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides said the matter would probably be settled Aug. 31 at a
meeting of the Mexican American Political Assn.'s national executive
board.</LD>
<LD>   "Until then, there is no national MAPA endorsement of Valley
secession," national President Steve Figueroa said.</LD>
<TE>   The organization's Hollywood area chapter supports Hollywood
secession, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute within the national leadership mirrors one at the
local level. A long-standing Valley chapter of MAPA voted to oppose
secession, but a new chapter is being formed in the Valley by
secession supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another example of secessionists trying to mislead the
Latino community," said Xavier Flores, vice president of the Valley
chapter that opposes secession.</TE>
<TE>   One association leader said the dispute may end up in court as the
principals consult with attorneys on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders have courted the civil rights group, which was
formed in the 1960s, because they see Latinos as a crucial voting
bloc in the November election.</TE>
<TE>   Secession supporters believe the group has sway within the Latino
community, even though the national organization appears to be in
disarray.</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa's board is one of two that have filed papers with the
California secretary of state's office to be recognized as the
national MAPA. The other group has not weighed in on the secession
issue.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the Valley and Hollywood cityhood committees put out a
notice that national Vice President Al Castaneda would announce
MAPA's endorsement of both secession proposals on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   In an appearance with secession leaders in Pacoima on Friday,
Castaneda said the national group had endorsed the secession
proposals at a recent convention after it "came to the conclusion
that the people of San Fernando [Valley] and Hollywood are ready to
stand on their own."</TE>
<TE>   But in view of the national board's upcoming meeting, he added:
"We may be forced to recall that endorsement in the short future."</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa said Valley secession has not yet been put to an official
vote of the national executive board, as required for endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   Castaneda said the Valley chapter disbanded in March 2001, but 40
people, including many secession supporters, petitioned this week to
form a new local chapter.</TE>
<TE>   Local leader Flores said the Valley chapter had not lost its
charter and that the proposed chapter does not have a legal right to
form.</TE>
<TE>   That dispute will also be taken up by the national executive
board, Figueroa said. The board could recognize the old Valley
chapter, or recognize both it and the proposed one and force the
sides to take one stand on secession.</TE>
<TE>   The confusion over whether the national association supports
secession proved an embarrassment for the Valley Independence
Committee. At the news conference in Pacoima, the committee heralded
the "historic" endorsement and said it showed that the area's Latino
elected officials are out of step in their opposition to secession.</TE>

<LD>   About 12:40 a.m., a pair of deputies spotted two of the alleged
robbers walking near 15th Street East and Avenue J-8.</LD>
<TE>   As deputies were arresting them, the third man pulled up in a car,
Sheriff's Sgt. Joe Efflandt said. When the driver pulled out a gun,
the two deputies opened fire, Efflandt said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department did not release the names of the deputies
involved in the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman, whose name was not released by authorities, was
pronounced dead at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   The two other men, who were arrested on suspicion of assault and
robbery, are David Taylor, 19, of Palmdale, and a 17-year-old whose
name was not released because he is a minor. They may also face
additional charges, including attempted murder, said Deputy Richard
Pena, a Sheriff's Department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The three suspects allegedly broke into the first home in the
43700 block of Yaffa Street intending to rob it. A male resident of
the house was shot in the shoulder by at least one of the men,
deputies said.</TE>
<TE>   Less than 30 minutes later, the three men broke into a house in
the 1200 block of Chagal Avenue, less than half a mile away,
authorities said. Efflandt said a number of shots were fired inside
the house during that robbery, but no one was initially hurt.
However, a neighbor who heard the shots and confronted the men as
they were leaving the house was shot several times, according to
Efflandt.</TE>
<TE>   Both shooting victims were taken to a local hospital and were
expected to survive, officials said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged robbers "were very brazen," Efflandt said. "You would
have thought they would have known they'd attracted attention to
themselves after the first shooting."</TE>

<HD>DWP Says Its Spending Plan Is Paying Off</HD>
<DH>Health: Continuous testing for pollutants is cited among
reasons for better water quality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is producing the
highest quality water in its century-old history, the strongest
evidence to date that the billions of dollars spent on water testing,
treatment and infrastructure improvements are paying off, department
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Improvements in water quality are the result of strict adherence
to state and federal water-quality standards as well as continuous
testing of the water supply for contaminants deemed unsafe, the
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The utility chronicled its efforts to improve and expand water
safety in its 2001 annual water-quality report, which it issued in
four geographic regions: the San Fernando Valley, central and eastern
Los Angeles, western Los Angeles and the harbor area. The document
provides a detailed description of the testing, treatment, quality
and safety of the water flowing to 3.8 million residential and
commercial customers in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   "We want everyone to know that the department has made some
extensive investments to ensure that LADWP serves high-quality
water," General Manager David Wiggs said. "We are proud that the
water supplied today is the highest quality ever provided to Los
Angeles residents."</TE>
<TE>   At a time when consumers are jittery about arsenic and chromium
contamination and terrorist attacks on facilities, the department
wants to reassure its customers it is doing all it can to ensure a
safe water supply.</TE>
<TE>   "We've evaluated the entire infrastructure of our system to
determine the risk of physical, chemical, radiological and biological
threats," said Gerald Gewe, assistant manager for water services. "As
a result, LADWP has put in place substantial improvements to
safeguard the supply from saboteurs."</TE>
<TE>   The department plans to spend $132 million during the next five
years to protect water and power buildings, reservoirs,
water-treatment plants, storage and transmission facilities and the
power system infrastructure, officials said. Additional security
guards, fencing and alarms at facilities as well as increased water
testing are among the proposed safety measures.</TE>
<TE>   As it does each year to meet water-quality standards set by the
California Department of Health Services and the federal
Environmental Protection Agency, the utility monitored its water
supply for more than 170 contaminants, DWP officials said.</TE>
<TE>   After conducting more than 196,000 tests on 24,000 samples
throughout the year, only 45 of the 170 contaminants--including
arsenic, chromium, lead, radon and copper--were detected and all were
at levels deemed safe for consumption, according to the department's
annual report.</TE>
<TE>   Sujatha Jahagirdar, safe drinking-water advocate for the
California Public Interest Research Group, a Los Angeles-based
nonprofit environmental and consumer advocacy organization, is
concerned about perchlorate, a substance found in rocket fuel that
has been detected in city water at safe levels by state and federal
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Perchlorate is an inorganic contaminant that interferes with the
thyroid's ability to use iodine to produce hormones.</TE>
<TE>   Although the report states that the levels found in the water are
lower than 4 parts per billion, Jahagirdar said the EPA is
considering a draft recommendation to reduce the level to one part
per billion. Jahagirdar said the city should follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to see the drinking-water providers in Southern
California not only meeting the technical standards, but the spirit
of the standards by providing the public with the maximum amount of
information on health effects of contaminants in their drinking
water," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the next decade, the utility will invest more than $2 billion
in infrastructure improvements, including $500 million to improve
water quality, DWP officials said.</TE>
<TE>   To protect the water supply from other forms of contamination,
department officials are in the process of closing smaller, open
reservoirs and replacing them with enclosed tanks.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we drain the reservoirs and build a circular storage
tank," Jim McDaniel, director of water quality and operations, said.
"Now you have the water protected from birds, airborne particles and
sunlight that promotes algae growth."</TE>
<TE>   In the next few years, McDaniel said, the department plans to take
the Encino and Stone Canyon reservoirs off line and retain the water
as an emergency supply. The water now drawn from those reservoirs
will be replaced by other city sources.</TE>
<TE>   The department is also in the process of replacing bronze water
meters, which typically contain 8% lead, with a meter made of mixed
metal that has a negligible lead content, McDaniel said.</TE>
<TE>   To reduce the potential long-term health risks that could be
caused by disinfection byproducts, McDaniel said the utility intends
to switch from chlorine to a chloramine--a chlorine and ammonia
mixture--to disinfect water supplies. The byproducts occur when a
disinfectant such as chlorine combines with naturally occurring
materials in the water.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of customers object to the chlorine taste in the water,"
McDaniel said. "Chloramine has much less of an odor and taste to it."</TE>
<TE>   While the utility acknowledges the taste of bottled water is
preferred by many consumers, McDaniel said the store-bought variety
and tap offer the same health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "If customers are buying bottled water because they think they
need it to protect their health, they should think about that again,"
he said. "There really is no health advantage. And at four gallons
for a penny, tap is a better buy."</TE>

<HD>Mother, Daughter Acquitted in Attack</HD>
<DH>Court: Simi Valley man whose wife and stepdaughter were
charged with trying to kill him is shocked by the jury's verdict.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County jury acquitted a woman Friday accused of trying to
kill her sleeping husband by setting him on fire, allegedly to
collect on a $1.4-million life insurance policy.</LD>
<LD>   The woman's teenage daughter, who allegedly beat her stepfather
over the head with a baseball bat during the attack, also was found
not guilty.</LD>
<LD>   Eileen and Jennifer Childs of Simi Valley were cleared of nine
charges, including arson, and set free Friday after spending four
months in jail.</LD>
<TE>   Some jurors returned to the courtroom after the verdict to hug the
two women. One juror said police conducted a shoddy investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged the pair conspired to kill Larry Childs, 57,
so they could spend insurance money to further the singing career of
19-year-old Jennifer Childs. The pair had also talked about opening a
Jiffy Lube franchise with the money, according to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "I really cannot put this feeling into words," Jennifer Childs
said, flanked by family members as she left the courtroom of Ventura
County Superior Court Judge Herbert Curtis III. "After being in jail
for four months, right now I feel I could pass out."</TE>
<TE>   The aspiring pop singer, who performs under the name Jenni Childs,
said she wrote a few songs while in jail and is eager to return to
the recording studio.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Childs, 37, who was portrayed by prosecutors as the
mastermind of the attack, said her husband was abusive and set his
own bed on fire to frame her. The verdict, she said, was an "absolute
relief."</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to hug my sons," she said, referring to 11-year-old
Jacob and 9-year-old Zachary, who also testified in the month-long
trial. A few minutes later she got her wish, as the boys were brought
into the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   The mother said she was nervous as she awaited the verdict, but
felt confident that justice would be served. Eileen Childs also was
acquitted on two counts of child endangerment and one count of grand
theft in connection with a forged insurance check.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was first arrested, I thought, this is a terrible
mistake," she said. "I knew this was not right."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Childs, reached at his Simi Valley home Friday, said he was
shocked at the jury's verdict. He said the evidence clearly indicated
that his wife and stepdaughter were trying to kill him on the morning
of March 25.</TE>
<TE>   "You depend on the system, and it doesn't seem to work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Lee, teary-eyed as she left the
courtroom, said the verdicts were "extremely disappointing ... I
can't imagine what the jury was thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Juror Ta-Lin Chen said that for her, the case was hampered by an
error-filled police investigation that resulted in "premature and
wrong assumptions. There was no solid proof of the crime."</TE>
<TE>   Saying she believed Larry Childs lied on the witness stand, she
added he "deserved an Oscar" for his performance. "I truly believe
they are innocent."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that the women tried to set fire to his bed,
and when that didn't work, they ambushed him with baseball bats,
hitting him several times over the head.</TE>
<TE>   On the witness stand, both women admitted to striking Childs, but
only in self-defense as he ran out of the bedroom in an angry frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Childs was an abusive husband and father, the women said,
and must have just "snapped."</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Childs said Friday that she believes her husband set his
own bed ablaze to frame her and her daughter, in part because he
didn't want to go through a divorce.</TE>
<TE>   The fire became a key point for jurors, who said they believed it
was set intentionally, but could not find the proof about who started
it.</TE>
<TE>   Any time there is a fire, arson should be suspected, Chen said.
But investigators didn't begin looking for a lighter that may have
been used to start the fire until months after the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a huge foul-up," she said.</TE>
<TE>   For the prosecution to base its case on such shaky evidence was
"like trying to build a house out of sand," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Other jurors said the testimony of the two Childs boys swayed
them, as did a secretly recorded videotape of a conversation between
the two women while they were in the police station hours after the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   "You would think if they didn't know they were being recorded, one
of them would have said something incriminating," said juror Sheri
Castorena. "That was a biggie."</TE>
<TE>   Acquittals in major criminal cases are fairly rare in Ventura
County.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, only two other defendants in high-profile defendants
have been cleared on all charges. Edward Nishida Drake, a Simi Valley
auto mechanic, was acquitted in 1999 on allegations that he fatally
shot a 17-year-old whom he mistook for a burglar. That same year,
Margaret Major, a Simi Valley day-care provider, was found not guilty
on child-abuse charges.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Jean Farley characterized the arrests of
Jennifer and Eileen Childs as one of the biggest miscarriages of
justice she has seen in her 30 years as an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, I think justice was done," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Bradbury, Eileen Childs' sister, said the case has taken a
major toll on the entire family. She is getting married next month,
she said, and can finally print programs because her niece, Jennifer
Childs, will be able to sing "The Lord's Prayer."</TE>
<TE>   "This has ruined our lives," Bradbury said. "I'm so happy it's
over."</TE>

<HD>Plans for Skid Row Raise Questions</HD>
<DH>Redevelopment: Some owners prepare to fix up blighted
hotels. But housing advocates worry the poor will suffer if the area
goes upscale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The renovation of a vacant square block in downtown's skid row
district has drawn praise from city officials, driven up land prices
and inspired the conversion of more than one low-income hotel to
upscale housing.</LD>
<LD>   But the success of the luxury residential project has raised
concerns about where to house low-income people who may be displaced,
and rekindled the debate about the acceptable costs of an urban
renaissance.</LD>
<LD>   While City Hall and downtown commercial interests are pushing
eagerly ahead with a $2.4-billion downtown redevelopment project,
several nonprofit groups that provide housing for the area's poor now
worry that the $150 million earmarked for low-income issues may not
be enough.</LD>
<TE>   The Skid Row Housing Trust, one of the best-known groups providing
housing downtown, is trying to buy a cluster of once-glorious
beaux-arts hotels--home to thousands of poor families and
individuals--that have suddenly become attractive to developers,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of another nonprofit, the larger SRO Housing Corp., say
they welcome the communal benefits that redevelopment will bring, but
agree the hotels should be preserved as low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   "Even a hotel that is considered a slum ... it's better than the
street," said Bud Hayes, who heads SRO Housing.</TE>
<TE>   City and redevelopment officials have said that tenants displaced
by building conversions will be relocated at public cost. Many
tenants, however, are skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   The relocation issue is the subject of a lawsuit against the city
and the Community Redevelopment Agency filed recently by some hotel
tenants and the Los Angeles Coalition to End Hunger and Homelessness,
which alleged that plans to relocate skid row residents and provide
affordable replacement housing are inadequate. The project already
has been suspended because of a legal dispute between the city and
county.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Bonar, executive director of the housing trust, said he would
approach every private investor and public official he knows, looking
for the financial backing to buy some of the large hotels.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mission is to save the housing for very low-income people,"
Bonar said.</TE>
<TE>   The 12 hotels, which have 200 to 600 rooms apiece, are scattered
around Main Street, skid row's western boundary.</TE>
<TE>   The 50 square blocks generally considered skid row are bounded by
3rd Street to the north, 7th Street to the south and Alameda Street
to the east. Many of the hotels are plagued by prostitution and
drugs. Several are under investigation by the city for possible
nuisance abatement actions.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't serve anybody's purpose," said Carol Schatz, president
of the Central City Assn., which represent downtown business
interests. "They're a problem for the LAPD and for the residents who
are moving into [nearby] lofts."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Community Redevelopment Agency said they
question housing poor families in the hotels.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an appropriate housing situation for families to be
living in a small hotel room," said Don Spivack, deputy administrator
of the agency. "There needs to be a broader solution to the housing
needs of this population."</TE>
<TE>   Housing advocates concede the situation is not ideal for families,
but they say the problem of the homeless--an estimated 3,000 to 4,000
people live on the streets and in temporary shelters--will worsen if
the buildings are not preserved as low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to buy them all," said Alice Callaghan, a longtime skid
row activist and housing trust board member. "If we lose the housing
on Main Street, there will be thousands of people for whom the city
will have to build a massive and costly shelter system."</TE>
<TE>   For nearly two decades, nonprofit housing providers have had
little competition for properties in this stretch of the city dotted
with missions and services for the poor, disabled and drug-addicted.</TE>
<TE>   The housing trust and SRO Housing gradually bought and
rehabilitated 42 rundown single-room-occupancy hotels, creating a
supply of decent housing for the very poor, many of whom pay only a
third of their monthly income--income that consists of a $220 general
relief check--in rent.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofits operate roughly 2,800 rooms, or about a third of
the total number of affordable rental units in the downtown area.</TE>
<TE>   Now they have new neighbors, like the Old Bank District, a
$37-million project that converted a block of vacant commercial
buildings on the fringes of skid row into 240 luxury lofts.</TE>
<TE>   The project, by developer Tom Gilmore, was the first completed
under a city program designed to promote downtown housing by relaxing
building requirements. The development along 4th Street at Spring and
Main streets has attracted national attention and many imitators.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, the heart of [an area that] used to be
unthinkable for developers ... now appears to be fair game," Hayes
said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's redevelopment project and successes like Gilmore's have
caused property costs in the area to skyrocket.</TE>
<TE>   The average price of a square foot has increased from $10 in the
mid-1990s to $25 to $50 today, according to David Zoraster, a
downtown real estate expert.</TE>
<TE>   Zoraster said that, for now, developers are mostly interested in
vacant office buildings with spacious interiors and high ceilings.
About 40 such buildings downtown are in various stages of
development.</TE>
<TE>   But Gilmore and another hotel owner have announced plans to
convert hotels into market-rate housing.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore said he would convert the El Dorado Hotel, which is near
the Old Bank District, into condominiums within two years. He bought
the hotel two years ago after it was shut down for health and safety
code violations.</TE>
<TE>   Hotelier Robert Frontiera recently announced plans to convert his
crime-ridden Frontier Hotel on West 5th Street, near Main Street,
into an apartment building. He said he would remodel the hotel one
story at a time, beginning with the top floor. Frontiera said he was
applying for building permits to turn the 43 rooms there into 13
loft-style apartments, which would rent at market rate, about $1,200,
and less.</TE>
<TE>   "The area's changing, and we wanted to try it," Frontiera said.</TE>
<TE>   City and business leaders say they don't want poor residents to be
crowded out of the area. But they insist that downtown should be
populated by residents from all walks of life.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have that mix of high-end, mid-level and low-income
housing ... to make for a vibrant downtown," Schatz said. "You have
to be able to house janitors, secretaries and CEOs."</TE>

<HD>MTA Combats Fraud by Workers</HD>
<DH>Finance: District attorney's unit joins the transit agency
in rooting out false injury claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with skyrocketing workers' compensation costs, Los Angeles'
transit agency has joined with county prosecutors to launch a program
aimed at deterring employees from making false claims and urging them
to turn in colleagues who fake injuries.</LD>
<LD>   For the last two weeks, Tom Higgins, head of the district
attorney's workers' compensation fraud bureau, has been visiting work
sites at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which has 9,000
employees.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing large groups of workers, Higgins warns of harsh legal
consequences for those lining their pockets by faking on-the-job
injuries.</LD>
<TE>   He notes that scofflaws are sitting at home collecting paychecks
while hard-working drivers and maintenance workers are on the job.
And he appeals to law-abiding workers to turn in colleagues who don't
play by the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to treat these MTA cases no different than any I've
worked in my career," said Higgins, a veteran deputy district
attorney who prosecuted murderers, rapists and other hard-core
offenders before taking over the fraud unit in October.</TE>
<TE>   "What I do first and foremost is prosecute ... and generally win."</TE>
<TE>   The tough talk is needed at the MTA, officials say, because the
agency's workers' compensation plan is in crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, costs have doubled, standing now at $60 million a
year. According to the MTA, it now spends roughly $6,500 per employee
every year to pay for workers' compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Those costs are the highest in the nation for big-city transit
agencies--about six times as much per worker as is paid by the
similar-sized Washington, D.C., bus and rail system and nearly 10
times what New York pays.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA estimates it spends about twice as much per worker as most
other California transit agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the transit agency say the costs affect long-term
planning, as well as the daily operations of buses and trains.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 10% of the hourly cost of running a bus goes toward paying
workers' compensation costs, for example.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just got to get the costs in line and reasonable," said
Richard Brumbaugh, the MTA's chief financial officer. "It's a huge
issue for us."</TE>
<TE>   Brumbaugh added that most claims are legitimate and that the
agency's high costs are partly due to a confluence of
factors--including statewide insurance deregulation, rising medical
costs and legislation that favors workers.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the partnership with the district attorney's office is
aimed at knocking out claims that the agency believes are fake.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA earlier this year dropped the private insurance company
that had monitored its workers' compensation cases for years.</TE>
<TE>   Agency officials brought the program in-house because they were
concerned that the insurance company was not aggressive enough in
fighting suspect claims. MTA workers filed about 6,000 claims over
the last four years; of those, just 16 were referred by the insurance
company to the district attorney's office as possibly fraudulent.</TE>
<TE>   Officials believe the MTA will significantly increase the
referrals for possible prosecution under the new partnership. MTA
managers have recently started meeting nearly once a week to review
claims.</TE>
<TE>   If red flags are raised, the agency and the district attorney are
poised to begin spying on workers with video cameras on and off the
job--looking for the supposedly injured worker who is out playing
softball or lifting weights.</TE>
<TE>   The weekly meetings, according to Brumbaugh, already have turned
up a number of questionable cases.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is a bus driver with nearly 100 claims over the last
five years and another who filed 59 claims in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Citing one example without identifying the employee, Brumbaugh
said: "In September of 2001, she had a sharp pain in the shoulder
from turning the wheel. In May of 2001, she sprains a right ankle
getting off the bus. In April 2001, she runs over a pothole.... All
told, she got paid $230,000."</TE>
<TE>   Higgins said he is convinced that if he educates workers--telling
them how to use workers' compensation properly and what fraud is and
urging them to call his unit if they know someone who is taking
advantage of the system--he can help reduce misuse of the system.</TE>
<TE>   MTA workers who break the law "think nobody is paying attention,
and that they can slip under the radar," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "These sorts of people, I think--we can really stop them from
doing wrong if we can convince them we are out there."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA professor Daniel Mitchell, a business and public policy
expert, said public agencies and private businesses in California
have been grappling for years to rein in workers' compensation costs.</TE>
<TE>   He said that relaxed California laws allowing workers time off
with pay for such things as psychological stress, coupled with holes
in health insurance coverage, sometimes can entice workers to take
advantage of the system.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell also said some workers, unhappy with the way they are
treated by management, use workers' compensation as a "grievance
mechanism."</TE>
<TE>   Focusing on that issue, Higgins used one of his recent lectures to
MTA workers at the Carson bus division to emphasize that he is not
interested in fielding complaints about management.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to a group of about 100 workers, Higgins spelled out the
types of fraud he sees and gave the drivers, mechanics and janitors a
number to call if they knew of people engaged in such abuses.</TE>
<TE>   When he finished, a number of workers approached Higgins. One of
them, a longtime driver who did not want to be identified, said he
did not think many people would turn in their fellow employees.</TE>
<TE>   "If word gets out, you could get beat up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But another man, an MTA custodian, said he believed some workers
would welcome the chance to crack down on fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tired of seeing people rip off the system, stay at home and
collect a check when they're fine," he said. "They end up ripping me
off, the way I see it."</TE>

<HD>Bush Urges Opportunity for Latinos</HD>
<DH>Education: During his California political swing, he visits
heavily ethnic Santa Ana to press schooling--as well as standards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI and JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his first visit to Orange County since taking office, President
Bush swept through Santa Ana on Friday to call for more education
opportunities for Latino children before heading to a political
fund-raiser at a posh Dana Point hotel.</LD>
<LD>   The visit was part of a quick tour of California during which the
president quietly campaigned for GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill
Simon Jr. But in Santa Ana, the site of his only public appearance
during the Orange County visit, the president met with community
leaders before delivering a 30-minute speech to about 500 invited
guests at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art.</LD>
<LD>   On a stage adorned with a banner declaring "Bienvenido Presidente
Bush," the president reached out to Latinos by touting education as
the road to success for disadvantaged minorities.</LD>
<TE>   In this most Latino of America's large cities, where public school
enrollment is more than 90% Latino, the president took the
opportunity to tout the "No Child Left Behind Act," a key component
of his education agenda that became law this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Some believe certain children can't learn," Bush said to a
receptive crowd. "I don't believe that.... I want to make sure we
challenge a system that sometimes has got standards so low, it's what
I call the soft bigotry of low expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Immigrant children who come from non-English-speaking families,
and urban African American children, are the victims of such low
expectations, he said. To raise achievement, they must be held to
high standards and be provided funds.</TE>
<TE>   "We must recognize the facts," he said. "Too many of our Latino
children are not learning to read early enough.... I don't care for
the fact that a lot of the youngsters, the Latino youngsters, don't
go to college. It's not a good statistic for America."</TE>
<TE>   The president also took the opportunity to promote his homeland
security agenda as the nation approaches the first anniversary of the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still cold-blooded killers out there that would like to
hurt America," Bush said. "The best way for us to secure our homeland
... is to chase these killers down, one person at a time, and bring
them to justice."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd exploded into applause.</TE>
<TE>   Although the president had not visited Orange County, heartland of
California's Republican Party, since his election, it is familiar
territory for Bush. He spoke of education reform and took questions
from Santa Ana High School students two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "When he came onto the stage, he recognized it wasn't an
all-Republican crowd," said Edward Hernandez Jr., chancellor of the
Rancho Santiago Community College District and one of two dozen
activists granted private time with the president. "He said it's
about everyone working together to make the country a better place."</TE>
<TE>   There's another reason Orange County's de facto downtown was
attractive for a presidential appearance, said Fred Smoller, a
political scientist at Chapman University in Orange: The Latino
business and community leaders chosen to attend Friday's
meet-and-greet are more likely to be sympathetic to Bush than their
more liberal counterparts elsewhere in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, courting the Latino vote is something Bush does
effectively, and he ultimately has dreams of doing better in
California than the last time," said Smoller.</TE>
<TE>   Absent from the president's speech was any reference to Simon.
After the Santa Ana visit, the president headed to a
$1,000-per-person fund-raiser for the gubernatorial candidate at the
St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort and Spa in Dana Point.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana police blocked portions of Main Street near the museum
for several hours Friday, snarling downtown traffic. The appearance
drew a small flock of demonstrators, some holding antiwar placards
and others taking issue with the president's support of Simon.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the theme of education, some of the guests inside
were parents, administrators and students from local schools.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something I'll be able to tell my grandchildren," said
Carly Menkine, 16, a junior at the Orange County High School of the
Arts. With 17 of her schoolmates, Menkine sang the national anthem
before the president's entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Also waiting for a glimpse of Bush was Cynthia Criollos and her
family, including sons Trevor, 8, and Cole, 6, who are students at El
Sol Science and Arts Academy of Santa Ana, a charter school. The two
boys hoped to present the president with a placard and pen to thank
him for his support of charter schools. They got their wish after the
president delivered his speech.</TE>
<TE>   "We were dumbfounded," Criollos said after the event. "We didn't
know what to say. We were just so proud for the boys to see our kids
conversing with the president of the United States. I still have
goose bumps."</TE>
<TE>   Some of their schoolmates were not as lucky.</TE>
<TE>   Because of last-minute safety concerns, a group of 100 El Sol
students who were scheduled to greet the presidential motorcade as it
entered Santa Ana were told they could not attend.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents were understandably disappointed," said Jenny Doh, an
El Sol parent and the school's spokeswoman. "A lot of our kids got
all dressed up.... But they are still excited the president came to
Santa Ana."</TE>

<HD>Bush's Message to Santa Ana</HD>

more liberal counterparts elsewhere in the state. "Clearly, courting
the Latino vote is something Bush does effectively, and he ultimately
has dreams of doing better in California than the last time," said
Smoller.</TE>
<TE>   Absent from the president's speech was any reference to Simon.</TE>
<TE>   After the Santa Ana visit, the president headed to a
$1,000-per-person fund-raiser for the gubernatorial candidate at the
St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort and Spa in Dana Point.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana police blocked portions of Main Street near the museum
for several hours Friday, snarling downtown traffic. The appearance
drew a small flock of demonstrators, some holding antiwar placards
and others taking issue with the president's support of Simon.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the theme of education, some of the guests inside
were parents, administrators and students from local schools.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something I'll be able to tell my grandchildren," said
Carly Menkine, 16, a junior at the Orange County High School of the
Arts. With 17 of her schoolmates, Menkine sang the national anthem
before the president's entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Also waiting for a glimpse of Bush was Cynthia Criollos and her
family, including sons Trevor, 8, and Cole, 6, who are students at El
Sol Science and Arts Academy of Santa Ana, a charter school. The two
boys hoped to present the president with a placard and pen to thank
him for his support of charter schools. They got their wish after the
president delivered his speech.</TE>
<TE>   "We were dumbfounded," Criollos said after the event. "We didn't
know what to say. We were just so proud for the boys to see our kids
conversing with the president of the United States. I still have
goose bumps."</TE>
<TE>   Some of their schoolmates were not as lucky. Because of
last-minute safety concerns, a group of 100 El Sol students who were
scheduled to greet the presidential motorcade as it entered Santa Ana
were told by the event organizers that they could not attend.</TE>

<HD>Border Culture's Complicity With Smugglers Put to Challenge</HD>
<DH>Immigration: U.S. agency begins effort to change the
perception of migrant trafficking. But tolerance remains widespread
in Mexico.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>They are the most callous, most violent, most dangerous men in the
lucrative world of migrant trafficking. That's what the U.S. Border
Patrol said when it released the names and photos of eight men on its
first most-wanted list of migrant smugglers.</LD>
<LD>   The men run vast networks that not only sneak thousands of
immigrants across the border from Mexico, but also are responsible
for the growth in the number of immigrants who are led astray,
sometimes to their deaths, in the desert, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not immigration we're focusing on, it's the deaths," said
Raleigh Leonard, a spokesman for the Border Patrol's San Diego
sector. "We figure that if we could put these guys out of action, we
won't have to issue 300 body bags, like we did last year."</LD>
<TE>   Creation of the most-wanted list was meant to do more than aid in
the smugglers' capture. It was the first step in a public relations
blitz to challenge the tolerance with which Mexicans have long viewed
so-called coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   Border Patrol agents say they are tired of being painted as the
bad guys in the border drama. Agents are tired of rescuing half-dead
immigrants who have entrusted themselves to smugglers, tired of
finding bodies in the desert, and tired, they say, of seeing most
Mexicans embrace the culprits.</TE>
<TE>   The most-wanted list is a challenge to the reputations, to the
honor, of figures who have not only eluded the law but have been
seemingly immune to public censure. The Border Patrol dreams of the
day when Mexicans will turn hostile at the sight of one of the wanted
coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   "In the two different countries, the perceptions of these guys are
entirely different," Leonard said. "We want these guys to walk down
the streets in Mexico and have [people] say, 'Hey, look, there goes a
criminal.'</TE>
<TE>   "Far too often, people point the finger at border policy. We're
not to blame, and we're going to change that perception. It may take
five or six years, but we're going to change it."</TE>
<TE>   But as long as U.S. border agents stop the desperate from crossing
illegally and coyotes help the migrants do it, the attitudes will not
change, advocates of immigration reform say.</TE>
<TE>   Coyotes have an entrenched place in the mythology of border
culture. At worst, they seem to be viewed as a necessary evil. At
best, they are romanticized as Mexican Harriet Tubmans, guiding the
downtrodden northward to prosperity and freedom.</TE>
<TE>   When the most-wanted list ran in Tijuana newspapers, it was
translated as "los mas buscados," or "the most sought after." It is a
phrase that neatly sums up the ambiguity many people in Mexico feel
for the people smugglers. As any migrant about to slip over the
border will say, a successful coyote is, of course, in high demand.
And what better measure of success than making the most-wanted list
in the U.S.?</TE>
<TE>   "There are coyotes who are legends, whose deeds are the subject of
folk songs and stories," said Victor Clark Alfaro of the Binational
Center for Human Rights and a longtime immigration activist.</TE>
<TE>   Three smugglers are credited with guiding half the town of San
Martin Hidalgo in Jalisco state to the San Luis Obispo area.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks to them, thousands of migrants have arrived successfully
in the United States," said Clark, who has an extensive acquaintance
among coyotes. "Someone's little grandmother made it safely, or their
husband, or their whole family, and people are grateful."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, U.S. investigators announced that they had
taken a bite out of the smuggling profession by arresting a dozen
people who ran the largest Latin American child-smuggling ring that
investigators had ever encountered. But officials acknowledged that
the deep dependence of parents on coyotes for family reunification
remains a barrier to cracking down on the smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   The nicknames people give the smugglers also illustrate the
dichotomous world they inhabit. One of the eight, Silvestre Rivera,
is popularly called "Rambo." Is he the violent miscreant who flouts
the law, or the defender of just causes, merely misunderstood by the
authorities?</TE>
<TE>   Rivera's partner, Alfonso Zapien Carillo, is called "Chivero,"
meaning "goat herder." Is he the kind shepherd leading his flock to
greener pastures, or the mercenary directing his charges to
slaughter?</TE>
<TE>   The best measure of the border culture's complicity with the
smugglers can be found near Tijuana's red-light district, the Zona
Norte, where Zapien operates out of the Hotel Guadiana, coordinating
the recruiting of migrants. Two police officers stand at a nearby
corner, chatting. Here, Zapien plots the movement of clients from
south and central Mexico, their transportation to the hotel and then
across the border to safe houses, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Far from being romantic figures, Zapien and Rivera have often
endangered the lives of migrants in their care, U.S. officials said.
The arrest of Zapien or another of the eight most wanted would have
"an immediate and significant" effect--reducing the perils faced by
immigrants, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. once had Zapien. Caught smuggling migrants in San Diego
in 1999, he and several co-defendants pleaded guilty to several
smuggling-related charges. But he jumped bail before sentencing. With
their investigation of Zapien's activities expanding, U.S. officials
believe that they could send the smuggler to prison for many years.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. cannot simply go and capture Zapien in Tijuana. Before
U.S. agents would even attempt extradition--which would require reams
of documentation--they want to complete their investigation of the
smugglers' operation, U.S. officials said. They want to do nothing to
interrupt their work.</TE>
<TE>   So Zapien works away in the hotel courtyard, undisturbed.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course we know where he is," said the Border Patrol's Leonard.
"All I can say is that we're working closely with people on both
sides of the border, trying to place these criminals behind bars."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. should not expect overwhelming support from the Mexican
people.</TE>
<TE>   At a migrant shelter for women and children in Tijuana, Claudia
Martinez and her husband, Israel, cuddle their 7-month-old baby while
planning their trip to Vista in northern San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a smuggler took her and 17 others through the desert
east of San Diego. For three weeks, they were lost, with little food
and water.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her ordeal, Martinez insists it is not fair to call all
smugglers bad. A few are heroes, she said. Of Zapien, she said only:
"Well, if the Border Patrol wants him, he must be good."</TE>
<TE>   Next door at the Casa del Migrante, everyone is making plans.
Slightly more than half the men will soon head across the border,
while the rest, who already have been caught by U.S. officials and
deported, consider trying again.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knows who the good [coyotes] are," said Father Luiz
Kendziereski, who runs the shelter.</TE>
<TE>   "The increased vigilance at the border has created this demand, so
a good [smuggler] will have a good reputation. It travels by word of
mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Clark, of the binational rights center, defends the integrity of
many coyotes but acknowledges that there are bad ones.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seen the majority do their job with
responsibility--although it sounds strange to say it," he said. "They
are experts on the border region, experts at guiding people safely."</TE>
<TE>   Clark said he believes that an older generation of smugglers, many
now in their 40s and 50s, provides the best and safest transit for
their clients. A new generation of brash young men in their 20s,
including some drug addicts, has led people astray and caused most of
the problems, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Far from the pseudo-travel agents of yesteryear, who offered
package deals for cars and hotel rooms, these younger smugglers see
migrants purely as merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA professor Abel Valenzuela has surveyed day laborers at 50
sites throughout Los Angeles, most of whom crossed the border
illegally. Virtually all used coyotes, Valenzuela said, and in all
his 250 interviews he heard no complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they saw the smugglers as criminals, but many don't
even see themselves as criminal" for crossing the border illegally,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with benevolent Mexican attitudes toward the smugglers, U.S.
immigration officials said they are making progress.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working very closely with the Mexican government on
migrant-trafficking cases, and we have an outstanding relationship
with Mexico currently," said Scott Hatfield, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service officer in charge, based in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfield declined to discuss the details of Zapien's case, except
to say the smuggler is of "strong interest" to officials.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Hotel Guadiana, Zapien--lithe and dark, with thick
black hair--is talking on the phone in the courtyard when a reporter
and photographer approach. His eyes snap to menacing attention at the
sight of unexpected visitors. As a reporter begins to ask questions,
he stops talking and hangs up. Several men come out onto the balcony
above the courtyard to peer down silently.</TE>
<TE>   A hotel employee at the entrance said: "You cannot ask any
questions here, and you cannot take any photographs here. What you do
on public property is fine, but not here."</TE>
<TE>   Zapien stares but does not speak, his business interrupted. For a
moment.</TE>
<TE>   Do not ask him questions; he does not want to talk, the hotel
guard said firmly. And with a smile that never reaches his eyes, he
gives a final piece of advice: "You should go," he said. "You should
go now."</TE>

<KH>Q &amp; A WITH JACK KRAMER</KH>
<HD>Looking at Men's Game, U.S. Class Is Half Full</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earlier this summer, the U.S. men had their worst showing at
Wimbledon since the Open era began in 1968. With stars such as Pete
Sampras and Andre Agassi growing older, questions have arisen about
the future of men's tennis in this country.</LD>
<LD>   The legendary Jack Kramer, 81, says that although the junior ranks
are replete with talent, there is a sense of urgency about producing
a new generation of champions.</LD>
<LD>   After winning Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships in the amateur
era, Kramer helped bring order to the fledgling professional tour and
later became the first executive director of the ATP. A fixture on
the Southern California scene, he serves as patriarch of the local
men's tournament, the Mercedes-Benz Cup.</LD>
<TE>   With the U.S. Open starting Monday in New York, Kramer offered his
thoughts on American tennis.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Is the state of the men's game as discouraging as it
appeared during Wimbledon?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Let's face it, outside of Andy Roddick and now James
Blake, we haven't had too many players since 1987, when Sampras and
Agassi and Todd Martin and Michael Chang all came out at once. We
haven't done anything big time. In the meantime, our girls have come
around great. You have to wonder why the girls are in the top five
and the boys aren't.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you think the USTA should address this gap?</TE>
<TE>   A: I wish I knew. It's probably a matter of getting the top kids
when they are 12 and 13 and working with them to be sure they don't
have bad grips and bad swings. If you have a bad second serve or some
outlandish grips, like Jan-Michael Gambill does, you're not going to
make it. The other thing is, the top kids get an international
[junior] ranking and they want to protect that ranking, so they don't
want to play each other. They duck the competition at home.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The association recently announced it would establish a youth
training center at the new sports complex under construction in
Carson. Might that help?</TE>
<TE>   A: The question is, who's going to be in charge? And are they
going to get the top kids to knock heads? Sampras is rumored to be
putting in a tennis camp there and that could be helpful. They could
get Vic Braden [noted tennis instructor and researcher]--you give him
some good kids to work with and he'll produce a champion.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Among the new generation of U.S. players, who has the best
chance of reaching the top?</TE>
<TE>   A: Roddick has tremendous ability, but he hasn't quite acquired
the knowledge. He wants to hit three or four boomers from the
baseline. Tactically, he's not taking advantage of his serve to get a
short ball and come in and have a good volley game. He's got the
strength of serve and the forehand to close the game off at the net.
When he learns that, he can make up very quickly what we are losing
with Agassi and Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So, even with the recent success of backcourt players, you
believe the serve-and-volley game remains viable?</TE>
<TE>   A: Sure, as long as Wimbledon is the goal. Wimbledon and the
hard-court circuit and indoors. We all try to prepare a surface that
is fair to the serve-and-volley player but still gives the defensive
and backcourt player a chance to run the ball down. If you're trying
to win the French Open, you've got to play three or four feet behind
the baseline. But if you want to win Wimbledon and indoors, you've
got to stand on the baseline and be ready to attack.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you think of the overall health of the men's game? Do
you agree with critics who say it is lacking a dominant star
presence, such as a Bjorn Borg, a John McEnroe or an Ivan Lendl?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think maybe we don't realize the depth of how many good
players we have. That's why we're having all these upsets. Guys are
playing great from Argentina and you don't even know their names.
Spain and Brazil are producing great players. And I don't think
Agassi or Sampras are over the hill by any means.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Next summer, the ATP schedule has put your Los Angeles event
head-to-head against the tournament in Washington. Your defending
champion, Agassi, is reportedly leaning toward playing on the East
Coast. Is that a problem?</TE>
<TE>   A: Unfortunately, that's what the schedule looks like. That makes
it very difficult because my great friend, Donald Dell, works like
the devil making money for the Washington tennis patrons. But the
game is strong enough that we'll have a great field, and it will be
mainly European and South American. I think [Marat] Safin wants to
come back. [Yevgeny] Kafelnikov has never been out here, but he has
expressed interest. There's room in tennis to have two events.</TE>

<LD>Barry Zito has a carefully planned pregame routine, and nothing
messes it up more than a rain delay.</LD>
<LD>   Friday night, though, it didn't seem to bother him.</LD>
<LD>   Zito waited out a delay of 2 hours 26 minutes at Detroit, then
pitched seven shutout innings as the Oakland Athletics beat the
Tigers, 9-1, for their 10th consecutive win.</LD>
<TE>   "It is tough, but as long as I can get 30 minutes, I'll be OK," he
said. "I usually take 50, but you can't ask for that on a night where
it is raining."</TE>
<TE>   The victory moved the Athletics into sole possession of first
place in the AL West, breaking a tie with Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "That feels good," said Manager Art Howe. "These guys have worked
really hard to get here."</TE>
<TE>   Starting pitchers have won every game for Oakland during its
streak. The last team to win 10 straight games, all by starting
pitchers, was Baltimore from Aug. 29-Sept. 7, 1974.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm barely old enough to remember that," said Howe with a smile.
"But that shows you how impressive this has been. And I don't see any
reason that it wouldn't continue."</TE>
<TE>   Zito (18-5) gave up four hits and two walks and struck out five.
He moved into the American League lead in wins.</TE>
<TE>   "That's great, I guess," Zito said. "But mainly, that just means
I'm getting run support. It won't help me win my next start."</TE>
<TE>   John Mabry homered twice for the second time in his career, both
against Detroit. The first came on April 28, 1999, with Seattle.
Mabry had started only one of Oakland's previous 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 4, Seattle 2--Josh Bard capped his major league debut
with a game-winning, two-run homer with one out in the bottom of the
ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Bard, recalled from triple-A Buffalo earlier in the day when
catcher Einar Diaz went on the 15-day disabled list, hit a towering
shot to right off James Baldwin (7-10) to help the Indians end a
five-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle fell one game behind Oakland in the AL West, the Mariners'
biggest deficit since April 9 when they also trailed the Athletics by
a game.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin, making only his second relief appearance since June 9,
2001, walked Greg LaRocca on four pitches with one out in the ninth.
He then went to 3-1 before Bard, who had his first hit in the fifth,
connected for his homer.</TE>
<TE>   As he rounded first base, Bard jumped and pumped his fist as the
Indians came out of the dugout to meet him.</TE>
<TE>   The teams were scoreless after six innings when rain moved into
Jacobs Field and caused a rain delay of 2 hours 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 6, New York 2--Chan Ho Park (5-6), activated from the
disabled list earlier in the day, gave up seven hits in six innings,
and the Rangers hit four homers, including two by Rafael Palmeiro, at
Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander left his last start on Aug. 6 after only three
innings with a blister and was put on the 15-day disabled list the
next day.</TE>
<TE>   Park, pitching like the No. 1 starter the Rangers had hoped he
would be when they signed the former Dodger to a $65-million,
five-year free agent contract in the off-season, struck out six while
walking only one.</TE>
<TE>   Texas has 177 homers this season, second in the majors to the
Yankees' 188.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 9, Kansas City 2--Cristian Guzman extended his hitting
streak to 21 games and A.J. Pierzynski drove in three runs to lead
the Twins at Kansas City. The AL Central leaders have won five of
six.</TE>
<TE>   Guzman had two hits in four at-bats and scored twice. He has the
longest current hitting streak in the majors and the Twins' best
since Shane Mack hit in 22 straight in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Reed (12-6), given a 5-0 lead after two innings, won for the
sixth time in seven decisions. He gave up six hits and one earned run
in seven innings. He struck out five and didn't walk anyone--the 14th
time in 26 starts he hasn't walked a batter.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 8, Chicago 2--Tanyon Sturtze took a shutout into the
ninth inning at Comiskey Park as he won consecutive starts for the
first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Toby Hall homered and drove in three runs for the Devil Rays, who
ended a three-game losing streak. The White Sox lost for the seventh
time in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Sturtze (3-13) took an 8-0 lead into the ninth before giving up
homers in succession to Jeff Liefer and Joe Crede to lead off the
inning. Sturtze pitched an 11-hitter for the third complete game of
his career, walking one and striking out six.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 11, Toronto 7--The victory at Camden Yards put the
Orioles at .500 (63-63) for the first time since May 11.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Gibbons hit the first of four home runs as the Orioles rallied
from a six-run deficit to win their fourth in a row and match their
2001 victory total. Geronimo Gil, Melvin Mora and Tony Batista also
homered for the Orioles.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Phelps homered and drove in four runs for the Blue Jays.</TE>

<HD>Angels Unable to Break Their Fall</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They are beaten by Red Sox, 4-1, for third loss
in four games. Boston close to passing them in wild-card race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Angels lost to Pedro Martinez, and so what? Everyone loses to
Pedro Martinez. As one game out of 162, no big deal.</LD>
<LD>   As the third loss in four games, on a trip in which a playoff
berth appears to be an increasingly distant goal, defeat can be a big
deal indeed. It is disturbing enough that the Oakland Athletics and
Seattle Mariners have jumped ahead of the Angels in the American
League West standings this week.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to Martinez and his 4-1 victory Friday, his Boston Red Sox
are close enough to the Angels in the wild-card standings that the
Sox could jump ahead of the Angels by Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   There is a sense of urgency about the series, at least for the
home team. While Boston Manager Grady Little said that "everyone
knows what's at stake in a series like this," the Angels pretty much
stuck to the season-long mantra that no one game is more important
than the next, that they need to win no matter who the opponent is.</TE>
<TE>   But, said second baseman Adam Kennedy: "When we're struggling like
this, you've got to try to stay afloat, stay around the top and stay
within reach to make a run in September. We don't want to get four or
five games back."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are in third place in the division, two games behind
the A's, winners of 10 consecutive games. The Red Sox crept within 1
1/2 games of the Angels in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   This one was not pretty, except for the artistry of Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Angel ace Jarrod Washburn gave up a season-high 11 hits, including
one broken-bat single on which he barely dodged the broken bat.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy let a pop fly drop, he said, because he believed the voice
yelling "I got it" belonged to right fielder Orlando Palmeiro.
Actually, in cozy Fenway Park, the voice was that of a fan. Palmeiro
retrieved the ball and forced a runner at second base.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny now, because the run didn't score," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez dominated the Angels, again. In two starts against the
Angels this year, he is 2-0 with a 0.56 earned-run average, with one
walk and 16 strikeouts in 16 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing against the Angels, mind you. Martinez has the best record
and the best ERA in the league, at 17-3 and 2.15. In his last 39
innings at Fenway, he has given up one earned run, a home run by Troy
Glaus in the seventh inning Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But knuckleballer Tim Wakefield pitches today, an unpleasant
prospect for the Angels at any time and particularly at a time Tim
Salmon is on the disabled list. Wakefield followed Martinez in
Anaheim too, and the Angels lost both games without scoring off
either starter.</TE>
<TE>   To replace Salmon in the No. 3 spot, Angel Manager Mike Scioscia
has employed a platoon of Palmeiro and first baseman Scott Spiezio.
The No. 3 spot traditionally is filled by the best hitter on the
team, but Scioscia isn't sure that bumping Garret Anderson up from
the cleanup spot would necessarily jump-start the offense.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that part of the lineup is where the breakdown is,"
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are 10-3 with Palmeiro batting third, 3-2 with Spiezio
hitting third. But aside from the 11th inning Wednesday, when the
Angels scored four runs, they are two for 24 with men in scoring
position over the last 36 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio is hitting a team-high .327 with men in scoring position
this season, and Palmeiro is at .283, but catcher Bengie Molina is at
.255, Kennedy is at .232 and designated hitter Brad Fullmer is at
.210.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn (15-5) lost successive starts for the first time this
season, but he saved himself from a dangerous flying object, and for
that the Angels are grateful. In the sixth inning, as Rickey
Henderson got a bloop single, Washburn fell onto his rear end dodging
a jagged half of a broken bat.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>With outfielder Tim Salmon and pitcher Aaron Sele on the disabled
list, Angel fans might wish their team had been the one to trade for
slugger Cliff Floyd, as the Red Sox did, or pitcher Jeff Weaver, as
the Yankees did. Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman does not have
the budget that would allow such a trade, and even if he did he would
be reluctant to surrender the top prospects necessary to do so.</LD>
<LD>   But, with depth suddenly a critical issue for the Angels, the
Stoneman regime has proven adept at identifying useful players and
acquiring them at virtually no cost, in deals that attract little
notice. The shining example, of course, is shortstop David Eckstein,
claimed off waivers from Boston on the recommendation of several
scouts.</LD>
<LD>   But outfielder Alex Ochoa, indispensable with the injury to
Salmon, came from Milwaukee in a July trade for backup catcher Jorge
Fabregas. Mickey Callaway, who will replace Sele in the starting
rotation, came from Tampa Bay in a winter trade for minor league
shortstop Wilmy Caceres. Infielder Chone Figgins, promoted to fill
Salmon's roster spot, came from Colorado last year, in a minor league
trade for journeyman outfielder Kimera Bartee.</LD>
<TE>   Stoneman credited his scouts and coaches for flourishing in an
atmosphere where they can recommend the pursuit of any player, no
matter how few tools he might possess or how low he might have been
drafted. Stoneman cited the example of bullpen mainstay Ben Weber,
who had played in an independent league and in Taiwan before the
Angels claimed him off waivers from San Francisco, on the
recommendation of coach Ron Roenicke.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to have guys who have that much interest, passion and
good judgment about people," Stoneman said. "We're not going to rule
out a guy because he's not a household name or not making $2 million.
Talent is what we're looking for, not reputation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even if Sele can strengthen the partially torn rotator cuff in his
shoulder enough to return within three weeks, the Angels are
considering using their top starters on three days' rest during the
last one or two weeks of the season. The Angels play 10 of their last
13 games against Seattle and Oakland, the two teams ahead of them in
the American League West.... Salmon received a third opinion on his
slow-to-heal left hand; an orthopedic specialist affiliated with the
Red Sox confirmed the diagnosis of a deep bruise and administered a
cortisone injection to combat inflammation.... Scott Schoeneweis, the
Angel player representative, said the players would not delay their
strike date past next Friday, no matter how close to an agreement the
two sides might be by then. "That's the only thing I know 100%--if
there isn't a deal done, there will be a strike," he said.</TE>

<HD>Oswalt Draws Five-Game Suspension</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Houston starter Roy Oswalt was suspended for five games Friday for
throwing a pitch that hit Chicago's Alex Gonzalez on Aug. 12.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Watson, baseball's vice president in charge of discipline,
said Oswalt intentionally threw at Gonzalez after Oswalt had been
given a warning by umpires.</LD>
<LD>   Oswalt, who also was fined, was to start serving the suspension
today. If the Players' Assn. appeals, the penalty would be delayed
until after a hearing before Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating
officer.</LD>
<TE>   During the game at Wrigley Field, Oswalt hit Fred McGriff with a
pitch in the second inning, then hit Gonzalez in the back with a
pitch in the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   Oswalt (16-6) defeated the Cubs on Thursday night in Houston,
improving to 5-0 with a 1.47 earned-run average in August.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fred Wilpon completed his buyout of New York Met co-owner Nelson
Doubleday, ending their acrimonious partnership after 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   Wilpon sued Doubleday in July, trying to force a buyout at the
price set by an appraiser. Doubleday countered with accusations of
misconduct between Commissioner Bud Selig and the appraiser. The
sides settled last week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Major league baseball will offer video coverage of an entire game
on the Internet for the first time Monday, showing the Texas Rangers'
game against the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   The game will be available at www.mlb.com for free, baseball said
Friday, but the Internet coverage can't be accessed in the home
television markets of the teams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Indians put catcher Einar Diaz, injured when he got
stepped on by Oakland's David Justice on a play at the plate during
Thursday night's 9-3 loss, on the 15-day disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz got hurt in the second inning when he tried to tag Justice,
who accidentally stepped on Diaz's right hand, then sent him
sprawling as he ran across the plate. The Indians said Diaz has a
strained right elbow and strained triceps. He also had three spike
marks on his hand.</TE>

<HD>Fonoimoana Makes Motivational Tale</HD>
<DH>Beach volleyball: After rising to top of sport despite
parents' deaths, he hopes his experience inspires people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Years before he became a pro beach volleyball star, what seemed a
lifetime before he won an Olympic gold medal, Eric Fonoimoana
received a phone call.</LD>
<LD>   He had just returned to his apartment after volleyball practice at
UC Santa Barbara, where he was a sophomore with promise and
potential.</LD>
<LD>   On the other end of the line was a familiar voice--that of his
older brother, Toa. But what Toa was saying didn't make sense.</LD>
<TE>   Their mother, Connie, had been in an accident. Fonoimoana needed
to come home to Hermosa Beach right away.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere between the first and final words of the two-minute
conversation, Eric Fonoimoana's life changed forever.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fonoimoana, 33, is a serious type. One of the top players on the
Assn. of Volleyball Players Tour, he is known for his tireless
training regimen and his no-nonsense attitude with his beach
partners.</TE>
<TE>   One of the fittest players on the sand, Fonoimoana might also be
the most impatient: He won the gold medal with Dain Blanton at the
2000 Sydney Olympics, then dropped him less than a year later after a
few unsuccessful tournaments together.</TE>
<TE>   It's a mind-set that dates to his days at Mira Costa High in
Manhattan Beach. The youngest of six kids, all of whom attended Mira
Costa, he arrived with the burden of trying to live up to standards
set by his siblings.</TE>
<TE>   One of his sisters, Le Lei, was a world-class swimmer who competed
in the 1976 Montreal Olympics. Another sister, Debbie, played
volleyball at UCLA. Toa played water polo at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Eric's niche was volleyball. He practically had plans for his
career laid out in his first year of high school.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything he did, he went about with a purpose," said longtime
Mira Costa volleyball Coach Mike Cook.</TE>
<TE>   Fonoimoana excelled at Mira Costa and in 1988 became the first
freshman to start at UC Santa Barbara, helping the Gauchos advance to
their first NCAA championship. They lost to USC in five games, but
big things were expected from the Gauchos and Fonoimoana.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the phone call from his brother in September 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Connie Fonoimoana had fallen while trying to catch a bus in
Manhattan Beach. She had been running alongside the bus and tripped.
The bus rolled over her midsection and caused severe internal damage
that required numerous blood transfusions.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, Fonoimoana thinks his family hid the severity of the
accident so he would stay in school and continue his athletic
development.</TE>
<TE>   After all, his father, Alio, didn't even want to tell him about
the accident the day it happened.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad didn't want to bother him," Toa Fonoimoana said. "I said,
'That's ridiculous. That's mom's favorite son.' "</TE>
<TE>   So Toa made the call. And although Fonoimoana went home, his
family persuaded him to return to school within a week. It's what mom
would have wanted, they said.</TE>
<TE>   He returned home every other week, his mother's condition neither
improving nor deteriorating. He looked forward to spending time with
her at the end of the fall quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was coming home for Thanksgiving," Fonoimoana said, "I was
told she didn't make it. I thought I was coming home and she was
coming out of the hospital, but there was pretty much no chance."</TE>
<TE>   She died Nov. 24, 1988, two months after the accident. It was
Thanksgiving Day.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Santa Barbara for school and volleyball. The
Gauchos weren't as good as expected, but Fonoimoana made a name for
himself by becoming a hard-swinging outside hitter.</TE>
<TE>   And by simply showing up.</TE>
<TE>   "It amazed me," said Ken Preston, who has coached UC Santa Barbara
for 23 seasons. "I couldn't believe he finished the season. He did it
obviously for his mom."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fonoimoana: "I had this feeling that she was around me and I
needed to impress her."</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was a senior, Fonoimoana had become the focus of
the offense and was a second-team All-American.</TE>
<TE>   A month after volleyball season ended, UC Santa Barbara held its
graduation day. Although he had earned a degree in sociology,
Fonoimoana was not there. He was at an AVP tournament in Chicago, one
of his first events as a pro.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric's father, Alio , was a disciplinarian. The youngest of 13
kids, he had a rough-and-tumble upbringing. He moved away from his
family at 18 and began working as a plumber.</TE>
<TE>   He married Connie and was in charge of lining up chores for the
kids ... and meting out punishment, if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "You didn't do anything [halfway] or he'd catch you," Eric said.
"If he did, it wasn't a fun ordeal. They were not fun spankings. The
belt was always his preferred weapon of choice. There was no
talkback. Nowadays, they probably call it abuse."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, Alio occasionally showed his softer side, particularly
when his kids were playing sports. Sometimes he let loose a playful
demeanor on the family's annual skiing trip.</TE>
<TE>   It was moments like those that Fonoimoana remembered a few years
ago, in the presence of his ailing father.</TE>
<TE>   Alio was diagnosed with liver cancer in 1997. He refused medical
treatment and hid his condition from his sons and daughters. He
continued to work, brushing off questions about his weight loss and
increased fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't want to worry anybody," said Kirk Fonoimoana, another
brother. "It was his burden."</TE>
<TE>   Alio finally told his family members in January 1998, about four
months after he had been diagnosed.</TE>
<TE>   "I made sure when I went over there that I wouldn't cry,"
Fonoimoana said. "He wouldn't allow it."</TE>
<TE>   To the end, Alio refused to go to a hospital. Only in the final
weeks did he accept painkillers. He died that year on Father's Day.</TE>
<TE>   "When it was all said and done, it was like he was at peace,"
Fonoimoana said. "One of the last things he said to me was, 'I want
you to continue playing.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fonoimoana, in his 11th year on the AVP Tour, has been to the
finals with Dax Holdren in four of five AVP tournaments this season,
winning twice. The Chicago event begins today. The season finale, the
Las Vegas Open, is Sept. 5-7.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Olympics are two years away, Fonoimoana and Holdren
could be one of two U.S. teams in Athens.</TE>
<TE>   That Fonoimoana made it to the Sydney Olympics, let alone won a
gold medal, was improbable. Fonoimoana and Blanton passed Adam
Johnson and Karch Kiraly for the last U.S. spot at the final Olympic
qualifying tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly had dislocated his shoulder earlier in the tournament, and
Fonoimoana and Blanton took advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Then they stunned the beach volleyball world at the Olympics,
turning emotion and intensity into a gold medal by winning five
consecutive matches.</TE>
<TE>   They were penalized by referees for arguing calls, slapped away
balls in anger and engaged in shouting matches with opponents, but
managed to maintain a laser focus and defeated Ze Marco de Melo and
Ricardo Santos of Brazil, 12-11, 12-9, for the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Fonoimoana kept the story of his life shackled. NBC
would have loved to broadcast it to the world, piano keys tinkling in
the background, but Fonoimoana told no media members about his past.</TE>
<TE>   "Self-pity was not something I wanted to portray," he said. "I
didn't want people out there feeling sorry for me."</TE>
<TE>   Fonoimoana did, however, reflect on his parents after he won the
medal.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to the Olympics with my mother and father's spirit ...
knowing they were with me win or lose," he said. "They're always
around me. The presence of mind that they're around makes it a lot
easier to continue day to day."</TE>
<TE>   Fonoimoana says he now has reasons to go public with his past. It
has to do with his experiences since he founded a charity, Dig for
Kids, that gives academic guidance--and volleyball lessons--to
children from mostly low-income families.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone sees this story and says, 'I didn't know other people
had these problems as well,' maybe they can turn mishaps into
successes," he said. "Maybe some kid sees it and says, 'I don't have
it half bad.'</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of bad things that have happened to me. But I'm
extremely focused in what I do. I think it's pretty powerful what I
can convey to people: Believe in anything."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Spurrier, who took heat from critics for running up the score
while at the University of Florida, is getting the same treatment now
that he is coaching the NFL's Washington Redskins.</LD>
<LD>   "Any time you score a lot of points, people look for something to
be critical about," he said. "I've always wondered in basketball,
when one team is way ahead, how come they keep shooting. Why is that
legal?</LD>
<LD>   "In baseball, if you're up 10-0 going into the top of the ninth,
is a guy supposed to go up and strike out? He's still swinging. So
why can't football [players] keep playing? Why is football the only
sport that they call running up the score?"</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: How many American drivers have won Formula One races?</TE>
<TE>   Keeping tabs: Former Atlanta Brave slugger Dale Murphy ran into
Greg Maddux one day and mentioned to the Atlanta pitcher, "I was one
for 22 against you [when Maddux was a Cub]."</TE>
<TE>   To which Maddux replied, "No, it was one for 26."</TE>
<TE>   High honors: Three of the country's top 10 high school football
teams, as ranked by USA Today, are in California, headed by No. 1
Concord De La Salle, riding a record 125-game winning streak. Long
Beach Poly is No. 4 and Los Alamitos No. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Took a long time: After nearly 80 years, Devils Lake, N.D., is
dropping Satans as its high school nickname.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to stand up and cheer for the Satans," said one mother
and coach. "It's not an appropriate name for children."</TE>
<TE>   Talking horse: Repent, a Kentucky Derby favorite in April before
he was sidelined with an ankle chip, is coming back today to run in
the $1-million Travers Stakes at Saratoga Springs, N.Y. What prompted
trainer Ken McPeek to enter Repent after a 140-day layoff? "He told
us he's ready to go," said the trainer.</TE>
<TE>   Wedding bells: Fifteen couples are getting married today at
Bristol Motor Speedway before the Sharpie 500 Winston Cup race.</TE>
<TE>   If you think that's odd, how about this? Jerry Nadeau, who drives
for Petty Enterprises, will serve as honorary best man for each
couple, and his sponsor, Georgia-Pacific, will give out their first
wedding presents. The catch: All must have tickets for the race.</TE>
<TE>   More on Bristol: Says third-generation driver Kyle Petty about the
high-banked half-mile Tennessee oval: "The Daytona 500, the Southern
500--those races might have been the ones that put NASCAR on the map.
But tracks like the Bristols and the Martinsvilles and the Richmonds
are the ones that made NASCAR go before there was a map."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Five: Mario Andretti, 12; Dan Gurney, four; Phil
Hill, three; Peter Revson, two, and Richie Ginther, one.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: After forward Keith Van Horn was traded by the New
Jersey Nets to the Philadelphia 76ers, Shaun Powell of Newsday
couldn't resist a barb or two about the former collegiate
All-American:</TE>
<TE>   "They certainly bought into the insane hype that said Van Horn
would become another Larry Bird. Well, Van Horn can never be Bird.
Not the Bird who led the Boston Celtics to championships, and not the
Bird who's going on 46 and shooting hoops in his driveway."</TE>

<HD>Not the Same Fresno State</HD>
<DH>College football: Bulldogs begin post-Carr era with 23-21
loss to No. 25 Wisconsin. Grady has three scoring passes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>So this is what life is like after David Carr.</LD>
<LD>   Overthrown passes. Fumbled snaps in shotgun formation.
Interceptions thrown into double coverage.</LD>
<LD>   And, yet, there was still almost a Fresno State victory. On the
road. Against a ranked opponent.</LD>
<TE>   But in the end, it became apparent that times have changed for the
Bulldogs: They were the ones that got caught from behind at Camp
Randall Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin, ranked 25th, defeated Fresno State, 23-21, on a field
goal in the final minutes before 75,136 in both teams' season opener
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   No, there weren't as many Fresno State visits to the end zone
without Carr, who led the nation last season with 4,839 yards passing
and 46 touchdown passes before being drafted by the Houston Texans
with the first overall pick in the NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   The hardest college job in America (i.e., whomever replaced Carr)
was filled by Jeff Grady, a redshirt junior who had thrown 23 passes
in college before Friday. Grady, who played at Huntington Beach
Edison High, completed 21 of 42 passes for 262 yards, produced three
touchdowns and was intercepted twice. Grady struggled at times,
sometimes overshooting receivers by 15 yards, but he didn't get much
help from his teammates. Case in point: After he connected with
Marque Davis for a nifty 37-yard gain, Davis fumbled the ball to
negate a third-quarter drive.</TE>
<TE>   Grady was also short-circuited by the loss of receiver Bernard
Berrian, who sprained a knee ligament in the first quarter. And Grady
was injured in the second quarter, taking a shot in the hip from Jake
Sprague, but continuing to play after sitting out one snap.</TE>
<TE>   "He started off a little wobbly," Fresno State Coach Pat Hill said
of Grady, adding that the hip injury could sideline his starting
quarterback for a couple of weeks. "He made some big plays. He never
quit. And he played hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "We played a good team ... we're not playing Cal Poly or
something," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Bulldogs soared to No. 8 in the Associated Press
poll with victories over Colorado, Oregon State, Wisconsin and
Colorado State on the way to a 6-0 start.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Bulldogs stumbled with losses to Boise State and
Hawaii, the nation came to learn what the "V" meant on the back of
their helmets (an ode to farmers in the San Joaquin Valley) and folks
in Fresno couldn't get enough of the hometown team, shattering
attendance records at Bulldog Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   This season, however, the Bulldogs have already used the "slap in
the face" cliche to describe a coaches' preseason poll that picked
them to finish third in the Western Athletic Conference. Still,
Fresno State had three leads against the Badgers, only to be passed
for good when Mike Allen kicked a 34-yard field goal with 2:05 left.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to hear that they overlooked us," Hill said. "I
heard that [from teams] all last year."</TE>
<TE>   Then there were the Badgers, also looking for a little respect
after last season's unsettling 5-7 record kept them out of a bowl for
the first time since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   They revamped their defense, with only one returning starter, a
sensible move for a squad that folded in seemingly every game,
bottoming out by giving up 63 points and 631 yards to Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for the Badgers, they didn't tinker with sophomore running
back Anthony Davis, who had 184 yards in 37 carries, helping
Wisconsin take an enormous edge in time of possession, 41:09 to
19:51.</TE>

<HD>Bowden Is Looking to Move Past Bryant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The race is on for No. 1 in college football, and that goes for a
coaching icon too.</LD>
<LD>   Florida State's Bobby Bowden is tied with Bear Bryant for second
in all-time victories among Division I-A coaches.</LD>
<LD>   Bowden will have a chance to break that tie tonight and move a
step closer to the leader, Penn State's Joe Paterno, when the
third-ranked Seminoles play Iowa State in the Eddie Robinson Classic
in Kansas City, Mo.</LD>
<TE>   Bowden, in his 27th year at Florida State and 37th overall, has
323 victories. Paterno, whose team opens Aug. 31 against Central
Florida, has 327.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, Bowden resumes the chase in a game named after the
man who has more victories than any coach at any level. Robinson won
408 games at Grambling.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State is trying to bounce back from an 8-4 record in 2001,
its worst season since 1986. The Seminole defense gave up 49 points
to Miami, 41 to North Carolina, 37 to Florida and 34 to North
Carolina State.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State will have to contain Iowa State quarterback Seneca
Wallace, who finished second in the Big 12 Conference in offense last
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska is in the unfamiliar position of looking for respect.</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers' No. 10 ranking is their lowest to start a season
since they were 11th in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   They begin their quest today against Arizona State in the Black
Coaches Assn. Classic at Lincoln, Neb.</TE>
<TE>   Jammal Lord, who replaces Heisman Trophy winner Eric Crouch, gets
his first start at quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first game between Nebraska and Arizona State since
the Sun Devils stunned the Cornhuskers, 19-0, in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State is coming off a 4-7 season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Look for Texas Tech quarterback Kliff Kingsbury to challenge the
Ohio State secondary in the Pigskin Classic at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   "Plan A is throw it. Plan B is throw it," Kingsbury said. "That's
about how we operate around here."</TE>
<TE>   With a size advantage on the line, the Buckeyes are expected to
run the ball. Ohio State has 14 freshmen and eight sophomores listed
on its two-deep lineup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The number of black head coaches at major college programs
declined over the last six years, according to a study released by
the NCAA Minority Opportunities and Interest Committee. In 1995-96,
black head coaches made up 5% of Division I-A programs. This year
only 2% of coaches are black.... Pittsburgh freshman running back
Jawan Walker tore his left medial collateral ligament and partially
tore his anterior cruciate ligament during a scrimmage and is out
indefinitely.</TE>

<LD>A horse was euthanized during training hours at Del Mar and another
died of an apparent heart attack during the running of the fourth
race Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In the morning, Golden Hours, the morning-line favorite for the
eighth race, could not be saved after he fractured his right foreleg
during a gallop. On Friday night, Global Gait collapsed in the
stretch run and died near the eighth pole.</LD>
<LD>   His jockey, David Flores, was not seriously injured. Global Gait,
who was bought in January 2001 by Bob and Beverly Lewis for an
estimated $600,000, was a Kentucky Derby prospect who dropped off the
Triple Crown trail after running seventh in last year's Lexington
Stakes. He was winless in eight starts for the Lewises.</LD>
<TE>   Kachamandi, with only one victory in nine U.S. starts, paid $7.60
for his win in the Harry F. Brubaker Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-year-old gelding was ridden by Pat Valenzuela, Del Mar's
leading rider, who was handed a seven-day suspension by the stewards
because of the way he rode Ourfirstattraction in Wednesday's eighth
race.</TE>
<TE>   The suspension is to begin next Friday.</TE>

<HD>Lo Duca Takes One for Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After homer in the first inning, catcher is hit
by pitch in the ninth for a 4-3 victory over Braves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ink was barely dry on Paul Lo Duca's quotes ripping Arizona
Manager Bob Brenly for not selecting him to the National League
All-Star team in early July when the Dodger catcher went into a
lengthy tailspin, in which he looked like anything but an All-Star.</LD>
<LD>   Lo Duca hit .326 in the first half but .203 in the six weeks after
the All-Star break, his average falling to .285 entering Friday
night. The 123-point drop-off was the second largest in the major
leagues behind Florida third baseman Mike Lowell's 132-point fall.</LD>
<LD>   But Lo Duca is beginning to awake from his second-half slumber,
following Thursday's key pinch-hit single with two big runs batted in
Friday night, homering off Atlanta starter Greg Maddux in the first
inning and getting hit by a pitch with the bases loaded in the ninth
to lift the Dodgers to a 4-3 victory over the Braves.</LD>
<TE>   "It barely nicked my elbow pad, but it did hit me," said Lo Duca,
whose RBI single in the seventh inning Thursday knocked in the tying
run in an eventual 6-2 win over Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good. I got the hit [Thursday] and let out a sigh of
relief. Then I hit the home run. I don't care, just as long as it
comes at a crucial time. I got hit by a pitch at a crucial time."</TE>
<TE>   A Dodger Stadium crowd of 50,341 marked Atlanta right fielder Gary
Sheffield's return to Los Angeles with hearty boos before every one
of his at-bats--Sheffield, traded to the Braves in January after a
stormy tenure with the Dodgers, went 0 for 4 with three popups and a
groundout.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, meanwhile, won for the 12th time in 15 games and
increased their wild-card lead over San Francisco to 3 1/2 games,
thanks to a game-winning rally that didn't include a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Roberts opened the ninth with a walk off Brave reliever
Darren Holmes and stole second. Marquis Grissom grounded to short,
with Roberts holding, and Shawn Green, who homered in the first
inning, was intentionally walked.</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Beltre worked the count full before fouling off three
pitches. Holmes then tried to pick off Roberts at second, but his
throw bounced into center field, allowing the runners to advance.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre was walked intentionally to load the bases, and Atlanta
Manager Bobby Cox summoned right-hander Kevin Gryboski. On a 2-1
pitch, Gryboski's tailing fastball nicked Lo Duca, and Roberts jogged
home with the winning run.</TE>
<TE>   While the Dodgers celebrated a victory that improved their record
to 23-11 in one-run games, starter Odalis Perez fumed after being
ejected after the seventh, when a controversial balk call helped the
Braves score the tying run.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander hit Darren Bragg with a pitch to open the inning,
and Roberts made a nice leaping catch of pinch-hitter Javy Lopez's
drive to left-center for the first out.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Marcus Giles flied to right, and Perez appeared to
pick off Bragg, who was tagged out at second. But first-base umpire
Doug Eddings cited Perez for a balk and awarded Bragg second.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Furcal then lined a ground-rule double to right field to
score Bragg for a 3-3 tie.</TE>
<TE>   "Unbelievable," said Perez, who gave up three runs and five hits
in seven innings. "I've been doing this ... all season, and it's the
first time they've called it. ... I can't believe it. That's
ridiculous. How come they do it with the tying run on [first] base?"</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers scored three runs on two home runs in the first, the
first time in two years Maddux has given up two homers in the first
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, hitless in his first 12 at-bats of the home stand,
started the rally with a one-out single to center, and Green sliced
an opposite-field fly ball that cleared the short fence near the
left-field foul pole for a two-run homer, his 37th of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The shot also gave Green 86 home runs in 2001 and 2002, the
highest two-year total in Dodger history, a record previously held by
Duke Snider, who hit 43 homers in 1955 and 42 in 1956. Lo Duca capped
the rally with a two-out homer to center, his eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "The big key for him offensively is he has such a short stroke
that if he stays away from a pull mode of thinking, he's a very
dangerous hitter," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said of Lo Duca. "He has
to stay on top of the ball, and not under it."</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, he was just as dangerous when the ball was on top of
him.</TE>

<HD>Strikes on the Field Are Main Concern</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With next Friday's strike date looming, catcher Paul Lo Duca called a
meeting before Friday night's game to update teammates on
negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement. Then, he
essentially told the Dodgers to put those negotiations out of their
minds.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers began a three-game series against the Atlanta Braves,
who had the major leagues' best record, and they begin a three-game
series against National League West-leading Arizona on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   If a work stoppage is avoided, the Dodgers would then play wild
card-contending Houston three times, the Diamondbacks three more
times, the Astros three more times and wild-card contending San
Francisco three times.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got to play as if there's no strike, because if there isn't
a strike, we can't put ourselves in a hole by acting like these are
the last six games of the year," Lo Duca said of the remainder of
this home stand.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing the two best teams in the National League now, and
we need to play well. These are huge games. Then, we play Houston and
San Francisco. The next 18 games are big. They could make or break
us. They'll [determine] whether we go to the playoffs or not. We
can't focus on a strike."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, whose average has slipped from .329 on July 6 to .285
before Friday night, said ongoing negotiations and the threat of a
work stoppage have not been a distraction--yet.</TE>
<TE>   "If it has been, it hasn't showed," Lo Duca said. "When I step on
the field, I don't think about it one bit. But I'm sure it will start
hitting us pretty hard Monday."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Giovanni Carrara, on the 15-day disabled list because of
a strain in his right forearm, threw a two-inning, 45-pitch simulated
game Friday afternoon, reporting no problems afterward. Carrara is
eligible to come off the DL Monday but will likely throw one more
simulated game before being activated next week.</TE>
<TE>   Carrara also admitted his arm was bothering him in early August
more than he let on. In his last four outings before going on the
disabled list, Carrara gave up two home runs, a tiebreaking two-run
double and hit two batters with the bases loaded to force in the
tiebreaking runs.</TE>
<TE>   "I wore long sleeves because I didn't want anyone to see the
bruise on my arm," Carrara said. "That's the way I am. I want to do
anything I can to help the team, but I finally realized I wasn't
helping the team, and I was hurting myself too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Jordan, sidelined for 12 of the last 13 games
because of a protruding disk in his lower back, began some rotational
exercises to loosen his trunk area Friday. He said his back felt the
same as it did Thursday--"the good thing is it's not worse," Jordan
said--but he still hasn't been able to swing a bat and will be
sidelined indefinitely.... Brave center fielder Andruw Jones, who
suffered a strained left shoulder and right wrist while making a
diving catch Thursday in San Diego, did not start Friday night and is
questionable for today's game.... Individual tickets for Dodger
playoff games will go on sale Sept. 14 and can be purchased at Dodger
Stadium, by phone or on the Internet.... Vin Scully returned to the
television booth Friday night after missing two games because of
laryngitis.</TE>

the Braves starting left-handers today and Sunday night, it's
possible Dave Roberts will get his second start of the season against
a left-handed pitcher. The left-handed-hitting Roberts has platooned
in center with Grissom but is batting .417 (10 for 24) against
left-handers this season. Ashby has had trouble with Brave third
baseman Vinny Castilla, who is batting .333 (13 for 39) with five
homers and 13 RBIs against him. Lo Duca (six for eight) has had
success against Glavine.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Soccer games are divided into 45-minute halves, but Galaxy Coach Sigi
Schmid is breaking down his team's season into unequal thirds.</LD>
<LD>   The first third lasted five games, a somewhat successful if
disjointed stretch during which the Galaxy went 2-1-2, and ended with
the team's heart and soul, Cobi Jones, leaving for World Cup duty
with the U.S. national team.</LD>
<LD>   The middle third was full of injuries and frustration as the
rudderless and injury-prone Galaxy stumbled through a 4-5 run that
included a three-game losing streak.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight's game at Dallas, the Galaxy's sixth game in 18 days,
falls into the final third, a more prosperous period that began with
Jones' return. With veteran defender Alexi Lalas assuming a sweeper
role, the Galaxy has gone 8-2-1 since, including a pair of U.S. Open
Cup victories.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough to establish a rhythm [early on]," Schmid said.
"Actually, this series of games has been the most constant we've been
able to maintain our starting lineup in a while and I think that's
what's helped us a lot. So hopefully now we'll catch a rhythm and
ride it."</TE>
<TE>   The streaking Galaxy, which at one point was 11 points behind
division-leading San Jose, is now in second place in Major League
Soccer's Western Conference, three points behind the Earthquakes,
whom they play in a home-and-home series to finish the season.</TE>
<TE>   Which puts that much more at stake in tonight's game against the
third-place Burn, which lost Wednesday at San Jose, 3-1, and is two
points behind Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the most improved team in the league and they're a team
that plays very similar to San Jose with their 4-4-2 [alignment],"
Schmid said of Dallas. "It becomes a game where Dallas is maybe a
little more desperate than we are because they've now, for the first
time, slipped into third place.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to be very hungry, very motivated and when teams
are desperate, they're always dangerous. But by the same token, I
think our guys know what's [at stake]. We've had success in the past
in Dallas and we've also taken one on the chin pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   The Burn has four players in double-digit scoring--forward Jason
Kreis, 29 points on 13 goals and three assists; forward Bobby Rhine,
15 on five goals and five assists; midfielder Antonio Martinez, 13 on
two goals and nine assists, and forward Ronald Cerritos, 12 on three
goals and six assists.</TE>
<TE>   "They have star power but don't play with any prima donnas on the
field," Schmid said.</TE>

forward Brian Mullan will sit out with a one-game suspension because
of the red card he received in the closing moments Wednesday. He has
three goals and two assists in 18 games, nine starts. The Galaxy
leads the all-time series, 12-8-5, but is only 4-5-2 against the Burn
away from home.</TE>

<KH>GOLF ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Allenby, Lowery Are Tied</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Allenby has been looking for a spark in his game, a little
something extra to turn good rounds into good scores. His
eight-under-par 63 in the second round of NEC Invitational on Friday
might do the trick.</LD>
<LD>   Allenby had an eagle and five birdies on his final seven holes at
Sahalee Country Club in Sammamish, Wash., to set the course record
and take a share of the lead with Steve Lowery in the $5-million
World Golf Championship event.</LD>
<LD>   Lowery started his round the way Allenby finished his, with
birdies on four of his first five holes. He missed two short par
putts on the back nine, including one from 18 inches, and finished
with a 65 to join Allenby at 10-under 132.</LD>
<TE>   Retief Goosen (68) was one stroke back and Justin Rose had his
second 67 and was at 134.</TE>
<TE>   The previous course record was 65, held by Greg Kraft and Nick
Price at the 1998 PGA Championship (par 70), and matched Thursday by
Goosen and Toshi Izawa.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods' hopes of becoming the first player in 75 years to win
the same event four years in a row will require two low scores.</TE>
<TE>   Birdies were followed by bogeys and he shot a 70, which left him
six strokes behind. That's the widest margin he has faced after any
round in the three-year history of the NEC Invitational.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Flesch had an eagle and four consecutive birdies to shoot a
64 and take a share of the second-round lead with Tom Pernice Jr. and
rookie Ben Crane at 10-under par at the $3 million Reno-Tahoe Open.</TE>
<TE>   Flesch, who started the day at two under, with a migraine headache
and a sore wrist, played the first nine holes six under at the
7,472-yard, par 72 Montreux Golf and Country Club in Reno.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Howell III, who led after the first round with a
seven-under 65, shot a 73 to fall four strokes off the lead at 138.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Ammaccapane took another step toward ending a four-year
winless streak with a three-under 69 that allowed her to maintain a
share of the lead after two rounds of the Betsy King Classic at
Kutztown, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Ammaccapane, who opened with a 66, made three of her five birdies
on the back nine in the second round. She was tied with Wendy Doolan,
who had an eagle during a round of 68, and they were nine-under at
135.</TE>
<TE>   Karrie Webb had a 65, despite a triple bogey on the 14th hole. She
was at 136, tied with Michelle Ellis, Rachel Teske and Stefania
Croce. Teske had a 67. Ellis shot 69. Croce had a second 68.</TE>
<TE>   Joanne Morley shot a 66 and was two strokes off the pace with Val
Skinner, who had a 69.</TE>
<TE>   Se Ri Pak, third on the money winners' list, shot a 68 and was in
a group of five players at 138.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Morris Hatalsky chipped in on consecutive holes and finished with
eight birdies, an eagle and 19 points to take the first-round lead at
the Uniting Fore Care Classic at Park City, Utah.</TE>
<TE>   The Senior PGA Tour went to the modified Stableford scoring system
for this year's event.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Watson birdied and eagled two of the final three holes and
moved into second place with 14 points. Hugh Baiocchi, Terry Dill,
Mike McCullogh and John Harris were tied for third with 12.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Haas, son of PGA Tour pro Jay, defeated John Klauk, 5 and 4,
to reach the semifinals of the U.S. Amateur at Bloomfield Hills,
Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Haas, of Greer, S.C., shot a 28 on the front nine to make the turn
at 4-up.</TE>
<TE>   He will next face Ricky Barnes of Stockton, who beat 18-year-old
Spencer Levin of Elk Grove, Calif., 4 and 3.</TE>
<TE>   In the other semifinal, Hunter Mahan of McKinney, Texas, faces
Dustin Bray of Asheboro, N.C. Mahan defeated Henry Liaw of Rowland
Heights, 3 and 2. Bray beat Ryan Moore of Puyallup, Wash., 4 and 3.</TE>

<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>"Come o-n-n-n!" he squeals, sounding like a wounded wombat, pumping
his fists and cursing at the imaginary adversaries he has invented on
his way to the top of his sport. And his sport just sits there,
wondering what to make of this impudent kid in the backward baseball
cap who has turned men's tennis on its head.</LD>
<LD>   "Come o-n-n-n!" Lleyton Hewitt shouts, and the rest of tennis does
a double take, giving serious thought to a question that has yet to
be sufficiently answered: If Hewitt's doing the leading, are we
really sure we want to go with him?</LD>
<LD>   There are champions of the moment--Marat Safin, Thomas Johansson,
Albert Costa--instant lottery winners who take their prizes, do their
news conferences and fade quickly into the background. Staying power
is a rarity. Men's Grand Slam champions of late seem to come equipped
with ticking clocks.</LD>
<TE>   Hewitt has changed this time-share arrangement at the top,
apparently having settled in for the long haul. Top-seeded this year,
he won the U.S. Open last year, becoming the youngest No. 1 in ATP
history at 20, then added a Grand Slam bookend with his Wimbledon
title in July at 21.</TE>
<TE>   He wins and he snarls. He loses, less frequently, but the snarl
remains. Consistency is both Hewitt's strength and his weakness. His
world is a simple one, divided neatly into casts of supporters and
enemies. Chair umpires, linespeople, reporters, opponents, tour
officials, who you are doesn't matter--if you're not with him, the
way Hewitt looks at it, you are most assuredly against him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm competitive. I'm the first to admit that," he says. "That's
me. It doesn't matter if I'm swimming against [Olympic champion] Ian
Thorpe, I'll try and win. I know I can't, but I'll try and do my
best.</TE>
<TE>   "That's probably one reason why I've probably been able to do as
well as I have, because I go out on the court and try and give
everything I've got every time."</TE>
<TE>   That much the rest of tennis learned long ago. But what else do we
know about Hewitt, the economy-sized firebrand from Adelaide,
Australia, with the formidable groundstrokes and the attitude to
match?</TE>
<TE>   Rather than providing clues, Hewitt's triumph at Wimbledon only
heightened the mystery. Australian writers, deprived of easy access
during the tournament, were holding secret meetings with his family
to help improve the situation. Reporters from other countries joined
the pursuit. One was spirited into the house of Hewitt's entourage at
Wimbledon to speak with his parents, Glynn and Cherilyn, in the
basement, but was asked to stay in hiding because Lleyton had
unexpectedly arrived with his girlfriend, tennis pro Kim Clijsters.</TE>
<TE>   The Wimbledon title--taken with the loss of only two sets in seven
matches--accelerated the unveiling of Hewitt. Then, after he'd pulled
out of an event in Los Angeles because he was sick, his people were
willing to make him available at the Stanford women's tournament
where Clijsters was playing.</TE>
<TE>   There the Hewitt we've come to see on the court was missing.</TE>
<TE>   Where was the tennis brat columnist John Feinstein had recently
compared to Barry Bonds, calling them champions who were "absolute
chumps as human beings?"</TE>
<TE>   Where was that rumored chip the size of New Zealand on his
shoulder?</TE>
<TE>   The heir apparent to John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors and early Andre
Agassi was polite, reflective and even modest about his abilities.</TE>
<TE>   This had an almost "Wizard of Oz" feel. On a bench near the
practice courts at Stanford, Hewitt--the screaming, polarizing No. 1
who'd once called an umpire "a spastic" and had slid into a racially
tinged controversy while playing African American James Blake at the
2001 U.S. Open--seemed more like a shy, skinny kid looking for the
area's best skateboarding park.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you learn from your mistakes now and then," Hewitt said.
"Then again, sometimes people try to find the negative thing out of
anything to write about. That's the disappointing thing."</TE>
<TE>   So little was known about Hewitt, and outside of a couple of
acquaintances in the media in Australia, he had little reservoir of
goodwill when various controversies hit in the last year or so,
including the break in December with respected coach Darren Cahill.
He has been revealed in fits and starts, meaning that his story
remains hard to tell.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm probably more shy off the court than people probably think,"
he said. "I'm not the biggest fan of going there and standing up and
telling stories about myself."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, he has spoken a couple of times to the most outgoing
and affable of previous Australian champions, John Newcombe, who was
also Hewitt's first Davis Cup captain.</TE>
<TE>   "Talking about yourself, I find that a little bit tough," Hewitt
said. "I spoke to Newk a couple of times about it because he talks so
well. He has so many stories to tell over the last 50 years he's
played this game. He said when I'm his age, I'll have stories to tell
as well. It's tough for a 21-year-old to go out there and stand up in
front of a lot of people. That comes with experience."</TE>
<TE>   The dual Hewitts are not a new development. His agent, Tom Ross,
learned this from Hewitt's mother when he was recruiting the
youngster.</TE>
<TE>   "She would often say there's two Lleytons," Ross said. "There was
the Lleyton on court, who is this fiery personality and an incredible
competitor.</TE>
<TE>   "Off court, you wouldn't recognize him. He's this shy little kid
who sits in the back of the class."</TE>
<TE>   One consistent thread was his passion for winning--at everything.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt says he got his body type and endurance from his mother,
who was a netball player, and his quickness from his father, a former
Australian rules football player. Competitiveness came from both
sides.</TE>
<TE>   Oftentimes, junior players go through periods of
petulance--tanking a match or throwing a set or simply retiring.
Hewitt looked stumped when asked if that ever happened in his
childhood.</TE>
<TE>   "I always gave 100%. I can't remember once, I honestly can't," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   This, combined with his counterpunching abilities, makes him a
fitting successor to Connors, who, like Hewitt, won his first
Wimbledon at 21.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, he shares Connors' fighting spirit on the court and
the ability to raise his level in hostile circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pretty strong-headed," said Patrick McEnroe, ESPN
commentator and U.S. Davis Cup captain. "That's why he's No. 1 in the
world. He's always reminded me of Connors. When he first came on the
tour, the way he played, a me-against-the-world type of mentality.</TE>
<TE>   "Which, quite honestly, isn't the worst thing to have for a tennis
player. He thrives on that. Jimmy was like that in a lot of respects,
'I'm going to screw everybody, and show everybody.' In tennis, you
can get away with that."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hewitt: "There's a few times when people tried to hop on the
train, and try bagging you. It doesn't worry me. It doesn't affect my
tennis. I don't think people really realized that until probably the
U.S Open last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's happened so many times in Davis Cup. I was getting bagged
before I played in Spain. I went out there and beat [Albert] Costa in
five sets in Barcelona. The crowd doesn't worry me when I go out
there. I'm able, for some reason, to block it out and play my best
tennis."</TE>
<TE>   The similarities to Connors don't end there. When Connors won at
Wimbledon in 1974, he was dating Chris Evert. Their engagement was
viewed by many as the class rebel hooking up with the leader of the
pep squad. Hewitt has been seeing Clijsters since he met her at the
Australian Open in 2000, attending as many of her matches as
possible. Clijsters is well liked by media and her peers on the tour.</TE>
<TE>   "Watching Kim affects me," Hewitt said. "I want her to win every
time she steps on the court. It's tough. When you're out there, you
don't feel those same sorts of pressures. You're sitting off the
court and you're thinking, 'Get a first serve in here,' and then they
miss it. I couldn't do it week in and week out."</TE>
<TE>   Like Hewitt, Connors had his media problems and conflicts with
tour officials in his day, even filing a $40-million antitrust
lawsuit against the ATP officials and others, charging a conspiracy
to monopolize pro tennis.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt's difficulties with the ATP aren't quite of that nature,
but even on the eve of his U.S. Open title defense he was prepared to
spar with that organization. He was fined $105,650 by the ATP for
refusing to conduct an interview with ESPN this month before his
first-round match at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   There is an appeal pending, but Hewitt hired counsel in
Indianapolis this week, Barnes &amp; Thornburg, to handle the matter
should legal action be required. His camp felt an arrangement with
the parties had been reached before the matter exploded at the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "Based upon Lleyton's experience with the tour to date, it's not
hard to understand he felt the need to engage a litigator," Ross
said. "There was some extremely bad judgment used by certain tour
staff--and Lleyton paid the price."</TE>
<TE>   One of the members of the appeals panel used to be Patrick
McEnroe. He has stepped down from the position, citing his Davis Cup
position as well as his broadcast responsibilities. McEnroe speaks
highly of Hewitt as a performer and personality, but says that being
No. 1 carries extra responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "The tour has got to have some power here," he said. "The Lleyton
Hewitts of the world have a lot more being asked of them. You need to
do more when you're at the top of the sport."</TE>
<TE>   For Hewitt, the good still outweighed the bad a few weeks ago at
Stanford. This was before the ATP feud, long before he'd told an
Australian newspaper that the men's tour was a badly run "circus."</TE>
<TE>   On this day, there was still a Wimbledon afterglow and the thrill
of holding the No. 1 ranking, talking about his favorite band,
Midnight Oil, and getting to play on Tiger Woods' collegiate golf
course.</TE>
<TE>   So, what would the top tennis player want to ask the top golfer?</TE>
<TE>   "The way that he handles himself every tournament he goes into,
everyone expects him to shoot 65 every day," Hewitt said. "That's an
extraordinary thing. The way he's been able to block everything out
and concentrate on going out there and doing what he does best. If
there is a secret for him doing that, I'd like to know it, to try and
keep my ranking and majors going as long as I could."</TE>

<HD>McAnally Taking Plenty of Chances</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer has three horses, all longshots,
entered in Sunday's Pacific Classic at Del Mar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>The late Charlie Whittingham, a hall-of-fame trainer, would routinely
start three horses in stakes races, and even ran 1-2-3 on several
occasions.</LD>
<LD>   "I like it when I've got them surrounded," Whittingham would quip.</LD>
<LD>   But Ron McAnally, who was inducted into the racing shrine in 1990
and has been training for about 45 years, can't recall ever tripling
up on the opposition. Now, against War Emblem, the Kentucky Derby
winner and the early favorite for horse of the year, McAnally will
take three shots in Sunday's $1-million Pacific Classic at Del Mar.</LD>
<TE>   What gives?</TE>
<TE>   "They're all longshots, but I think they deserve a chance,"
McAnally said. "These horses are closers, and at this track, like
Santa Anita, closers are capable of winning. At a track like
Hollywood Park, closers don't have much of a chance."</TE>
<TE>   McAnally is not the only trainer who smells an upset Sunday. This
year's Pacific Classic has drawn a record 14 horses. McAnally's
entries are Jimmy Z, Seinne and Tapatio, who are all 30-1 on the
morning line. War Emblem is the 2-1 favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, McAnally was in a position to start four horses in the 1
1/4-mile dirt race, but he's decided to leave Oh Take, a major winner
in Argentina at the Pacific Classic distance, in the barn.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson Bunker Hunt, who bought Oh Take three days before the horse
won a Grade I race in South America in late June, will still be
represented Sunday when the 70-year-old McAnally saddles the
Chilean-bred Seinne, a 5-year-old whose recent strong races,
including a win in Santa Anita's Arcadia Handicap, have been on
grass.</TE>
<TE>   "Seinne can run on dirt," McAnally said. "He won what amounts to a
Breeders' Cup race on dirt in Argentina."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson Bunker Hunt, that name rings a bell.</TE>
<TE>   At 76, the defrocked Texas billionaire is having a renewed love
affair with racing. Hunt began buying horses again three years ago,
after an ill-fated attempt at cornering the world silver market in
the 1980s led to bankruptcy and the short-circuiting of a racing
empire that produced champions on both sides of the Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   The names Dahlia, Youth, Empery, Vaguely Noble and Trillion
scratch only the surface of the very best Hunt raced. In fact, his
premier horse was arguably the Whittingham-trained Exceller, never a
winner of an Eclipse Award, even though he won the 1978 Hollywood
Gold Cup and later in the year beat two Triple Crown champions,
Seattle Slew and Affirmed, in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it was finance or racing, Hunt's philosophical mind-set
was a good fit for high-stakes wheeling and dealing. When his
personal fortunes turned turtle, he offhandedly said: "You know, a
billion dollars isn't what it used to be."</TE>
<TE>   When Hunt unloaded his bloodstock in a record dispersal sale in
1988, Whittingham all but predicted that his longtime client wasn't
finished with racing.</TE>
<TE>   "Bunker's not out till he's out," Whittingham said, sounding a
whole lot like Yogi Berra.</TE>
<TE>   Until Hunt's second time around, McAnally had never trained a
horse for the Dallas oilman who won an Eclipse as best breeder three
times. The closest he came was with Palace Music, the sire of Cigar,
the two-time horse of the year and upset victim of Dare And Go in the
1996 Pacific Classic.</TE>
<TE>   "Palace Music was in my barn at the start," McAnally said. "Bunker
was a partner of Allen Paulson [Cigar's owner], and I was training a
lot of Paulson's horses at the time. But I went out of town for
several days, to buy some horses at a sale, and by the time I got
back, [Palace Music] had been moved to [Whittingham's] barn."</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Z, another of McAnally's hopefuls Sunday, is a 5-year-old
gelding who races for Jerry and Ann Moss. Jimmy Z, who'll be ridden
by Pat Valenzuela, Del Mar's leading rider this season, has won only
two of 22 starts, but at 1 1/16 miles here Aug. 4, he finished a
creditable second to Pleasantly Perfect, another Pacific Classic
starter.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out McAnally's contingent is Tapatio, a Gary Tanaka-owned
Argentine-bred who's been no better than fourth in four U.S. grass
starts.</TE>
<TE>   McAnally has won 397 races at Del Mar, more than anybody else, and
he's No. 2--behind Whittingham--on the stakes list here, but in 11
years of Pacific Classics, he's had only four starters and never done
better than Festin's fourth in 1991, the first year the race was run.</TE>
<TE>   "Realistically, you look at this race and it looks like there
ought to be a fast pace," McAnally said. "[Trainer Paco Gonzalez] has
a second horse [Bosque Redondo] in there to ensure a good pace for
his other horse [Came Home]. All of this might help closers like
Milwaukee Brew, who was too far back in the Hollywood Gold Cup."</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Classic is not exactly an oasis for favorites. Only
one public choice--Gentlemen, in 1997--has won the stake. Among the
winners have been Dare And Go, who paid $81.20 for $2 when he upended
Cigar, and Missionary Ridge, who won at 24-1 in 1992. War Emblem has
that history--and McAnally's longshot trio--to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The race that War Emblem might have run, today's $1-million
Travers at Saratoga, has drawn heavy favorite Medaglia d'Oro and
eight other 3-year-olds that appear to be overmatched.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time I've had the chance to really train this
horse, rather than just running him and running him," said Bobby
Frankel, who trains Medaglia d'Oro. "If he shows up, he should win."</TE>
<TE>   Medaglia d'Oro, after the grueling Triple Crown run in which his
best finish was the second behind Sarava in the Belmont, blew out the
opposition in the Jim Dandy at Saratoga three weeks ago, winning by
13 3/4 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   The colt's most intriguing rival is Repent, one of the favorites
for the Kentucky Derby before he ran second to War Emblem in the
Illinois Derby and underwent ankle surgery. The 1 1/4-mile Travers
will be Repent's first start in 4 1/2 months.</TE>
<TE>   "He's run well off a layoff before," trainer Ken McPeek said. "I
actually wish War Emblem was in this race. We beat him once, and I
would have had no fear about taking him on again."</TE>

<HD>Dublino, Megahertz Meet in Del Mar Oaks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those who missed the American Oaks on July 6 at Hollywood Park can
catch the rerun this afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Dublino and Megahertz, the principals in what turned out to be a
controversial conclusion, are back for the $300,000 Del Mar Oaks, a
Grade I at 1 1/8 miles on the turf.</LD>
<LD>   Making her U.S. debut for trainer Laura de Seroux, Dublino crossed
the wire first in the American Oaks but was disqualified and dropped
to second for alleged interference against runner-up Megahertz with
about an eighth of a mile to run.</LD>
<TE>   This "victory'' left Megahertz, who is owned by Michael Bello and
trained by Bobby Frankel, perfect in five American starts, and she is
two for two at today's distance.</TE>
<TE>   The race, won a year ago by longshot Golden Apples, attracted two
others who ran in the American Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Of that pair, Alozaina is the one with the best chance of
surprising the top two.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Arnold Zetcher and trained by Ron McAnally, who's having
an excellent Del Mar meet, Alozaina has been compromised by troubled

<TE>   Race of the day: The third at Del Mar isn't a particularly good
betting race with only five entrants, but it does feature something
unusual. When was the last time the names of all the horses in a

Likely and Motto will be getting together in the $80,000 claimer at
one mile on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Edgar Prado. The jockey continues to sizzle at
Saratoga, having won with half of his 24 mounts during one stretch

Dollar Bill was three for his first 45 at Arlington Park.</TE>

<HD>Steroids Could Be Key Issue</HD>
<DH>Labor: Union makes new proposal on testing, with its
response on revenue sharing and tax due today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While revenue sharing and the payroll tax have been considered the
deal breakers in baseball's bargaining negotiations, steroid testing
might also fit that category, a sudden and surprising development
with only six days to go until the union's Friday strike date.</LD>
<LD>   Rob Manfred, management's lead labor lawyer, seemed to make that
suggestion in his daily conference call with reporters after the
sides devoted Friday to non-economic issues, including testing.</LD>
<LD>   Manfred said that the union had made a new testing proposal that
moved "modestly in our direction" on the elements of discipline and
"how to deal with nutritional supplements and recreational drugs."
But he said it was still not a proposal on which he could reach an
agreement, and in response to questions, he implied that the union
would have to enhance its plan before getting a new labor agreement.</LD>
<TE>   In other words, he was asked, would steroid testing stand in the
way of an agreement even if the sides reached accord on revenue
sharing and payroll tax?</TE>
<TE>   "Not if they change their position," he said, referring to the
union's testing position.</TE>
<TE>   And if they don't?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to comment on that issue in isolation," he said.
"It's like a number of issues that have not yet closed. I simply do
not have a proposal I can close on."</TE>
<TE>   A union lawyer said he did not want to get into a public debate
with Manfred but added, "It's too bad Rob feels the way he does
because [the proposal] is not going to get any better than it is."</TE>
<TE>   Much of this could simply be rhetoric at a time when both sides
can hear the clock ticking and the two core issues, revenue sharing
and luxury tax, remain unresolved. Neither was discussed Friday, but
Manfred said he expects the union to make new proposals on both
today.</TE>
<TE>   Less than 24 hours after negotiators agreed that they have plenty
of time to resolve their remaining differences before Friday's strike
date, Manfred changed the tenor on that as well.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at a time when we need to get at the core issues and see if
we can get them resolved," he said. "The pace on those has to
improve."</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, the testing issue seems to have become an impediment
after it seemed to be just the opposite Aug. 7, when, to Manfred's
applause, the union amended years of resistance to random testing by
proposing two years of unannounced survey testing to determine the
level of use in baseball. If more than 5% tested positive in either
year, the union would then agree to random testing in 2005 and 2006.
If fewer than 5% tested positive, testing would be discontinued and
done only for cause.</TE>
<TE>   In its new proposal, the union addressed management's desire to
have a lower threshold by basically reducing the 5% survey number to
2.5%, with some exceptions. In addition, according to a person close
to the process, the union made a series of adjustments allowing for a
yearly continuation of testing, depending on survey results.</TE>
<TE>   Manfred wasn't specific in regard to his problems with the new
proposal but said he would soon respond to it with one of his own and
added, "The key thing from our perspective is that we want a program
that applies throughout the agreement. No matter what the
consequences are, we want some sort of testing for steroids and drugs
throughout the agreement."</TE>
<TE>   The union lawyer, however, called that a "faulty foundation" on
which to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "Their position is all about public relations," he said. "They're
insisting on some form of testing, even if the survey testing
demonstrates that all the fuss about this is unjustified and that it
isn't as widespread as people thought it was."</TE>
<TE>   As testing emerged as more of a major issue in the bargaining
process than people thought it was, negotiators also spent
considerable time Friday on important but more mundane issues such as
scheduling, player discipline, medical care, licensing programs and
the amateur draft. As Manfred put it: "We have multiple packages of
issues that are in play. It's fair to say that every open issue is
involved in some package. The list of open things is narrowing as we
reach agreement in some areas."</TE>
<TE>   He also said that he does not know one owner, let alone a segment
of owners, who would prefer a work stoppage over a settlement and, in
terms of ratification, "I am not concerned about getting anything
that's in the neighborhood of the proposals now on the table"
ratified.</TE>

<LD>I wrote a long letter about how the average fan can show the players
and the owners that we won't put up with this, and then I realized
that the average fan is weak and could never be as strong-willed as
Major League Baseball.</LD>
<LD>   Strike or not, there will always be someone to pay the excessive
price for a game, it just won't be me.</LD>

<TE>   Excuse me for taking sides with the players, but when was the last
time one of these clubs went out of business? When was the last time
an owner sold one for less than he paid for it? If these rich
playboys want to buy teams and subsidize them, why should we care if
they're technically in the red? It's about as significant as WorldCom
having been technically in the black.</TE>

<TE>   Funny, but I haven't heard a word about the millionaire members of
the players' union planning to share some of their revenue with
teammates whose bank accounts aren't quite so swollen. Come to think
of it, I haven't heard the players offering to share any of the
endorsement money the game put them into position to make with the
owners either.</TE>

<TE>   To hear Marquis Grissom say that salary arbitration and free
agency are for the "betterment" of the game is total hilarity. Salary
arbitration is why mediocre bench players and left-handed "specialty"
relievers are making millions. It's why parking is $8 and a burger,
fries, coke and a program will set you back $20.</TE>
<TE>   Free agency is why there is no loyalty among fans, players and
teams. The only thing this is all for the "betterment" of is your
wallet, Marquis. At least have the guts to admit it.</TE>
<TE>   Please go on strike. I can't wait to strike back.</TE>

<TE>   Tom Glavine said, "The union won't allow a luxury tax ... that's a
salary cap." Earth to Major Tom: The last time I looked, the NFL and
the NBA were being successfully run under salary-cap structures. Why
should Major League Baseball be exempt? Because of its popularity?</TE>
<TE>   It's time for the union to give up on this one. Even Mr. Glavine
must realize that baseball is the fourth-most popular sport in
America today, behind the NFL, NBA and X Games.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Grande</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 40 years ago, Calvin Griffith, the skinflint owner of the
Minnesota Twins, predicted free agency would ruin baseball. More than
anything else, the outrageous salaries of players, along with the
greed and complicity of owners, have brought the game to its knees.</TE>
<TE>   Ain't free enterprise great?</TE>
<TE>   Jerome S. Kleinsasser</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I believe the main problem in baseball today is a lack of pride. I
don't mean the players lack pride in their athletic abilities, their
large salaries or the hero worship they so often receive, and I don't
mean the owners lack pride in their financial empires, their
country-club memberships, or their massive stadiums.</TE>
<TE>   What I am talking about is a total lack of pride on the part of
the fans. It is incomprehensible that any self-respecting person
would continue to support these clowns after you have been shown time
and again that neither the owners nor players give a damn about the
fans.</TE>
<TE>   If a strike happens and the fans return afterward, you should all
hang your heads in shame.</TE>

<TE>   As a lifelong Kansas City Royal fan, I sit here and ask myself--
how, in the name of God, will I survive if the players strike?</TE>
<TE>   Gary Durrett</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For quite a few years now, the conventional wisdom, correct or
not, has been that baseball players are overpaid.</TE>
<TE>   The players have implicitly endorsed this view by regularly
claiming that it's not their fault--if the owners are willing to pay
these exorbitant salaries, why shouldn't they take them?</TE>
<TE>   Now, in a display of unity unmatched since losing their infamous
reserve clause, the owners say they are no longer willing. This has
not deterred the players, however, who resist any meaningful
restraints on the annual escalation of their salaries.</TE>
<TE>   The owners claim that a majority of teams is losing money and,
moreover, that their proposals are aimed primarily at bringing about
competitive balance.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for them, most people, the players included, assume
that the figures bandied about by the owners are as reliable as those
of their brethren in corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   What everyone needs is an honest, independent audit. With verified
numbers, no matter what they showed, the owners would still be on
solid ground in pushing their luxury-tax and revenue-sharing
proposals because competitive balance is needed to sustain baseball.
The players would have the opportunity to mount a defensible position
in contesting the lines where these numbers should fall as they would
affect salaries. A reasonable middle ground would probably be
available because neither party would be able to blithely accuse the
other of being driven solely by greed.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain: A strike would be as bad for baseball as
would the Yankees' signing of free agent Vladimir Guerrero at
season's end.</TE>
<TE>   Bart Robertson</TE>
<TE>   Torrance</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I wish the owners would, for once, develop a spine and stand up to
Donald Fehr and the players. The owners should let the players strike
and then declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This would cancel all player
contracts and allow the owners to put in a more balanced and sane
economic structure.</TE>
<TE>   Most of us true baseball fans these days are loyal to the game and
the team. Players come and go. There are enough minor league,
college, and international players to fill the major league rosters.
Eventually, when the current major league players realize that the
game is larger than they are and not vice versa, they will come back.</TE>

Silence by referring to him as the legend he was, it was
disappointing that the photo used above his Aug. 19 obituary was of
his loss in the 1990 Hollywood Gold Cup, the final race of his
career. A much more appropriate choice would have been a photo of one
of his wins, including victories in three of the four most important
races in America: the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Breeders'

<LD>It's rare when an opportunity arises with a win-win outcome. Yet,
that's exactly the prospect for UCLA football this season.</LD>
<LD>   The offense has Cory Paus and an experienced line back. The
defense has plenty of players returning. Though the schedule is
difficult, don't be surprised if the Bruins are 4-1 and a top-20 team
when Oregon comes to town.</LD>
<LD>   If the season turns sour, UCLA finally will get the makeover it
needs. Bob Toledo's 17-18 record since losing to Miami is an
embarrassment. His finger-pointing is infamous. Unfortunately for the
coach, there is a new AD in town. Another mediocre season or 27-0
drubbing by USC probably will result in Toledo's dismissal, an event
that probably will put UCLA football back on the map.</LD>
<TE>   If you are a UCLA fan, enjoy this season and the rare opportunity
to come out ahead--win or lose.</TE>

<LD>It is ludicrous to criticize Shaq for postponing his surgery.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers have a 3 1/2-month off-season. Football players have
six to seven months. Shaq takes a worse physical and emotional
pounding (100 games-plus) than any football player (20-23 games). In
addition, Shaq played in excruciating pain all last season. So Shaq
should give up his entire vacation time to undergo immediate surgery
and rehabilitation?</LD>
<LD>   Laker fans are blessed to have someone who is as committed as Shaq
is to excellence. Doesn't he deserve some rest after winning three
consecutive championships? Give the guy a break.</LD>

pain.</TE>

<TE>   The Lakers counter all this with the signing of Jannero Pargo and
A.J. Guyton. Huh?</TE>

<LD>Ten fillies and mares will be trying tonight to earn a trip to Texas.</LD>
<LD>   The winner of the $31,000 Ford California Distaff Challenge, the
10th of 11 races on tonight's program, earns a spot in the $75,000
Ford Distaff Challenge at Lone Star Park near Dallas on Nov. 2.</LD>
<LD>   One of the main contenders in the 400-yard Challenge is defending
champion Big On Charm.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Double Bar S Ranch and trained by W.G. Baber, the
5-year-old Sir Alibi mare beat Linda Te Chick by a nose in winning
this race in 2001. The California-bred is winless in four starts
since, but will try to turn things around tonight under G.R. Carter,
who last rode her more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   From the inside out, the rest of the field includes Imjumpn, who
beat Big On Charm by a length on Aug. 4, 2001; Royal Dip, the Golden
State Derby winner; Austiana, who is shipping from Texas for trainer
Janet Van Bebber; First Place Princess, Sport Report, More Heart, Ity
Bitty Rarity, WCR Rubys Diamond and Allurist.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Miss Absolut. 2. Fat Tuesday. 3. I Dream Of Flyin.
4. Drivers Seat. 5. Salty Toast. 6. Would She. 7. Sell Short. 8. IB
Snow. 9. Shania Fame. 10. Allurist. 11. Lets Disco First.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Miss Absolut and Sign It Sadie in the first; Fat
Tuesday, Murmuring Sea and Amok in the second; I Dream Of Flyin,
Darlenes Sugar Chick and Saszy in the third, and Drivers Seat and Yes
I'm No Fool in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Shez Simply Fabulous could fire off the bench
in the eighth for trainer Donna McArthur. Grateful Heart is better
than shown and could wake up in the ninth.</TE>

<HD>Strike Would Leave Triple-A Teams Intact</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A major league players' strike might benefit the Dodgers' and Angels'
triple-A affiliates, whose postseason rosters would remain intact
instead of potentially being ravaged by Sept. 1 call-ups.</LD>
<LD>   The Las Vegas 51s would keep all nine of their players on the
Dodgers' 40-man roster and be at full strength heading into the
Pacific Coast League playoffs if the strike--scheduled to begin
Friday unless players and owners reach a new collective bargaining
agreement--wipes out the rest of the major league season.</LD>
<LD>   "If we end up having our full complement of people, that bodes
well for us because we have a hell of a group," said Las Vegas
General Manager Don Logan. "It's a positive, there's no question
about that."</LD>
<TE>   While Las Vegas (78-54) has already clinched its first playoff
berth since 1996, the Salt Lake Stingers (73-60) are hoping their
three-game lead over second-place Omaha in the Central Division holds
up over the last 11 regular-season games. The Stingers have eight
players on the Angels' 40-man roster and could lose stars such as
slugger Robb Quinlan, who is batting .335 and leads the league with
103 runs batted in, if the strike is averted.</TE>
<TE>   Logan said it is difficult to assess whether his players would
prefer a big league call-up or a chance to lead the 51s to the PCL
title.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's different," he said. "They've put one of our best
seasons together and I think they'd like they'd to see it through.
But there's nothing like Major League Baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas opens its first-round series against Edmonton on Sept. 4
in Las Vegas. The 51s could meet the Stingers in the PCL championship
series, which begins Sept. 10. "That," Logan said, "would be great."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger System</TE>
<TE>   Two other Dodger affiliates could also qualify for the playoffs.
Double-A Jacksonville (33-25) is a half-game ahead of Greenville in
the Eastern Division of the Southern League, while the rookie-level
Gulf Coast League Dodgers (32-24) are 3 1/2 games ahead of the
Marlins in the Eastern Division of the GCL.</TE>
<TE>   * Las Vegas third baseman Phil Hiatt set a franchise record for
home runs in a career Tuesday during the 51s' 6-0 victory over
Fresno. Hiatt, who hit a league-leading 44 homers last season, led
off the second inning with his 17th homer of 2002, giving him 61
overall. He surpassed Dave Staton, who hit 60 homers in 293 games
with Las Vegas from 1991-95.</TE>
<TE>   * Pitcher Joel Hanrahan, who has two no-hitters for Vero Beach,
has been promoted to Jacksonville. Hanrahan went 10-6 with a 4.20
earned-run average for Vero Beach with a team-high 139 strikeouts.
Hanrahan's no-hitters were April 21 and July 4.... Las Vegas
right-hander Robert Ellis is 3-0 with a 0.96 ERA in his last four
starts. In his last three starts, Ellis has not given up an earned
run in 21 innings.... Dodger director of player development Bill
Bavasi said the team "hasn't discounted" the possibility of a return
to the California League but that it probably won't happen next
season.... Jacksonville plays its last game at 47-year-old Wolfson
Park on Sept. 2 against the Orlando Rays. The Suns will move into a
new 10,000-seat ballpark next season.</TE>
<TE>   Angel System</TE>
<TE>   While Salt Lake is fighting to make the playoffs, two other Angel
affiliates already have clinched berths. The Class-A Cedar Rapids
Kernels (36-23) qualified for the Midwest League playoffs for the
first time since 1997 by finishing second in the Western Division's
first-half standings. The Kernels, who lead Quad City by one game in
the second-half standings, open their first-round, best-of-three
playoff series Sept. 3.</TE>
<TE>   The rookie-level Provo Angels of the Pioneer League (10-15), in
third place in the second-half standings, also guaranteed themselves
a playoff berth by winning a first-half title.</TE>
<TE>   * One reason for Cedar Rapid's success has been a consistent
bullpen. Kernel relievers have a combined ERA of 2.68. They have
given up 364 hits in 442 2/3 innings, walking 161 and striking out
440.</TE>
<TE>   Three relievers have ERAs of less than 1.10. Joel Peralta has
given up five earned runs in 41 2/3 innings (a 1.08 ERA); Steve
Andrade has given up five earned runs in 47 1/3 innings (0.95) and
struck out 80; and Jon Rouwenhorst, who also has three starts, has a
1.02 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Joe Saunders, the Angels' top pick in the recent amateur
draft, has continued to impress since his promotion to Cedar Rapids.
A starter, he gave up only four hits in seven shutout innings Monday
in a 1-0 victory over Beloit. Saunders (3-0, 0.47 ERA) walked a
batter and struck out two.</TE>
<TE>   * Cedar Rapids became the fourth Angel affiliate to extend its
contract with the parent club, signing a two-year extension. Cedar
Rapids, Salt Lake, double-A Arkansas and Provo will remain partnered
with the Angels through 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel contract with Class-A Rancho Cucamonga expires after
this season. Quake General Manager Pat Filippone has been barred from
discussing negotiations since Wednesday, when Mike Moore, president
of the National Assn. of Professional Baseball Leagues, sent what
Filippone termed "an unusual" letter to minor league officials
insisting they refrain from commenting on contract negotiations with
major league teams.</TE>
<TE>   Filippone told reporters on Tuesday, the day before the gag order
was instituted, that if he decided to file for reaffiliation--a move
that would allow him to talk to all clubs, including the Angels--he
would do so Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   * Salt Lake outfielder Nathan Haynes' franchise-record 24-game
hitting streak--the fifth-longest in the minors this season--ended
Aug. 15. Haynes went 36 for 101 (.356) during the streak, improving
his average from .254 to .297.</TE>
<TE>   * Mesa right-hander Daniel Arias, who leads the Arizona League
with 14 saves, has walked only three batters and struck out 37 in 26
appearances. Arias is 1-2 with a 1.27 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   California League</TE>
<TE>   Lancaster first baseman Corey Myers is closing in on Brent Gates'
league-record 35-game hitting streak, set with Modesto in 1992. Myers
had amassed a 26-game streak heading into a three-game weekend series
against Visalia and is batting .422 in August with 15 RBIs in 15
games.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time Jimmy Spencer raced at Bristol Motor Speedway, he was
bumped to second place.</LD>
<LD>   There was no tapping on his return trip--no one could get close
enough to him to even try--as Spencer easily won the NASCAR Food City
250 on Friday night in Bristol, Tenn.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Spencer had to slow to avoid the spinning car of Tim
Sauter with two laps to go. That gave Scott Wimmer enough space to
close the gap on Spencer's lead, but Spencer held off the challenge
to win his first Busch Grand National Series race of the season and
12th of his career.</LD>
<TE>   Wimmer finished a career-best second. Busch series points leader
Greg Biffle was third and was followed by Mike McLaughlin and Jeff
Green.</TE>
<TE>   Biffle, who entered the race with a 56-point lead over Keller in
the standings, stretched it to 78.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Gordon, winless in 31 consecutive races, took the first step
toward ending his drought by winning the pole for the NASCAR Winston
Cup Sharpie 500 at Bristol, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon ran a lap in his Chevrolet around Bristol Motor Speedway at
124.034 mph to earn the top starting spot for tonight's race.</TE>
<TE>   Dale Earnhardt Jr. qualified second in a Chevrolet with a lap at
123.937. Michael Waltrip qualified third in 123.905.</TE>
<TE>   It's the second consecutive race the two Dale Earnhardt Inc.
teammates have had strong qualifying runs. They were first and second
last week at Michigan International Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cristiano da Matta guaranteed himself another front-row start by
winning the provisional pole for the inaugural CART Montreal
Molson-Indy.</TE>
<TE>   He earned another standings point and leads Patrick Carpentier and
Bruno Junqueira by 43 points. He can add one more in final qualifying
today.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta's Newman-Haas Lola-Toyota got around the 2.709-mile,
14-turn Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on Notre Dame Island in 1 minute
19.465 seconds, which translates to 122.279 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams beat Daniela Hantuchova, 6-3, 6-3, in the Pilot Pen
and will play Lindsay Davenport in the championship for the third
time in four years.</TE>
<TE>   The three-time defending champion, Williams is unbeaten in her
four years at New Haven, Conn., and has been stretched to three sets
only twice.</TE>
<TE>   With serves consistently higher than 110 mph, she overwhelmed the
seventh-seeded Hantuchova, who managed to win points on the strength
of her precision groundstrokes and occasional well-timed lobs and
drops, but could do little with Williams' serves.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport cruised in her semifinal earlier, beating Anastasia
Myskina, 6-2, 6-2. She advanced to her second final in four
tournaments since returning in July from knee surgery that sidelined
her nine months.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Juan Ignacio Chela, who has climbed almost 800 places in the world
rankings over the last 16 months, defeated Mardy Fish, 7-5, 6-3, to
advance to the semifinals of the TD Waterhouse Cup at Commack, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Chela, 25, who was suspended for three months and fined by the ATP
last year for illegal use of steroids, was ranked No. 810 in April
2001. He's currently No. 26.</TE>
<TE>   He advanced to today's semifinals against Alex Corretja, who led,
5-2, when Paul-Henri Mathieu retired because of a left toe blister.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo, who led Brazil to its fifth World Cup title by scoring a
tournament-high eight goals, will return to Italian club Inter Milan
after trade talks with Spain's Real Madrid fell apart.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't clear if the striker will start Tuesday, when Inter
plays Portugal's Sporting Lisbon in a Champions League qualifier.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The defending world champion U.S. women's national soccer team
will play Russia on Sept. 29 in Uniondale, N.Y., in the opening game
of the four-nation U.S. Women's Cup, which runs through Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans also will play Australia on Oct. 2 and Italy on Oct.
6, with both games part of doubleheaders in Cary, S.C., U.S. Soccer
announced this week. The Washington Freedom plays the Carolina
Courage in Founders Cup II, the Women's United Soccer Assn.
championship game, today in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Dwain Chambers beat Maurice Greene in the 100 meters for the
fourth time this season and, if that wasn't bad enough, Tim
Montgomery beat the world record holder for the second time in a
week.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers charged through a talented field to win in 9.98 seconds
at the Norwich Union Grand Prix meet at Crystal Palace in London.
Montgomery was second in 10.05 and Greene third in 10.06.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's race, Marion Jones took advantage of a fast start
to beat Zhanna Pintusevich-Block in 10.97.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers signed free agent Soumaila Samake, a 7-foot center who
averaged 3.8 points and 6.0 rebounds in 18.3 minutes on their Summer
Pro League team.</TE>
<TE>   Samake was a second-round draft pick of the New Jersey Nets in
2000. He played in 34 games for the Nets in the 2000-01 season,
averaging 1.4 points and 1.6 rebounds in 6.6 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Orlando Magic exercised its option on guard Mike Miller,
keeping him with the team through the 2003-04 season.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to make about $2.7 million next season and $3.4
million the following season.</TE>

<LD>Randy Moss had four catches for 76 yards and a touchdown, leading the
Minnesota Vikings to a 14-10 victory over a diluted version of the
Tennessee Titans in the teams' second-to-last exhibition game Friday
night at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Guiding the Vikings' first-team offense for one half, Daunte
Culpepper had some overthrows during a 10-for-15, 137-yard
performance.</LD>
<LD>   A perfectly thrown 67-yard pass to Moss on the first snap of the
second quarter was the highlight of Culpepper's night.</LD>
<TE>   Beating Dainon Sidney deep, Moss--to whom Minnesota has pledged to
throw 40% of its passes--was tackled inches from the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   Culpepper's sneak two plays later gave the Vikings a 7-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   With one minute remaining before halftime, Moss capped a 10-play,
75-yard drive against mostly second-stringers with a wide-open,
four-yard touchdown reception on a quick slant pattern that made it
14-3.</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Samari Rolle was one of three Tennessee regulars who
didn't play because of injuries, and the Titans held out six other
starters who were slightly hurt--among them quarterback Steve McNair,
running back Eddie George and tight end Frank Wycheck.</TE>
<TE>   New England 23, Carolina 3--Tom Brady threw his first touchdown
passes of the exhibition season, to David Givens and Christian
Fauria, as the Patriots won at Foxboro, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Vinatieri, whose 48-yard field goal on the last play won the
Super Bowl in February, had three field goals and is 10 for 11 in
exhibition games.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 13, Philadelphia 12--For the second consecutive week,
the Eagles missed a two-point conversion late in the fourth quarter,
losing at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hasselbeck's one-yard touchdown run with 1:19 left in the game
got Philadelphia (1-2) within a point.</TE>
<TE>   But Rod Smart dropped a pass from Hasselbeck on the conversion
attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Blake threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Javin Hunter and Matt
Stover kicked two field goals to lead the Ravens (2-1).</TE>
<TE>   Jacksonville 24, Chicago 16--David Garrard led the Jaguars to 17
second-half points and a comeback victory at Champaign, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in New Castle, Pa., have issued an arrest warrant for
Jeff McCurley, who is competing to be the San Francisco 49ers' backup
center, on charges he altered a prescription to get painkillers....
Rams' defensive end Leonard Little sustained a concussion after
fainting in a restaurant, St. Louis Coach Mike Martz said. Little was
expected to be released from a hospital today and might not be ready
for the season opener Sept. 8 in Denver.... Randall Cunningham
officially retired after 16 seasons in the NFL.</TE>

<HD>Munro Leads Astros to Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pete Munro found out another reason he likes playing for Manager Jimy
Williams.</LD>
<LD>   Munro (4-2) had an admittedly shaky game but still managed to last
five innings and help the Houston Astros beat the Cincinnati Reds,
6-4, Friday night at Houston.</LD>
<LD>   The right-hander gave up four runs and seven hits and will
remember facing Ken Griffey, who went 4 for 4, in the fifth inning
more than anything.</LD>
<TE>   The Reds had scored two runs to pull within 4-3 and Griffey
singled in another run to tie the game. Munro was just surprised he
was still on the mound with lefty specialist Pedro Borbon fresh in
the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   After Griffey tied the score, Munro got Austin Kearns to ground
out to end the inning. The Astros then scored two runs in the bottom
of the inning to give Munro the win. It was the Astros' third win in
a row and moved them a season-high eight games above .500.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Ausmus and Adam Everett hit consecutive RBI doubles in the
fifth to give the Astros the win. Brian Hunter added two RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said he thought Munro deserved the chance to get the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Pete has really given us something extra this season," Williams
said. "He's given it to us in relief and starting. He never
complains."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 3, Chicago 2--Byung-Hyun Kim struck out Sammy Sosa with
runners on second and third to end the game at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than intentionally walk Sosa, the Diamondbacks decided to
pitch to him because of Kim's success against the slugger.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa swung and missed at a 1-2 pitch, leaving him hitless in nine
at-bats with seven strikeouts lifetime against Kim. Kim got his 32nd
save.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Gonzalez had a two-run homer for NL West-leading Arizona,
which won for the 12th in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 18, Florida 2--The Padres, who had 18 hits, set season
highs for runs and hits in their highest-scoring game since May 19,
2001, when they beat Montreal, 20-7. The Marlins gave up their most
runs since losing, 20-3, to Atlanta on Oct. 5, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres did most of their damage in the bottom of the fifth
inning when they scored nine runs. Bubba Trammell hit his second
homer of the game in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Trammell went 4 for 5 with four runs and four RBIs. He hit a
two-run homer in the second inning off Carl Pavano (3-10) and a solo
shot to start the scoring in the fifth against reliever Vic
Darensbourg.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 5, St. Louis 4--Bobby Abreu homered to lead off the
top of the 14th inning to give the Phillies their third consecutive
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Abreu, who entered the game with one hit in 12 at-bats against the
Cardinals this season, went 3 for 6 with a run-scoring single in the
first. He hit his 15th homer over the wall in left-center on a 2-1
pitch from rookie Kevin Joseph (0-1).</TE>
<TE>   It was only the third loss in 14 games for the Cardinals, who lead
the NL Central by five games over the Astros. The marathon lasted 5
hours 13 minutes--the longest game for both teams this season.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 10, New York 4--Jay Payton tormented his former team,
homering and driving in four runs at Coors Field as the Rockies
handed the Mets their 12th loss in a row. It's the Mets' sixth
longest losing streak in franchise history and the longest in 22
years, since they lost 13 in a row from Aug. 31-Sept. 12, 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 7, San Francisco 2--Tomo Ohka gave up Barry Bonds' 602nd
homer, but he also pitched 7 2/3 strong innings and drove home the
go-ahead run with a squeeze bunt at San Francisco. Ohka (11-6) won
his third consecutive decision, yielding six hits and three walks as
the Expos snapped San Francisco's four-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 6, Milwaukee 3--Adam Hyzdu hit a grand slam and the
Pirates continued their success against the Brewers. They are 13-4
against the Brewers this season, including a 7-1 record at Miller
Park. Reliever Jayson Durocher (1-1) got out of a bases-loaded jam in
the sixth inning, but wasn't so fortunate in the seventh while trying
to protect a 3-2 lead.</TE>

<HD>Martinez Aces Test Against Washburn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Angels needed Pedro Martinez Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   They got Jarrod Washburn.</LD>
<LD>   Washburn is having a splendid season. He has made himself the ace
of the Angels. His 15-5 record is worthy of national notice.</LD>
<TE>   But Washburn couldn't make the Red Sox look as if they were
batting during an earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez did that to the Angels. Martinez, with his fastball that
moves seven ways, with his curveball that creates a parabola, with
his roiling changeup, made it seem as if the Angels were standing on
a rocking, rolling fault line instead of the batter's box at Fenway
Park.</TE>
<TE>   "Pedro is an amazing human being," Red Sox Manager Grady Little
said after Boston had beaten the Angels, 4-1, and Martinez had
pitched eight magnificent innings, had given up only a lonely, solo
home run to Troy Glaus, had moved his record to 17-3.</TE>
<TE>   In a pennant race where only a game or two separates the top three
teams in the American League West and the top three teams in the AL
wild-card race, it is good to have "an amazing human being" take the
mound.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels swung helplessly, hopelessly, as they trudged, one
after another, with their heads down to and from the plate, it was
clear. This game had been lost when Little decided to hold Martinez
out of his scheduled Thursday night start against Texas and save him
for this test against a team Boston is trailing in the wild-card hunt
and against a young pitcher who is coming into his own.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn could have taken it as a compliment that the Red Sox
juggled their pitching rotation so Martinez, the best the AL has to
offer, suddenly was rescheduled.</TE>
<TE>   But it was clear Washburn was not going to seize this chance to
mark himself as an equal to Martinez, as a man who wins no matter
what. Boston's leadoff hitter, Ricky Henderson, blasted a line drive
to center. Darin Erstad made a lunging, leaning, running catch, a
great play, but this was not the way Washburn should have been
sending a message, a Martinez message, a message that says, "You
can't hit me. Don't even think about it."</TE>
<TE>   And that's what the Angels needed.</TE>
<TE>   They needed an ace who walked off the mound after the top of the
eighth and raised his right thumb in triumph and who left the
opposing batters mostly swinging and missing at noise or pounding the
baseball weakly into the dirt or weakly into the air, harmless puffs
of popcorn drifting softly into the gloves of the outfielders.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels needed an ace who smiled as he walked onto the field,
who threw with the light, live arm of a man who believes every game
is his victory instead of only hoping it is.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez is supposed to have a weak arm, a sore arm. His velocity
is down, the angst of the Red Sox nation is up. Martinez had to be
shut down last year with a torn labrum in his pitching shoulder. On
opening day 2002, Martinez gave up nine hits and eight runs in less
than four innings, and all of Boston was certain the season was over,
that Martinez's career was finished.</TE>
<TE>   "Pedro keeps getting better and better," Little said Friday night.
"He keeps getting stronger and stronger. It looks like he'll make it
through the season."</TE>
<TE>   You think?</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, 30, is a pitching virtuoso, a Pavarotti. Just as you
don't have to be a musician to understand Pavarotti's greatness, you
don't have to be a pitching coach to appreciate Martinez. Just watch.</TE>
<TE>   His pitches are fluid, washing up to the batters as if they were
waves on the beach, relentlessly powerful and mesmerizing. Martinez
loves what he does. He embraces the pressures of pitching here, with
the panting fanatics who revel in doom and distrust any good fortune,
with the ache of cursed history in the bones of every Red Sox fan.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand my responsibility," Martinez said. He was speaking
of being pulled from the lineup and his expected start on Thursday.
He was speaking of the importance of knocking down the Angel ace, of
starting this critical four-game series the right way.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez understands responsibility, but he understands so much
more.</TE>
<TE>   "Just watch the way he uses the plate," Boston catcher Jason
Varitek said.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez is one of the few pitchers today who will come hard
inside after a hitter the way Don Drysdale, Bob Gibson, Jim Bunning
used to. "Pedro uses all of the plate," Varitek said.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed unfair. The Angels didn't know where to look for the
ball. It was never the same place twice and Martinez drove the Angels
to desperation.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth inning, having fallen behind, 4-0, Orlando Palmeiro
singled with one out. Garret Anderson followed with a well-struck
double, a hit that might have meant something, a hit after a hit and
maybe a sign Martinez could be taken. But Palmeiro was sent around
third and toward home, chugging hard, testing the sometimes lazy arm
and concentration of Boston right fielder Manny Ramirez.</TE>
<TE>   But Ramirez was paying attention. His throw to cut-off man Rey
Sanchez was accurate. Palmeiro was left to heave himself desperately
at Varitek, hoping to jar the ball loose. Neither happened. Palmeiro
was out. Brad Fullmer swung weakly at the next pitch and was out.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn never made the Red Sox feel desperate. He gave up a hit
in the first. He hit the first batter of the second inning, Shea
Hillenbrand, gave up two more hits and was lucky only one run scored
because Sanchez's line drive to Palmeiro was hit so hard that it was
a 9-6 double play to end the inning. The third inning was the end,
three more runs to the Red Sox. It might as well have been 10.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said, "I thought it was a well-pitched
game on both sides."</TE>
<TE>   But against Martinez well-pitched isn't good enough.</TE>
<TE>   Only a masterpiece will do.</TE>

condition at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles and is expected to stay
through the weekend after collapsing in practice on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Hospital spokesman Steve Rutledge said there is no timetable for
the release of Chamberlin, a 6-foot-3, 280-pound sophomore offensive
lineman. The 14-year-old continues to suffer from dehydration and
symptoms related to heatstroke.</LD>
<LD>   "His vital signs are stable," Rutledge said. "If they tend to move
toward not being stable, he may be moved to serious."</LD>
<TE>   Chamberlin collapsed near the end of a practice early Wednesday
and was rushed to Glendale Memorial Hospital. He was transferred to
Childrens Hospital in critical condition but has improved steadily
since then.</TE>

<HD>Golfer Satarak Leaves UC Irvine After One Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From staff reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walailak Satarak, who was the Big West Conference's women's golfer of
the year as a freshman at UC Irvine, will attempt to turn pro after
one collegiate season, Irvine Coach Kelly Crawford said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Satarak reached the quarterfinals of the U.S. Women's Amateur
Championship last week before losing to Pepperdine senior Lindsey
Wright. She was named freshman of the year by the National Golf
Coaches Assn., winning three tournaments and recording a 73.95 stroke
average.</LD>
<LD>   "From a coaching standpoint, losing your No. 1 player is going to
make things more challenging," Crawford said. "But she and her family
felt that it was a good time for her to pursue a professional career.
I think it was always the plan for her to turn pro early."</LD>
<TE>   Satarak, a former Paramount High standout, left for LPGA
qualifying school Friday and will play for Thailand internationally.</TE>

<LD>Iain Percy and Steve Mitchell, mere rookies among many of the world's
best sailors, won the final race of the 81st Nautica 2002 Star Class
World Championship on Friday at Marina del Rey to give Britain its
first title in the venerable class.</LD>
<LD>   Neither Percy, 26, the 2000 Olympic Finn class gold medalist from
Winchester, nor Mitchell, 32, of London, had sailed a Star until 10
months ago, although they had already worked their way up to the No.
17 ranking in the class.</LD>
<LD>   With finishes of 4-1-3-2 in the 103-boat fleet in the previous
four races, they entered the sixth and final race with a four-point
lead over 1990 champions Torben Grael and Marcelo Ferreira of Brazil
and nine points over France's Xavier Rohart and Yannick Adde.
Although Grael finished fourth and Rohart 10th, neither threatened
seriously Percy and Mitchell, who led at every mark.</LD>

<HD>Former NFL Player Simmons Dies in Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDEPENDENCE, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Former NFL linebacker Wayne Simmons, a starter on the Green Bay
Packers' 1997 Super Bowl championship team, was killed early Friday
when his car crashed and burst into flames.</LD>
<LD>   Simmons, 32, was driving too fast and weaving through traffic on
an interstate in suburban Kansas City when his Mercedes veered off
the freeway about 2:45 a.m., witnesses told police.</LD>
<LD>   The car rolled several times and landed in a ditch, then the
engine caught fire. Other motorists tried to get Simmons out, but
they couldn't unfasten his seat belt.</LD>
<TE>   Firefighters put out the fire and pulled Simmons from the car. An
autopsy was planned.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, Simmons was a friend of Derrick Thomas, a Kansas
City teammate who died of injuries related to a car accident in
February 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons was traded by Green Bay to Kansas City during the 1997
season. He was cut after the Chiefs lost to Denver, 30-7, on Nov. 17,
1998.</TE>
<TE>   With a Monday night television audience watching, the Chiefs
committed five personal-foul penalties on Denver's last touchdown
drive: three by Thomas, one by Chester McGlockton and the other by
Simmons.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons was picked up by Buffalo and finished the season with the
Bills. He didn't play again in the NFL.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Finally Putting Their Game in Drive</HD>
<DH>WNBA playoffs: A victory over Utah today would be their
seventh consecutive and would put them in title series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>That roll the Sparks were looking to get on the last third of the
regular season? They seem to have found it.</LD>
<LD>   After an 11-1 start, including a nine-game winning streak, the
Sparks were 14-6 the rest of the way. But until the Aug. 8 loss to
Houston that threatened to throw their year into disarray, the most
victories Los Angeles could string was four.</LD>
<LD>   Since that Aug. 8 game, however, the Sparks have won six
consecutive--their last three regular-season games and all three
playoff games, among them Thursday's 75-67 decision over the Utah
Starzz in the Western Conference best-of-three finals. Another win
over the Starzz today at Staples Center will put the defending league
champions back into the WNBA Finals.</LD>
<TE>   The Sparks are winning no matter the circumstances--at home, on
the road, playing their best or just getting by--and their confidence
is building.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting like the feeling we had last year, when the ball
always seemed to find an open player," said Lisa Leslie, after a
short practice Friday. "And when the ball finds the open player, the
game is a lot simpler. Right now we're playing excellent team
defense, even though teams don't want to give us credit for it yet."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the changes Utah has to make, according to Coach Candi
Harvey, are basic.</TE>
<TE>   "We had talked about rebounding in winning this series because it
won the Houston series," she said. "But [even though Utah had a 38-37
edge Thursday] we didn't get the job done on the boards. When you
give that good a team extra shot opportunities, bad things are going
to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Utah also needs more from its guard duo of Marie Ferdinand and
Adrienne Goodson. Goodson's seven points were her second-worst
scoring night of the season. Ferdinand had 13, but the Sparks'
defense gave her only nine shots.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the adjustments are on their behalf," said Spark Coach
Michael Cooper. "I think it will be a game situation adjustment.
We'll come out, and whatever they do, we'll call time out and try to
work through it. And I'm sure they're gonna do some different things.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have to limit the field-goal attempts of Ferdinand and
Goodson, because they can get Utah going. So our defense has been
geared toward them; they'll always see a player and a half. We want
to make them become passers. We don't want them to pass to people for
easy layups, but we have to get the ball out of their hands."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although Leslie was scoreless in the second half Thursday and
finished with 12 points, Cooper called her performance "one of the
smarter games" he has seen her play this season.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't try to force anything," Cooper said. "She did what she
had to do to help us win. That's why I say she is an MVP.</TE>
<TE>   "MVPs don't necessarily have to do it [by scoring]. They can help
by passing to the appropriate people, getting offensive rebounds,
slowing the team down when necessary. Even though she is a center,
rather than the point guard, she still has control over what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie agreed that there had been no need to force things. "We had
plenty of fastbreak opportunities," she said. "And there were times I
was passing because DeLisha [Milton] was cutting to the basket."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even though they won, the Sparks have areas they want to improve.
Missing 12 of 33 free throws did not go over well, nor did shooting
35.3% from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the presence of Utah's 7-foot-2 center, Margo Dydek,
Leslie said that she should have made more than three of her 12
shots. "I have to finish some of my inside shots, whether I think I'm
fouled or not," she said.</TE>

<HD>Key Deadline Nears ... for Postseason Ticket Money</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a possible strike looming, Major League Baseball teams have
nonetheless begun collecting substantial deposits for playoff tickets
from season-ticket holders. Or are hoping to collect.</LD>
<LD>   "Until I know they're not going on strike, I don't want to give
them a dime," said Ed Huff, an Orange resident who shares an Angel
season-ticket package with his mother, Lois.</LD>
<LD>   Huff's resistance will be tested. The team has instituted a
deadline of Friday--the day the Major League Players Assn. has made
its strike deadline--for receiving full payment from season-ticket
holders for playoff tickets to all home American League division
series, championship series and World Series games.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels' strips range in price from $370 for a child's seat to
$1,040 for a Diamond Club seat.</TE>
<TE>   An Angel official who requested anonymity said the Aug. 30 date
was determined before the players had set their strike date, and
added, "We'd like to have the payment in our offices by the 30th, but
we won't quibble if they get here with an Aug. 30 postmark."</TE>
<TE>   Other clubs have set other deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger season-ticket holders have until Sept. 12 to send in their
orders. Seattle Mariner fans have a Sept. 4 postmark deadline. The
7,000 Oakland A's season-ticket holders have until Sept. 9.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't wait until the last minute on this," said Ken Pries, the
A's vice president of broadcasting and communications. "If we wait
until we clinch a playoff spot, that's an operational nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   Pries said he speaks from experience.</TE>
<TE>   "When we got in [to the playoffs] on the last game two years ago,
we had 25,000 people standing in will-call lines on game day," Pries
said. "Teams handle it differently. I would say the Angels deserve
some slack on this. They haven't been in this [playoff] position for
a while. They're just trying to make sure they handle it as smoothly
as possible."</TE>
<TE>   The playoff-bound Minnesota Twins have introduced another wrinkle.
Customers who are not season-ticket holders can guarantee postseason
ticket priority by including $200 nonrefundable deposits for 2003
season tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Bradley, 25, of Newport Beach pitched in with two friends to
buy a 20-game package from the Angels this season. He said he had no
problem with the collection policy and would mail off his money by
next week. He is not thrilled by the strike threat, though.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think it's ridiculous that they're even considering a
strike," he said. "It's been an incredible season [for the Angels],
the way they come back so often. They're overachieving guys playing
their hearts out. But if they go on strike and ruin this season, I'm
done with baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Huff, who spent $2,407 for his two terrace-level aisle seats
within shouting distance of the owner's box, said ownership's
handling of the ticket policy is another example of the game's major
flaw: greed.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball officials say that teams typically deposit the
playoff-ticket cash in bank accounts earning 4.5% to 5.5% in
interest. If 10,000 season-ticket holders in Seattle send in their
playoff money--Mariner playoff strips range from $900 to $1,270--the
team will have about $10 million. Drawing 30 days' worth of interest
at 5.5%, the Mariners will realize about $45,833.</TE>
<TE>   Pries of the A's and Dodger spokesman John Olguin say their teams
will refund the full amount or remaining deposit one day after their
teams are eliminated from the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Huff, however, said the Angels' letter requesting the payment did
not detail the refund policy.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked an usher about how long it'd take to get the money back,
and he told me, 'No longer than November,' " Huff said. "Well, that's
a long time for them to have my money, especially if there are no
playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   An Angel official said the team would refund the unspent money to
fans no more than 21 days after the team's season ends.</TE>
<TE>   "What if the players strike? How long would I have to wait until
they decide the season is over?" Huff asked. "I don't like them
sitting on my money like that, but if you're an Angel fan who's
waited a long time for a year like this, you really have no choice
but to send them the check."</TE>
<TE>   Joe DiBenedetto, a 14-year Angel season-ticket holder from
Fullerton, has no such qualms. He said he'd told the Angels after
their September playoff collapse of 1998 to apply the playoff deposit
toward his 1999 season tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "As someone who uses my [four] season tickets for business and
pleasure, and pays for them out of my business account, this is not a
big deal," said DiBenedetto, who owns an Orange County
packaging/crating business. "I've already sent off the $3,400 for the
strips and parking."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a continuing effort to eliminate the off-the-field problems that
have plagued his program, UCLA Coach Bob Toledo has trotted out
everyone from NFL player representatives to FBI agents to speak to
the players.</LD>
<LD>   Two nights ago, the Bruins heard another cautionary tale, this
time via video because the speaker, Henry Thomas, is in state prison
serving a life sentence for armed robbery and kidnapping stemming
from a 1991 incident in which he and an accomplice forced someone to
withdraw money from an automated teller machine.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas was a UCLA track and field All-American whose highlight was
running on the 1988 collegiate record-setting 400-meter relay team.
He sent the video to UCLA unsolicited.</LD>
<TE>   "I just hope you guys were listening," Toledo said to the team
after practice Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The video showed Thomas' athletic exploits before cutting to him
in prison expressing regret for his crime. He has finished his degree
while behind bars and has learned carpentry.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a powerful message and it made a strong impression," said
quarterback Cory Paus, who served four days in jail during the
off-season for a drunk-driving conviction.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Because he is the only experienced quarterback, Paus is essential
to any success this team might have. So his strong first week of camp
was especially welcome.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, he is ahead of where he was last year," Toledo
said. "He's only had one poor day. He knows the offense and is
throwing the ball well. Last year that thumb bothered him and this
year I think he's healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Paus, a senior who ranks fifth on the school's all-time passing
list, is in the best shape of his career. Among the five
quarterbacks, he routinely finishes first during conditioning
sprints.</TE>
<TE>   "I really do have a different mind-set and a clearer head," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said defensive tackle Rodney Leisle is questionable for the
opener against Colorado State on Sept. 7. Leisle, who is on the
Outland Trophy watch list, reported to camp with a sprained left knee
and has practiced sparingly.</TE>
<TE>   Leisle, however, said he should be ready.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There are 22 scholarship freshmen in camp, making it difficult for
a walk-on to make an impression. One who has is James Jessen, a
6-foot-4, 235-pound freshman from Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   Jessen plays on the Bruin volleyball team and did not go out for
football last season. But he walked on during the spring as a
linebacker and has impressed coaches this fall with his athleticism.</TE>
<TE>   "We see potential," Toledo said. "He's an athletic guy and he put
on some weight and got stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Jessen was on the kickoff team during practice Friday, lined up
alongside veterans Ricky Manning Jr., Manuel White and Akil Harris.
He is backing up Brandon Chillar and Tim Warfield at strong
linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins hold their last practice at Cal Lutheran today at 9
a.m. then will scrimmage at Spaulding Field in Westwood at 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The scrimmage is open to the public.</TE>

<HD>Wyatt May Be in Line to Start</HD>

<LD>Justin Wyatt expected playing time, not a starting position.</LD>
<LD>   But Wyatt, a freshman from Compton Dominguez High, could be USC's
starting left cornerback when the Trojans play Auburn in their Sept.
2 opener at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   Senior Kevin Arbet underwent surgery Friday for a broken bone in
his right foot and is out for the season. And with junior college
transfer Ronald Nunn nursing a hamstring injury that is expected to
keep him out until Tuesday, Wyatt is working with the first-team
defense.</LD>
<TE>   "It's pretty dead even if you ask me," Wyatt said. "It's still up
for grabs."</TE>
<TE>   Wyatt, 5-foot-10, 175 pounds, played quarterback, running back,
receiver and cornerback in high school and also returned kicks.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said Wyatt also could emerge as the
Trojans' top punt returner. Wyatt will receive another opportunity to
impress when the Trojans end training camp with a scrimmage today at
Howard Jones Field.</TE>
<TE>   "He really knows his stuff and feels confident," Carroll said. "If
he gets back there, he'll be ready to go."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior fullback Chad Pierson participated in contact drills for
the first time since straining a hamstring last week and found
himself in a battle to hold on to his No. 1 spot on the depth chart.</TE>
<TE>   Pierson's absence allowed freshman Brandon Hancock to move into
contention along with senior Sunny Byrd.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little bit in question until we see Chad," Carroll said.
"He's the most experienced guy, Sunny has received most of the work
but we've liked a lot of stuff Brandon has done."</TE>
<TE>   Pierson said he improved his blocking technique during the spring
and summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to get out there and show what I can do," he said. "Me,
Sunny and Brandon can all block, catch the ball and hold onto it, and
run with it when we need to.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us can do the job."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior David Davis is entrenched as the No. 1 kicker, but after an
erratic performance Thursday he was given the day off to rest and
Ryan Killeen tried all the field-goal attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Killeen, who will kick off, showed good range in converting four
of six attempts and hit the goalpost on a 47-yard attempt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he would probably wait until Thursday or Friday to
decide on a starting tailback.</TE>
<TE>   Malaefou MacKenzie and Hershel Dennis got the most repetitions
during the last week, but Sultan McCullough appears fit after a
hamstring injury.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Fargas, who opened training camp as No. 1 on the depth
chart, injured a hamstring last Saturday and is not expected back
until Tuesday, making him a longshot to start the opener.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be hard," Carroll said. "He would have to come back and
really be impressive and give us a lot of confidence."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Derek Graf dislocated the pinkie on his right hand, but
X-rays were negative and he is expected to play today.... Quarterback
Matt Cassel, recovering from a chipped bone in his right kneecap,
took part in light passing drills.</TE>

<HD>NEXT, A SUIT OF PINSTRIPES?</HD>
<DH>Yankees will take a big financial hit from proposals by
both sides, so Steinbrenner might sue to keep revenue</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If death and taxes are the only certainties, George Steinbrenner
seems convinced that his New York Yankees are going to experience
death by taxes unless the players' union can remove some of the sting
from the bargaining proposals on the table.</LD>
<LD>   It's a strange business when Steinbrenner and the Yankees become
de facto partners with Don Fehr's union, but that's basically the
situation as the bargaining negotiations approach crunch time. The
Yankees are so concerned about the financial hit they will take from
the proposed revenue-sharing and payroll-tax components that they
have asked noted attorney David Boies, who carried Al Gore's election
case to the Supreme Court, to investigate a possible lawsuit against
baseball if the ultimate bargaining agreement is, for them, too
onerous.</LD>
<LD>   The Yankees, of course, have signed and agreed to abide by the
provisions of the Major League constitution, and legal experts don't
think they would have much chance in court. Nor are they certain on
what basis the Yankees would sue, but as Gary Roberts, the Tulane
sports law professor, said by phone, "This is America. You don't
always need a basis or precedent to sue."</LD>
<TE>   Boies did not return messages left at his office, and the Yankees
refused comment, but it is safe to say that they have not generated
much sympathy among the 29 other teams given the rampant envy that is
the byproduct of the Yankees' industry-high revenue and four World
Series titles in the last six years, and the rampant anger at how
they flaunt their riches.</TE>
<TE>   A high-ranking baseball official said that when the Yankees
recently acquired Raul Mondesi and Jeff Weaver, spiraling their 2002
payroll to about $135 million, he got all over club executives,
telling them, "What you're doing is rubbing it in people's faces. I
mean, the Yankees are a hard club to deal with because they're light
years ahead of everybody financially. It's not easy to be
sympathetic."</TE>
<TE>   It's also safe to say that the Yankees are in a category by
themselves in more ways than one.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, baseball's revenue classifications can now be
defined as the Yankees, the Haves and the Have Nots. Second, aside
from some private concerns among the Boston Red Sox and a couple of
other big spenders regarding the proposed tax/revenue-sharing bite,
the Yankees are pretty much isolated on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say that Commissioner Bud Selig, trying to control
his varied and self-interested factions, among them a group of
militants who apparently don't mind shutting the industry down for as
long as it takes to get a deal that will cap payroll and salary
growth, has total unanimity.</TE>
<TE>   It's only to say that as Selig tries to prevent the type of
splintering and capitulation that eroded management efforts in
previous negotiations, the Yankees are the team that will be hit
hardest by the proposals, possibly the only team affected by the
payroll tax, depending on the threshold at which the tax kicks in.
And they certainly are the only team considering a lawsuit against
its collective bargaining partners.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee executives have already met with baseball officials to
express their concerns. Selig, choosing his words carefully, said, "I
hear from a lot of clubs on a daily basis and I'm sympathetic to
their positions, but I have to make decisions based on the greater
good. I'd add that the road map regarding our labor objectives was
very public and shouldn't have come as a surprise to any team or
anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   He referred to the recommendations in the report by his
blue-ribbon economic committee in July 2000--recommendations that
have been followed by management negotiators.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the strike date only six days away, the Yankees are
hoping that union negotiators can reduce what their increased
financial obligation will be over the next three to five years, if
there is a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   And if there is not?</TE>
<TE>   In that case, the Yankees' obligation will probably be even
larger, because owners will ultimately try to implement new work
rules, imposing a more restrictive tax than any emerging from a
settlement with the union.</TE>
<TE>   According to figures released by the commissioner's office, the
Yankees had local revenue of $217.81 million last season and a
payroll of $120.86 million, and they paid about $28.2 million in
revenue sharing, with no payroll tax.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees' 2002 revenue projection is $230 million, and although
their 25-man payroll of $135 million is imposing enough, it goes to
$171 million for tax purposes, because those computations include the
40-man roster and benefit plan contribution.</TE>
<TE>   The union, of course, wants to minimize the toll on the Yankees
and the half dozen or so other clubs that drive the salary market,
but even on the basis of the union's current revenue-sharing and tax
proposals, the Yankees would pay about $51 million next year. The
owners' proposals would cost them about $86 million. It's a heavy
burden either way, but the Yankees are clearly rooting for the union
to lighten the load.</TE>
<TE>   Said a lawyer supportive of their position:</TE>
<TE>   "The Yankees pay more than anybody pays, and are willing to
continue paying, but what's the point if it depresses their franchise
value and threatens the way they do business?</TE>
<TE>   "The guy in San Diego [John Moores] paid $80 million for his
franchise and does nothing to improve it. Why should he get a
windfall at the Yankees' expense? I mean, when you get beyond
sound-bite words like 'competitive balance,' this is all about people
doing what's in their own best interest, and if it comes down to a
fight for survival, the Yankees will use everything at their
disposal."</TE>
<TE>   The point, indeed, is that fellow owners want to threaten the way
Steinbrenner, who bought the Yankees for $10 million in 1973 and
whose holdings include hotels, a thoroughbred horse farm, a transit
company and a lucrative cable network tied to Yankee telecasts, does
business. The intent is not to break up the Yankees but to bring them
back to the pack.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, one of the tools at his disposal is Boies.</TE>
<TE>   William B. Gould, a Stanford law professor and former director of
the National Labor Relations Board, said he had not looked at filings
in the mail-and wire-fraud case brought by former minority partners
of the Montreal Expos against Selig and former Montreal owner Jeffrey
Loria under the racketeering statute known as RICO, but that,
perhaps, the Yankees could cite the same statute in alleging
conspiracy and violation of a contractual understanding.</TE>
<TE>   But, Gould added, "It would be my impression they would have a
very tough time legally and practically."</TE>
<TE>   It would be new terrain, said Roberts, the Tulane law professor.</TE>
<TE>   Using legalese, he cited the agreements that commit the Yankees to
a "joint venture partnership" and a "multi-employer group for
bargaining purposes" and said maybe they could claim breach of
fiduciary duty and good faith bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   He added, however, "I don't think this situation has ever been
addressed, and my instincts tell me that at the end of the day, they
would lose."</TE>
<TE>   Fay Vincent, the legally schooled former commissioner, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no expertise except my own experience, but it strikes me
as a loser's game," he said. "David Boies is a first-class lawyer,
but the Yankees signed the major league agreement and they have to
live with those judgments. I can't believe it's a serious issue."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not, but the thought of Steinbrenner rooting for Fehr? And
the 29 other clubs rooting against both?</TE>
<TE>   Well, as Professor Roberts said, "As the backdrop of a potential
strike, it makes for an interesting sideshow."</TE>
