<HD>The Cannes of Comics</HD>
<DH>Hollywood* A San Diego gathering for makers and consumers
of the illustrated tales becomes a must-stop for stars and directors
who want to shape the pre-release buzz.</DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The Terminator, having already received a standing, clapping,
hollering, whistling ovation from several thousand comic book fans
jammed into a ballroom here, returned the adoration.</LD>
<LD>   "You're the biggest, the best fans we have," roared Arnold
Schwarzenegger--setting off another round of exuberant applause.</LD>
<LD>   To reward such devotion, the star and his director chose the
Comic-Con International gathering as the ideal venue for the first
public peek at their "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," set to be
released next July.</LD>
<TE>   Call it the Cannes Festival for the comic
book-superhero-sci-fi-full-fantasy subculture.</TE>
<TE>   The annual gathering of the tribe for the makers and consumers of
comics has also become the place for stars and directors of movies
geared to the same demographic to strut their stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of regular people laugh at us as just a bunch of comic-book
geeks," said Brett Hermann, a college student who arrived dressed as
a Klingon. "But the people who make movies show us respect."</TE>
<TE>   Comic-Con is seen by Hollywood as an excellent spot to reward the
box office faithful, to spark that all-important prerelease buzz, and
maybe to counteract Internet "spoilers" who love to dis current
movies as unworthy of their cinematic or comic book origins.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't distill down the fan base to a more pure essence
than the people in this room," "Terminator 3" director Jonathan
Mostow said of the crowd Saturday in the convention center ballroom
here.</TE>
<TE>   In hopes of influencing that essence, LucasFilm, Paramount, New
Line, Warner Bros., Universal and 20th Century Fox all brought stars
and directors and never-seen-before film clips of movies to be
released during the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a rough cut; nobody has seen it," said James Cameron,
producer of "Solaris," which stars George Clooney. "You're on the
inside, baby."</TE>
<TE>   While Comic-Con, now in its 33rd year, has always had a movie
tie-in, the Hollywood presence has gotten progressively larger over
the years and took a quantum leap this time out, when upward of
75,000 people flocked to the four-day event.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a mecca for pop culture," said Jim Gianopulos, chairman
of Fox Filmed Entertainment. "It's like they put out a homing signal
and tens of thousands of people arrive. It's a fascination, a hobby,
a cult."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there is always a danger in meeting aficionados who
know the source material intimately and take a proprietary interest
in its sanctity.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Crisscoula, a retail clerk, wanted to make sure that the
second installment of "The Lord of the Rings," due out at the end of
this year, is consistent with the first and with J.R.R. Tolkien's
book. He left satisfied after a peek and the question-and-answer
session with New Line executives.</TE>
<TE>   "They've captured the wonder of it," Crisscoula said. "They're
smart to show us first. They know their audience: It's us."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the audience questions at the mini-screenings were of the
polite-to-gushy variety about autographs, future projects and
specific characterizations, but there were some assertive queries.</TE>
<TE>   One questioner noted that Mostow was not the director on the first
two "Terminators" and asked pointedly: "Are you going to ruin this
like somebody ruined 'Batman'?"</TE>
<TE>   Mostow's response was diplomatic: Buy an $8 ticket next July and
decide for yourself.</TE>
<TE>   "If you guys don't like the movie, we're really [messed up]," Ben
Affleck joked after showing a clip of "Daredevil," in which he plays
the first blind superhero.</TE>
<TE>   Wanting approval, however, does not mean currying favor at all
costs. Jason Lee, star of "Dreamcatcher," drew the line at a request
from a fan to insult one of the fan's former friends. Lee took it in
stride and fired a jocular shot back, referring to a previous
convention panel with Lucy Liu, star of "Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever."</TE>
<TE>   "With Lucy Liu, it was all about 'overcoming obstacles [for Asian
women],' " Lee responded. "But with us, it's 'call him an [insulting
name].' "</TE>
<TE>   A Colorful Exchange</TE>
<TE>   Some semi-raunchy dialogue ensued among Lee, co-star Timothy
Olyphant and the audience, and when the two stars rose to leave, Lee
offered upraised finger gestures. The fans appeared to love it and
jumped to their feet in raucous appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   With the success this summer of "Spider-Man," "Men in Black II"
and "Road to Perdition," comic books and graphic novels are hot as a
source for films. The Web site comics2film lists more than 200 movie
projects that have comic book characters and themes as their starter
dough.</TE>
<TE>   For movies such as "Daredevil," "X-Men" and others that are taken
from comic books, there is a cultural symmetry in the trip to
Comic-Con.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the people who kept 'X-Men' alive the last 40 years, so
it was available to filmmakers like me," said director Bryan Singer,
now making "X-Men 2." "It's absolutely appropriate that this is the
place to talk about the project for the first time."</TE>
<TE>   Along with movies and comic books, the conventioneers are also
devotees of the Internet--where numerous sites, authorized and
unauthorized, provide information about movies in progress. An
appearance at Comic-Con can help the studios straighten out--or
spin--the story in a helpful way.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors abound on the Internet about what comic characters will or
will not be in which movie and how they will be portrayed. It is the
kind of information that moviemakers are reluctant to release before
the premiere.</TE>
<TE>   "You all know who the characters are," said Singer, trying not to
be pinned down. "You all have computers."</TE>
<TE>   At the Comic-Con showings, the barrier that often exists between
the makers and the consumers of popular culture is virtually
nonexistent. Many of the makers of comic-book movies began as avid
readers of comic books.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels weird being up here like this," said Mark Steven
Johnson, director of "Daredevil." "I used to attend the convention
just like you."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the emergence of the annual Comic-Con gathering in San
Diego on the must-do list for stars and directors has caught some a
bit by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I came to America, I dreamed about becoming a big movie
star," Schwarzenegger said. "I did not dream I would be at the
world's greatest comic book convention."</TE>
<TE>   But even for a superhero from the future who returns to the
present on occasion, a trip to Comic-Con is easy to explain.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the people who stand in line to go to movies," Singer
said.</TE>

<LD>The summer of sequels and spy movies continues Wednesday with the
release of Dimension Films' kiddie action flick "Spy Kids 2: The
Island of Lost Dreams." The colorful comic adventure, starring
Antonio Banderas, is the follow-up to last year's surprise hit "Spy
Kids," which grossed more than $112 million at the box office. The
movie, which was hailed by most critics for its original look and
offbeat humor, made $26.5 million in its opening weekend in March
2001, then continued to do strong business at the box office for more
than two months.</LD>
<LD>   Both the original and the sequel were written, directed and
co-produced by Robert Rodriguez, who, before "Spy Kids," was best
known for such edgy, violent fare as "El Mariachi" and "Desperado."</LD>
<LD>   "Spy Kids 2" follows the super-spy Cortez family in its quest to
keep the world safe from an agent who has turned evil.</LD>
<TE>   Inspired by Rodriguez's childhood fantasies of becoming a spy,
"Spy Kids 2" is a curious mix of James Bond and "Chitty Chitty Bang
Bang." In creating the so-called OSS Jr. Headquarters, where junior
spies Juni (Daryl Sabara) and Carmen (Alexa Vega) hang out, Rodriguez
wanted it to be like the ultimate treehouse--complete with a
helicopter pad.</TE>
<TE>   The director also let his imagination fly in designing the strange
creatures inhabiting the island--they are hybrids of animals such as
a horse/fly, cat/fish and spider/monkey.</TE>
<TE>   "Spy Kids 2" is one of many summer spy movies, including "The
Bourne Identity," "Austin Powers in Goldmember" and the Vin Diesel
action thriller "XXX," which comes out Friday. But unlike the others,
which are for teens and adults, Rodriguez wanted to keep his subject
matter family-friendly: "Spy Kids 2" is rated PG.</TE>
<TE>   "We created even more action and adventure for this sequel, but at
the core it remains very much about the mission of family life," said
the director, who has three children and lives in Austin, Texas, with
his family. "The movie is about a family that just happen to be
spies."</TE>

<HD>'Reanimation' Revs Up Rock Remixes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled by Times staff writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Reanimation," the remix version of Linkin Park's hit debut album,
"Hybrid Theory," is off to a roaring start in its first week in
stores, suggesting that a concept that's worked well in hip-hop can
also succeed in rock.</LD>
<LD>   Retailers are expecting "Reanimation" to debut strongly when
first-week sales are released on Wednesday: The album probably will
enter the national album chart at No. 2 behind Bruce Springsteen's
"The Rising."</LD>
<LD>   "They've really made a remix record that stands on its own," says
Bob Bell, senior pop buyer for the Wherehouse chain. "It's an unusual
project, but they seem to have put a lot more care into a remix album
than most artists do."</LD>
<TE>   The remix versions of "Hybrid Theory's" songs feature Staind
singer Aaron Lewis, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Orgy's Jay Gordon,
Jurassic 5 rapper Chali 2na, hip-hop group the X-Ecutioners and more
than a dozen others.</TE>
<TE>   Although hip-hop and R&amp;B remix albums by Sean "P. Diddy" Combs,
Jennifer Lopez and Destiny's Child have become hits, Linkin Park's is
a rarity in the rock world, one that's all the more unusual because
it remixes an entire album, and because that album was the group's
first.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that "Hybrid Theory" was the biggest selling album of
2001 (the release has tallied 7.3 million copies since its release in
2000) translates to a huge potential market for "Reanimation." Yet
despite the millions of albums Limp Bizkit has sold, its remix
collection has sold only 566,000 since its December release,
according to Nielsen SoundScan.</TE>
<TE>   "Reanimation" may sell half that much or more during its first
week in stores.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows just how strong their fan base is if you can have that
type of response to a group on a remix project," says Best Buy's Joe
Pagano. "It also bodes very well for the new project." The band's
next studio album is in progress and doesn't have a firm release
date.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the positive fallout "Reanimation" should have for Linkin
Park singer Chester Bennington and his five bandmates, will it spur
others to follow the group's lead and rework earlier hit albums?</TE>
<TE>   "These things may have a pretty quick burn too," says Tower
Records' Southwest region director, Bob Feterl. "It's a little early
to tell."</TE>
<TE>   Still, says Wherehouse's Bell, "I think this speaks well for the
whole concept and shows that when you do a great job on a remix
album, fans will respond."</TE>

<HD>The Little Distributor That Could</HD>
<DH>If not for Kino Film International, some of the best
independent work from around the world would not be seen here.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's unlikely that filmgoers care where their films come from
anymore--or if they ever did, although certain distinctions could at
one time certainly be made. MGM was the splashy factory (sometimes
literally) for big-budget musicals. Warner Bros. was the hard-edged
producer of gangster flicks and social drama. Universal made monster
movies. Columbia meant Capra. RKO, "King Kong."</LD>
<LD>   Meaningless generalities, of course, but what have we got today?
Miramax represents the cache of foreign films for people who don't
really like foreign films. DreamWorks is all about slipping
intelligent movies over on a mass audience without anyone noticing,
and Disney, which is related in different ways to both companies,
doesn't seem to know what it is. The remaining studios live by the
give-me-a-blockbuster-or-give-me-death mentality, except maybe
Paramount, but only when Scott Rudin is producing.</LD>
<LD>   The thing is, any real sense of identity among the
who's-who-who-bring-you-what has been the purview of the smaller
indie companies, whose independence has evaporated faster than
WorldCom dividends and which are being swallowed whole by the very
companies to which they were--originally, presumably--philosophically
opposed.</LD>
<TE>   Which is why it's more than noteworthy that Kino Film
International is celebrating its 25th anniversary this month. A
retrospective-tribute to the company began in New York on Friday and
ends Aug. 15, presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. All
you have to do is look at the lineup to realize what a valuable
resource Kino is. And how equally treacherous is the current state of
film distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1977 to oversee the Janus Collection (anyone with a
passing interest in art films from the '40s through the '60s knows
the double-profile company logo), Kino also distributes such film
libraries as the Killiam (which includes, to name a few, Sergei
Eisenstein's "Potemkin," Erich von Stroheim's "Queen Kelly" and F.W.
Murnau's "Nosferatu").</TE>
<TE>   There are other collections under Kino's domain--the Selznick
among them--and if I wanted to take a catalog to a desert island (no,
not the book, the films), it would be Kino's.</TE>
<TE>   But Kino chief Don Krim and company haven't just been dwelling in
the past, as illustrious as that past might be. If not for Kino, we
probably wouldn't have in U.S. circulation, or even have been exposed
to, some of the real masters of contemporary filmmaking: Hong Kong's
Wong Kar-wai, or Finland's Aki Kaurismaki, or Japan's Shohei Imamura
or, for that matter, such films as Julie Dash's "Daughters of the
Dust" or Tian Zhuangzhuang's "The Blue Kite" or Michael Haneke's "The
Piano Teacher." (Most are available on video and listed at
www.kino.com.)</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the mall movie--the popcorn movie, the blockbuster, the
chick flick, the shoot-'em-up and the franchise, from the heights of
"Spider-Man" to the depths of "K-19: The Widowmaker"--is fine.
Sometimes. But, still, man and woman do not live by mental mush
alone. Although a lot of people do a lot of talking about the
preservation of film, the preservation of Kino has been rarer than a
miracle, more precious than a gift. It's been a victory for good
taste.</TE>

<HD>AguaLuna's Formula for Folklorico Is Disciplined But
Aimless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Dancing in the Shadow of Amalia" could be the subtitle of all
Mexican ballet folklorico concerts, so much do they owe to Amalia
Hernandez, who invented the form and whose company in Mexico City
still sets a high standard.</LD>
<LD>   Gustavo Gonzalez's AguaLuna Dance Company exists very much within
the Hernandez tradition, with its identically costumed men who steal
kisses and maidens who sashay in unison with their water jugs. When
the women swirl their skirts of edible colors or lacy white, and
stride in circles wearing brilliant white-and-gold cowgirl outfits,
they stir an instant, vocal response from the audience, which comes
to partake of various Mexican rhythms and iconic identities.</LD>
<LD>   To an enthusiastic crowd at the Ford Amphitheatre Friday night,
AguaLuna's program "Reflejos/Reflections" alternated dance suites
with solo singers and contributions from Mariachi Los Trovadores.
Amplification difficulties plagued the live music and taped
accompaniment (used for most dances and some songs), but ballads from
Joe Ponce and Marissa Gaeta made an impression, as did the first two
singers (unnamed on the program) from Mariachi Los Trovadores.</LD>
<TE>   AguaLuna looked most secure in numbers such as "Flor de Mexico,"
"Melodias Tabasquenas" and "Tierra, Mujer y Canto." In "Ritmos de
Costa," with its authoritative shoulder-tossing and conventional
charm, the company showed itself to be the most disciplined
folklorico troupe in the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the pieces often looked aimless, with multiple entrances and
exits standing in for choreographic development. And reaching into
less-explored territory proved tricky. Opening the program, a
heartfelt but painfully underdeveloped work by company member
Patricia Maloy exposed technical weaknesses of dancers who,
elsewhere, usually looked more confident. All other choreography was
by Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   The new "Danzoneras" featured the eight beautiful company women,
who wore shimmering black-and-silver cocktail dresses and tried to
create a mood in which their feet kept the Cuban-inspired beat while
they shifted into minimalist patterns like models who don't want to
disturb their makeup. It set an interestingly dramatic tone, but a
bit more polish would have completed the picture.</TE>
<TE>   With so many directions open to Gonzalez in the post-Amalia
Hernandez century, he has taken only baby steps to move ballet
folklorico out of formulaic atmospheres and into a new age.</TE>

<HD>Mancini Show's Solo a Second-Half Success</HD>
<DH>Randy Brecker gives big band night a lift, but questions
linger about the institute's mission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were two distinct halves to the performance by the Henry
Mancini Institute Big Band on Friday night at Royce Hall.</LD>
<LD>   The first was dedicated to the briskly swinging compositions
written by Neal Hefti for the Count Basie band. The list of tunes
included such now-classic items as "The Kid From Red Bank," "Lil'
Darlin', " "Splanky" and "Whirly Bird."</LD>
<LD>   This is music that, despite its engaging melodies and accessible
rhythms, is effective only when performed with great finesse and
precision. To the credit of the Big Band's relatively youthful
players, the ensemble passages were delivered with clarity, accuracy
and--most of the time--a delightful rhythmic buoyancy. What was
largely missing was a set of solo performances equivalent to the high
level of the collective playing. Tenor saxophonist Jeff Elwood was
the exception, offering chorus after chorus of captivating
improvisations.</LD>
<TE>   It was not until the program's second half and the arrival of
veteran trumpeter Randy Brecker that the quality of solo invention
rose to world-class level. Although Brecker has been a busy,
much-praised jazz artist since the late '60s, his tenor
saxophone-playing brother, Michael Brecker, has generally received
greater attention. But trumpeter Brecker's fluid, articulate soloing
in a diverse set of material ranging from Herbie Hancock's "One
Finger Snap" to Michael Abene's beautifully textured "Goodbye Again"
provided potent evidence of the evenness with which the talent has
been distributed in the Brecker family.</TE>
<TE>   There were two other aspects of the program worth noting--both
underscoring questions regarding the current mission of the Mancini
Institute, now that founder Jack Elliott has died.</TE>
<TE>   The first was a tendency--also present in other programs--to
showcase faculty members, and/or their works, rather than the young
professional players. In this concert, it was the too-constant
presence of leader Justin DiCioccio, who spent an inordinate amount
of time talking between numbers, leading the band with distracting
physical gyrations, and having so much difficulty setting the tempo
for numbers that the audience began clapping in rhythm before the
music started. As a result, he failed in the fundamental task of
allowing--in a supportive but transparent fashion--his players to
take possession of the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   The second question had to do with the makeup of the band. The
Institute prides itself on the fact that its participants come from
15 countries and 50 U.S. cities. Given that diversity, one could only
wonder what sort of audition process could possibly have produced an
HMI Big Band that did not include a single African American, and only
one female player.</TE>

<HD>A Tradition's Call to Arms</HD>
<DH>John Mellencamp reflects the '70s style of combining pop
sensibility and social commentary--adding a dose of Americana.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there had never been a Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp might be
the rock star called the Boss by his fans and interviewed on TV by
Ted Koppel.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, that's a bit like saying the New Jersey Nets might be NBA
champions if it weren't for the powerhouse Western Division.
Springsteen's cultural impact and body of work are far greater than
Mellencamp's.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the singer-songwriters have a lot in common. They are born
outsiders who see rock as a force for personal and social liberation.</LD>
<TE>   Their Bob Dylan-influenced music combines the energy and
celebration of early rock and R&amp;B with the social commentary of folk
and country music. Their band members interact on stage with a sense
of community that reflects a larger bond between the artists and
their audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Along with such other '70s arrivals as Jackson Browne, Don Henley
and Tom Petty, Springsteen and Mellencamp recognize their roles as
spokesmen, to varying degrees, for many in their generation.</TE>
<TE>   That's why in a time of national joy or anxiety, these artists are
turned to for inspiration and comfort as well as entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "After 9/11, we could all use some Americana these days," said the
Mellencamp fan sitting next to me Friday at the singer's Staples
Center concert. "And John's about as American as you can get."</TE>
<TE>   During the wait for the show to begin, another fan predicted that
Mellencamp would have an American flag behind him on stage.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, Mellencamp brought a dose of Americana to the
stage--including a flag, at one point--but he did so with restraint
and an acknowledgment of some of the nation's social problems.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their cheery titles, "Love and Happiness" and "Peaceful
World," both of which were played early in the 90-minute set, are
biting pieces of social commentary. The former is about man's warlike
nature in the Middle East and in our hemisphere, while the latter is
a reminder that racism is still alive in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Because Mellencamp has a strong pop sensibility that turns many of
his songs into feel-good sing-alongs, you wonder how much the
cheering fans actually reflect on the seriousness of the songs'
themes.</TE>
<TE>   Early in his career, Mellencamp--then billed as John Cougar--was
almost all pop sensibility, and the catchy nature of such tunes as
"Jack and Diane" and "Hurts So Good" made him a star. But Mellencamp
was dissatisfied with the lightweight nature of that material, and he
started working as hard on his themes as on his seductive melodies.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a series of '80s albums, highlighted by "Scarecrow"
and "The Lonesome Jubilee," that established him as a purposeful
figure in pop.</TE>
<TE>   He also showed his personal commitment to issues such as the
plight of the family farmer by co-founding Farm Aid.</TE>
<TE>   The Indiana native and his eight-piece band did a good job at
Staples of framing his old hits and some recent material with
aggressive arrangements that added strong contemporary elements,
including rousing percussion, to his folk and rock-roots foundations.</TE>
<TE>   At 50, Mellencamp isn't as flashy a performer as he once was, but
his voice remains forceful and full.</TE>
<TE>   He finally brought the flag out during an acoustic section that
featured a spirited version of "This Train Is Bound for Glory," the
Woody Guthrie-associated folk song that Springsteen reworked into his
own "Land of Hope and Dreams" during his reunion tour with the E
Street Band.</TE>
<TE>   It was a graceful and affecting reminder that Mellencamp and the
rest of the '70s songwriter brigade, for all their sales and acclaim,
owe their own debts to their forefathers in a rich American musical
tradition.</TE>

<HD>A Rousing Yawn for a Blockbuster Series Idea</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Levinson's film "Avalon" includes a scene at a large family
gathering, set about 1950, showing everyone in front of an early TV
set, totally awed, all eyes lasered to a single stagnant image on the
tiny screen.</LD>
<LD>   A nonstop test pattern.</LD>
<LD>   I thought of that recently, and how not only did Levinson's 1990
film deliver a message about TV's dangerously seductive nature, but
also how this scene foreshadowed the hottest of today's new "reality"
shows.</LD>
<TE>   Not the derivative group predicated on competition, but newer
shows that chronicle the tedious minutiae of daily life. Think MTV's
smash hit "The Osbournes."</TE>
<TE>   It was then that I realized I was sitting on a gold mine. So I
phoned my friend Joe, who's in series development at one of the major
networks, and persuaded him to give me a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Over lunch, I told him I had an idea for a blockbuster series. "It
would be a process show," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "A process show?"</TE>
<TE>   "The process of people leading dull lives."</TE>
<TE>   "What people?"</TE>
<TE>   "Well, me, mostly."</TE>
<TE>   Joe was skeptical. "You on TV?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm extremely dull."</TE>
<TE>   "I know," Joe said. "I read your column."</TE>
<TE>   "Just hear me out," I said. "What I have in mind is so spiritless,
so aggressively tiresome and uniquely dry that viewers will find it
irresistible."</TE>
<TE>   "Look," Joe said, eyeing me wearily beneath thick lids. "We're
already doing dull. So you'd need some kind of reality hook. What
would be distinctive about your dullness?"</TE>
<TE>   "My job, for one thing."</TE>
<TE>   Joe sat up straight and his baby blues sparkled. "You mean ... ?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes. I make my living watching dull shows, some of them
excruciatingly dull."</TE>
<TE>   "And what you envision, what you see for us is a dull show
capturing you in your office at home each week as you watch other
dull shows?"</TE>
<TE>   "Exactly. A wall, a monolith of the lackluster. An impenetrable
dose of unimpassioned dullness no one else on TV could match."</TE>
<TE>   "Keep talking," Joe said.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's the payoff. The shows I'm talking about are so tedious
that I often doze off while watching them."</TE>
<TE>   Joe was now taking notes furiously. Then he looked at me squarely.
"And when you doze off, do you snore?"</TE>
<TE>   "All the time."</TE>
<TE>   "I dig it, I dig it. What else?"</TE>
<TE>   "Well, there's some flat gray paint peeling on a wall in my
office."</TE>
<TE>   "Right. So we go tight on that each week for three or four
minutes. Tell me more."</TE>
<TE>   "I get deliveries, you know, tapes of shows brought to my house
for me to review."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you talk to the people who deliver the tapes?"</TE>
<TE>   "I say hi, they say hi. I say thanks, they tell me I'm welcome."</TE>
<TE>   "This is working, really working. What else happens?"</TE>
<TE>   "We could start each episode with the camera on me as I wake up in
the morning. The alarm goes off, and I hit the snooze."</TE>
<TE>   "Just once?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, two, maybe three times."</TE>
<TE>   "Tedium city."</TE>
<TE>   "In triplicate."</TE>
<TE>   "And?"</TE>
<TE>   "You know, it's the old bladder thing. I stumble into the
bathroom, and my wife always yells out for me to lift the seat. Then
I brush my teeth."</TE>
<TE>   "And floss?"</TE>
<TE>   "Naturally."</TE>
<TE>   "Gargle?"</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   "That's really dull."</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know any dull people besides your wife?"</TE>
<TE>   "My friends are as dull as I am. Our conversations are meaningless
and obtuse. And I talk to my elderly mother pretty regularly on the
phone."</TE>
<TE>   I'd brought along a tape of me talking to her long distance, and
played it for Joe.</TE>
<TE>   Hello, Mom. I said hello. HELLO! What do you mean you can hear? If
you can hear, why did you ask me what I said? I SAID WHY DID YOU ASK
ME WHAT I SAID?</TE>
<TE>   I was pleased to see Joe's eyes glaze over as the tape ran. "That
is so incredibly boring," he said. "I've rarely heard anything as
monotonous."</TE>
<TE>   "You're such a pro. I knew you'd like it."</TE>
<TE>   "Like it? I love the show's entire concept. There's enough right
here for a pilot, and I can promise you a winner. We'll call it 'The
Dull Life of a Dull Man.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't it amazing what people will watch?" I said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the old story," Joe said. "They don't call it reality for
nothing."</TE>

<HD>Veranazo Fest Debut a Hit at Dodger Stadium</HD>
<DH>Six-hour Latin-music event's all-star lineup includes Juan
Gabriel and Banda El Recodo. Enrique Iglesias' pared-down act also
scores with the crowd.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERNESTO LECHNER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The goal of the inaugural Veranazo 2002 festival Saturday at Dodger
Stadium was to deliver an over-the-top, multiple-course musical feast
that would outdo all other Latin-music events. And indeed, its
Pantagruelian excesses resulted in the kind of sonic satiation that
Latin music fans tend to savor.</LD>
<LD>   The six-hour show, organized by the radio station conglomerate
Hispanic Broadcasting Corp., focused mostly on live music, keeping
lip-synced performances to a minimum and allowing chart-toppers Juan
Gabriel, Los Temerarios, Joan Sebastian and Banda El Recodo at least
45 minutes each to work their magic on the crowd.</LD>
<LD>   There were two lessons to be learned from the event, both of which
apply to Latin music at large: Less is always more, and sticking to
your cultural roots is likely to result in a tastier musical
experience.</LD>
<TE>   The former was best exemplified by Enrique Iglesias, who appeared
on stage accompanied only by two guitarists, confessing to the
audience that he had arrived at the stadium completely unprepared.</TE>
<TE>   Whether this was true or just a ploy to create the illusion of
spontaneity is irrelevant. Demonstrating again that he's the most
genuine presence in Latin pop, Iglesias charmed his way through
lilting but rough acoustic versions of a few of his hits. The
unadorned arrangements left plenty of space for the expressiveness of
his voice and his connection with the fans.</TE>
<TE>   The importance of remaining true to your roots became apparent in
the contrasting styles of flashy, lip-synced segments by Mexico's
rebellious roquera Alejandra Guzman and pop star Thalia, and that of
stunning banda sinaloense acts Jose Manuel Figueroa and Banda El
Recodo.</TE>
<TE>   Guzman's trite brand of arena hard rock was unintentionally funny
at times, as when she sang with utter conviction her hit, "Hacer El
Amor Con Otro," some of whose lyrics translate as "Making love with
another man/Is not the same thing/You don't get to see pink-colored
stars."</TE>
<TE>   Thalia's bubbly routine was infectious, with a quartet of dancers
sensuously prancing around the stage, and her own share of
experimentation fusing banda with digital-friendly pop.</TE>
<TE>   But the divas' efforts paled in comparison to the sheer drive of
Figueroa and Recodo. The latter provided the festival's most
exuberant moments. This is seriously funky music, marked by an
astonishing combination of brass instruments that includes sweeping
saxophone and clarinet, virtuoso syncopation on the snare drum and
elephantine bursts of tuba adding an otherworldly tone--both humorous
and melancholy--to the music.</TE>
<TE>   The intensity of Recodo's performance was sustained in the
evening's efforts, including the big-band sound of Sebastian (who was
joined by 31 singers and musicians), the ultra-romantic barrio-pop of
Los Temerarios, and the glowing melodies of Gabriel, Mexico's most
transcendent living pop composer.</TE>
<TE>   The show's only serious faux pas was the condescending treatment
of the predominantly working-class crowd, browbeaten by some of the
radio personalities and performers into expressing enthusiasm for
Veranazo, and bombarded with slogans such as "We're all passionate
Latinos."</TE>
<TE>   At times, you wished someone from the audience would climb
onstage, grab the mike and tell the organizers: "We might be Latinos,
but we're not stupid."</TE>

<LD>Ben Stiller has given us an exclusive quote that I pass on to all
those who had been looking forward to his co-starring with Danny
DeVito in David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, "Glengarry Glen
Ross," on Broadway in January.</LD>
<LD>   "I've made the difficult decision to withdraw from 'Glengarry Glen
Ross.' My priorities changed after the birth of my daughter, and the
reality of being separated from my family for the better part of
eight months caused me to rethink my commitment. We decided this
would be the best thing for us."</LD>
<LD>   He expressed regret at not being able to work with Mamet, DeVito
and the rest of the creative team and added, "I want to publicly
apologize to everyone involved for not being able to be a part of
what I know will be an incredible production."</LD>
<TE>   Producer Robert Cole says, "I am now exactly where I was in April
prior to Ben Stiller's involvement--I'm sitting on top of the world
with Danny DeVito." No word yet on who might replace Stiller....</TE>
<TE>   Singer Josh Groban, 21, is having his tonsils removed. Don't
panic--his golden notes won't be harmed. He'll rest his voice for
much of the next month, but is expected to recover in time to appear
on the Tom Brokaw-hosted "Concert for America" at the Kennedy Center
in Washington on Sept. 9.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every wiggle tells a story. At least that's what two hula groups
purported to do on Friday at California Plaza's Water Court.</LD>
<LD>   Under a brightly shining noontime sun, the locally based Hula
Halau O Kamuela Elua, directed by Kunewa Mook, presented a mostly
educational program, as Mook sang, played the ukulele and talked
about everything from leis to his travel itinerary (he heads
halaus--hula schools--in Burbank and Hawaii).</LD>
<LD>   As danced by a gaggle of adolescents and young women, the
characteristic dipping, sensuous swaying and florid hand gestures of
traditional hula didn't exactly transport one to the Islands, but
they proved pleasant enough.</LD>
<TE>   At the evening concert, with fog hanging heavy over the downtown
fountain-spewing plaza, the troupe presented a truncated program of
traditional chants and hula dedicated to volcano goddess Pele.</TE>
<TE>   The main event, however, was the hourlong performance of Na Lei
Hulu I Ka Wekiu. Directed by Patrick Makuakane, the 16-year-old San
Francisco company is known for its progressive hula--hula mua--with
the native Hawaiian making use of more modern hula moves
(hypnotically smooth undulations) than traditional hula (deep plies),
and set to contemporary music. Like Liberace with a lei--sans piano
or ermine cape--Makuakane presided over a show that seemed more
shipboard revue (the kitsch factor was rampant) than cutting edge.</TE>
<TE>   His version of Hawaii's paniolos (cowboys) saw six men in Stetsons
faux-lassoing and squatting in cocky unison, and could have sprung
from Santa Monica Boulevard. Five women in red strapless gowns
gyrated and struck poses to Peggy Lee's classic, "Fever." Effortless
gliding punctuated a piece in which gingham checked dresses ruled:
Think "Little Hula on the Prairie." The biggest crowd-pleaser?
Makuakane's nightclub homage set to techno music, where brightly
feathered costumes and bawdy booty-shaking prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   All said, this native was restless.</TE>

<HD>The Show's on Time, but the Script Is Late</HD>
<DH>Television* In a debate drawing guild attention, directors
say tardy pages make all jobs harder and raise budgets. A writer says
you can't hurry creativity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Director M. Night Shyamalan appears on the current cover of Newsweek,
heralded in conjunction with the movie "Signs" as a potential new
Steven Spielberg--another filmmaker whose name is splashed above a
movie's title and, theoretically, puts people in seats.</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, Rod Holcomb directed the series prototype for the
long-running NBC hit "ER"--a franchise worth more than the $600
million that Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" grossed worldwide--but
Holcomb can pretty much go about his day anonymously, even as ads run
nightly promoting new TV series this fall from elite writer-producers
such as "The Practice's" David E. Kelley and "ER's" John Wells.</LD>
<LD>   In terms of power equations in the entertainment industry,
television is the converse of film. It's a medium where writers wield
control over series, while directors are mostly guns for hire, moving
from show to show.</LD>
<TE>   And just as writers sought to address that inequality by making
the "a film by" credit for feature film directors an issue in their
last contract negotiations, directors are now rallying to curb a
growing practice among TV writers that they claim causes series to
run less efficiently, turn out worse and--not inconsequentially to
networks and studios--cost significantly more to produce.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, a survey of Directors Guild of America members found
that episodic TV scripts for dramatic and single-camera comedy shows
arrive late more than half the time--a level of tardiness, they say,
that means inadequate time to prepare and thus undermines program
quality.</TE>
<TE>   The issue, directors say, is that more and more top
writer-producers who oversee programs, or "show runners," are
emulating heralded writers such as Kelley, "NYPD Blue" co-creator
David Milch and "The West Wing's" Aaron Sorkin, all notorious for
writing and rewriting virtually every episode until the last possible
moment.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt that from conversations with the members, this problem
was growing and needed to be dealt with," said Holcomb, co-chairman
of the guild's subcommittee regarding late scripts.</TE>
<TE>   Television directors cite several negative consequences of this
trend, which they plan to document during the coming season. Beyond
financial implications, they say late scripts help stifle efforts to
provide younger directors of varied backgrounds opportunities,
because established pros are required to turn episodes around that
rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can wing it, you're OK. If you can't wing it, it's
problematic," said Mark Tinker, a director and producer who also
supervises other directors on "NYPD Blue." "I had my hands tied on
what directors I could hire, because you couldn't really bring in
somebody green and then ask them to jump on a moving train."</TE>
<TE>   Under the DGA's current contract, directors are supposed to
receive scripts eight days before shooting begins, allowing them to
plan camera angles and set up shots.</TE>
<TE>   That timetable is rarely met--a point Wells conceded, in his
then-capacity as head of the Writers Guild of America, in a 2000
article for the guild's magazine. "Directors in episodic television
... are not getting the level of respect they deserve and have a
moral and contractual right to expect," he wrote, adding that to do
less given the concessions writers sought in film "would be
hypocrisy."</TE>
<TE>   Directors Surveyed</TE>
<TE>   This spring, the Directors Guild sent questionnaires about late
scripts to 500 members who have directed dramas or single-camera
filmed comedies like Fox's "Malcolm in the Middle" (as opposed to
multi-camera shows shot with a studio audience, such as "Everybody
Loves Raymond" or "Frasier"). Of the 199 respondents, almost 80% said
they had received a late script, estimating that over half of the
more than 1,200 scripts they had directed arrived late.</TE>
<TE>   Half of those surveyed said late scripts meant insufficient
preparation time and compromised the finished product enough to hurt
their professional reputation. In addition, two-thirds said late
scripts diminish quality--giving actors little time to rehearse and
making crews struggle to construct sets or find locations, resulting
in more overtime, expense and stress.</TE>
<TE>   Tardiness Affects Budget</TE>
<TE>   According to Tinker, late scripts during a recent season of "Blue"
padded the annual budget by roughly $3 million, a cost of more than
$100,000 an episode. Sources say Sorkin's last-minute delivery adds
at least that much to the cost of "The West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   Given the emphasis on holding down production overhead, DGA
members are hoping the data will inspire studios and networks to take
action. "It's a domino effect that impacts virtually every member of
the crew, not just the DGA," said Paris Barclay, who has directed for
such series as "NYPD Blue" and "ER."</TE>
<TE>   "Every single department ends up doing their job on double
time.... It's never done as well, and it costs more money."</TE>
<TE>   Barclay acknowledged that "genius writers" on hit shows, such as
Sorkin or Milch, may warrant an exception, but he added that too many
writers lacking that talent level are following the lead of those
auteurs. As an African American who produced the short-lived CBS
series "City of Angels," Barclay said he is also concerned that late
scripts are an impediment to minority and female directors breaking
into the business.</TE>
<TE>   Studio officials were reluctant to comment, privately saying the
issue is a source of frustration but adding that they have little
recourse in compelling writers to work faster, especially with
today's emphasis on sophisticated, serialized programs.</TE>
<TE>   TV executives also note that script delivery is only one
cost-related factor they would like to remedy, citing a laundry list
that includes union requirements and the fees paid top talent. "This
is just one element that needs to be addressed," said Gary Newman,
president of 20th Century Fox Television, which is responsible for
such shows as "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "24."</TE>
<TE>   Holcomb said the goal among directors is not to be adversarial but
rather to find a solution, even if that means altering
long-established schedules in order to start production sooner--an
incremental expense that could pay dividends in less overtime and
better shows.</TE>
<TE>   "We need the cooperation of everyone to be able to solve this," he
said. "You have to have a script that's done on time for everyone to
efficiently do their job."</TE>
<TE>   Milch, who is sympathetic to TV directors' plight, agreed that
affording writers "a rational period of preparation" time would help
the process run more smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   "The burden that late script delivery puts on the production and
pre-production process is enormous," he said, citing the tyranny of
prime-time economics that require producers to generate at least 22
episodes a year. Milch said he appreciates the toll his work habits
have exacted on collaborators, adding that writers approach their
work "with some deep, passionate need to make it as good as they can,
and ultimately the process is going to suffer."</TE>
<TE>   Writer Defends Process</TE>
<TE>   Charles Holland, vice president of the Writers Guild and
co-executive producer on CBS' "JAG," said writers don't relish being
late but face a daunting task in generating the equivalent of a dozen
feature films annually per series. "You cannot legislate that we're
going to be done sooner, because we would be if we could," Holland
said. "This isn't making widgets."</TE>
<TE>   Although the process frequently bottlenecks at the executive
producer level, Holland said input from networks and studios can also
lead to rewriting and delays. He added that the WGA has proposed
discussions with the DGA to address concerns affecting them in both
film and TV but has been met with little enthusiasm--an assertion the
Directors Guild refutes, saying it doesn't see this matter as an
inter-guild dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Even directors acknowledge that while they see value in drawing
attention to the issue, change will be difficult to achieve. "It's
hard to regulate creativity," Tinker said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Director M. Night Shyamalan's science-fiction thriller "Signs"
exploded at the box office over the weekend, raking in a hefty $60.3
million and pushing "Austin Powers in Goldmember" to No. 2.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Myers' James Bond spoof dropped nearly 60% in its second
weekend, collecting $32 million, but "Goldmember" continues to do
well, having generated a total of $142 million since its release.</LD>
<LD>   The opening for "Signs" was the largest for Shyamalan and box
office king Mel Gibson, both of whom needed a big hit after their
previous films failed to ignite at the box office. The grosses
stunned Disney executives, who had predicted it would come in between
$35 million and $45 million.</LD>
<TE>   "Typically if you look at a feature like this, you expect in your
mind that it will play suburban, but this played in every theater, in
big cities and little cities," said Chuck Viane, senior distribution
executive at Disney. He added that the film's demographic cut across
all age groups and genders. "And, boy, that does not happen very
often."</TE>
<TE>   "Signs" stars Gibson as a Pennsylvania farmer who awakens to find
a mysterious crop circle on his field. The film prompted a flurry of
television specials, newspaper articles and books focusing on the
phenomenon and whether the crop formations are the work of pranksters
or aliens.</TE>
<TE>   The big first weekend was great news for Gibson, whose last film,
"We Were Soldiers," failed to open at No. 1. It eventually took in
$80 million but was considered a disappointment in its initial
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Shyamalan's last film, the creepy thriller
"Unbreakable," ended up grossing a respectable $96 million but was
dwarfed by the success of his first film, "The Sixth Sense," which
grossed $293 million domestically and was nominated for six Academy
Awards.</TE>
<TE>   And Disney needed a live-action hit after the dismal performance
of two of its summer films, "Bad Company" and "The Country Bears."
Some analysts said "Signs" benefited not only from the media
attention and star power of Gibson, but also from the lack of
original, commercial adult films in a summer clogged with mindless
sequels.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a unique film in the marketplace," said Gitesh Pandya,
editor of boxofficeguru.com. "There were not many scary movies this
summer. Mel Gibson is still one of the bankable stars in Hollywood
and the director has become a huge name himself. Disney had an
excellent campaign [that] intrigued the audience but did not give
away too much about the plot."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the big audience for "Signs," the collective box office
take for all films this weekend  was an estimated $154 million, down
10% from the same weekend last year. Nonetheless, this year's box
office remains 15% ahead of last year, according to Nielsen EDI, a
box office tracking service.</TE>
<TE>   Among other movies this weekend, Martin Lawrence's concert film,
"Runteldat," which was made for $3 million, opened well, bringing in
$7.5 million on 752 screens, while Steven Soderbergh's "Full Frontal"
opened to $725,000 on 208 screens. The latter film, which cost $2
million and was pre-sold to foreign territories for $7 million, again
paired Soderbergh with Julia Roberts, who won an Academy Award for
her performance in his "Erin Brockovich."</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks' "Road to Perdition," with Tom Hanks and Paul Newman,
dropped 40% in its third weekend out, taking in $6.6 million for a
cumulative total of $77.2 million. The Matt Damon spy thriller, "The
Bourne Identity," continues to chug along, grossing $1.6 million over
the weekend on 989 screens, for a total of $113 million since its
June 14 opening.</TE>
<TE>   Revolution Studios' "The Master of Disguise," starring Dana
Carvey, collected $13 million its first weekend out, while Sony's
"Stuart Little 2" brought in $6 million in its third weekend, for a
total of $46.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Men in Black II" churned up another $4.7 million for a total of
$182 million in its fifth week out. And the Harrison Ford dud "K-19:
The Widowmaker" continued its downward spiral with a $3-million take
for a cumulative sum of $30 million.</TE>

<HD>Vague Text, Lack of Emotion Trip Up 'The Glass Case'</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dee Caspary IV is an up-and-coming 26-year-old choreographer who has
been compared to Bob Fosse. Unfortunately, his "The Glass Case,"
which opened a weekend run Friday at the El Portal Theatre in North
Hollywood, turns out to be little more than a music video alternating
with a computer animation game.</LD>
<LD>   The short two-act work, the first in a planned trilogy, recounts a
story about intrigue in a royal family of a remote age and galaxy
where the royals wear bizarre masks and the hunter-people wear as
little as they can get away with. At least, I think that's what it's
about: The theater's speaker system (perhaps mercifully) muddled the
vague, pretentious text, written by Caspary.</LD>
<LD>   The title alludes to a glass box in which Jadan (Merrissa Gassel),
the beloved of the hero, Prince Talimeen (Justin Giles) of the
Village of Lindley, is imprisoned for mysterious reasons and from
which she is finally released or rescued by Talimeen's love.</LD>
<TE>   Caspary is adept at forming and dissolving high-energy, drill-team
groups, inventing asymmetrical, pump-action movement and working on
and against the beat in a score compiled from music by Bjork, U2,
Meshell Ndegeocello, Lamb, Rusted Root, Eric Amadio, and the
soundtracks of "Spy Game" and "Minority Report."</TE>
<TE>   The choreography has no emotional weight whatsoever but gives the
15 dancers plenty of bite-sized opportunities to explode in action.</TE>
<TE>   The choreographer also devises a mime language resembling
computer-animation figures to accompany and act the voice-over
narratives that advance the story. But what action can salvage such a
prosaic line as Talimeen asking his father, King Algon (Brian Burt),
why he has imprisoned Jadan: "Just explain the plan. Better yet, what
is going on?"</TE>
<TE>   The work ends with what's meant to be a tantalizing teaser for the
sequel: "The secret remains hidden." Some of us won't find it hard to
resist.</TE>

<HD>LINES Ballet Takes Fest Further</HD>
<DH>At a BalletFest notable for its quality, Alonzo King's
group outshines all others with complex, unpredictable work.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The annual BalletFest returned to the Luckman Fine Arts Complex at
Cal State L.A. over the weekend offering another sampling of
California-based achievement, but with greater quality control than
in previous years.</LD>
<LD>   The two-night 2002 edition broke with the event's dubious
tradition by insisting on a high level of professionalism from all
the participating companies. But only Alonzo King's LINES Ballet took
classical dancing beyond obvious and often trivial entertainment
values into the realm of art.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, for movement invention and emotional power, the silent
first minute or two of King's "The Heart's Natural Inclination" on
Saturday left the entire two-company Friday program in the dust.</LD>
<TE>   Inching across the stage in this opening sequence, his arms
tightly clamped around his head, Artur Sultanov unclenched only when
warmed by the tenderness of Maurya Kerr. As he threw his arms around
her, an eerie, rough-textured score by Leslie Stuck launched an
intricate and daring duet--classical steps resituated amid
deliberately off-center balances, asymmetrical lifts and an engulfing
use of gymnastics.</TE>
<TE>   As Sultanov moved across the stage, Kerr rapidly climbed all over
him until their bonding reached a flashpoint, and they imploded into
a rolling sphere of tangled limbs and torsos, all individuality lost
in their obsessive hunger for one another.</TE>
<TE>   The work also included a virtuosic character solo for Gregory
Dawson and a finale in which Lauren Porter manipulated the assembled
cast rather like a nurse in a ward, with King giving each episode an
air of mystery.</TE>
<TE>   After 20 years of running LINES in San Francisco, he's
experimenting with structure and what seems like an intuitive
musicality, letting the spectacular technical innovations that he
achieved early in the company's history support complex,
unpredictable and often enigmatic expressive statements.</TE>
<TE>   In "Koto," for instance, Sultanov again served as the resident
dreamboat-psychopath, brutally beating Brett Conway with a wooden
pole but feeling his own strength bleed away with every assault. It
was Conway who not only survived but also danced ecstatically in the
gathering darkness as the piece ended.</TE>
<TE>   With Miya Masaoka playing and chanting her atmospheric score on a
platform behind the dancers, "Koto" again wedded mystery and even
mysticism to powerful classical technique.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, King introduced intriguing, even teasing structural
gambits (a trio that kept forming and dissolving), along with
incredibly intense solo dancing (Prince Credell and Xavier Ferla, in
particular).</TE>
<TE>   Set to music by Hamza El Din, "Tarab" emphasized flow, with plenty
of percussive points of contrast, and often so many things going on
at once that you had to choose, Merce Cunningham-style, between
simultaneous actions of equal interest.</TE>
<TE>   Two excerpts from "Klang" (music by Miguel Frasconi) featured
brilliant mini-corps choreography that framed phenomenal solos by
Ferla and Laurel Keen: the groups defining a state-of-the-art norm,
the soloists something like the bravura of the future.</TE>
<TE>   The Friday program found Orange County's Ballet Pacifica on its
best behavior in the late Choo-San Goh's rather rigidly formulaic
neoclassic showpiece "Double Contrasts," with half the company
mirroring the other half to music by Poulenc. Paul Michael Bloodgood
and Eloisa Enerio capably led the cadre dressed in black, while Adam
Hundt and Erin Holmes proved equally skillful as their white-costumed
counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Marie DeAngelo's "Blackberry Winter" used the Conni Ellisor
dulcimer concerto to accompany a number of scattered, intermittently
diverting effects--including an unresolved quasi-narrative about the
crushing of a free spirit (Holmes again, this time in red with blond
hair flying free). The audience-courting finale, however, had only
its clean execution to recommend it.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Ballet showed proficiency galore Friday, but nothing to
dance other than the slick fripperies of Val Caniparoli's endless pop
divertissement "Djangology" (music by Django Reinhardt) and Reginald
Ray-Savage's passable but undistinguished jazz-ballet "Faux Pas" (to
music arranged and/or composed by Marcus Shelby). Erin Yarbrough and
Gabriel Williams looked especially stylish in both pieces, while
Ethan White and Phaedra Jarrett slumped deliciously in "Djangology."</TE>

<HD>Chamber Festival Shows It Can Finally Hang Ten at the Beach</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LA JOLLA--No one is ever likely to confuse La Jolla with one of the
old-world European resorts that host summer classical music
festivals.</LD>
<LD>   Beethoven and Brahms in the environment of a Southern California
beach town--even this upscale one--on a Saturday night continue to
strike a chamber musicgoer as a slight disconnect.</LD>
<LD>   But this year at SummerFest 2002, the three-week chamber music
festival that opened this weekend, something significant has changed.
The disconnect is no longer quite so disconcerting. Saturday night,
after hearing the energetic, American-accented Orion String Quartet,
a stroll through La Jolla night life seemed just fine. Two weeks
hence, when Michael Daugherty's "Dead Elvis" and "Sinatra Shag" are
on the bill, worlds may well merge.</LD>
<TE>   It may seem odd that it has taken a violinist from Taiwan to
finally give SummerFest its American, and to some extent West Coast,
cast. But in his second season as artistic director, Cho-Liang Lin is
beginning to manage that, both with American music and a feisty
American approach to music making.</TE>
<TE>   This year's impressive composers in residence are John Harbison,
John Adams and Esa-Pekka Salonen. Among the performers are the flashy
violinist Leila Josefowicz, maverick Bach and ragtime expert Anthony
Newman, and such all-American individualists as pianists Leon
Fleisher, Christopher O'Riley and Jeffrey Kahane.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's Orion concert in the Sherwood Auditorium of the Museum
of Contemporary Art San Diego was more or less traditional, opening
with Beethoven's String Quartet, Opus 18, No. 4 and concluding with
Brahms Sextet, Opus 36. But in the center was the first performance
of John Harbison's String Quartet No. 4--the first major new piece
from Harbison, who was composer in residence of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic in the '80s, to receive a premiere in Southern
California in more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Since writing his first in 1984, Harbison has been an occasional
string-quartet composer. His first two quartets are fond and
wonderful exercises in translating techniques from Renaissance and
Baroque music into glowing modern sonorities. The Third, from 1993,
is an intense and dramatic, 22-minute single movement, but it too has
an aura of times past, its inspiration coming from American hymn
tunes and plainchant. Another small piece for string quartet, "Thanks
Victor," is a lustrous arrangement of Victor Young tunes.</TE>
<TE>   In a preconcert talk, Harbison explained that he wrote his Fourth
Quartet quickly, during a three-week period last summer at an artists
colony in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   That knowledge may color a listener's first impression of the
work, but it was hard not to sense a dappled Umbrian light in its
shining harmonies, not to taste the earthy truffles in the refulgent
string textures, not to feel the impassioned character of Italian
life in the operatic dialogues between the first violin and cello.
Having spent much of the '90s with his opera, "The Great Gatsby,"
Harbison said the operatic qualities of Mozart's string quartets were
on his mind while composing.</TE>
<TE>   The new quartet begins with a long, rhapsodic melody in the cello,
robustly played by Timothy Eddy; it grows ever more ardent throughout
the first movement. The operatic duet between Eddy and violinist
Daniel Philips in the two middle movements suggests a love scene,
first restrained, then warmer and more personal, with even a hint of
something torrid. The last movement is happy, content.</TE>
<TE>   The other Orion players, violinist Todd Phillips and violist
Steven Tenenbom, are supporting characters, but the quality of
Harbison's writing for them, as they circle, color and engulf the
principles, give the quartet its atmosphere of captivating radiance.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on the program, the Orion's distinguishing trait was its
thick, robust sound and rhythmic zeal. Beethoven's early quartet (a
last-minute replacement for Opus 127) was forthright and forceful.
Brahms' sextet, which included violist Michael Tree and cellist Ralph
Kirshbaum, was more deliberate. The leisurely pace and plush textures
created a kind of resort Brahms, everything so well prepared that it
felt as if these musicians were there to serve and anticipate every
need of a listener lounging in the lap of luxuriously full string
sounds. It is a better piece when an audience is not coddled, when
there can be surprise. But it sure was ravishing.</TE>
<TE>   SummerFest continues through Aug. 18, Sherwood Auditorium, Museum
of Contemporary Art, La Jolla and other locations. (858) 459-3728.</TE>

<HD>Music's Key Role in Movies' Moods</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Romantic movie music can be a silky cliche, coming on like heavy
cologne, or it can seduce the viewer in subtler ways.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the best composers in the movie business share their
seduction secrets in tonight's episode of "Music: Behind the Scenes"
(7 and 10 p.m., Bravo), the third installment in a revealing six-part
series. In the coming weeks the show focuses on music for suspense
films, chase scenes and independent cinema.</LD>
<LD>   In "Emma," Rachel Portman's crafty score guides the audience
through the heroine's game playing, and ultimately, to her romantic
destiny. In the sewing-circle scene, director Douglas McGrath's
camera circles the women as Emma weaves one of her matchmaking
schemes, and Portman's music also has a sneaky, circular feel.
Throughout the film, instruments help "voice" the characters, Portman
says: A quivering violin stresses Harriet's uneasy stomach; a
bittersweet clarinet accompanies Emma on her emotional journey.</LD>
<TE>   George Fenton's score for "Dangerous Liaisons" conveys a colder
form of gamesmanship. When the John Malkovich character throws
himself at Michelle Pfeiffer, the music, like his maneuver, needs to
be slightly over the top without straining credibility. When
Malkovich sees through a keyhole that his ploy had the desired
effect, "The music stops what it's doing because his game is over,"
Fenton says.</TE>
<TE>   "The English Patient" tells parallel love stories--one smoldering,
one gentler--so composer Gabriel Yared signals turmoil and yearning
in shifting tones. The film's main love scene, as it were, comes when
Kip hoists the Juliette Binoche character into the air to show her a
dazzling display of frescoes. The boost he gets from Yared's lifting,
swinging notes demonstrates how vital movie music can be.</TE>

<HD>You're (Almost) in the Army Now With 'Basic Training'</HD>
<DH>Debuts* Story of six recruits is documented in
warts-and-all portrait of the military. Another History Channel show
answers 'Mail Call.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three decades after the end of the draft, military service has long
since ceased to be a widespread experience for the American public.</LD>
<LD>   Large segments of society have little or no firsthand knowledge of
the men and women serving in the all-volunteer military. Even the
massive media coverage after Sept. 11 tended to dwell on "elite"
units, not the average soldier or sailor.</LD>
<LD>   Two weekly series that debut tonight on the History Channel aim to
correct that civic ignorance about who serves in the modern American
military and what they do.</LD>
<TE>   The more ambitious of the two is "Basic Training," a look at
recruits' first real taste of the Army at Fort Jackson, S.C. Four men
and two women recruits will be followed throughout the nine-week
rigor.</TE>
<TE>   They enlisted for reasons only vaguely related to patriotism: One
wants to escape his inner-city neighborhood in Chicago; another had a
bad day at work in Oklahoma and went directly to the recruiter; a
college graduate from Oregon dreams of being a colonel at the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Army provided the filmmakers with virtually
unrestricted access, it remains to be seen whether the Army will come
off looking good at the end of "Basic Training." Based on the first
episode, the series is a warts-and-all look at the individuals and
the institution.</TE>
<TE>   One immediate impression is that the "Saturday Night Live" satire
is right: Some of the instructors speak in such a strongly accented
Southern-pidgin dialect that they are nearly incomprehensible.</TE>
<TE>   The recruits are confused but not particularly awestruck. One
tries to stare down a corporal with that basic sarcastic look that
every teenager learns. Another vows not to be pushed around.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to do what he says and what he wants me to, but in my
own way," says Ever Ochoa-Bonilla, 19, from Clovis, N.M.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first tasks is to boil away the Hollywood myths.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Full Metal Jacket'? A movie," says an instructor. " 'Hamburger
Hill'? A movie. 'Saving Private Ryan'? Yes, a movie, but it did
happen, but we'll never see it."</TE>
<TE>   Although the corporals and sergeants doing the early training seem
inhibited by the cameras, the recruits do not. By turns, they are
cocky, insecure, idealistic and pragmatic.</TE>
<TE>   The Army offers them the kind of challenge that others in their
peer group are finding in college or on the first rung of the
civilian job market.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'll be afraid of anything once I go through this,"
says Richard Jones, 19, of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The other History Channel series making its debut tonight is "Mail
Call" with R. Lee Ermey, the ex-Marine who played the drill sergeant
in "Full Metal Jacket." The format has him answering letters about
gear and tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "Mail Call" seems geared to the aficionado who really does wonder
how a land mine works, how fast a Gatling gun shoots, and what makes
samurai swords so powerful. In his growly, listen-up voice, Ermey
provides his own brand of instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "You just put this piece of machinery on like a pair of pantyhose,
doncha?" Ermey says as he slides into a World War II tank.</TE>
<TE>   No one said being a G.I. meant being dull.</TE>
<TE>   "Mail Call" airs at 8 tonight, followed at 8:30 by "Basic
Training," on the History Channel. The shows repeat Sundays at 11 and
11:30 p.m.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am sitting here on the rear deck of my house, staring at the oak
trees that surround me and feeling, well, sluggish.</LD>
<LD>   The good dog Barkley, whom everyone is calling Broccoli, is
similarly lethargic. He is lying at my feet with one eye open
observing a bird sitting on a nearby limb. The bird is staring back
with the intensity of a tax auditor.</LD>
<LD>   I hadn't known until then that dogs were able to sleep with one
eye open. I thought that only Marines in combat situation were
capable of sleeping and not sleeping at the same time.</LD>
<TE>   But my intent was not to sit out here on this sweet summer morning
and stare at the trees like some kind of farm boy idiot. I hauled my
laptop computer out to the deck because I began thinking the other
day that I had the deck, so why not write out there?</TE>
<TE>   I spent big money recently having it rebuilt because the old
platform was rotting and the whole structure was getting shaky. When
people start bouncing on your floor like characters in a Mickey Mouse
cartoon, you know that something must be done.</TE>
<TE>   Just before we had it rebuilt, an old drinking buddy visiting from
Oakland managed to put his foot through one of the rotting planks.</TE>
<TE>   "He's half drunk," my wife, the observant Cinelli, whispered to me
after we had pulled his foot out of the hole.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be negative," I whispered back. "He's actually half sober."</TE>
<TE>   My intent this morning was to bustle out to the deck, set up my
laptop and send words tumbling into cyberspace like beads of sweat
from a thinker's brow. I'm not sure how that works exactly, columns
flying from here to there, but I don't know how the radio works
either or the telephone or the dishwasher, and so what?</TE>
<TE>   Old Broccoli, which is what I'm going to start calling him, seemed
pretty eager at the outset too. We usually begin our mornings leaping
out of bed, shouting, "Into the breach once more, dear friends!" like
British soldiers fighting an unwinnable battle, but plucky just the
same. (Why are the Brits always plucky? Who knows?)</TE>
<TE>   Actually, I'm the one who does the shouting. Broccoli, who sleeps
on an old leather couch near our bed, greets the day with a bark that
is half woof and half yowl. My granddaughter Nicole says he wowls.
Anyhow, he was eager to get on with it.</TE>
<TE>   But by the time we reached the deck, something had happened. The
morning bore the subtle aroma of perfume in a woman's hair, a
hypnotizing blend of flowers and sun warmth that can turn a tiger
into a lamb and a writer into something soft and pliable and strange
looking. I was mesmerized the moment I stepped out the door.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, I began smiling. That is not a condition of my
nature, although in high school and college I was told I had a quick,
bright smile and I should use it for attracting girls and seducing
teachers into believing that I was smart and pleasant.</TE>
<TE>   I smiled all through high school, though it didn't do me a lot of
good, but quit smiling after a few months in college when people
suspected I might be on drugs, which I wasn't. And here I am smiling
again, and I'm not sure why. Even the dog is smiling, and dogs aren't
supposed to smile either.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you doing out there?" Cinelli has just called, standing
in the doorway.</TE>
<TE>   "Smiling," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Aren't you supposed to be writing a column?"</TE>
<TE>   "I am," I say. "I'm writing and smiling."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't hear the cheery clickety-click of your writing machine."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm writing it in my head first, the way Mozart wrote his stuff
before putting it on paper."</TE>
<TE>   "Good," she said, "we'll play it when you're through. Can we
expect a concerto or will it be a simple cantata this time?"</TE>
<TE>   She knows.</TE>
<TE>   What she knows is that even though it's summer, spring fever has
caught up with me and my inert friend Broccoli. We are finally tired
of winter's wearying rush of events and have dissolved into this
April state of ennui--me staring at the trees, and the dog with one
eye on the bird. It is springtime of the soul in the summer of our
languor.</TE>
<TE>   "Have we come to this?" I ask the dog. His other eye pops open. He
looks up at me with both eyes, waiting eagerly for words of strength
and wisdom, or at the very least a dog biscuit. I carry them in my
pocket. Not words of wisdom, but dog biscuits. I am tempted to share
one with him as an act of friendship, but I am not quite at that
point. I ate dog food once, thinking it was hash. Pour a little
ketchup on it, and everything tastes like hash.</TE>
<TE>   Emily Dickinson, that puckish old sprite, wrote, "A little madness
in the spring / Is wholesome even for the king." That goes for
springtime of the spirit.</TE>
<TE>   So I'm not writing of Valley secession today, or the pope or any
of his saints. I don't care about either the scramble for power or
the lure of salvation.</TE>
<TE>   All I care about is the soft breeze that stirs the uppermost
leaves of the trees, and the sun that lights their morning ... and
the good dog Broccoli, who lies in peace at my feet, one eye in
heaven and the other on the bird.</TE>

<LD>"Passion is a malady. It's possession, something dark. You are
jealous of everything. There's no lightness, no harmony," wrote the
French author Georges Simenon.</LD>
<LD>   Men and women are equally vulnerable to the sickening clutches of
jealousy. But evolutionary psychologists and anthropologists have
long trumpeted the view that there are differences in what makes men
and women most jealous. Women are most jealous when their mate forms
an emotional bond with another woman, the theory goes, and men are
most jealous of sexual infidelity. One widely reported study turned
up these distinctions when asking the genders which scenario would
evoke the most jealousy: a mate's sexual infidelity or a mate's
emotional bond with another.</LD>
<LD>   These gender differences, posit evolutionary theorists, emerged as
ancestral females evolved to become highly attuned to signals that a
mate was diverting resources (affection, food, money, time) to a
rival woman, posing a threat to the survival of his original partner
and her offspring. Men, though, evolved to be exquisitely sensitive
to cues of sexual infidelity so as to fend off the possibility of
raising offspring carrying an interloper's DNA.</LD>
<TE>   But a new study, in press for the November issue of the Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology, challenges that widely held view
about jealousy. The authors argue that the reason gender differences
appear in jealousy studies that use either/or questionnaires (with
phrasings such as: "Which would make you more jealous, x or y?") is
not evolution. They believe it's because genders understand the
questions differently.</TE>
<TE>   "What we generally find is when you tell a woman, 'Your husband is
emotionally committed to someone else,' she reasons that it means he
is emotionally committed and he is having sex with her," said the
study's coauthor Peter Salovey, the Chris Argyris Professor of
psychology and chairman of the psychology department at Yale
University. "So when you say to women, 'Which would make you more
jealous, your husband having a sexual affair or being emotionally
committed to someone else?,' she chooses the emotional commitment."
But, he noted, "When you say to a man, 'Your wife is emotionally
committed to another man,' he doesn't assume that she is having sex
with him."</TE>
<TE>   This is what David DeSteno, assistant professor of psychology at
Northeastern University and principal researcher and author of the
paper, calls "the double shot hypothesis" (one probably predicts the
other). In a 1996 study, DeSteno and Salovey asked women and men
about what a partner's emotional bond to another might mean. "The
vast majority of women said that if a man had an emotional bond with
a woman, there will probably be a sexual bond," DeSteno said. "Men
were about evenly split. Some believed a one-night stand for a woman
implied emotional involvement, some did not."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In their most recent study, DeSteno, Salovey and fellow
researchers hypothesized that both sexes would be most disturbed by
sexual infidelity. Using 111 undergraduates, the researchers first
were able to replicate the gender-difference findings by asking:
"Which of the following two events would cause more distress? (a)
Finding out that one's partner had passionate sexual intercourse with
another person or (b) finding out that one's partner had formed a
deep emotional attachment to another person."</TE>
<TE>   The researchers then asked the same 111 participants to rate the
degree to which they would experience specific feelings (anger,
jealousy, calm, relief, etc.) in response to their partner's forming
an emotional bond with another and to their partner's infidelity.</TE>
<TE>   They were next asked to rate themselves on a scale (from "1:
strongly disagree," to "7: strongly agree") in response to questions
about sexual and emotional infidelity. Finally, they were asked to
check adjectives that best described how they would feel in response
to both forms of infidelity (angry, jealous, worried, threatened,
content and so on).</TE>
<TE>   What the researchers found is that even when participants had
given answers that were gender-biased on the question of which
infidelity was most disturbing, they reported being most jealous
about sexual infidelity in all the other surveys. Women, however,
tended to report more intense emotions for both types of infidelity.
The researchers were able to replicate their findings using an
Internet survey with 22,000 participants, ranging in age from 18 to
65, culled from the Web site Emode.com.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that what was driving [the] forced choice [either/or
answers] is analysis of the trade-off, and one is that women think
that men can have sex without falling in love but if a man falls in
love, there is probably going to be sex involved," DeSteno said. This
is based on a thoughtful analysis and isn't an automatic, ingrained,
instinctual response, he said.</TE>
<TE>   An instinctual response is what evolutionary psychologists and
sociobiologists sometimes call hard-wired behavior, behavior that
occurs beyond conscious control because it's shaped by neural
pathways and cognitive mechanisms that developed as our ancestors
evolved. DeSteno and co-researchers hypothesized that sexual
infidelity would rate as more distressing than emotional infidelity
even if the test were set up to measure more automatic, less
thoughtful responses.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the second part of their forthcoming study, DeSteno and his
co-researchers divided 121 participants into a control group and an
experiment group. Those in the experiment group were asked to view
seven numbers that appeared on a computer screen and remember those
numbers while choosing which hypothetical scenarios involving a
partner would be most disturbing (i.e. was rude to my friend or was
rude to my family ....had passionate sex with someone else or formed
a deep emotional bond to someone else).</TE>
<TE>   The control group chose its answers without the "cognitive
interference" of trying to remember numbers at the same time. Women
preoccupied with the memory task while answering picked sexual
infidelity as more upsetting than women who answered without the
distraction. Men's choices remained unchanged. "On a gut level,
sexual infidelity bothered everyone more," DeSteno said,  which
undermines the argument that evolution has encoded gender-based
responses to jealousy.</TE>
<TE>   University of Texas at Austin evolutionary psychologist David M.
Buss, one of the most well known researchers using either/or
questions in jealousy studies, claims he never argued that jealousy
is an automatically activated, gender-linked response to a partner's
behavior. After reading the DeSteno and Salovey study, Buss, who is
author of "The Dangerous Passion: Why Jealousy Is as Necessary as
Love and Sex," (Free Press, 2000), was dismissive.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail response, Buss wrote that "there is tons of empirical
evidence in support of fundamental sex differences in the
psychological design of jealousy." Buss continued that the evidence
includes sexual infidelity as a sex-linked cause of divorce. Men are
more likely than women to divorce if their partner is sexually
unfaithful, and women are more likely than men to forgive a sexual
infidelity, Buss wrote, if there was no emotional involvement. When
asked to spontaneously detail a time they experienced jealousy, Buss
wrote, men reported sexual infidelities and women reported emotional
bonds with others, which Buss detailed in his book on jealousy.</TE>
<TE>   But not all social scientists are so ready to reject the findings.</TE>
<TE>   "This study contradicts the party line," said Rutgers University
anthropologist Helen Fisher, author of "The First Sex: The Natural
Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World," (Random House,
1999). "Anthropologists for some time have been citing this
conclusion that women are more disturbed and jealous by a man giving
his resources to another woman and a man is more disturbed when a
woman copulates with another man. But the fulcrum of both things is
sexual infidelity. Jealousy is a basic emotion system of the brain
that can be turned on in anybody. There is every reason to believe
that sexual infidelity is a very powerful part of the mating emotions
for both sexes."</TE>
<TE>   DeSteno and Salovey say they were inspired to test their
hypothesis because they felt the evidence for gender differences in
what triggered the most intense jealousy was weak.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not opposed to the evolutionary view of human behavior,''
DeSteno said. "In fact, we are sure that evolution was an important
shaper of human thought and behavior. We just believe that the
long-standing view put forth about human jealousy is wrong. We
actually think that there may be evolutionary influences on jealousy,
but we don't think they are going to be different for men and women."</TE>

<HD>Bubbleheads of Summer</HD>
<DH>Makers of the beloved toy star in a competitive and soapy
opera</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the season of languid afternoons, a time of year when adults
cast off responsibility to play children's games. Bubbles appear in
the air--deliciously iridescent and impermanent--perfect spheres that
disappear with a tiny pop.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like watching clouds going across the sky," said Reyne Rice,
a publicist for the market research company National Purchase Diary,
which tracks the sales of bubbles and bubble toys. "In the summer,
you're lazy. You can do things like that."</LD>
<LD>   The infinitesimally thin concoctions of soapy water and breath
have inspired dreamy wonder, nostalgia, romantic notions and songs
(think Lawrence Welk and "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles").</LD>
<TE>   But there's another side to the bubble, a competitive side driven
by the quest for novelty in a pastime that dates back centuries. On
the cutting edge of the bubble biz is a quest for better soap
solutions, more innovative wands, edible bubbles and the next new
thing in hot-selling, battery-powered blowers. The business end of
the bubble is serious. Very serious.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibit A: the decades-long competition between Chicago's
Strombecker Corp./Tootsietoy Products and Imperial Toy Corp. in Los
Angeles, widely considered the world's top manufacturers of bubble
solution and bubble toys. Both claim to be the leader of the
$66-million-a-year industry, and each insists that the secret to its
success is in the solution--which is 99% water.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Dan Shure, president of Strombecker Corp./Tootsietoy
Products, claims that his company's Mr. Bubbles solution creates
larger, longer-lasting and more plentiful bubbles with more vibrant
"rainbow effects."</TE>
<TE>   David Kort, Imperial's vice president of marketing and licensing,
scoffs at Tootsietoy's claim and credits his company with
popularizing the industry's best-sellers. "I think it's really a
non-issue," he says of Shure's claims. "We wouldn't be selling tens
of millions of bottles of bubbles a year, several times over, if
[Imperial's Miracle Bubbles] solution didn't work."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This year, the top-selling bubble item in America is Spin Master
Toys' Catch-a-Bubble, a toy that uses a thick, syrupy solution to
produce sticky bubbles that last for days. (Does a bubble that lasts
for days, not moments, lose its essential bubble nature? That's a
question for philosophers, not bubble salesmen.)</TE>
<TE>   Alerted to this ranking, Kort grows slightly perturbed. "We had
that same process five years ago," he says. "We have items just like
that. It's not a true bubble item."</TE>
<TE>   Strombecker Corp./Tootsietoy Products once earned the top spot in
U.S. bubble-toy sales with its battery-powered bubble gun. "You just
keep pulling the trigger and it just spews bubbles all over the
place," said publicist Rice. "It's a really, really fun toy. It just
blew off the shelves. Very hot item."</TE>
<TE>   Kort's response? "It's not the first of its type."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the two companies compete fiercely for the tiny bit of
retail shelf space allotted to bubble toys. They even disagree on how
bubbles were popularized.</TE>
<TE>   According to Shure, it was in the 1920s, when a Chicago pharmacist
named Sid Belmont packaged soap solutions in glass bottles and
started selling them to children. He founded a chemical company that
in 1979 was acquired by Strombecker Corp./Tootsietoy Products.</TE>
<TE>   But the history is recounted differently by Imperial's founder and
president Fred Kort, David's father. As he tells it, a Charlotte,
N.C., man named Joe Scott (brother to actor Randolph Scott) founded a
bubble manufacturing company in 1946, bringing bubbles to the masses.
Kort's first bubble job was at the California branch of Scott's
company.</TE>
<TE>   An interesting footnote to Fred Kort's history: His oldest sons,
Steven and Jordan Kort, left Imperial Toy Corp. in 1999 to start
their own toy company in Northridge called What Kids Want. Now, the
brothers are marketing their own brand of bubbles, a dry chemical
that comes attached to a wand and, when dipped in water, produces a
"cleaner" bubble called a "Wubble." Steven says he isn't really
competing with his father and brother, because "we have the most
innovative bubbles in probably 15 years."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "There's a little art in this, as crazy as it sounds," says David
Kort. He's standing in the "bubble area" of the company's vast toy
showroom, a child's dream where thousands of toys line lavender
walls. The boyish-faced man has rolled up his sleeves and is
earnestly blowing bubbles from a kazoo.</TE>
<TE>   When the toy fails him, he picks up a large purple paddle that
creates "bubbles within bubbles, if you will," says Kort. Soon the
office table is strewn with bubble toys and wet with puddles of
bubble solution.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Then, it's on to the battery-powered bubble machines. As Chief
Financial Officer Peter Tiger takes the Bubble Torch, Kort handles
the Triple Bubble Blaster, which lights up and shoots bubbles in
three directions. Huge clouds of bubbles surround the two men. "We'll
just create a bubble storm here," Kort says, with a childlike giggle.
Then, he explains Imperial's goal: to give children "something so
high-tech to keep them interested."</TE>
<TE>   Hence, the bubble toys resembling a video game controller, cell
phone and video camera. Kort explains, "We're trying to emulate
real-life experience for children."</TE>
<TE>   And, perhaps, put a few more pretty bubbles in the air.</TE>

<DH>Tie the knot and strap on the bungee cord: Welcome to the
modern honeymoon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the third day, Christine Bubser began having second thoughts. She
and her husband, David Baron, had just begun a bike trip through
newly opened Bhutan when Baron was clipped by a passing truck and
thrown into a ditch. When he tried to stand, he found it quite
difficult.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm thinking, 'Oh, my God. I'm 36 years old, I finally get
married and my new husband has just been hit by a truck in a country
where to get decent medical care, they airlift you to India," Bubser
says now, four years later.</LD>
<LD>   Wincing, Baron gamely got back on his bike and they finished their
trip--an 11-day, 450-mile bicycle trek through the Himalayas that
included 50,000 feet of ascent and 60,000 of descent. But although he
could ride, Baron could not really walk.</LD>
<TE>   "So I had to carry all the luggage whenever we made camp," Bubser
says. "I'm thinking: 'What kind of honeymoon is this?' "</TE>
<TE>   An extreme honeymoon. A postnuptial adventure that, more and more,
is replacing the time-honored Caribbean cruise or trip to Niagara
Falls. Forget two weeks in Italy, let's go trekking through Nepal or
bungee-jumping in New Zealand. A cabin in Vermont? How banal. Let's
tour Vietnam or Sri Lanka, let's climb Mt. Everest. And if we must
visit a predictable country like Switzerland or France, at least
let's do it on our bikes or with large packs upon our backs.</TE>
<TE>   A generation ago, the honeymoon was a social rite of passage. As
recently as the early '60s, it was often the first trip a couple took
together, certainly the first one in which they openly shared a bed
or even a room. The honeymoon was designed to allow a couple to live
together for the first time away from the pressures of everyday life,
to get to know each other in a way that perhaps they hadn't before.</TE>
<TE>   For modern newlyweds, that traditional concept of a honeymoon is
practically obsolete. They are older, wealthier, better traveled and
have usually spent a fair amount of time in close quarters with each
other. Bubser and Baron's first trip together was a six-week tour of
Africa. "After something like that," Bubser says, "I knew I had to
marry him."</TE>
<TE>   The travel industry is nothing if not responsive. Honeymoon
packages, once the province of high-end hotels and cruise lines, are
now offered by trekking and adventure companies, although some have
redefined "adventure" to include chateau-hopping and "tent" camping
suitable for traveling royalty. International travel Web sites hawk
the romantic possibilities of everything from ice camping to hot-air
ballooning.</TE>
<TE>   "People live together for years nowadays," says Tom Hale,
president of Backroads, which puts together adventure tours. "So they
do what they want to do, not some preconceived notion of a honeymoon.
We've had people take very high-end walking and biking tours, where
they're staying in high-end hotels, and people who have shared tents
with other folks in the Grand Canyon."</TE>
<TE>   Backroads, which is in Berkeley, has seen so many honeymooners
that it started a honeymoon registry--instead of gifts, friends of
the new couple can donate to their bike, hike, kayak and snorkeling
tour of Thailand. Which makes sense since such organized tours can
range from $1,700 per person for a domestic trek to $5,000 for more
exotic destinations.</TE>
<TE>   "People are getting married older now," says Hale. "They already
have plenty of stuff."</TE>
<TE>   That stuff often includes a ticking biological clock.</TE>
<TE>   "We see a lot of B.C. activity," says Jim Sano, president of
Geographic Expeditions in San Francisco. "People want to take the
trip they won't be able to take after they have children."</TE>
<TE>   That was the primary motivator in Carmen and Chris Joseph's
decision to take an 11-day trek into the Anapurna Sanctuary of Nepal
after their wedding last year. Both are avid campers and hikers and
had traveled quite a bit--he proposed during a trip to New
Zealand--so the honeymoon bar was set fairly high.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we wanted to get pregnant right away," says Carmen, who
is due to deliver her first child in October. "So we decided to go
someplace we wouldn't take a small child. We thought about Africa and
Tibet, but the altitude was too high. We chose Nepal and so we had to
trek because that is what you do in Nepal."</TE>
<TE>   They were part of a group tour and so, although they had a tent to
themselves, they were basically sharing their honeymoon with five
other trekkers and a crew of 30, she says. A crew set up camp every
night and broke it down in the morning and the food was good, but in
11 days she got to shower only three times. "That was hard."</TE>
<TE>   About three days into the trek, the party passed over a very high
and narrow part of the trail, and Carmen began experiencing vertigo.
"I thought for a minute I wouldn't be able to go on, that I'd have to
stay behind in a tea house while Chris took our honeymoon for us."
But the guides talked her down, or rather up, and she pressed on.</TE>
<TE>   At 10,000 feet, she experienced altitude sickness but,
fortunately, had gotten a prescription to fight the symptoms. (Her
husband didn't have the same luck when back in Katmandu, he brushed
his teeth using tap water and was sick for the trip from Katmandu to
Bangkok and for almost three months after their return.) The most
difficult thing, she says, was getting up at 6 every morning to get
on the trail.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very hard," she says, "but it was wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly a conventional definition of a "wonderful" honeymoon,
but, according to Cherri Briggs, president of Explore Inc., a lot of
younger newlyweds don't want to go conventional. The number of
honeymooners calling her company has increased so much in the past
four or five years, she says, that Explore, of Steamboat Springs,
Colo., now offers several trips specifically geared to them. And the
expectations have changed as much as the interest level.</TE>
<TE>   "People want the exact opposite of what they wanted in the past,"
she says. "They want to conserve rather than kill things, they want
to hang out with the villagers rather than be waited on by them. And
the new profile includes a lot of activity--there is something very
sexy about a near-death experience," she adds with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Adventure travel in general, and Africa in particular, can break
down emotional and psychic barriers faster than any trip to Europe,
Briggs says. "In Paris, you're going to museums, restaurants, it's
all in your head. Here it is absolutely primordial. You have to give
up control, turn it over to the guides. Which is why so many women
fall in love with their guides. Which," she adds, musing, "might not
be the best thing on a honeymoon."</TE>
<TE>   According to Geographic's Sano, a general ratcheting up of travel
experiences has pushed the limits of what some people expect from
their honeymoons.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the '70s, the number of trekkers in general has increased
dramatically. When we started, there were five adventure companies in
Nepal; now there are more than 300," he says. "People are better
traveled in general so it takes something extra to make a trip
special."</TE>
<TE>   The proliferation of travel magazines also makes the world seem
smaller and any trip plausible. "Outside magazine and National
Geographic Traveler make even the most difficult trips seem
accessible and doable."</TE>
<TE>   His company, he says, has always had a small but steady number of
honeymooners, but he sees a huge increase in couples who might pass
on a lengthy group tour, which can be pricey, but plan similar
adventure vacations on their own. "Honeymooners, understandably, may
not want to travel with other people," he says.</TE>
<TE>   For Bubser and Baron the group experience was even more souring
than the accident. Being trapped with a bunch of "drunk, angry
Brits," many of whom were highly competitive cycling club buddies,
Bubser says, was not exactly conducive to romance. "Even if you could
get past the tiny tent, the various gastrointestinal problems and the
clothes that never quite dried," says Baron.</TE>
<TE>   So when a couple of their well-traveled friends asked them for
honeymoon advice, they were cautious. "Go somewhere relaxing," Baron
says. But Amy Guggenheim and Ed Shenkan, who took a five-week trip to
Greece and Italy to celebrate their engagement, are leaning toward a
bike trip in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought about scuba diving in the Galapagos," says Guggenheim,
"but the weather's not good in October. Vietnam is supposed to be
beautiful in the fall."</TE>
<TE>   Although they haven't agreed on the length of the trip (Shenkan
says five weeks, Guggenheim says maybe three), they are committed to
breaking up the biking with stays at beachside hotels. "We do want to
make sure we have some air-conditioning," says Shenkan.</TE>
<TE>   They realize their plans are a far cry from their parents'
Caribbean and Bermuda honeymoons, but, says Guggenheim, travel is
easier and cheaper than in her parents' day and they will be older
newlyweds than their parents were.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 37, Ed's 31, we have more money, this isn't our first trip
together," she says. "We want to do something we'd never done
before."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, of course, getting married.</TE>

<LD>Put on a Musical!</LD>
<LD>   Summer's a great time to put on a puppet musical. Follow the
directions and soon you'll entertain family and friends.</LD>
<LD>   Step 1: Write a script for your musical. You might want to base it
on a fairy tale that you already know, such as "Little Red Riding
Hood" or "Jack and the Beanstalk." Set your words to music and have
your characters sing their lines instead of saying them.</LD>
<TE>   Step 2: Take a cardboard box and paint the outside a bright color.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Ask an adult to cut openings in the side and bottom of the
box as shown at right.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Paint a scene on the back wall of the box that goes with
your script.</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: Make finger puppets out of old socks. Draw faces on the
puppets, and use yarn for hair, gluing the "hair" to the "head" of
the puppet. You can even dress your puppet using small scraps of
material.</TE>
<TE>   Step 6: Place the box on a table, letting it hang over just enough
in the back so you can stick your hands and puppets inside the box
from underneath. You might need to tape the box to the table to
steady it during your show.</TE>
<TE>   Step 7: Practice, practice, practice.</TE>
<TE>   Step 8: Invite your family and friends to watch your performance.</TE>
<TE>   For more summer music fun, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn.
presents Open House at the Hollywood Bowl through Aug. 16. This
summer's theme is "From Sea to Shining Sea: A Celebration of American
Music." Performances are 9:30 a.m. for children ages 3 and 4, and
10:30 and 11:30 a.m. for ages 5 to 10. Arts and crafts workshops are
also available. For more information, call (323) 850-2000 or go to
hollywoodbowl.com.</TE>

<HD>Not Just Skeletons From the Closet</HD>
<DH>Is his the 'official' history of the Grateful Dead? Pretty
close.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The hardest moment for Dennis McNally in the more than two decades
he's served as historian and publicist for the Grateful Dead was not
when group leader Jerry Garcia died--seven years ago this Friday--of
a heart attack while in a drug rehab center. Nor was it the earlier
death of a band member, the 1990 overdose of keyboard player Brent
Mydland.</LD>
<LD>   It was an incident at an Indiana concert a month before Garcia's
death that to McNally marked more of a spiritual death in the
'60s-rooted community that had gathered around the San Francisco
band. "The worst night with the Grateful Dead was at Deer Creek in
the summer of '95," he says. That Sunday of the Fourth of July
weekend, several thousand people who had shown up at the outdoor
amphitheater without tickets stormed the back fence and rushed into
the already crowded facility, while others in the parking lot threw
rocks and bottles at security.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not because we had a bunch of kids break into the show,
although it was frightening to see," McNally says. "It was that a
large part of the audience turned and cheered them on.... It did
break Jerry's heart. It broke everybody's heart." The next day's
scheduled concert at the same location was canceled, the first time
in the band's 30-year history that the audience had caused a show to
be called off. It was devastating for the band for whom the audience
members were not merely fans, but an extended family--the storied
Deadheads, a community germinated in, and maintaining the legacy of,
San Francisco's mid-'60s Acid Tests and Summer of Love.</TE>
<TE>   The influx of people at that concert who had no connection to the
communal spirit and just wanted to party was so pronounced that it
put the future of the annual summer tour--for which thousands of
Deadheads would caravan from show to show with quasi-mystic zeal--in
doubt. Garcia's death only made it official.</TE>
<TE>   For McNally, what the Deer Creek disaster portended and Garcia's
death made real was both a personal tragedy and a professional
nightmare. But it was also a moment of truth. Since 1980, he'd been
charged with writing the official history of the Grateful Dead. The
closing chapter had now played out, and he had work to do.</TE>
<TE>   The result is "A Long Strange Trip: The Inside History of the
Grateful Dead," a comprehensive, colorful and complex look at the
band and its surrounding culture, due in bookstores on Tuesday from
Random House's Broadway Books.</TE>
<TE>   Starting with the musicians' childhoods in the '40s and '50s, the
620-page book leaves little about the band and its milieu
unexplored--from the intertwined formation of the group and the
Haight-Ashbury scene to Deadheads now walking the corridors of power
(Laker coach Phil Jackson and Sen. Patrick Leahy [D-Vt.], to name but
two) and the Dead brand-name marking everything from neckties to Ben
&amp; Jerry's Cherry Garcia ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   The book balances insights into the characters' psyches, cultural
anthropology of the extended family, vivid peeks behind the scenes of
the band's singular concerts and the evolution of the music as it
reached into and ultimately enriched a distinctly American mythos of
drifters, outlaws and seekers. "Jerry's death made the book
possible," says McNally, 52. "He'd invited me in 1980. I spent about
four years doing basic research, got hired [as publicist] in '84, and
tried to do both for a year and a half. But for time reasons and the
emotional reason that I was a historian and respect history, I
realized the two do not go together. So I spent the next 11 years
being publicist and taking notes on the side."</TE>
<TE>   He's remained the publicist for the ongoing Grateful Dead
Productions--which oversees an array of enterprises including
members' individual bands, a stream of archival CD releases (more
than 30 full concert albums since Garcia's death, plus two massive
box set anthologies) and related concert ventures. This past weekend,
in fact, the four surviving members--singer-guitarist Bob Weir,
bassist Phil Lesh and drummers Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey
Hart--performed together for the first time since the leader's
passing in a two-day "Grateful Dead Family reunion" festival at
Alpine Valley, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   "Emotionally, [the current role] is nothing the same as being
publicist for the Grateful Dead," McNally says. "But that
[distancing] made it possible for me to write a very nonapologetic
version. The band members vetted it for facts, but it is not the
authorized story. This is my version. And anyway, the experience is
so subjective that the idea of an official version is hilarious."</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzmann concurs that no "official" history would be possible.
But both McNally's thoroughness and perspective impress him. "Other
people have written books about us and either tear us apart or go the
other way like we could do no wrong, and [McNally's] much more
honest," says Kreutzmann. "I'll take the truth any time. And it
served to tell me a lot of things I didn't even know. When there are
this many people in a family it's hard to know what's going on all
the time--especially with the early history."</TE>
<TE>   In McNally's account, the Deer Creek disaster is almost a replay
of the situation in the band's heady Haight-Ashbury days, when young
would-be hippies flocked to the Bay Area in search of spiritual
and/or hedonistic freedoms and spoiled the vibe.</TE>
<TE>   "Both times were cases of system overload," McNally says. "But the
people who fell into the Haight fell into it in an organic way, on a
very individual or small-group basis, having felt themselves drifting
away from conventional society and toward less material values and
questioning. The Deadheads became Deadheads in an organic way, not
because they heard a hit on the radio."</TE>
<TE>   McNally is hardly the stereotypical Deadhead. He favors an
unassuming manner over tie-dyed exuberance, and lives a relatively
quiet life in San Francisco with his wife, photographer Susana
Millman. (They have an adult daughter, Season Ray.) He'll
passionately discuss San Francisco Giants baseball as readily as
Grateful Dead music. His musical tastes run to jazz and he's more
comfortable in lone or small-group settings than in communal revels.
And he entered the Dead family through a backdoor, having been a
scholar on Beat writer Jack Kerouac, who held a position similar to
Garcia's for an earlier generation of American bohemians. (McNally's
first book, "Desolate Angel: Jack Kerouac, the Beat Generation and
America," expanded from his doctoral thesis, is slated to be
republished by DeCapo Press next spring.)</TE>
<TE>   An Army brat born in Ft. Meade, Md., he spent his teen years in
Maine after his father retired from the military to become a
Unitarian minister. He graduated from St. Lawrence University in 1971
and then attended graduate school to study history at the University
of Massachusetts, where he focused and formalized his interest in the
counterculture. "I was never a hippie," he says. "At that time, I
guess you would say I was more political. There were May Day
demonstrations in D.C. in the spring of '71. I took a little pepper
gas in that. I got to graduate school in the fall of '71, and you
could still smell tear gas on the coat I wore."</TE>
<TE>   Early on at graduate school he set his sights on writing a book
about Kerouac and the Beats. And then in 1972, a friend initiated him
into a related world. "He bought me my first ticket [to a Grateful
Dead show], stuck a tab [of LSD] in my mouth and said, 'Have a good
time,' " he says. "A few months later, I came to the revelation that
what I'm really up to here is a two-volume history of bohemian
America. The first covers the '40s and '50s with Kerouac, and the
second the '60s and '70s--and since I'm slow, the '80s and '90s--with
the Grateful Dead."</TE>
<TE>   A brief introduction to Garcia backstage at a 1972 concert, when
he saw that the guitarist had put a photo of Kerouac on his dressing
room wall, confirmed the link. "When the Kerouac book was done in
'79, I sent [Garcia] a copy and waited," he says. "I knew if I'd
marched up to them and said I wanted to do a book, they'd say, 'Go
away.' But after he got the book, I spoke to Jerry and we talked
about Kerouac and we spoke some more and, eventually, he said, 'Why
don't you do one about us?' I said, 'Good idea!' "</TE>
<TE>   McNally was given full access to the Dead, but soon realized that
an official position in the organization would give him a better
vantage. "The way it came about was perfectly Grateful Dead," he
says. "The way you worked for them was you were evaluated as a
friend, and whether or not everybody could put up with you, because
everybody [in the band] got a vote. And after you passed the test, if
there was a job you could fill, you got the job. I got the publicity
job because the secretaries complained that no one was dealing with
the media. Garcia said, 'Get McNally to do it.' No more thought than
that."</TE>
<TE>   Although it took 23 years for McNally to write his second book,
he's already at work on a third, which will take another angle on
Americana by tracing the cultural journey along the Mississippi River
from the source in Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   But he maintains that the cultural journey the Dead and Deadheads
carried from the '60s holds just as legitimate a place in the fabric
of American life. "As borderline anarchy, it couldn't last," he says
of the world in which the Dead was spawned and, to many people, still
represents today. "But that was the template for the Grateful Dead
experience, and they stayed true to it, from when everybody was
paying a dollar for tickets to grossing $60 [million] or $70 million
a year. Jerry didn't mind making money, as long as he spent it. To
keep money around was to turn you into a materialist.</TE>
<TE>   "Here it is 2002 and we don't have enough perspective to know for
sure, but if the world does not go to hell in a handbasket
environmentally, it will be because of what we learned in the '60s.
Feminism, homosexual rights, civil rights--a lot of stuff happened in
the '60s that will take another hundred years to see where it leads,
but it's clearly a pattern."</TE>

<LD>Two rows of kids, five in each line were piling into the camp bus.
Devin was one of them. She had already said goodbye to her mom, but
when she found a seat and sat down she looked out the window and
waved goodbye again.</LD>
<LD>   When the last camper got on and the doors closed, she clutched her
backpack in her lap and bit her lip, trying not to cry. No one sat
with her. Devin was going away to camp for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   The bus rolled out of the parking lot toward the freeway. Most of
the kids were quiet, except for the two who sat in the last row. A
kid sitting across from her was looking out the window. The name
"Jack" was written in large black letters across his backpack.</LD>
<TE>   Devin leaned her head against the seat and closed her eyes. She
missed her best friend Yvette, who had gone away to Texas to visit
her grandparents for the summer. She missed Monster, her cat that
liked to curl up on her lap at night.</TE>
<TE>   After a couple of hours the bus slowed down as it took a
right-hand turn onto a dirt road. The road was very bumpy but the bus
soon came to a stop. The driver opened the doors.</TE>
<TE>   A kid who looked like a teenager bounded into the bus. He wore a
large brimmed hat, long pants, hiking boots and a t-shirt that read:
Camp Rattlesnake.</TE>
<TE>   "Hello campers! My name is Wolfman! I'm your camp counselor! I
want you to grab your belongings and line up outside."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone stood up, buzzing with excitement. Devin's heart started
racing. She heaved her backpack onto her back.</TE>
<TE>   Devin stepped off the bus and onto the dry, dusty earth. She
looked around. She wondered where they were. There was no camp in
site. Tumbleweeds and a few cacti surrounded them.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey Wolfman," shouted Jack. "Where's the camp?"</TE>

<HD>The Other Hormone</HD>
<DH>Androgen is gaining attention in treating a variety of
problems women face as they age</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hormones considered to be the foundation of masculinity may be a long
overlooked component to treating menopausal symptoms and sexual
problems in women.</LD>
<LD>   Androgens, a family of hormones that includes testosterone, are
crucial to women's bone health, sexual function, muscle strength and
mood, health experts say. Traditionally used by young women who have
had their ovaries removed, they are now seen as a possible remedy for
health problems experienced by women as they age.</LD>
<LD>   Even otherwise healthy young women are increasingly taking the
hormones, often without a prescription, for depression or to boost
their libido.</LD>
<TE>   Doctors and researchers say that, although little is known about
the long-term effects of these chemicals, they may be able to improve
the physical and mental health of women who are not getting adequate
relief from estrogen.</TE>
<TE>   "Most women think of testosterone as being a male hormone and
estrogen as being a female hormone," says Dr. James Simon, a clinical
professor at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and an
expert on hormones and sexuality. "The reality is that these are not
male or female hormones. Both of the hormones are integral in women.
Without them there are symptoms, and if you replace them you can
alleviate those symptoms."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the better-known estrogen, which the ovaries stop making
after menopause, androgen begins to decline subtly around age 30 and
is reduced by about half by menopause. This gradual decline of the
hormone, researchers say, may have disguised its impact.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors have long prescribed testosterone to women who have had
their ovaries removed because the sudden plunge in estrogen and
androgen can lead to sexual dysfunction and hot flashes.
Testosterone, the androgen of primary importance, is also prescribed
for women with uncommon pituitary and adrenal conditions that lower
testosterone.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, testosterone has been offered to post-menopausal
women who continue to have hot flashes or vaginal dryness even though
they take estrogen. One prescription product, a pill combining
estrogen and testosterone called Estratest, is available for
menopausal women.</TE>
<TE>   But researchers are moving past this limited use of testosterone
therapy. A testosterone patch is undergoing clinical trials in women
with sexual dysfunction, and scientists are studying whether
testosterone can improve women's bone strength, muscle mass and
general sense of well-being.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 40% of women complain of some type of sexual
dysfunction, studies have shown. Given this figure, androgen
replacement should be given the same kind of attention as estrogen
replacement, says Dr. Glenn Braunstein, who is testing Procter &amp;
Gamble's testosterone patch at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Some women develop significant symptoms of androgen
insufficiency: low libido, low quality of life," he says. "Some
symptoms improve with estrogen replacement. Hot flashes are clearly
improved by estrogen. But once the estrogen is taken care of, if
libido stays low and [a blood test shows] free testosterone is low,
giving androgen is probably in order."</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many women have low libido caused by androgen
insufficiency. But Braunstein says that androgen treatment should,
for now, focus on post-menopausal women, including younger women who
have had their ovaries removed.</TE>
<TE>   "Pre-menopausal women who complain of low libido is the group I'm
most uneasy about," he says. Desire problems in younger women are
more likely to be caused by factors other than testosterone levels,
such as fatigue and relationship problems, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, androgen use among women of all ages is becoming
more popular, despite an absence of research data. A growing number
of doctors are prescribing androgens to pre-menopausal women with
sexual dysfunction. Other women take over-the-counter DHEA
supplements.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a real interest in this, and a fair amount of androgen
is already being used," Braunstein says. "But I worry about the
potential side effects."</TE>
<TE>   Androgens can cause masculinizing features in some women,
including acne, facial hair and lowered voice. They can also lead to
liver injury, fluid retention, sleep apnea, aggressive behavior and
lowering of HDH (good) cholesterol levels. Over-the-counter androgens
have other problems. For example, the actual amount of chemical in
DHEA supplements can vary "from negligible to higher than is stated
on the label," says Braunstein.</TE>
<TE>   Widespread use of androgens in women is also premature because
there is not yet a reliable diagnostic test to quantify androgen
levels.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, researchers say they hope the news that estrogen and
progestin replacement therapy slightly raises the risk of heart
attacks, strokes and breast cancer does not taint this new avenue of
research.</TE>
<TE>   While androgen therapy is usually tied to sexual dysfunction, the
hormone could prove beneficial to women in other ways, says Simon,
noting that several preliminary studies show the hormone can
strengthen bones and muscles and lower body fat.</TE>
<TE>   "Androgen therapy, to me, is also about muscle mass, muscle tone
and bone density," he says. "For women in early menopause, having
less fat and more muscle and being in better shape and having more
strength is a great thing. There is also a whole cadre of issues
around androgens and women that have to do with sense of well-being
and cognitive function."</TE>
<TE>   "Testosterone is a medication that has a lot of promise, and we
don't know a lot about its risk or benefits," adds Dr. Elizabeth
Barrett-Connor, a UC San Diego researcher who has studied whether
estrogen and androgen together work better to increase bone mineral
density than estrogen alone. Women who become menopausal after their
ovaries are removed tend to lose bone mass fast.</TE>
<TE>   But women should not jump on the androgen bandwagon as a
substitute for estrogen, she adds.</TE>
<TE>   "We really need longer-term safety and efficacy data for
testosterone," she says.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I learned to surf when I lived by the beach and begged to borrow a
10-foot-long board from a colleague. He had me practice popping up
from my stomach to my feet a few times on the beach, then I was on my
own.</LD>
<LD>   But what would it be like to actually start out with a surf
lesson, I wondered?</LD>
<LD>   To find out, I headed to La Jolla for a weekend clinic at Surf
Diva Surf School.</LD>
<TE>   Surf Diva was founded in 1996 by Isabelle Tihanyi, 32, a
competitive surfer who started teaching surfing in high school. She
began Surf Diva with her twin sister, Caroline, because she felt
there weren't enough women in the water.</TE>
<TE>   "There was not enough instruction that was geared toward women and
was non-intimidating, that wasn't just about catching the biggest
wave," Isabelle Tihanyi said. "I wanted it to be about having fun and
being lighthearted."</TE>
<TE>   Surf Diva, based in La Jolla, offers private lessons for girls and
women, with teen surf camps, weekend clinics and even a session
called "Guys on the Side"--co-ed private lessons or classes. They
teach at locations from Vancouver , Canada, to Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico. All classes are taught by the "Diva method." That, explained
Tihanyi, means breaking surfing down into baby steps, giving lots of
one-on-one attention, and going out in the water only as far as
people are comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend clinic, which costs $115, consists of two-hour
sessions on both Saturday and Sunday. Classes start at different
times of day, but I signed up for the 7:30-9:30 a.m. class. Even
three weeks in advance, most of the later clinics were full.</TE>
<TE>   I arrived at 7:15 a.m. The day was overcast, but the beach at La
Jolla was already so crowded I could barely get a parking place.</TE>
<TE>   Surf Diva set up camp right next to Lifeguard Stand 32, a tent for
shade, a rug of AstroTurf on the sand, and a rack of flowered girlie
rash-guards (T-shirts worn under wet suits to prevent rashes in
winter, and used as light insulation in summer) at the ready. Stacks
of blue, pink and yellow foam boards lay against a nearby wall.</TE>
<TE>   We had five teachers, who all looked like they had stepped right
out of the pages of Wahine, a women's action-sports magazine that
ceased publication earlier this year. We were a group of 25 women,
ranging in age from teens to late 40s. Most of the women were local;
one mother was on vacation from North Carolina with her family, and
had never even ridden a boogie board.</TE>
<TE>   A Movie's Ripple Effect</TE>
<TE>   Enrollment in Surf Diva classes has been growing quickly. Tihanyi
estimates that this year 5,000 women will paddle out into the water
with Surf Diva. And that's before the debut of Universal's "Blue
Crush," a big-budget, chick surf movie set to open in theaters on
Aug. 16.</TE>
<TE>   "Just since the trailers have come out, our phones have been
ringing off the hook," Tihanyi said. "I think that after that movie
every little girl is going to want to surf. It's going to be like
Dorothy Hamill and ice skating."</TE>
<TE>   Back at the beach, we introduced ourselves, and everyone said why
they were there. Some had always lived by the sea. Some had seen the
Divas out in the water and wanted to check them out. A lot of women
had surfing boyfriends and husbands who either tormented them by
dragging them out into too-big surf or abandoned them on the beach
while they joined their buddies in the waves.</TE>
<TE>   The first 45 minutes of class were spent on the sand, learning
surfing etiquette and basic ocean safety. If there's a riptide, swim
parallel to the beach, they told us. Fall flat off your board. Don't
be a board caddy, chasing after other surfers' runaway boards. Always
wade into the water shuffling your feet to scare away stingrays so
those camouflaged bottom-dwellers don't zap you. And never, ever cut
off a surfer who is already on the wave.</TE>
<TE>   We learned the anatomy of the surfboard and a smattering of surfer
lingo. Then we dragged our foam boards out to the sand, donned the
aloha print rash guards, and practiced pop-ups on land. Next, the
instructors divided us into smaller groups of five for more intensive
instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "Look for your sweet spot on the board," said instructor Jane
Kaine. We slithered around on our stomachs, trying to figure out
where that might be.</TE>
<TE>   We got in push-up position and curled our toes under, ready for
orders.</TE>
<TE>   "Here comes the wave. Paddle! Paddle!" yelled Kaine. We looked
over our shoulders at the imaginary wave, paddled through the air,
and then, bing!, popped to our feet like Bruce Lee. "Knees bent, so
you can take the bumps," Kaine coached. We squatted low and stable,
riding our imaginary waves to the horizon like Hawaiian queens.</TE>
<TE>   Then we strapped on our leashes, picked up our boards, and headed
for the waves.</TE>
<TE>   The foam boards are light and easy to maneuver as boogie boards.
An out-of-control bonk from a flying foam board won't cut your lip or
put a bump on your head. The boards are simple to paddle out and less
scary for beginners. They are good in a crowd.</TE>
<TE>   On the first day, our instructors kept us inside in the white
water. Kaine took us, one at a time, and pushed us from behind,
launching us into the waves. She yelled encouragement and advice as
students toppled over, time after time.</TE>
<TE>   Tihanyi said some people ask her if she can guarantee that
students will stand up in a class. She always says no. The only
guarantee she offers is that participants will have a good time.</TE>
<TE>   By day's end, everyone in my group had gotten up. Some were
wobbly, some were screaming in terror, and some rode to shore with
their feet spread wide in the classic stink bug stance. But they were
riding the waves!</TE>
<TE>   The instructors sent us home with a round of applause and orders
to do 25 pop-ups on the bedroom floor before we turned in.</TE>
<TE>   When we arrived on Sunday, Diva Kaine asked us: "How are your
muscles? How is your mind?"</TE>
<TE>   Denise Martella, 35, said her arms were so sore that her husband
had to dress her that morning because she couldn't raise her arms
over her head.</TE>
<TE>   We stretched in a big circle in the sand, then got another
dry-land lecture on some practical surfing basics. "I'm taking my
group to the outside," Diva Kaine announced. "I think people are
ready to get on their board and paddle out."</TE>
<TE>   I've been out in the water a lot, but I had to admit, it felt
pretty cool to be out in the lineup with a tribe of women.</TE>
<TE>   We practiced punching through the surf without losing our boards.
We raised ourselves up in push-up position to get through the baby
waves, and flipped over and turtle-rolled for the bigger swells. We
bobbed in the water, facing out to the horizon in search of the
perfect wave, then learned to turn and paddle for it. "Put the nose
in the air, slide back, grab the rails, do the eggbeater kick," Diva
Kaine coached. Slowly, the surfer girls spun into position. Finally,
we learned how to pull out of a wave.</TE>
<TE>   Then we were left to catch our own waves. The waves were perfect
and smooth, and the women in my group were zipping by me on their
boards. There were no hang-tens, a lot of squeals, and a bunch of
women zooming to shore in the white water still stuck on all fours,
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the most athletic person," said Megan Riggs, 32, of
Carmel Valley after class. "Let's just put that out there. But I
actually stood up. It was the most amazing experience. It was
probably only five seconds, but it felt like forever."</TE>
<TE>   Waves Provide Workout</TE>
<TE>   None of us had shoulders like an Adonis or rippling golden brown
biceps after a day, but steady surfing can carve a great upper-body
physique. Paddling for waves can be as much of a workout as swimming
laps in a pool--especially in big surf--and a lot more fun. Even
surfing for less than an hour in small waves I burned 238 calories
the first day and 150 the second.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic really was for flat-out beginners. I thought maybe I'd
learn how to walk to the end of my board, or pick up some amazing
style that a self-trained surfer like me never got.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis, though, was on learning the basics. Still, I had to
hand it to the Divas: They packed a real surf experience into two
days. They taught camaraderie and chick-power. They projected
attitude, but not testosterone. They gave us a great workout, but
didn't punish us.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, they got women in the water, floating like mermaids
and addicted to that rush of riding a wave. There is nothing like it.
Even on a sponge board in baby waves.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are out in the water, nothing else matters," Tihanyi
says. "It's not what's in your bank account. It's not what kind of
car you drive. Get off the beach! Don't let the boys have all the
fun."</TE>

<LD>Blue-collar workers aren't giving up cigarettes as readily as
white-collar workers, and on-the-job smoking-cessation programs are
less successful for them as well. Researchers at the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute of Boston believe they've found a solution:
combining cessation programs with work safety programs.</LD>
<LD>   To test their theory that combined health messages might be more
helpful, Glorian Sorensen, director of the Center for Community-Based
Research at Dana-Farber, and her colleagues worked with 15
manufacturing companies in eastern Massachusetts. Half of them
conducted health promotion efforts to help workers quit smoking and
eat more fruits and vegetables. The others combined similar efforts
on smoking and diet with programs that informed workers how to
protect themselves from exposure to toxic chemicals and other job
hazards.</LD>
<LD>   Eighteen months after the programs were initiated, the researchers
found that in work sites that received the combined programs, twice
as many blue-collar smokers quit, compared with those in the work
sites that got only the promotion program.</LD>
<TE>   "If we want to promote smoking cessation, then we need to think
about the larger health issues these workers are dealing with. If
you're exposed to [toxic] chemicals, it's important to address those
hazards and not just smoking," says Sorensen. And obviously, for many
of the workers, awareness of the interaction between the two made a
difference.</TE>

<TE>   Study Finds Lower Male Hormone Levels Among Apnea Sufferers</TE>
<TE>   Men with sleep apnea who think they're just too tired to have sex
may actually have flagging testosterone levels to blame for their
lack of desire.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli researchers measured testosterone levels in 10 men with
sleep apnea and five healthy men every 20 minutes throughout the
night. They found that the normal peak in testosterone didn't happen
in about half of those with sleep apnea.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers also learned that the accumulated amount of
testosterone during the night in those men whose hormones didn't peak
was at least 50% lower than the average levels in the five good
sleepers. "We believe the entire endocrine system is blunted in those
patients," says Peretz Lavie, director of the Sleep Research Center
at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, where the study
was done.</TE>

<TE>   Plaque Ruptures Linked to Repeated Coronaries</TE>
<TE>   A person who has a heart attack is at high risk of having another
one within the year, and now researchers have uncovered a possible
explanation. Using an ultrasound technique that creates 3-D images
from within an artery, French researchers found that there are often
other plaque ruptures in the vessels supplying the heart muscle.</TE>
<TE>   A study of 24 patients in France found that 79% of the people who
had their first coronary had at least one plaque rupture besides the
one that caused their heart attack. And one in eight of the patients
had unstable plaque in all three arteries.</TE>
<TE>   These plaque ruptures may not create a blockage, but their
presence does indicate that coronary artery disease isn't a simple
mechanical problem but a complex biological process that may involve
all the arteries supplying the heart.</TE>

<TE>   Many Young Men With Chlamydia Lack Symptoms</TE>
<TE>   The first national survey of the prevalence of chlamydia in young
men has found that 3.1% to 4.5% of teenage and young adult males are
infected with the sexually transmitted disease.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 2,000 men, ages 18 to 26, participated in the National
Surveys of Adolescent Males. Researchers then interviewed about 1,500
respondents and took urine samples for testing. The study was done by
the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and Research Triangle
Institute in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   The tests for chlamydia done as part of this study detected
infections in 3.1% of the teenagers and 4.5% of the young adults.
Only one-fourth of the teenagers and one-third of the young adults
with symptoms, such as burning upon urination or having a discharge
from the penis, had been tested in the past year. And many of those
who tested positive as a result of the study hadn't had symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   "Chlamydia is often a silent disease, and that's what makes it so
tough to deal with," says Leighton Ku, who was at the Urban Institute
when the study was done. "The majority of young men aren't aware of
it and so they never seek medical treatment. That's why screening is
so important."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike young women who tend to have routine gynecologic care,
"lots of young guys go for years without seeing a doctor," says Ku.
The CDC recommends annual chlamydia screening for sexually active
women 24 years old and younger. There is no similar recommendation
for young men. According to the CDC, untreated chlamydia in men
causes urethral infection and can lead to complications such as
swollen and tender testicles. In women it can cause pelvic
inflammatory disease, which can lead to infertility and tubal
pregnancy, among other consequences.</TE>

<TE>   Injury Affecting Women Cyclists Is Identified</TE>
<TE>   Women can now add "bicyclist's vulva" to the growing list of
sports side effects such as saddle sores and cyclist's nipples.</TE>
<TE>   In Belgium, where the women's cycling event La Grande Boucle
Feminine Internationale begins Aug. 12, this sports injury has been
identified in competitive women cyclists. "Bicyclist's vulva," a
chronic swelling on one side of a woman's genitals, isn't painful and
doesn't seem to interfere with other activities, but the enlarged
vulva is so embarrassing that the few women diagnosed with the
bulging had not seen a doctor about it specifically.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the reason for the swelling is chronic inflammation of
the perineum and the curved position the cyclist maintains," says Dr.
Luc Baeyens, head of sports gynecology at Brugmann University
Hospital in Brussels.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure from the bicycle seat doesn't appear to be a factor.
Rather, the curved position taken when biking long distances
compresses the lymph vessels in the groin, compromising circulation
in the area, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Although the problem may never resolve completely, it might be
relieved or prevented by elevating the legs during rest periods to
assist lymph drainage of the perineum and pelvis. Swelling may be
reduced by applying cold compresses to the area after training and by
massage, or manual drainage, to push the lymph fluid into
alternative, undamaged pathways. Preventing inflammation and taking
care of any irritation in the genital region are important too.</TE>
<TE>   Competitive cyclists put in far more miles than the weekend
athlete, but so can "spinners." Kimberly Fowler, a spinning teacher
and owner of YAS (Yoga and Spinning) in Venice, says the average
spinner clocks about 30 miles in a class. A person who combines
long-distance biking on the weekends with three or four classes a
week, which is not unusual, says Fowler, could bike 300 miles a week.</TE>

<HD>If You Must Have a Doughnut, Keep It Simple</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to doughnuts, we are a nation of Homer Simpsons. No
matter how often the fried rolls are declared nutritionally bankrupt,
their sweet, oily fragrance is overwhelming. Americans eat about 10
billion doughnuts each year, or about 40 for every man, woman and
child in the country, according to industry estimates.</LD>
<LD>   The fried snacks are most likely descended from the Dutch
olie-kochen, or fried cakes, which arrived on these shores with Dutch
settlers in the 1640s. A sea captain from Rockport, Maine, named
Hanson Gregory claims credit for punching the first holes in the
cakes, in 1847, to get rid of the doughy middle. By the 1920s the
first doughnut-making machines had turned a kitchen craft into a
growing industry.</LD>
<LD>   No one mistakes a doughnut for health food. The combination of
flour, sugar and fat contains very little fiber, so its 200 to 300
calories are absorbed quickly, said Randi Konikoff, a dietitian at
Tufts University Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy in
Boston.</LD>
<TE>   The body converts the simple carbohydrates in doughnuts to sugar,
which prompts the release of insulin; insulin in turn converts excess
sugar to body fat. And all that's on top of the large dose of dietary
fat in the snacks themselves.</TE>
<TE>   At their best, doughnuts are light pastries rather than heavy gut
bombs. Dipped briefly in hot oil, the sculpted dough develops a
delicate crispy skin. The moisture trapped within turns to steam,
cooking the dough inside, said Ralph Primo, who with wife Celia
founded Primo's doughnuts in West Los Angeles, in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   In a well-made doughnut, the oil does not penetrate far into the
pastry, he said. When sprayed with a film of liquefied sugar, a
simple ring of yeast-raised dough becomes one of the most popular
breakfast foods in the nation: the simple glazed doughnut.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there are dozens of varieties, and each carries a
different package of calories and fat. Besides the simple glazed,
top-sellers include the chocolate-frosted cake doughnut, the
jelly-filled and the old-fashioned.</TE>
<TE>   At Dunkin' Donuts, the heaviest of these is the chocolate-frosted
cake, which has 16 grams of fat and 300 calories, according to the
company.</TE>
<TE>   At Krispy Kreme, the glazed devil's food old-fashioned leads with
24 grams of fat and 390 calories, while the chocolate frosted cake
comes in at 13 grams and 270 calories.</TE>
<TE>   A jelly-filled falls somewhere in the middle, from 8 grams of fat
and 210 calories (Dunkin' Donuts) to 14 grams and 290 calories
(Krispy Kreme). Any one of these doughnuts provides roughly 20% of
USDA's recommended allowance for fat, and 15% of the day's allowance
for calories.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent analysis, Tufts University researchers found that many
blueberry muffins--including so-called low-fat varieties--had more
fat and calories than a glazed doughnut. Even eating three of the
little, fried doughnut holes can put you over the fat and calorie
count for a full-sized glazed, because of the amount of fried surface
area, Konikoff said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people have no idea," she said. "They think three of those
little things only equals about a half a doughnut."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the lightest selection often is the most popular: the
simple glazed, or raised, doughnut, which has about 200 calories and
8 to 11 grams of fat.</TE>

<HD>A Growing Transportation Gap</HD>
<DH>Study* As Americans live longer, the number of years they
are able to drive is shrinking--and causing a problem that needs to
be addressed by society.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of thousands of Americans are outliving their ability to
drive, a new study has found, leaving them dependent on others to
provide rides for several years.</LD>
<LD>   "Hundreds of thousands of older people quit driving each year and
must turn to alternative transportation," said Dan Foley, a
biostatistician at the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda, Md.,
and lead author of the study. "I don't think sufficient attention has
been paid to the transition from driver to non-driver in the aging
population."</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 10% of the nation's drivers today are older than 65. The
aging of the baby boomers and an increase in the number of female
drivers is expected to yield a growing population of older Americans
living longer than they hold a driver's license.</LD>
<TE>   Giving Up the Privilege</TE>
<TE>   Foley and his colleagues found that the largest number of older
drivers giving up the privilege did so around age 85, which suggests
that the "oldest old" may be most in need of transportation help.
Current projections are that the nation's 85-and-older population
could exceed 10 million by 2030. Although, by that time, some aging
experts point out, those who reach 85 may be as healthy and mobile as
today's 65-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Arun Karlamangla, a UCLA geriatrician, said it's often
difficult for non-driving seniors to arrange transportation to
appointments. Many of his patients arrange low-cost rides to their
medical appointments through Access Services, but often wait a couple
of hours for the ride back home, he said. Others rely on relatives,
or pay for assistance. "This is going to become an issue, more among
the people who are less well off," Karlamangla said. "We haven't
thought about this as a society."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Richard Marottoli, director of the geriatrics and extended
care section of VA Connecticut Healthcare System in West Haven, said
comprehensive approaches are needed. That means, for example, that
when the Department of Motor Vehicles takes away a senior citizen's
license, social services agencies should address the transportation
gap left behind.</TE>
<TE>   In the new study, the researchers analyzed data gathered in 1993
and 1995 about a sample of Americans age 70 and older, along with
follow-up data on 4,996 male and female drivers with access to a car.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, 82% of men and 55% of women in that age group were
driving. Two years later, 7% of the drivers had died and 9% had
stopped driving. Extrapolating from those numbers, it appears that
more than 600,000 people age 70 and older stop driving each year
because of poor vision, memory impairment or the inability to get
around anymore. About 400,000 older drivers die annually.</TE>
<TE>   In their study, researchers found that the rate of those who
continued to drive fell from 88% of men in their early 70s to 55% of
those 85 and older.</TE>
<TE>   Among women, about 70% were driving in their early 70s, but only
22% continued to do so at 85 and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Dependent on Others</TE>
<TE>   Foley's work found that the so-called driving expectancy for an
older adult fell short of overall life expectancy. Men and women able
to drive at ages 70 to 74 were expected to keep on driving 11 more
years; but the men statistically were expected to live an additional
17 years, and the women 21 years.</TE>
<TE>   That means men became dependent on other drivers for an average of
six years, and women an average of 10 years. The study appeared in
the August issue of the American Journal of Public Health.</TE>

<LD>Question: Some of my friends don't seem to know that beverages might
interact with medications, and when I watch them take pills with a
sip of coffee, grapefruit juice or milk, I cringe. Could you give us
some updated information?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Avoiding food and drug interactions is more complicated
than many people realize. A woman who takes her antibiotic
(tetracycline, Cipro or Noroxin) with milk or calcium-fortified
orange juice might not get over a urinary-tract infection or
bronchitis, for example, because calcium interferes with absorption
of the medicine. Cipro can also boost the caffeine effect.</LD>
<LD>   Grapefruit juice can interact with dozens of medications. Foods
that might affect certain medicines include cheddar cheese, broccoli,
avocado, oat bran, cabbage, licorice and watercress. When in doubt,
swallow pills with a water.</LD>
<TE>   Q: I understand that eating licorice lowers testosterone levels in
men. Will it have the same impact on testosterone levels in women?
Could this hormonal effect be a solution to eliminating unwanted
facial hair in women?</TE>
<TE>   A: An Italian study published in the New England Journal of
Medicine (Oct. 7, 1999) suggests that men who eat licorice have lower
circulating testosterone levels. Although this herb might also lower
testosterone levels in women, the risks might be too great.</TE>
<TE>   Licorice has a number of potential side effects, including high
blood pressure, fatigue, mineral imbalance and loss of libido.</TE>
<TE>   There are better options for controlling facial hair in women, but
they require a doctor's prescription. The diuretic spironolactone has
long been used for this purpose. Vaniqa cream is also effective.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I keep reading that tea might have benefits over coffee because
of its antioxidants. I prefer decaffeinated tea. Does decaffeinated
tea retain its antioxidant potency?</TE>
<TE>   A: Recent studies demonstrate that tea drinkers are less likely to
suffer a heart attack and less likely to die if they do have a heart
attack. Researchers speculate that antioxidants in tea are
responsible.</TE>
<TE>   Both green and black tea contain caffeine, although the dose per
cup is substantially lower than that in coffee. Decaffeination does
seem to remove many beneficial antioxidant compounds.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Americans needed a reminder not to take food safety for granted,
they've gotten it. A massive recall last month of 19 million pounds
of ground beef--the second-largest recall in U.S. history--was
followed last week by a recall of romaine lettuce.</LD>
<LD>   Both were due to E. coli contamination. At least 28 people in five
states became ill after eating the contaminated beef; at least 29
reportedly became ill in Washington state from the lettuce.</LD>
<LD>   These two incidents came on the heels of a recall of
salmonella-tainted cantaloupes in May and of public warnings the
previous month about an illegally produced soft cheese that was also
found to be contaminated with salmonella. The cantaloupes were blamed
for about three dozen cases of illness in the U.S. and Canada; the
cheese was linked to 50 cases of food poisoning.</LD>
<TE>   But health and food safety experts say these illnesses and recalls
don't mean our food supply is more riddled with problems than in
years past. Rather, they say, these events are a wake-up call to
people who let their guard down when preparing and eating food.</TE>
<TE>   "These incidents show there are significant gaps" in our safety
net, says Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of the food safety program
for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington,
D.C., consumer watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, while sanitary conditions in the U.S. have
improved, no system is foolproof.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we have harmful microorganisms being carried by
animals, and food handlers who may be infected by various pathogens
and don't wash their hands, we're going to see food-borne illnesses,"
says Michael Doyle, director of the Center for Food Safety and
Quality Enhancement at the University of Georgia in Griffin.</TE>
<TE>   The consequences can be devastating. Although most of the
estimated 76 million Americans stricken with food-borne illnesses
each year experience relatively mild symptoms, 325,000 of them are
sick enough to be hospitalized, and 5,000 people die each year from
unsafe food, according to government figures. Otherwise healthy
people may develop a mild case of diarrhea or nausea from tainted
food, but for pregnant women, the frail elderly, young children and
people with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or AIDS, food-borne
illnesses can cause kidney failure, paralysis, miscarriage and death.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more common food-borne pathogens are bacteria such as
salmonella, campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio and E. coli
0157:H7.</TE>
<TE>   There are a host of ways these microbes find their way to the
nation's dinner tables: Produce may be watered or washed with
feces-contaminated water, some animal carcasses are inadvertently
infected with microbes during processing, seafood may swim in
sewage-infested waters, or food may be improperly handled.</TE>
<TE>   In one recent incident in Georgia, several hundred people
developed flu-like symptoms after eating commercially prepared cakes
decorated by a woman with long artificial nails who had neglected to
wash her hands properly. (The microbes had become trapped underneath
her nails.) Germs hiding in ventilation ducts during renovations at a
hot dog manufacturing plant were responsible for an outbreak of
Listeria in 1998-99, in which 21 people died.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the tainted ground beef, experts believe the meat
was infected with E. coli 0157:H7 bacteria from manure-contaminated
water. Federal and state officials are investigating the source of
the recent lettuce contamination.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors normally do random spot
checks for the presence of E. coli bacteria at meat processing
plants, and rely on companies to do their own regular testing. "But
you can never take enough samples to have an absolute guarantee
unless you check the entire lot, which isn't economically feasible,"
said Peter J. Slade of the National Center for Food Safety and
Technology, which is part of the Illinois Institute of Technology in
Summit-Argo, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Still, this incident prompted calls from consumer activists to
tighten up plant inspection systems. "Tests of E. coli should be done
routinely by the USDA, not just randomly," says Patty Lovera, deputy
director of the energy and environment program at Public Citizen, a
watchdog group in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, consumers need to watch out for known hazards by
staying abreast of government alerts, as well as taking precautions
in the kitchen to protect themselves from food-borne bugs. Cooking
meats and shellfish to 160 degrees Fahrenheit kills bacteria such as
salmonella and E. coli. Eggs, which can be a breeding ground for
salmonella, should also be cooked thoroughly, as should anything
containing eggs, like French toast.</TE>
<TE>   Once meat is cooked, serve it on a clean plate. Don't reuse plates
that have been used for raw meats or poultry because the juices may
be teeming with germs. Wash your hands, too, for the same reason, and
wipe kitchen counters with clean cloths. Avoid cross-contamination of
foods--keep meat and produce separate. And be sure to keep foods
refrigerated; letting them sit on the table for longer than an hour
is inviting trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Fruits and vegetables should be cleaned thoroughly under running
water. "Running water is better than soaking because it can dislodge
surface bacteria," says DeWaal. "But even the best washing is no
guarantee that you won't have a problem."</TE>

<LD>Even as Americans have been bombarded with pep talks to get them off
the couch and into an exercise routine, health clubs have expanded
their repertoire beyond weight machines and treadmills. Both efforts
seem to be paying off.</LD>
<LD>   A record 13.9 million club members logged at least 100 or more
days at gyms and health clubs last year, up from 9.4 million in 1987,
according to the annual Health Club Trend report.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, members of fitness facilities worked out an average of 93
days last year--a record high, according to the report sponsored by
the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Assn., which
represents more than 6,500 clubs worldwide. In 1987, the first year
of the survey, members were averaging 72 days per year.</LD>
<TE>   The number of club members has nearly doubled, growing steadily
from 17.3 million in 1987 to 33.8 million in 2001, said Bill Howland,
an association spokesman. The Boston-based association attributes the
devoted attendance to many factors, including a more health-conscious
population. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and other government agencies, for instance, have urged everyone to
exercise and keep their weight under control.</TE>
<TE>   Many people in their 50s and older are joining gyms for the first
time because they have concerns about their overall health as well as
their ability to perform daily activities. "They get physically fit
to remain physically active," Howland said.</TE>
<TE>   Also contributing to more avid gym-going is an increase in the
number of clubs, which has made it more convenient to find one close
to home. And choices have expanded from "hard-core, iron-pumping
clubs" to clubs catering to women and to followers of particular
disciplines such as yoga.</TE>
<TE>   Personal training sessions and classes in yoga and strength
training are among the offerings that have attracted patrons to
fitness facilities, according to a survey from San Diego-based IDEA
Health and Fitness Assn., which represents health and fitness
professionals.</TE>
<TE>   IDEA surveyed U.S. fitness facility owners, managers and program
directors about programs offered by health clubs and personal
training studios; fitness centers run by corporations, hospitals and
universities; YMCAs; and park and recreational departments. About 250
responded.</TE>
<TE>   In 2002, the survey found 87% of the facilities offered personal
training, compared with 66% in 1996. And 87% offered group strength
training, compared with 75% in 1997. At the same time, 85% offer yoga
classes, a huge boost since 1996, when just 31% of facilities had
yoga programs.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the percentage of clubs offering low-impact
aerobics fell from 80% in 1996 to 79% last year; those offering
abdominal classes fell from 76% in 1997 to 72% last year.</TE>
<TE>   Yoga classes and other mind-body disciplines such as Pilates have
become even more popular since Sept. 11, said David Gilroy, an IDEA
spokesman. "People are finding refuge in their fitness facilities."</TE>

<HD>'Natural' Is No Guarantee</HD>
<DH>Drugs* Although more doctors are prescribing hormones
derived from plants, no one knows if they are any safer than the
traditional type.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like most other middle-aged women, Nancy Smith heard the news last
month that a commonly prescribed hormone replacement regimen could
increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and breast cancer.</LD>
<LD>   But the Agoura Hills woman, 49, wasn't sure what the Women's
Health Initiative study, which tested a synthetic estrogen-progestin
pill called Prempro, meant for her personally. After all, she doesn't
take Prempro.</LD>
<LD>   "This study was on the one-drug combination," says Smith, a
veterinarian. "What about everything else women take?"</LD>
<TE>   Smith is among a growing group of women who take so-called natural
estrogen and progesterone, which come from plant sources and are
chemically identical to the hormones women make. "Natural" refers to
the substance's chemical composition, not its source.</TE>
<TE>   Natural hormones have long been touted by alternative health
practitioners and some Internet-based pharmacies to be safer and
easier to tolerate than hormones made by drug companies and sold
under names like Premarin and Prempro. More mainstream doctors are
also recommending natural hormones, which are typically dispensed
through compounding pharmacies. These pharmacies blend and package
hormones in specific formulations ordered by doctors for individual
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Even some drug companies have developed brand-name products touted
as natural because they contain one type of estrogen identical to
what women's bodies naturally produce.</TE>
<TE>   And, in light of the recent findings, other doctors and women are
wondering if natural hormones are a safer alternative.</TE>
<TE>   The answer is that no one knows.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, we know less about those products than we do about
the ones in the trial," says Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor, a women's
health researcher at UC San Diego. "There is no safety data. There is
no efficacy data. They might be preferable. They might be worse."</TE>
<TE>   Divergent Effects</TE>
<TE>   There are clearly differences, however, in the way various hormone
products are made, raising questions about whether they might have
divergent effects in women.</TE>
<TE>   The estrogen in Prempro and Premarin is derived from the urine of
pregnant mares and contains equine estrogens and estrone, a form of
estrogen natural in women.</TE>
<TE>   Many women taking hormone therapy also take a progestin, a
chemical that is synthesized to mimic a woman's progesterone, because
taking estrogen alone increases the risk of developing uterine
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Natural estrogen and progesterone, in contrast, are made from
plants, such as wild yams and soy, and are chemically identical to
the hormones produced in women's bodies. The natural
estrogens--estradiol, estrone and estriol--are available in
compounded formulations called triple natural estrogen (TriEst) or
dual natural estrogen (BiEst). Natural progesterone is also available
in a compounded formulation.</TE>
<TE>   Some drug companies also make so-called natural estrogen products,
such as Estrace, a pill, and Estraderm, a skin patch. But those
products contain only estradiol.</TE>
<TE>   Both traditional and natural estrogens mimic what a woman's body
makes and begins to lose during menopause. And some people say the
natural hormones do a better job of that--not only because of their
chemical structure but because the doses are typically lower.</TE>
<TE>   "Most side effects from hormone therapy are related to doses. And
the doses [made by drug companies] are just plain too strong for most
women," says Dr. Jay S. Cohen, a San Diego doctor and author of the
book "Over Dose: The Case Against the Drug Companies."</TE>
<TE>   Compounding pharmacies can also package natural hormones as pills,
creams, gels, suppositories or drops--which may improve how women
absorb and metabolize them.</TE>
<TE>   Difference in Delivery</TE>
<TE>   There may be some theoretical basis for believing that the way
hormones are taken can make a difference, says Dr. Richard King, a
menopause expert in Gainesville, Fla. King says he prefers to
prescribe an estrogen patch, so that the hormone bypasses the liver
and goes directly into the bloodstream--possibly making it safer.</TE>
<TE>   He also prescribes a natural progesterone called micronized
progesterone that is made from yams. Micronized means the hormone is
finely ground and is more easily absorbed by the body. Micronized
progesterone synthesized from yams can also be ordered by
prescription from compounding pharmacies and is available in a
brand-name product called Prometrium.</TE>
<TE>   But to think that natural hormones are a "safe" alternative to the
hormones used in the Women's Health Initiative study is too
simplistic, many experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hearing that ... 'If you only get the product right,
hormone therapy will work beautifully,' " says Dr. Maida Taylor, an
associate clinical professor at UC San Francisco who has studied the
issue. "But that is extremely unlikely. There is no reason to believe
these will be safer."</TE>
<TE>   Compounded natural hormones may take longer to resolve menopausal
symptoms, experts say. And compounded hormones, if not carefully
constructed, can vary from batch to batch in their potency.</TE>
<TE>   Women who switch from the traditional hormones to natural hormones
should not be told that they are receiving a much different product,
Taylor adds. "It's very easy to make claims that something is better.
But it's very hard to do quality research," she says.</TE>
<TE>   It's unlikely studies will be done to shed light on how different
doses and formulations of estrogen and progesterone act. Since
natural hormones cannot be patented--and accordingly, drug companies
can't make huge profits from them--there is little incentive for
anyone to test them.</TE>

<HD>Maker of Norplant Decides to Take Product Off Market</HD>
<DH>Contraception* The implanted birth-control device,
currently used by 113,000 women in the U.S., is highly effective but
was often plagued by controversy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The company that supplied the once-popular but perpetually troubled
Norplant contraceptive device has quietly decided to withdraw the
product from the U.S. market.</LD>
<LD>   Wyeth Pharmaceuticals had temporarily suspended U.S. distribution
of the implantable contraceptive two years ago after health experts
raised concerns that the device might be less effective than believed
at preventing pregnancy. At the time, Wyeth advised women who used
Norplant to use a supplementary form of non-hormonal contraceptive.</LD>
<LD>   When subsequent studies found that those concerns were unfounded,
the Food and Drug Administration in late July issued an advisory
saying that backup contraception was not needed. Ironically, Wyeth
also announced in late July that it was permanently withdrawing
Norplant from the market, citing business reasons.</LD>
<TE>   "We think it's a shame Norplant won't be available to women in the
United States any more," said Melissa May, a spokeswoman for the
Population Council, a nonprofit organization that developed Norplant.
"We think it's a real loss."</TE>
<TE>   When Norplant was introduced in 1990, the implantable
contraceptive was heralded as a significant option for American
women, the first new method of birth control in 20 years. It features
six matchstick-size silicone rods that release the hormone
levonorgestrel. It is more than 99% effective.</TE>
<TE>   But the device was swept up in controversy from the start.</TE>
<TE>   Some women complained about side effects such as menstrual
irregularities, headaches and nausea. Others said they were scarred
when doctors botched the insertion or removal of the rods. And
hundreds of lawsuits alleging problems with Norplant were filed on
behalf of women who claimed they had not been adequately informed of
the contraceptive's risks.</TE>
<TE>   Some family planning specialists worry that Norplant's
unceremonious end could spell trouble for a second generation of
implantable hormonal contraceptives expected to hit the U.S. market
sometime next year.</TE>
<TE>   Norplant, which is sold in nearly 60 countries, was used by more
than 1 million Americans at its peak. Wyeth says that 113,000 U.S.
women still use the product.</TE>
<TE>   "Women are still calling us all the time about it," said Dr.
Felicia Stewart, a reproductive health expert at UC San Francisco.
"There certainly are women who really liked it."</TE>
<TE>   Although contraceptive choices have expanded in the last two
years--with a vaginal ring, hormonal patch and monthly hormonal shot
now available--there are still few choices for long-lasting,
reversible contraception, Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   "The only other methods that come close to this are surgical
sterilization and IUDs," she said. "And there are consequences and
risks to both of those."</TE>
<TE>   The FDA has advised women using Norplant to see their doctors and
consider other contraceptive options. Women who still have Norplant
can have it removed; Wyeth will pay the cost of the removal if the
procedure is completed by the end of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Wyeth has established a Norplant System Information Line at (800)
364-9809.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts hope that women may soon have the option of using a
new generation of implants, including a two-rod version of Norplant,
approved by the FDA in 1996 but not yet marketed in this country.
That product, Jadelle, is used in dozens of countries.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie de Vane, a Wyeth spokeswoman, said the company is
considering whether to introduce Jadelle in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Organon International, a Netherlands-based pharmaceutical firm,
expects to seek U.S. approval to market its implant, Implanon, later
this year, said spokeswoman Frances DeSena. Implanon is a single rod
that contains desogestrel, a hormone different from that used in
Norplant that could have fewer side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Implanon will also come with a special instrument to ease
insertion and is designed to last three years, perhaps appealing to
women who seek reversible contraception between pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   Whether those products reach U.S. women may, in part, rely on
their disassociation from Norplant, experts say. "We need to create
an identity for each of these new products that is different from
Norplant," says Dr. Paul Blumenthal, a medical advisor to Planned
Parenthood and researcher at Johns Hopkins University. "It's highly
likely they will be a lot easier to insert and remove than the
six-rod system. And, according to the data, they will be equally
effective."</TE>

<LD>Question: I read your article "If the Athletic Shoe Doesn't Fit Well,
Don't Wear It," and I have two more questions. How many miles can you
use an athletic shoe? And can you play tennis with running shoes and
vice versa?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: To answer your first question: Place your old shoes on a
table and look at them from the back. If they lean in or out or show
signs of excessive wear (such as badly worn edges on the sole), it's
probably time for a new pair. Even if they seem to be in good shape,
it's time for a change if you've logged 500 miles in them or if
you're experiencing pain in your feet, ankles, legs or knees though
you haven't changed your exercise routine.</LD>
<LD>   Now for the second question: Running shoes are primarily made to
absorb shock as the heel strikes the ground. Tennis shoes, in
contrast, provide more side-to-side stability. So although it's an
expense, different uses mean different shoes. One rule of thumb: If
you participate in a sport more than three times a week, you should
consider buying sport-specific shoes.</LD>
<TE>   For more information, take a look at Runners World magazine
(www.runnersworld.com) and Tennis Magazine (www.tennis.com).</TE>

<LD>Background: The center is a nonprofit group committed to helping
older people and adults with disabilities get good health care. Its
Web site is meant to be an all-purpose guide through the politics,
jargon and puzzles of the federal Medicare program.</LD>
<LD>   What works: In recent weeks Congress has defeated proposals to add
a drug benefit to Medicare, but the site has extensive links to
alternative sources of aid for seniors who need drugs. It lists not
only special programs with eligibility requirements, but discount
drug cards, mail-order pharmacies, and low-cost Internet services. A
feature called Medicare Answers provides lucid explanations of how to
choose and use a Medicare plan, and how to appeal coverage decisions
you feel aren't justified. This site is not a particularly good
source of news: The current debate over a drug benefit is not well
covered, for instance. But it's a good place to learn what you can
expect from Medicare--and what to do if the program doesn't provide
it.</LD>

<LD>People 65 and older often stop taking their statin heart medications
far too soon, setting themselves up for potentially fatal
cardiovascular problems, researchers reported in two studies released
recently.</LD>
<LD>   Statins include some of the best-known medications, such as
Lipitor, Mevacor, Pravachol and Zocor. The drugs lower cholesterol
and protect the heart after an attack.</LD>
<LD>   But these patients aren't taking their medications over the long
haul. Prescriptions are written, said researchers in the Journal of
the American Medical Assn., but patients do not always refill them.
For many older people, doctors say, statins should be taken for life.
Stopping the medications, studies have shown, can trigger a rebound
effect, causing some problems to return in more severe forms.</LD>
<TE>   The telltale issue of noncompliance comes from a study of more
than 34,000 New Jersey heart patients. Scientists at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston, led by researcher Joshua Benner, used the
databanks of New Jersey Medicaid and the Pharmaceutical Assistance to
the Aged Programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at the percent of days they had the drugs available,"
Benner said of having a filled statin prescription in the house.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time a patient went to a pharmacy," Benner said of getting
a refill, "they received credit for that many days of medication. So
we assumed they took the medication they received." Mathematically,
Benner, who is now director of health economics with Epinomics
Research Inc., in Alexandria, Va., developed a measure called the
PDC, shorthand for "proportion of days covered," or how many days'
worth of medication patients had on hand.</TE>
<TE>   Compliance declined by 25% in the first six months of therapy. By
the fifth year of treatment only one in four patients had a PDC of
80%. The abysmal lack of compliance was not the result of doctors'
having failed to write the prescriptions, Benner said, because
researchers tracked how many prescriptions patients got.</TE>
<TE>   He doubts the compliance problem is related to side effects,
because problems with statins are mild. A second study in the
journal, by Cynthia Jackevecius and colleagues in Canada, showed a
similar statin compliance problem. Her study included patients who
had heart attacks in the previous year, along with those suffering
chronic heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   The drugs work by slowing the liver's production of cholesterol
and by increasing the organ's ability to remove LDL, the so-called
bad form of cholesterol, from the blood. The drugs are best taken
during the evening, because the body makes more cholesterol at night
than during the day.</TE>

<HD>Feel Full on Fewer Calories: Pick the Right Foods</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Experts tell us there is no mystery to losing weight. We simply need
to eat less and exercise more--and the food we do consume should be
styled on the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet recommended by health
groups such as the American Heart Assn.</LD>
<LD>   Yet this recipe is clearly not working. Perhaps that's because
people are not following it. Or perhaps it's because such a diet
inadvertently has encouraged the consumption of highly refined,
starchy and sugary carbohydrates that research is beginning to
indicate do not quell hunger.</LD>
<LD>   While we eat for pleasure, taste and social reasons, hunger
remains a crucial factor, because the more satisfied we feel, the
less likely we are to go on eating simply because a food looks and
tastes nice.</LD>
<TE>   For this reason, scientists are now considering the effects foods
have on "feelings of fullness." Foods with high levels of protein,
such as fish, chicken, meat, lentils and eggs, plus fruits and
vegetables, have been found to have the highest satiating effect.</TE>
<TE>   High-fat, starchy baked goods such as croissants, cakes and
biscuits, have been shown to give the lowest feeling of fullness per
calorie, while carbohydrate-filled foods such as pasta and
whole-grain versions of bread and cereals are more satiating than
highly refined foods (though still less satiating than high-protein
foods).</TE>
<TE>   Canadian researchers at Laval University in Quebec, Canada,
recently reinforced the importance of a food's satiety on total
calorie intakes in a study published last year in the British Journal
of Nutrition.</TE>
<TE>   When obese subjects were asked to eat as much as they liked of a
typical American Heart Assn.-style diet, they ate an average of 3,440
calories a day.</TE>
<TE>   When allowed to eat as much as they liked of higher protein foods
and carbohydrates such as pasta and rye bread, which have a low
glycemic index and release sugar into the blood very slowly, they ate
an average of 2,593 calories a day.</TE>
<TE>   For a sedentary 280-pound man, for example, this difference of 847
calories a day would lead to a loss of about 2 pounds in just nine
days.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Caesar Barber, a 56-year-old maintenance man from New
York, launched the first lawsuit against fast-food firms, blaming
them for his obesity-linked health problems.</TE>
<TE>   While the courts have yet to decide on his case, there is no doubt
that such companies are the purveyors of fat and thus calorie-laden,
low-protein, high-glycemic index carbohydrate foods with an
implicitly low satiating value.</TE>
<TE>   For this reason it is perhaps not surprising that we find them so
easy to over-consume. But we can't wait for the fast-food giants to
reformulate their most popular recipes, serving food that is a lean
source of protein, is accompanied by vegetables and served with low
glycemic carbohydrate and fruit.</TE>
<TE>   So if you want to start making changes, look at the satiating
value of your meals and snacks. With hunger tamed, you may be
pleasantly surprised how fattening fast foods will begin to lose
their appeal and how you in turn may begin to slowly and gently lose
weight.</TE>

<HD>Loan Pledges Initially Pay Off in Poor Areas</HD>
<DH>Banking: Programs sought by activists spark surges in
lending. But levels typically fall by the third year, a study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bank pledges to provide more home loans in minority and lower-income
areas are followed by a surge in lending, but the financial flood
typically dries up after two years, according to a new study by a USC
economist.</LD>
<LD>   The study by Raphael Bostic, a former Federal Reserve Board senior
advisor who heads a USC real-estate economic forecast, is to be
released today. It contains mixed news for backers of these lending
deals, which community groups often negotiate when banks are seeking
regulatory approval for mergers--a process once compared to
"extortion" by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), then head of the Senate
Banking Committee.</LD>
<LD>   Data for the 23 years studied by Bostic showed that mortgage
lending jumped an average of 14% in targeted areas after the
agreements took effect. But the fact that lending fell back to its
original levels by the third year suggests the agreements may
typically help only the "cream of the crop"--the top tier of
potential borrowers in low- and moderate-income areas, said Josh
Silver, vice president of the National Community Reinvestment
Coalition, whose organization represents community groups across the
country.</LD>
<TE>   But even if the banks' Community Reinvestment Act programs
sometimes fizzle out, Silver said the new study reaffirms his belief
that there's a need for the programs and that they work. He cited
studies by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board
showing CRA lending is generally profitable for banks and brings new
capital to distressed neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Bank commitments to increase lending in lower-income areas are the
offspring of federal fair-housing and equal-credit laws and of the
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires regulators to
scrutinize banks and thrifts to ensure they are serving poorer
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The release of CRA data and the possible denial or delay of
mergers over CRA issues have been important in spurring banks to
pledge billions of dollars that, Bostic said, serve as "insurance"
against the cost of violating fair-lending laws.</TE>
<TE>   Sophisticated community groups have used money wrung from banks
under CRA agreements to increase home purchases and small-business
start-ups among low-income groups, striking more than 300 lending
agreements nationwide with pledges totaling more than $1.5 trillion.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, large commitments to community lending have become an
expected part of pre-merger maneuvering for banks, with the conflicts
centering on the size and form of the agreements.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its current bid to acquire California Federal Bank
parent Golden State Bancorp, Citigroup Inc. pledged last month to
commit $120 billion in new loans and investments over 10 years to
minority and lower-income customers in California and Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   But community groups protested that Citigroup, as the nation's
largest financial institution, should provide more money and better
details on how it would be spent. The Fed has asked Citigroup to
respond to a long list of questions raised by New York's Inner City
Press and other community groups about practices at its sub-prime
lending businesses, which make higher-interest loans to borrowers
with spotty credit.</TE>
<TE>   In his study, Bostic used a database combining information from
the Fed and community groups to examine lending patterns in various
census tracts after the agreements took effect.</TE>
<TE>   "My [initial] thought was that it was basically grandstanding on
the part of the banks, and that the community groups would be too
small to enforce these things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that lending increased significantly, he said, "was a
good surprise." Among the benefits of the CRA agreements, he said,
was that the banks developed new loan products tailored for
low-income borrowers, such as mortgages with extremely low down
payments.</TE>
<TE>   The study didn't determine why mortgage lending dropped off after
two years, a question Bostic hopes to address in future research. He
said early findings indicate that some community groups fail to
monitor lender programs and that some banks regard CRA "insurance" as
needed only for short periods, such as during the course of a merger.</TE>
<TE>   James Ballentine, director of the Center for Community Development
at the American Bankers Assn., said Bostic's research shows that many
potential borrowers in lower-income areas are "credit-worthy at the
outset."</TE>
<TE>   Banks have benefited from making more loans and taking in more
deposits in these areas, Ballentine said, but banks have found that
many more residents of these neighborhoods need considerable
financial coaching, credit repair and debt reduction before they're
ready to take on home loans.</TE>
<TE>   The success of programs such as low down-payment loans has made it
tougher for some banks to meet their lending goals in competitive
markets such as California. Seeing that these loans can be
profitable, other banks rush in with similar products to siphon
business away, Ballentine said.</TE>
<TE>   CRA agreements are more prevalent and more complex in states such
as Illinois, New Jersey and New York, which have big urban
populations and well-established community groups. No agreements have
occurred in some rural states such as Kansas, Bostic said.</TE>
<TE>   In California, groups such as the Greenlining Coalition and the
California Reinvestment Committee worked out some of the biggest CRA
commitments amid major mergers involving institutions such as Wells
Fargo &amp; Co. and Washington Mutual Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Lending information collected under the federal Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act consistently has showed that minorities are turned
down for loans more often than whites. The latest data, released last
week, showed 36% of black applicants for conventional mortgages were
rejected in 2001, compared with 35% of Native American applicants,
23% of Latino applicants and 16% of white applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Maud Hurd, president of the Assn. of Community Organizations for
Reform Now, said it was "outrageous that ... African Americans are
still being turned down for home purchase loans twice as often as
whites." She said blacks, "who are starting from behind in the climb
to homeownership, are being pushed still further back."</TE>
<TE>   Bostic and others, however, cautioned that no conclusions can be
drawn about the extent to which racial bias may have been a factor in
the higher rejection rates, because the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
requires lenders to disclose information about race, gender and
income, but not such crucial variables as the debt burdens and credit
histories of loan applicants.</TE>
<TE>   "An individual's credit status is highly significant when you
measure whether somebody gets a loan or not," Ballentine said. He
suggested that banks and community groups need "to do better
outreach" to educate potential borrowers.</TE>
<TE>   Bostic's study didn't address many facets of CRA agreements, such
as small business loans, commitments to community development,
minority hiring and adding minority representatives to boards. Data
about those areas is far harder to come by than information about
individual home loans at the census-tract level, he said.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Probing Marketers of Dish Network</HD>
<DH>TV: City attorney is trying to identify source of phone
messages warning of Adelphia cable disruptions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Los Angeles is investigating the telemarketing practices
used to sell Dish Network satellite TV service to current customers
of troubled Adelphia Communications Corp., the city's second-largest
cable provider, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
June.</LD>
<LD>   City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo said his office is trying to determine
the company responsible for a telemarketing campaign that over the
last two weeks has warned many Adelphia customers, through recorded
messages at their homes, that the cable company's subscribers are
experiencing interruptions and blackouts as a result of its financial
troubles.</LD>
<LD>   The messages begin by pointing out that Adelphia has filed for
bankruptcy protection as a result of one of the worst accounting
scandals in corporate history. One message claims that "Adelphia
customers are already reporting service outages and blackouts. In an
effort to minimize the potential impact to California residents, we
are offering to replace their existing cable equipment at no cost
with digital satellite TV service and high-speed Internet access."</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia says it has received scores of calls from alarmed
customers who are confused by the messages and by the claims made by
live telemarketers answering the toll-free lines.</TE>
<TE>   According to Adelphia, one employee who called the toll-free
number was told by a sales affiliate named Ryan that his company
"made a deal with Adelphia to basically take over their customers."</TE>
<TE>   The phone mailbox that answers if the toll-free lines are busy
identifies the company as Satellite Solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Two telemarketers answering the toll-free numbers over the last
two weeks described Satellite Solutions as a promotional company
hired by Dish, which is owned by EchoStar Communications Corp., the
nation's second-largest satellite provider.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar spokesman Marc Lumpkin said the Littleton, Colo.-based
company does not conduct telemarketing campaigns and that retailers
of its Dish service nationwide are required to follow sales
solicitation guidelines that prohibit false claims or any other
violation of the law. He said the company has several retailers named
Satellite Solutions and is investigating the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Dish Network will take disciplinary action up to termination for
retailers who fail to comply" with the law, he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to a transcript provided to the city by Adelphia,
another message tells cable customers, "You will be experiencing
interruptions in your service due to an immediate stop of all
Adelphia services."</TE>
<TE>   The messages end with toll-free telephone numbers to call for
satellite service.</TE>
<TE>   "They are lying to our customers, using scare tactics that are
below the belt and probably illegal," said Bill Rosendahl, vice
president of political affairs for Adelphia. "In some cases, they are
misrepresenting themselves as part of an Adelphia transition team."</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar's plan to become the nation's only satellite service by
merging with DirecTV Inc., the industry leader, is being reviewed by
federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Since Adelphia's bankruptcy filing, both DirecTV and EchoStar have
launched campaigns targeting the cable operator's customers. The
campaigns offer special discounts to customers who switch from cable
to satellite.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar launched another special promotion late last week in
response to recent price increases by Adelphia and other cable
operators.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hyping that our prices are the lowest in the nation," said
Lumpkin, adding that cable rates have increased by 45% over the last
six years.</TE>
<TE>   Lumpkin said Adelphia had recently raised rates in West Palm
Beach, Fla., by 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo said he has asked Los Angeles County's Department of
Consumer Affairs to assist with the city's investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know who the telemarketers are," Delgadillo said. "But
we're looking into violations of the state's business and
professional codes that prohibit false claims in these sales pitches.
We've been unable to substantiate blackouts among Adelphia customers,
so this could be a serious misrepresentation."</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo said if violations were found, the perpetrator could be
fined $2,500 for each customer contacted. He cautioned, however, that
the investigation "may prove to be unfounded."</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia serves about 250,000 cable customers in the city and an
additional 1 million throughout Southern California. Customers in
areas including Huntington Beach, Redondo Beach, Santa Monica, Eagle
Rock, Van Nuys and Riverside received the special satellite offer,
according to anecdotal evidence collected by Adelphia and The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The city has been monitoring Adelphia closely since the bankruptcy
filing, worried about the upcoming renewal of the company's five
cable franchises. After the bankruptcy filing, Delgadillo put
Adelphia on notice, threatening to revoke the company's franchises if
service deteriorated or Adelphia failed to pay city franchise fees on
time.</TE>
<TE>   The company made its most recent $1.7-billion payment by the July
31 deadline. On Friday, when Adelphia's five franchise licenses
expired, the city granted a 45-day extension to give both parties
more time to hammer out a new agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia said this is not the first questionable assault on its
subscribers since its bankruptcy filing and the arrest of five former
executives about two weeks ago. "We've had this issue in other parts
of the country, but we weren't able to pinpoint the problem," said
Adelphia general counsel Randy Fisher. "I'm happy that the city of
Los Angeles is on the forefront, looking into practices that appear
to require a second look."</TE>
<TE>   One Adelphia customer who called the toll-free number said a sales
representative claimed she would lose her service "because
[Adelphia's] CEOs were just arrested today."</TE>
<TE>   Former Adelphia Chief Executive and founder John Rigas and four
other former company executives were arrested by federal authorities
July 24 on criminal charges related to personal loans of $3 billion
that were not disclosed to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The executives were ousted in May, and the company has since been
run by independent board members and led by one of them, Erland
Kailbourne, who has become interim chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Kailbourne has promised to maintain the level of service to the
company's 6 million customers nationwide during the bankruptcy
proceedings.</TE>

<HD>Office Relationship Prompts Ashland CEO to Retire</HD>
<DH>Workplace: Paul W. Chellgren violated company policy, a
spokesman says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COVINGTON, Ky.</DL>
<LD>The chairman and chief executive of chemical and motor oil seller
Ashland Inc. decided to retire because he violated a company policy
banning office relationships, a company spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Paul W. Chellgren, 59, announced Friday he would retire in
November after working 28 years for the company that makes Valvoline
motor oil, Zerex antifreeze and Eagle One car-care products.</LD>
<LD>   Company spokesman Stan Lampe later said that Chellgren violated a
policy stating that "a supervisor may not date or have a romantic
relationship with an employee who reports through his or her
management chain, even when the relationship is voluntary or
welcome."</LD>
<TE>   A telephone message left Sunday at Chellgren's home seeking
comment was not returned.</TE>
<TE>   The policy also states that such activity "will subject all
involved to disciplinary action, up to, and including discharge."</TE>
<TE>   Lampe said Chellgren was not forced out by the company's board of
directors and won't face any other penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a mutual decision between him and the board for him to
retire," Lampe said.</TE>
<TE>   Lampe would not reveal the identity or job title of the other
employee.</TE>
<TE>   Chellgren's wife of 31 years filed for divorce on July 12.</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Mary McManus Chellgren, 62, said in the divorce filing that
the marriage was "irretrievably broken" and all attempts at
reconciliation had failed. She did not list a specific cause for the
breakup, and her attorney, Suzanne Cassidy, declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Chellgren has been Ashland's chief executive since 1996 and was
named chairman in 1997. He also served as chief financial officer and
chief operating officer.</TE>

<HD>AtomFilms in Cable Deal With Comcast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an unusual leap from the Internet to television, AtomFilms is
expected to announce today that its collection of short films and
animations will be offered this fall through Comcast Cable
Communications Inc.'s video-on-demand service in Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   The deal is the first deployment to be announced for
AtomTelevision, a joint venture between AtomFilms--a subsidiary of
San Francisco-based AtomShockwave Corp.--and Global Media Holdings, a
New York-based creator of cable TV programming.</LD>
<LD>   Mika Salmi, chief executive of AtomShockwave, said AtomTelevision
hopes to have several more video-on-demand deployments this year and
to distribute a 24-hour digital cable TV channel next year. The
initial deal will be five one-hour packages of films and animations
that Comcast will offer free to subscribers who sign up for its
digital cable service.</LD>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, a slew of entertainment companies brought
original programming to the Web, hoping it could be a low-cost
proving ground for their characters and story lines.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was to build an audience online, then take the programs
to a more lucrative medium--television, for example, or feature
films.</TE>
<TE>   But when advertising rates plummeted and Internet stocks tanked,
many of these companies collapsed too. AtomFilms survived largely
because it merged with Shockwave, whose downloadable games have
proved to be a steady source of cash, Salmi said.</TE>
<TE>   AtomFilms has deals with about 10 distributors, including mobile
phone companies and Internet providers.</TE>
<TE>   Its films and animations have appeared sporadically on HBO,
Showtime and the Sci-Fi Channel, but the AtomTelevision initiative is
aiming for a more steady presence on cable TV.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be interesting to see what crosses over" from the
Internet onto TV, Salmi said. The company may try to rescue some of
the programs developed by defunct dot-coms, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of great stuff that people have made but never
really was seen."</TE>
<TE>   AtomTelevision is negotiating with several of the top cable
operators but hasn't won any distribution deals for its cable TV
channel.</TE>

<HD>Brazil's Net Dollar Outflows Hit 3-Year High</HD>
<DH>South America: Foreign banks have curbed lending because of
debt and political concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAO PAULO</DL>
<LD>Brazil's net dollar outflows rose to their highest level in more than
three years in June as foreign banks reduced lending to Brazilian
companies.</LD>
<LD>   Many foreign banks have stopped providing loans because of
concerns about the outcome of October presidential elections and
speculation that the government may default on some of its
$250-billion debt.</LD>
<LD>   Net dollar outflows from financial operations in June were $4.2
billion, compared with a previous record of $6.7 billion in January
1999 during the devaluation of the country's currency, the real,
according to central bank data.</LD>
<TE>   Financial operations include loans, debt service payments and the
repatriation of corporate profits.</TE>
<TE>   During the last four months, foreign banks have reduced credit
lines to Brazil to about $5.7 billion from $10.8 billion, analysts
say.</TE>
<TE>   The credit crunch has added pressure on the real, which has lost
about 24% of its value against the dollar this year and currently
trades at about 3.01 per dollar.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill arrived in Brazil,
beginning a four-day regional tour of South American countries
seeking more consistent U.S. support for plans to repair their ailing
economies.</TE>
<TE>   High on the agenda will be discussions about a fiscal bailout
package Brazilian officials want from the International Monetary Fund
in order to avoid a debt crisis and assuage jittery financial
markets.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill was criticized last week after he suggested that aid money
for the South American countries might be diverted to Swiss bank
accounts and reiterated his wariness about extending big rescue
packages to heavily indebted countries such as Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Investors, thinking O'Neill meant Brazil wouldn't obtain key U.S.
support needed for an IMF deal, dumped the country's currency and
bonds.</TE>

<HD>Some CEOs Make Certifying Financial Data a Joint Effort</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Some executives, seeking safety in numbers, are
asking division heads to co-sign filings with the SEC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDY MATHEWSON</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ga.</DL>
<LD>Daniel Amos has a strategy for when he signs a letter to the
Securities and Exchange Commission assuring his company's most recent
financial statements are accurate.</LD>
<LD>   The chief executive of Aflac Inc., the No. 1 U.S. supplemental
health insurance provider, is requiring each division head in his
accounting and legal departments--a total of eight people--to sign a
document similar to the one he must sign.</LD>
<LD>   "That means if one of us is wrong, all of us is wrong," Amos said.</LD>
<TE>   Columbus, Ga.-based Aflac is one of nearly 1,000 companies with
annual revenues of more than $1.2 billion whose CEOs and chief
financial officers must soon file personal attestations with the SEC
after accounting scandals at WorldCom Inc., Enron Corp. and other
companies. Amos, like executives at other companies, has been poring
over his company's finances in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   The filings are due starting Aug. 14, and failure to submit them
may bring civil or criminal penalties, lawyers said. A few companies
already have turned in the certifications to assure investors their
books are clean. They include General Electric Co., FedEx Corp.,
Corning Inc., PepsiCo Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and AMR Corp., the parent
of American Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   "Executives at some companies are spending a significant amount of
time, hundreds of hours, on this," said Dean Krogman, a vice
president at Financial Executives International Inc., an association
of corporate executives.</TE>
<TE>   Delphi Corp., the first filer, said top officers of the world's
largest auto parts maker always have studied filings before
submitting them to the SEC. Attesting to their accuracy required no
extra effort, spokesman Brad Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   CEO Paul Stebbins of World Fuel Services Corp. had to certify his
company's financial statements his first week on the job. The Miami
Springs, Fla., company sells fuel at airports and seaports worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it possible to know everything? No," Stebbins said. "But you
have to take that leap of faith, and if I am not prepared to do that,
then I don't deserve to run the company."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC has said it will scrutinize companies unable to certify
their reports. The implication is that such companies will be
referred to the SEC's enforcement division, said Paul Maco, a lawyer
at Vinson &amp; Elkins in Washington and a former SEC official.</TE>
<TE>   Maco said executives have three alternatives: submit the statement
using the precise language prescribed by the SEC, submit a sworn
explanation if they can't, or don't submit anything and suffer the
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're late, it could be a referral to enforcement to compel
you to comply with the rule," said Stephen Crimmins, a partner at
Pepper Hamilton and former deputy chief litigation counsel in the
SEC's enforcement division.</TE>
<TE>   Attesters must say that "to the best of my knowledge," the most
recent annual and quarterly reports and other statements have no
"untrue statement of material fact." They also must attest that the
company's audit committee or independent board members reviewed the
certification.</TE>
<TE>   "If you submit a false certification, you submit yourself to
personal, civil and criminal liability for lying to a government
agency," said SEC spokesman John Nester.</TE>
<TE>   Executives also may be liable for perjury, Crimmins and Maco said.
The new corporate-governance law signed by President Bush carries
other penalties: Any executive who attests to financial statements
that he or she knows to be wrong faces a fine of as much as $5
million and 20 years in prison, Crimmins said.</TE>
<TE>   Executives who deviate from the SEC's language or attempt to
qualify their certification in a separate letter will be viewed as
failing to comply, the SEC said. The SEC is posting the submissions
on its Web site in two categories: submissions that follow the SEC's
prescribed format and "all others."</TE>
<TE>   Christian Mixter, a former SEC chief litigation counsel, said the
"all others" category unfairly lumps companies with minor problems
with those that have significant accounting improprieties.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC expects that the fear of being listed with delinquents
will force disclosure of even minute accounting issues.</TE>
<TE>   "If that results in some companies offering investors greater
clarity, that is not an unanticipated consequence," Nester said.</TE>
<TE>   Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. accounting analyst Pat McConnell said
confusion about the Aug. 14 deadline may cause unnecessary investor
concern.</TE>
<TE>   That date is for companies whose second quarter ended June 30.
Companies whose quarter ends at another time--about 21% of the
947--have later deadlines, McConnell said.</TE>
<TE>   The second quarter for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., for example,
ended May 31. The company's attestation is due in October, 45 days
after the third quarter ends Aug. 31.</TE>
<TE>   People shouldn't conclude that a company not reporting by Aug. 14
has an accounting deficiency, she said, when, "in reality, there may
be no problem at all."</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason the American Assn. of Individual Investors is
counseling investors not to automatically dump stock in a company
that files later.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to look deeper and find out first why management hasn't
signed the attestation," said Maria Scott, editor of the AAII
Journal.</TE>

<HD>Dynegy Asked Ex-Exec to Cook Books, Suit Says</HD>
<DH>Energy: The former senior vice president says he was fired
after he refused to help manipulate results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A former Dynegy Inc. executive alleges in a lawsuit that he was fired
for refusing to take steps to artificially manipulate profits and
losses in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The suit filed Friday was brought by Bradley Farnsworth, a former
senior vice president who served as controller for the Houston energy
company. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S.
attorney's office in Houston are investigating Dynegy's accounting.</LD>
<LD>   Farnsworth, 49, is seeking unspecified damages in the suit, filed
Friday in a Texas state court in Houston.</LD>
<TE>   Farnsworth claims he was asked by Steve Bergstrom, Dynegy's
president and chief operating officer, to engage in illegal practices
involving accounting of natural gas trading in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said Dynegy is reviewing the lawsuit
and intends "to vigorously contest Mr. Farnsworth's claims." Because
litigation is pending, Sousa said, company policy prevented further
comment.</TE>
<TE>   After refusing to take part in the alleged illegal practices,
Farnsworth was kept out of routine meetings on earnings and
eventually fired, the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   He was fired because "he wouldn't play ball," Farnsworth's lawyer,
Philip Hilder, told the Houston Chronicle in Saturday's editions.</TE>
<TE>   The suit doesn't allege that Dynegy went through with the
manipulation that Farnsworth said he was asked to engage in.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC and the U.S. attorney's office are probing Dynegy's
Project Alpha, a complex accounting vehicle that boosted reported
cash flow and cut taxes with no other obvious purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if his client had talked to the SEC or prosecutors, Hilder
said he couldn't comment.</TE>
<TE>   Farnsworth, hired by Dynegy in 1997, was responsible for
day-to-day accounting activities and SEC filings as controller.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2000, the suit says, Farnsworth told Bergstrom he was
concerned that Dynegy's British trading operation had significant
"short" positions in both gas and power. Such positions would benefit
Dynegy if commodity prices declined.</TE>
<TE>   The suit says he "discussed with Bergstrom the inherent risks
involved should prices in both the natural gas and power markets rise
simultaneously."</TE>
<TE>   About a month later, prices for both rose, "resulting in
significant financial losses to the company, which violated the
company's established risk limits." Throughout the summer, losses
continued to increase.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the suit says, "Bergstrom specifically asked that the
plaintiff 'shave' or reduce for accounting purposes" the model used
to project gas prices for the period from Oct. 1, 2000, to March 31,

<HD>Elan to Unravel Biotech Ventures</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Its new corporate structure affects drug
development partnerships with more than 50 firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turmoil at Elan Corp. is rattling dozens of small biotechnology
companies that have partnership deals with the big Irish
pharmaceutical firm.</LD>
<LD>   Elan announced last week a new corporate structure that would end
its joint ventures, which have come under regulatory scrutiny in the
United States. More than 50 biotech firms in the United States and
Canada have drug development ventures with Elan, which funded the
deals.</LD>
<LD>   The problems at Elan illustrate the risks that small biotech
companies face when they rely heavily on research partnerships with
big drug companies, an arrangement that many start-ups have counted
on for funding and growth.</LD>
<TE>   For companies such as Menlo Park-based DepoMed Inc., the outlook
is uncertain. DepoMed, which develops time-release drugs, said in a
regulatory filing that Elan provides most of its revenue, and it
would be hurt if the relationship ended.</TE>
<TE>   DepoMed Chief Executive John Fara said the company is in talks
with Elan about extending the partnership.</TE>
<TE>   "We have products coming out of the collaboration. The question is
what would happen to them," Fara said.</TE>
<TE>   Another question is whether Elan can continue to underwrite such
drug development projects. Elan, as part of its restructuring,
reported a second-quarter loss of $802 million last week after
writing down investments, including joint ventures, by $826.6
million. It plans to lay off 1,000 of its 4,700 employees by December
and shed an additional 2,100 by the end of next year.</TE>
<TE>   Elan faces a so-called poison put in December 2003, when it must
repay $953 million in bonds with cash or equity. By then, Elan said
it hopes to raise $1.5 billion from sales of assets unrelated to
neurology, pain management and autoimmune disease. If it is unable to
repay the debt in cash, the bondholders will own the company.</TE>
<TE>   John McCamant, an editor at Medical Technology Stock Letter, said
he expects Elan to unwind the complicated joint-venture deals, a
process that could take six to 12 months. Companies with low cash
reserves may have to put their drug development projects on hold as
Elan works things out, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "These JVs are all stuck in limbo," said McCamant, referring to
the joint ventures. "It's a true mess."</TE>
<TE>   Only a year ago, small biotech companies viewed Elan as a coveted
business partner. The pharmaceutical company financed the deals and,
just as importantly, shared valuable drug-delivery technology with
its partners, McCamant said.</TE>
<TE>   But the joint ventures were structured in a way that led the
Securities and Exchange Commission to question Elan's accounting
practices.</TE>
<TE>   In a typical scenario, Elan would invest $20 million in a partner
and form a joint venture. Then the joint venture would pay Elan a
$15-million technology-licensing fee. Critics said the arrangement
allowed Elan to book a portion of its investment as revenue.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Elan's partners paid a high price to do business
with the drug maker. Elan's investment typically took the form of
debt that was convertible to equity, giving it a substantial stake in
its partners.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Elan was viewed as a long-term investor. But
Elan's troubles have changed its attitude. Lately, Elan has asked
some of its partners to register the stock it owns with the SEC, a
step that would allow Elan to sell it. Investors, fearing dilution of
their holdings if those shares come onto the market, have responded
by hammering the shares of Elan's partners.</TE>
<TE>   Among the companies taking a hit is Ligand Pharmaceuticals, a San
Diego biotech firm that lost $42 million last year. Ligand's shares
have lost nearly half their value since June 7, when the company
disclosed that it had received a registration request from Elan.</TE>
<TE>   Ligand spokesman Michael J. Watts said that Ligand has not yet
registered the 19.9% stake owned by Elan, which acquired the stake as
part of a complicated drug-licensing deal. Ligand is in discussions
with Elan over whether and how the shares might be sold, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ligand's shares closed at $8.40 Friday on Nasdaq, down 20 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Elan's deals are with private companies clustered in such
biotech centers as Boston, North Carolina and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Isis Pharmaceuticals is trying to unwind two joint ventures with
Elan; it is the only company that has more than one such deal with
the Irish drug maker. The Carlsbad-based company recently prepaid a
$19.7-million debt to Elan at a 25% discount, a favorable deal made
possible by Elan's weakened bargaining position. But Elan continues
to hold a 5% stake in Isis, mostly in the form of convertible debt
and warrants.</TE>
<TE>   Elan isn't expected to convert the securities to stock unless
Isis' shares rebound. Isis has lost about half its market value since
February, when Elan's accounting methods came under SEC scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Isis' shares closed at $8.06 Friday, down 56 cents on Nasdaq, well
below conversion prices that range from $18.34 to $54, said analyst
Fariba Ghodsian of Roth Capital Partners.</TE>
<TE>   But for Isis, improving its balance sheet is only part of the
challenge. It must resolve ownership rights to two experimental drugs
developed by the joint ventures, one for rheumatoid arthritis and the
other for hepatitis C.</TE>
<TE>   Isis spokeswoman Karen Lundstedt said the company wants to
continue developing the drugs and is in negotiations with Elan over
rights to them. Sunny Uberoi, a spokesman for Elan, said that the
company is reviewing the joint ventures on a case-by-case basis and
said it is too early to comment on any of them.</TE>
<TE>   The experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug fits with Elan's focus
on autoimmune disease. But the company is not the strong marketing
partner it appeared to be when it formed the joint venture with Isis
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   James McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter and
John McCamant's father, said Isis would not have a problem finding a
new development partner on the rheumatoid arthritis drug, which he
considers promising. Whether Elan is willing to sell out under
fire-sale conditions is another matter.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a decision that Isis and Elan are going to have to make,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Data to Help Show Recovery's Course</HD>
<DH>Economy: Inflation, productivity and earnings reports may
reveal whether U.S. faces a 'double dip' recession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Economic news and corporate earnings reports due out this week may
help reveal whether the U.S. economic recovery is still on track--or
whether the U.S. is headed for a dreaded "double dip" recession,
which could send stocks into another swoon.</LD>
<LD>   Having watched stocks sink at the end of last week under the
weight of several downbeat economic reports, investors will be
keeping a close eye on reports measuring the strength of the nation's
service sector, inflation at the wholesale level and worker
productivity, as well as earnings reports from such high-profile
companies as Cisco Systems Inc. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</LD>
<LD>   "The post-bubble weakness is worse than people thought. It's
obviously not a one-quarter blip," said Stephen Roach, chief
economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. "We're right on the brink of
a double-dip recession. GDP growth slowed dramatically in the second
quarter, and a slew of other numbers suggest that momentum is moving
sharply to the downside."</LD>
<TE>   After rallying 14% from its multiyear low reached July 23, the
blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index shed a combined 5% on Thursday
and Friday amid various disappointing U.S. economic reports,
including the latest manufacturing, gross domestic product and
employment data.</TE>
<TE>   At 864.24, the S&amp;P 500 is not far from its five-year low of
797.70. The technology-oriented Nasdaq composite index, at 1,247.92,
is even closer to its multiyear trough of 1,229.05.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks sold off sharply in June and July as a succession of
corporate scandals panicked investors. Stocks reversed course and
started rallying July 24 as arrests in the Adelphia Communications
Corp. scandal and President Bush's approval of landmark corporate
reform legislation signaled that progress was being made on the
executive ethics front, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "In my view, we have undoubtedly passed the worst point in the
corporate accounting scandals," said Jack Laporte, manager of the T.
Rowe Price New Horizons fund. "The pendulum is already swinging in
the other direction, and companies are likely to err on the side of
conservatism as many of the recent perpetrators of fraud face
criminal convictions."</TE>
<TE>   But in recent days, investors have shifted their attention from
corporate scandals to the uncertain state of the economic recovery,
in turn bidding stocks lower.</TE>
<TE>   Noting the troubling data, two major investment banks predicted
Friday that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year in
another attempt to perk up the flagging recovery, according to a
Reuters survey.</TE>
<TE>   A double-dip recession could deal a psychological jolt to
investors--all the more reason investors will be keeping a close eye
on the raft of economic data and corporate earnings reports due out
this week.</TE>
<TE>   If the economy slips back into recession in the next few months,
"disappointment will replace doubt," which might mean another sharp
drop for the stock market, Donald Straszheim, president of Santa
Monica-based Straszheim Global Advisors, said in a report Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Straszheim still expects a slow, choppy recovery, but he said
investors should keep an eye on consumer data, including retail
sales, big-ticket spending, confidence and any hints of weakness in
housing prices.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St.
Louis, said key economic updates this week include this morning's
report on non-manufacturing production in July, Thursday's release of
monthly sales figures from chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and
Friday's preliminary tally of second-quarter productivity. Also
coming is the producer price index for July, which measures wholesale
inflation and is due out Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 13, the morning of the Fed's next meeting, July retail
sales figures will be issued. Thayer expects them to be strong,
offering "additional confirmation that confidence is down but the
economy is rolling along."</TE>
<TE>   But with investors on edge, the various numbers themselves "are
not as significant as how the market takes them," Thayer said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies expected to issue quarterly earnings reports this week,
according to Bloomberg News, include consumer products giant P&amp;G this
morning; tech bellwether Cisco and insurer Conseco Inc. on Tuesday
and insurance company Loews Corp. on Thursday. As the last major tech
company to report, Cisco's numbers and second-half outlook will be
closely watched, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Though any positive surprises could help spark another stock
rally, skeptical economists say the economic recovery may be further
off and far less potent than many investors expect.</TE>
<TE>   "An asset bubble burst in the U.S., which is something we haven't
seen since the 1920s," Morgan Stanley's Roach said. "Now it's payback
time, and it's going to be a fairly lengthy payback. We're probably
only one-third or, at best, one-half, through the post-bubble
aftershock."</TE>

<HD>Net Services Want Better License Deals From Labels</HD>
<DH>Music: Online rivals say Pressplay, a joint venture of Sony
and Universal, gets better treatment. They want equitable terms and
access to titles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pressplay, a joint venture by Universal Music Group and Sony Music
Entertainment, recently overhauled its service to give consumers more
of what they want from online music. Now, Pressplay's competitors are
pressing Universal and Sony to let them do the same.</LD>
<LD>   In particular, they want better access to the two record labels'
music catalogs, arguing that it would violate federal antitrust law
for the Sony Corp. and Vivendi Universal units to favor their joint
venture over independent online music companies.</LD>
<LD>   Antitrust investigators in the Justice Department already are
examining the major labels' licensing practices, as well as
scrutinizing Pressplay and MusicNet, a joint venture controlled by
AOL Time Warner Inc., parent of Warner Music Group; Bertelsmann,
which owns BMG; and EMI Group, which controls EMI Music Publishing.
For their part, the record companies say their efforts have been
completely lawful.</LD>
<TE>   The five major record companies hold the copyrights to about 85%
of the music sold in the U.S., with Universal and Sony claiming about
40%. Companies that want to sell downloadable songs or offer
subscription music services have to obtain licenses from the
copyright holders, setting up the major labels as gatekeepers to the
online market.</TE>
<TE>   That market is in its infancy, and neither the label-owned
services nor the independents have more than a few thousand
subscribers. The most popular players are the ones without
licenses--the file-sharing networks that let consumers make copies of
songs free.</TE>
<TE>   Last Thursday, Pressplay launched a version that lets subscribers
download an unlimited number of songs through the Internet for a flat
monthly fee. Those tracks expire when the subscriber's membership
ends, but for about $1 more per song, subscribers can download
permanent copies that can be recorded onto CDs or moved to portable
devices.</TE>
<TE>   No other subscription music service offers unlimited downloads
from Universal, Sony or any other major record company. And Pressplay
makes available permanent copies of more Universal and Sony downloads
than any other online outlet.</TE>
<TE>   Sources at several independent online companies said they weren't
getting the same deals as Pressplay, although labels' offers have
been improving dramatically. They say they've had trouble getting
wholesale prices for permanent downloads and obtaining the same songs
that Pressplay does--especially from Sony.</TE>
<TE>   These executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also
complained that Sony and Universal have been willing to try out new
features and business models with Pressplay before making them
available to its competitors.</TE>
<TE>   To some label executives, the complaints from the online music
companies are just sour grapes. The online companies' requests have
shifted over time, they say, and that's why they're not all in the
same posture in terms of licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Potter of the Digital Media Assn., a trade group for
online media companies, said the new offerings are significant
improvements that make Pressplay's service more appealing to
consumers. "But when are Sony and Universal going to offer
independent online music services the same bundle of rights they have
licensed to Pressplay?" Potter asked. "I hope that will be soon."</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Kenswil, president of Universal Music Group's ELabs,
said, "We would be happy to make a deal, similar to the one we made
with Pressplay, with anyone who comes to us with a similar business
proposition."</TE>
<TE>   Sony officials were less direct. After noting a variety of deals
it has with a number of digital music services, the company said,
"SME will continue to aggressively pursue relationships with
additional online music companies to have our artists' music
commercially available to consumers in as many ways as possible. Each
service is offering a different consumer proposition, and we must
evaluate each one on a case-by-case basis to ensure that we and our
artists are compensated appropriately for the use of the music."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Justice Department's investigation, the labels
also are under pressure from some members of Congress. Reps. Rick
Boucher (D-Va.) and Chris Cannon (R-Utah) have introduced a bill that
would require the labels to offer the same or better licensing terms
to independent companies that they do to Pressplay and MusicNet.</TE>
<TE>   With all the activity in Washington as well as the progress made
at the negotiating table, some online companies are confident they'll
be able to match Pressplay's deals soon. Besides, the record
companies have an economic interest in having as many online
distribution partners as possible, said Jim Long, chief executive of
RioPort Inc., an online music distributor that has music-downloading
licenses from all five labels.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clearly in the best interest of their shareholders for them
to do that, and this has been proven for 100 years by companies like
3M, General Electric and Johnson &amp; Johnson," Long said.</TE>
<TE>   "They understand that the way you build great companies is to have
the appropriate arm's-length relationships and an even playing
field."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bebel, chief executive of Pressplay, said that any advantage
his company has in terms of licenses and features is only temporary.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that everybody is headed in the same direction,"
Bebel said. "We think that the landscape will be pretty even not too
long from now."</TE>

<HD>State Court to Issue Rulings on Tobacco Suits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myron Levin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Supreme Court today is expected to issue a pair of rulings
with enormous implications for tobacco companies and people suing
them over smoking-related diseases. The rulings could determine
whether cigarette makers will be buried in liability claims in
California, or if the growing threat from hostile juries will
evaporate.</LD>
<LD>   In California, the industry has suffered three consecutive
multi-million-dollar defeats at the hands of lung cancer victims
since a 10-year-old ban on anti-tobacco lawsuits was lifted by state
lawmakers in 1998. The plaintiffs won because juries reacted with
anger to internal documents suggesting cigarette makers had carried
out a decades-long campaign to conceal the risks and addictiveness of
smoking.</LD>
<LD>   But the industry contends that the documents, produced mainly from
the 1950s through mid-1990s, were inadmissible because the companies
were immune to lawsuits until 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Directly at issue in today's rulings will be the future of two
cases--Myers vs. Philip Morris and Naegele vs. R.J. Reynolds--that
were dismissed before trial because of the immunity law. In deciding
if, and exactly when, the immunity applied, the justices will
determine if those two claims can go forward.</TE>
<TE>   More important, however, they also will decide whether
incriminating documents from past decades can be introduced at trial.</TE>
<TE>   If the answer is yes, cigarette makers are likely to face a flood
of new lawsuits and potential liability in the billions of dollars.
If the answer is no, the three plaintiffs' victories would almost
certainly be reversed, and the litigation could dry up.</TE>

<HD>US Airways to Hold Meeting for Investors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>US Airways Group Inc. invited some bondholders to a meeting in New
York on Thursday to discuss the airline's financial restructuring and
the potential effect on their investments.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting is for investors whose bonds are backed by some of the
carrier's older aircraft and whose debt payments have been deferred,
the company said in a notice to those bondholders. Some investors are
frustrated by what they consider the company's lack of communication
on the missed payments and suggestions that US Airways may seek debt
relief.</LD>
<LD>   The seventh-largest U.S. airline has been seeking to reduce annual
costs by $1.3 billion through concessions from workers, creditors and
suppliers. Arlington, Va.-based US Airways has said it needs to cut
costs to avoid a bankruptcy filing and to win final approval for a
$900-million U.S. loan guarantee.</LD>
<TE>   In late June, the carrier deferred payments to some aircraft
lessors and private lenders and began discussions seeking concessions
from them. Early last month, the company said it also would defer
payments to holders of some of its public debt. Some investors
holding the public debt have said they may balk at providing relief.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting will give bondholders information on the status of the
restructuring effort, said US Airways spokesman Chris Chiames,
declining to further comment.</TE>

<HD>Monsanto Is Only Firm to Sell Bonds</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Monsanto Co. is the only company slated to sell bonds this week, as
signs of a slowing economy crimp demand for corporate debt.</LD>
<LD>   The $1-billion sale by Monsanto, an agricultural products maker
that is being spun off by Pharmacia Corp., will come on the heels of
the slowest full week of bond sales since the second week of May,
when eight companies sold $2.9 billion of bonds.</LD>
<LD>   The slide in sales underscores the difficulties companies are
having raising money amid investor worries about accounting fraud and
slowing profits.</LD>
<TE>   About $2.8 billion of corporate bond sales were canceled in the
second half of July as investors moved out of stocks and corporate
debt and into the relative safety of government bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Investors' doubts grew about the accuracy of accounting after
WorldCom Inc. hid $3.9 billion of expenses and then filed for
bankruptcy protection, roiling stock and corporate bond markets and
slowing bond sales in July to less than $20 billion.</TE>
<TE>   That compares with a monthly average of $44 billion for the year,
according to CreditSights Inc., an independent research firm.</TE>

<HD>Music Firms See Games as Sound Marketing Tools</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: With their devoted following, software
titles can be launching pads for up-and-coming artists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget the MTV Music Awards.</LD>
<LD>   The latest sign a band has arrived on the music scene is when its
song blares while two video game characters pummel each other.</LD>
<LD>   For years, record companies considered licensing their music to
video games as a meager but steady source of cash. Game developers
had tiny budgets compared with movie studios, so games often ended up
with obscure songs.</LD>
<TE>   But as sales of video games rival Hollywood box office receipts,
the music industry is taking notice. Labels now view games--with a
dedicated fan base of young, affluent players--as launching pads for
up-and-coming artists.</TE>
<TE>   Game companies, in turn, are trying to capitalize on their
newfound popularity, becoming more choosy about which songs they
take, asking labels to help promote the games and even popping the
artists into the games.</TE>
<TE>   This week, for instance, software firm Electronic Arts Inc. is
announcing a deal with Island Def Jam Music Group to jointly produce
a series of wrestling games featuring the record label's top hip-hop
artists, including Method Man, DMX, Ludicrous and Noreaga.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, hatched by Def Jam President Kevin Liles and EA Chief
Executive Larry Probst, is unusual in that it doesn't involve
licensing songs, the typical route for getting music into games.
Instead, Def Jam artists will get royalties on game sales.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditionally, what happens is that a preexisting piece of music
is licensed into a game," said Jeff Kempler, head of business and
legal affairs at Island Def Jam, a division of Universal Music Group.
"With this, we felt we could together create an integrated
entertainment experience with music built into the game from the
ground up, as opposed to music added at the end, like paint on a
finished house."</TE>
<TE>   Games have come a long way in integrating music. Twenty years ago,
music was a matter of programming bleeps, like tunes punched out on a
telephone keypad. Then, as game technology became more powerful,
developers began adding songs and sound effects. In the 1990s,
developers got their friends to play music, hired local bands or
tried to license songs.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, video games amassed a fan base that included
established musicians such as Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who
wrote the score for Id Software's "Quake."</TE>
<TE>   "No one had ever done that before," said American McGee, a former
developer at Id, who helped recruit Reznor in the early 1990s.
Reznor, an avid gamer, continues to work with Id and is devoting six
months to making music and sound effects for the upcoming "Doom III."</TE>
<TE>   Though games have become big business, bringing in more than $6
billion a year in software sales, budgets for song licensing remain
small compared with film budgets. Game companies typically pay $2,000
for a song from an unknown band to $25,000 for established acts. That
pales in comparison with the hundreds of thousands of dollars movie
studios often pony up for each song.</TE>
<TE>   "They're definitely not doing it for the money," said Lori Lahman,
a former music supervisor for films and co-founder of SonicFusion, a
Los Angeles company that handles music licensing for game publishers
such as Activision Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, much of the desire for placing music into games lies in
the marketing boost these games provide, particularly as the music
industry veers into a rough patch of declining sales after years of
slow but steady growth. Last year, sales of music and music videos in
the U.S. sagged 4% to $13.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Games are an intriguing outlet for me to break my artists," said
Lee Stimmel, vice president of marketing for Atlantic Records, which
has licensed artists such as Brandy, Nappy Roots and Audiovent to EA.
"The amount of time people spend in front of these games is enormous.
In a game, your song is repeated over and over.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what radio does," Stimmel said. "Radio is still the No. 1
way to sell records, but the industry needs more ways to cut through
the media clutter and create awareness for our artists on a number of
different levels. This is just one more platform for us to get into
the public's consciousness and hopefully sell more records."</TE>
<TE>   Atlantic is arranging for its artists to appear at game industry
events and is promoting EA games alongside its albums. Radio station
callers, for example, can win a bundled prize of music and games,
Stimmel said. Store displays will cross-promote the CDs and the
games.</TE>
<TE>   EA, in turn, will start displaying artist names and song titles
within all of its sports games, beginning with "Madden Football
2003," to be released Aug. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Though EA will continue to pay a licensing fee to labels, the
Redwood City, Calif., game publisher wants to forge deeper ties with
labels. This year it hired Steve Schnur, a music industry executive,
to be its representative.</TE>
<TE>   "The key is that it's not just the old-school buyer-seller
relationship," said Schnur, who has worked for Capitol Records,
Elektra Entertainment and Arista Records. "Licensing music now takes
on a whole new level. We've become marketing partners."</TE>
<TE>   Artists, who often are gamers, are eager to get involved, seeing
the deal not so much as marketing as an opportunity to get their
songs into games they've grown up with.</TE>
<TE>   Audiovent, a rock band from Calabasas, turned down a Pepsi
commercial but had no problems licensing a song for "Madden Football
2003."</TE>
<TE>   "We like to think of ourselves as a band with integrity," said
Audiovent's 23-year-old drummer, Jamin Wilcox, who has played video
games since he was 9. "This was cool because it was an exercise in
melding two entertainment forms."</TE>

<HD>Camera Campaign Uses Actors Posing as Tourists</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Next time a good-looking young couple asks you to take their picture,
beware--they might work for the maker of the camera.</LD>
<LD>   Cell phone maker Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications has hired 120
actors and actresses across the country to play tourists and ask
passers-by to take their picture with the company's new T68i cell
phone and an add-on digital camera.</LD>
<LD>   Sony Ericsson, a joint venture of Sony Corp. and Ericsson, is
running the campaign in seven U.S. cities as part of what one
executive called "reach out and touch the consumer advertising."</LD>
<TE>   "It's not a sales pitch," Jon Maron, director of marketing
communications for Sony Ericsson, told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   He said the company went to talent agencies looking for young,
attractive people who were interested in technology and willing to
have their pictures taken all day long.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not just actors and actresses. They're the young, cool
people in the areas where they live," Maron said.</TE>
<TE>   Maron, who referred to the phones as "mobile multimedia devices,"
said the actors are visiting places such as malls and
nightclubs--tourist hubs where it would not seem unusual for a young
couple to want their picture taken.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, cell-phone cameras, either built into the
phone or attached externally, have grown in popularity in Asia and
Europe, where phones with color screens and high-speed Internet
connections are more prevalent than in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Maron said the actors, if pressed for information on what the
phone-camera is or where to buy it, will tell the inquiring
photographer where it can be found and who makes it, and they won't
make any secret of the fact they work for the company, if asked.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cisco Systems Inc.'s earnings report this week may signal that an
industry recovery is still a ways off as analysts and investors
expect to hear a repeat of weak sales forecasts from the networking
giant.</LD>
<LD>   Also of interest to investors will be whether the No. 1 maker of
gear that directs Internet traffic will expense its stock options and
how it plans to use its huge cash stockpile.</LD>
<LD>   "My interest is clearly on the top line [revenue]. People are
questioning whether this is a growth story again," said Alex
Vallecillo, senior portfolio manager with Armada Funds, which holds
Cisco shares in several of its mutual funds.</LD>
<TE>   Cisco, based in San Jose, has been hit by a slowdown in spending
by its large customers but has suffered less than other suppliers
because large corporate "enterprise" customers account for about 80%
of its sales, with only 20% in the battered telecommunications
sector.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth-quarter results
after the market closes Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The stock faltered Friday as reports continued to swirl about the
possible departure of Chief Financial Officer Larry Carter.</TE>
<TE>   The company denied the rumors, repeating that Carter, who is
turning 60, has always said he will retire "at some point in the
future" and at that time there will be "a smooth and well-planned
transition."</TE>
<TE>   The company also repeated Friday that it will certify its
financial results in late September in its annual 10-K filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco's stock fell more than 8% Thursday on rumors Carter and
Chief Executive John Chambers would resign and would not certify the
company's financial results. The company denied both reports.</TE>

<HD>OpenOffice Emulates MS Office--and It's Free</HD>
<DH>Software: It has some rough edges, but this suite can do
most of the job without the $479 price tag.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW FORDAHL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Microsoft Corp.
should feel supremely complimented by the OpenOffice.org suite of
software. And, perhaps, just a tad worried.</LD>
<LD>   OpenOffice's sleek word processor, spreadsheet and presentation
programs capture Microsoft Office's look and some of the most popular
features without the $479 price tag and anti-piracy measures.</LD>
<LD>   OpenOffice is free. The 50-megabyte download costs nothing. Unlike
most other "free" programs, it doesn't require an advanced degree to
fathom.</LD>
<TE>   More important--since Microsoft has more than 90% of the
productivity software market--OpenOffice reads documents that
originally were created with Microsoft's programs and can save in
those formats as well.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the catch?</TE>
<TE>   There are some rough edges and a few omissions, notably a calendar
program, an e-mail application and a database. They'll be missed
mainly by power users and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   There's also no tech support by phone and no printed manuals,
unless you print them yourself. That's not to say no help is
available. Each program has built-in assistance, and much more can be
found on the OpenOffice.org Web site.</TE>
<TE>   And anyone who wants a more powerful suite without paying
Microsoft's prices still could shell out $76 and buy StarOffice, on
which OpenOffice is based.</TE>
<TE>   Sun Microsystems Inc., which sells StarOffice, has released most
of the code to a community of programmers who work on developing
OpenOffice in their spare time. Besides fee-based tech support,
StarOffice also includes a grammar checker, a database, additional
filters and some fonts that Sun licensed from other vendors.</TE>
<TE>   Why is Sun doing this? Besides selling servers and workstations,
Sun also is in the anti-Microsoft business. Alternative software is a
key component, as is litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Microsoft had nothing to fear from StarOffice, which
Sun formerly gave away. The previous version was difficult and
disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not the case with OpenOffice, a surprising fact given
the reputation most open-source software has for being buggy and
targeted to gearheads. Such is true with most programs written for
Linux.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the look of Microsoft Office, OpenOffice incorporates many
of the same shortcuts. Want to create a new file? Hit Control-N. Want
to run the spell checker? Press the F7 key.</TE>
<TE>   It's consistent throughout the entire suite.</TE>
<TE>   The program also is available for operating systems other than
Windows, including Linux and Unix. The Mac OS X version still is
under development. A recently released "developer" version has just
implemented printing functions.</TE>
<TE>   OpenOffice does have some problems, however.</TE>
<TE>   Some complex Word documents, especially those with embedded
graphics, are mis-formatted in OpenOffice's Writer. Occasionally,
fonts are incorrect.</TE>
<TE>   OpenOffice's spreadsheet program, Calc, is confused by commas
placed within cells when text files are imported. And macros
developed in Microsoft Office don't work at all.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, I opened a news release that a company spokesman
originally had saved in Microsoft Office. It appeared mangled in
OpenOffice but revealed details that were hidden in Word, such as
talking points and a long list on which various managers made
comments and signed off.</TE>
<TE>   Still, OpenOffice handles with aplomb most everyday jobs, such as
composing a letter, a school report or a household budget. More
complex tasks might take some extra time but are manageable.</TE>
<TE>   The headaches are relatively small compared with shelling out
hundreds of dollars for each copy of Microsoft Office and then
"activating" the program so Microsoft knows you have not installed it
on more than one computer.</TE>
<TE>   I'd expect more cost-aware businesses to look closely at
OpenOffice now that Microsoft is bumping up the price of its
volume-licensing scheme.</TE>
<TE>   And for households annoyed by the lack of a family discount for a
shared copy of Microsoft Office, OpenOffice is a fine option.</TE>

<HD>A Window on Microsoft</HD>
<DH>General counsel Brad Smith discusses what's next for the
firm</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Smith took over as Microsoft Corp.'s general counsel early this
year, after the software giant negotiated a proposed settlement of
antitrust claims by the U.S. Justice Department and nine states.
Within weeks, a federal judge in Washington is expected to rule on a
request by nine other states that Microsoft be punished more severely
for the abuses of monopoly power identified by an appeals court.</LD>
<LD>   Question: A lot of people were surprised that when the nine
non-settling states were asked to prioritize their picks for remedies
at the last minute, they picked technical disclosure as opposed to
something more onerous, such as a modular Windows. Were you
surprised?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: I don't know if I had any particular expectation. One
possible irony is that technical disclosure is actually something
that we've been trying to do more of at the company, and it was a
predominant theme in the settlement that was negotiated last fall. We
recognize that there may arise opportunities for additional technical
disclosures. Our concern about what the states are seeking is that
they don't have much of anything that could rightly be labeled
technical disclosure. What they have been seeking is the confiscation
or the compulsory licensing of our intellectual property rights--the
notion, for example, that some of our most valuable intellectual
property would be put in the public domain or auctioned off to our
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: A number of people think a question from the judge indicates
she wants to give the states something, possibly something relatively
small. How much is too much? What would trigger an appeal?</TE>
<TE>   A: There are two or three principles that are fundamental to us.
One is protecting the integrity of the Windows product. If others in
the distribution channel can remove code from Windows, that poses a
problem that is fundamental to us. It would mean that the reliability
and security of Windows would be undermined. Consumers could not have
confidence that the product that they get is the product that they
want. It would make it extraordinarily difficulty for us to continue
innovating by developing new features in Windows.</TE>
<TE>   The second fundamental concern is the variety of steps that would
confiscate in one way or another our intellectual property rights. A
good example of that is the proposal that would take each advance
that we make in Internet Explorer and give that away for free to our
competitors. It's basically simple economics that says it doesn't
make sense to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to develop
software if you have to give away the results.</TE>
<TE>   The states have asked for sanctions that go so far beyond the
sanctions that the other states and the federal government negotiated
that you would have a very real risk of conflicting judgments. The
practical problems that could raise are obviously enormous. A second
problem is that the devil's in the details. One of the points that
Bill Gates made quite clearly when he testified is that you can have
language on its face that may seem appropriate to someone, but when
you really think what it would mean for software development, you
realize that the results are draconian and would have all of these
unintended consequences. So the truth of the matter is that we would
need to study very carefully whatever result comes from the court.
And unfortunately, unless you have the opportunity to sit down and
negotiate something and really work out all of those details, the
risk of serious unintended consequences is quite high.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Objectors to the proposed settlement have complained about
loopholes and wiggle room, and that has resonated because of the
history of the previous consent decree and the fact that Microsoft
knows how to find weaknesses in contracts. There's a new CEO here,
and there's a new general counsel. However this comes out, do you
think there won't be quite as much of a hardball stance?</TE>
<TE>   A: We have all learned a great deal from the experience of the
past five years. We recognize that we need to pursue business models
and technology initiatives that create opportunities for success
among a wide variety of companies. It's hard to believe that we are
going to be very successful in the future if we are the only ones who
benefit from the new technologies that we bring to market. One reason
that we had controversies with the government is that we had
disagreements with others in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Second, I would say that we appreciate that people will listen to
what we say, but they will judge us by what we do. One concern that
some people have raised is that we won't disclose as much as they
think we should under the requirements in the proposed consent
decree. The suggestion is that we will rely on the exceptions created
for security and digital rights management, for example. I expect
that in the next month we will have the opportunity to tell the
industry what it is that we are doing, and I hope that then they will
perhaps become a little bit more comfortable. But this isn't
something that you can do and suddenly have everyone walk away
applauding in six or 12 months. This is a multiyear, sustained
commitment that we will need to deliver on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Microsoft's legal situation reminds me a little bit of "The
Sorcerer's Apprentice," where you cut up one big broom and then
there's 10 little brooms. You've got the European Union, you've got
more than one class-action suit, you've got AOL Time Warner, Sun
Microsystems and Be Inc. How do you rank the threats? And second, I'm
reminded of the tobacco industry's plight--there were so many
different legal strategies against it, in so many different forums,
by so many different people, that almost regardless of the merits,
there was a real and eventually realized fear that they were going to
lose sooner or later. How do you deal with that kind of a siege by so
many forces?</TE>
<TE>   A: I tend to put things in two distinct categories, governmental
inquiries and lawsuits on the one hand and private cases on the
other. Governments are elected to represent the public interest, and
they are given broad powers to do so. Competitors represent only
themselves, and to some degree the law recognizes that. And it's more
often the case that competitor cases or class-action cases are about
money, as they seek to recover damages. While money is important,
it's not about the future in the same way that governmental cases
are, where they are seeking to devise a regulatory approach to
technology.</TE>
<TE>   The most important part about the governmental area is just how
vexing it is when multiple governments around the country and around
the world seek to regulate a single global technology like the
Internet or software that runs on the Internet. A car company can
make a catalytic converter for sale in California that is different
than it is in Germany. But a software company cannot create software
that is different in California and Germany unless we want to erect
big new national or state borders on the Internet. One of the big
challenges that we're all going to have to think about over the next
10 to 20 years is how multiple governments can best work together
when they are trying to regulate a technology that is singular and
global in character.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Will Microsoft be hurt in any way by the shifting public
sentiment seemingly against all big companies?</TE>
<TE>   A: We all need to recognize that there is something of a crisis of
confidence in the corporate sector. We all need to work twice as hard
to sustain the confidence that we do have and to regain the
confidence that the business sector has lost. This is something we
need to think about to some degree in everything we do, whether it's
financial accounting practices or corporate governance issues or any
other aspect of business life.</TE>

<LD>The company that held the lease for the World Trade Center estimates
its losses at $8.2 billion from the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Silverstein Properties had previously estimated the losses at $6.5

<DH>Travel agencies struggle to survive as online booking
surges</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Storefront travel agents are closing shop at a startling pace-- about
300 a month since January--as their business is siphoned off by
online travel companies catering to an ever-increasing number of
Internet-savvy consumers hooked on low rates and fast service.</LD>
<LD>   With airline commissions eliminated for independent agents and
carriers offering incentives only for the largest travel companies,
smaller agencies are scrambling for new sources of revenue, such as
adding fees for services and in some cases transforming into online
companies themselves, before they are shut out of the Internet
booking world.</LD>
<LD>   "When you have customers constantly saying, 'I can get that on the
Internet for less,' you start to realize what you have to do," said
Kelly Mayhew, an agent at Best Travel in San Antonio. "You have to
get the deals for your clients online while somehow getting paid for
it. It's hard not to look at the Internet as the big bad wolf, but
you have no choice."</LD>
<TE>   Traditional travel agents still handle more than half of all
leisure travel bookings. But online travel bookings have been rising
while bricks-and-mortar agencies have been going dark. As of June,
there were 26,120 U.S. travel agencies, a 12% drop from June 2001,
according to the American Society of Travel Agents. Meanwhile, online
companies continued to profit from the more than 21 million consumers
who are now buying their travel exclusively over the Internet.
Priceline.com last week said its second-quarter profit more than
doubled to $6.31 million, and industry experts said online travel
bookings will top $26 billion this year--up 31% from 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Joe McClure, president of Montrose Travel in Montrose, said there
is still so much confusion over finding the best deal on the Internet
that traditional business for his 150 employees remains strong. The
company, one of the largest independent agencies in the United
States, logs $118 million a year in bookings and has its own Web site
on which customers can make reservations while still having an agent
assist them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go out online and try to search for a good fare, you'll
get so many choices it's mind-boggling," McClure said. "And even if
you do have 10 hours to go through every single one, who's to say if
it was even worth it in the end."</TE>
<TE>   Montrose Travel charges fees for some of its services, helping to
recoup lost commissions, which began shrinking for all agents even
before the travel slowdown that followed the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks as the nation's airlines turned to the Internet to cut costs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In October, major carriers eliminated commissions for online
travel companies--although the largest ones have been able to
negotiate special fees based on volume, similar to what many
high-volume travel agencies do to keep commissions coming. Agents who
work for larger agencies have less to worry about because airlines
give bonuses to the companies that bring them the most business, and
bigger agencies have a better chance of making high-volume sales.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't felt the pinch because we are still making enough
money for the airlines that they continue to reward us for it," said
James Toler, a leisure travel manager at TravelWorld in Irvine, which
averages $75 million a year in bookings. Most storefront agencies do
less than $4 million per year in sales. "So we don't have to worry so
much about the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   At least one Internet upstart is tweaking the cyberspace booking
model to include traditional agents on its payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Pederson, founder of the Reservation Company, said paying
commissions to a base of loyal travel agents--while offering more
services for customers at cut-rate prices--is an approach he hopes
will give him an edge in the fast-growing online travel business.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some traditional elements to travel that are not going
to change, and one is the use of travel agents," Pedersen said.
"They're still key to making an online travel business work, because
consumers still want those traditional services no matter how much
[Web] surfing they do."</TE>
<TE>   The Reservation Company's model is different from other online
giants, such as Expedia Inc. and Travelocity, because it pays
commissions directly to travel agents who book trips on its Web site
and offers package deals that include entertainment such as tickets
to plays, concerts and reservations for golf tee times.</TE>
<TE>   Because the company contracts special rates with airlines and
hotels, agents can offer Web-only deals to their customers while
still getting commissions they otherwise wouldn't--anywhere from 5%
for booking a tee time to up to 50% for an airline ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Pederson said the Las Vegas-based, privately held company, which
was launched three years ago as BookVegas.com, posted $17 million in
sales in 2001, and said it is on track to double that figure this
year. The site began as a niche travel service focusing on hotels,
casinos and Vegas shows, but has since added 12 other U.S. cities,
including San Diego, Los Angeles, New York and Miami. About 14,000
travel agents have begun using his Web site, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lynne Erikson of Breton Village Travel Services in Grand Rapids,
Mich., called the model impossible to refuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would I go to one of the big online sites where I won't make
a dime?" said Erikson, who routinely books package trips to Las Vegas
through www.thereservationcompany.com.</TE>
<TE>   "They are very, very smart to romance the travel agents this way.
I don't know why more [online companies] aren't making nice with us."</TE>
<TE>   McClure of Montrose Travel said the idea of online companies
working with storefront agents may be good for those agents, but only
if the company can deliver the best deals.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it, we can name the top three big boys in the online
industry, no problem," he said. "They're the ones you have to compete
with, and that's not going to be easy for the 5,000 little guys out
there. I doubt very many agents will be rescued that way."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Expedia, which is owned by USA Interactive Inc., said
they do not comment on competitive issues, but pointed to the online
company's recent purchase of Classic Custom Vacations as an example
of how it is involving independent travel agents in booking sales.
Through a network of agents who receive commissions, the company
provides high-end package vacations to Hawaii, Mexico, Europe and the
Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps what makes Pederson's plan so appealing to some agents are
the residual commissions it offers them for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   If Erikson, for example, books a trip for a customer through the
Web site once, and that customer decides to go directly to the
Reservation Company sometime in the future, the booking will be
flagged and the original agent still will receive a commission on the
sale.</TE>
<TE>   "That's unheard of," said Richard Copland, president of the
American Society of Travel Agents. "It's going to send hordes of
loyal travel agents to that Web site, because loyalty is extremely
important to us."</TE>
<TE>   Some industry experts, however, said the Reservation Company's
approach is geared toward agents who already are using technology to
stay afloat, and those are precisely the travel agents who will
survive in the rapidly changing industry. And analysts said most new
travel companies either sink or are sold within their first five
years anyway, unable to compete with the giants.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more and more start-ups, but that's a reflection of the
online travel world, which has basically been the only bright spot in
travel for the past year," said Paul Keung, an analyst for CIBC World
Markets in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "In five more years, though, I don't see any new names being added
to the same big online travel sites we know now. The new ones still
have to compete, and in this environment that's going to be difficult
to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Reservation Company has contracts for low fares with several
smaller airlines, such as National and Spirit; Pedersen said he hopes
to add at least one major airline as a partner soon. Hotels include
Best Western and Marriott, plus individual contracts with dozens in
various cities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   PhoCusWright, an online travel consulting firm in Connecticut,
estimates that 54% of all leisure travel bookings are being done by
off-line agents. But that will drop to 43% within two years as the
more sophisticated agents look online for business and consumers
become even more Internet-savvy.</TE>
<TE>   "Travel agents need a life raft, and a few companies are throwing
them one," said Lorraine Sileo, a PhoCusWright online travel
researcher. "Those who grab it are going to survive at least a little
longer than those who don't."</TE>

<HD>Airline Sees Hope in Bankruptcy</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Discount carrier Vanguard hopes the Chapter 11
filing will attract an investor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMY SHAFER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>With little hope for returning to the air, ailing discount carrier
Vanguard Airlines Inc.'s decision to reorganize rather than sell
everything off has left a nagging question: Why?</LD>
<LD>   After all, the company, which bled money year after year, failed
to get the funding it needed in nearly a year of begging the
government and private lenders for help.</LD>
<LD>   Industry experts and company executives say last week's Chapter 11
filing leaves open the possibility that an investor might take a
chance on the long-struggling carrier. But the prospects seem dim for
Vanguard, which laid off nearly 90% of its employees when it shut
down. Los Angeles was one of the 18 cities it served.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody credible is going to give them money now," said Darryl
Jenkins, director of George Washington University's Aviation
Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Even Scott Dickson, Vanguard's president and chief executive,
offered little hope in a letter to employees posted on the company's
Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "It is likely this is a permanent shutdown," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   What Vanguard hopes is that the bankruptcy will attract a lender,
said Elizabeth Cattell, the airline's vice president of marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes in Chapter 11, we're looking for a debtor-in-possession
lender who would come in, and sometimes it's more attractive to
lenders once you're in [Chapter] 11," Cattell said.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard has given itself a week to find an investor. Without one,
the fire sale begins.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday--a day after the bankruptcy reorganization filing--a
judge approved the airline's request to use about $450,000 over the
next week to seek new financing.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard's shutdown came after a private equity arrangement fell
through and the federal Air Transportation Stabilization Board
rejected a final request for a loan guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   The airline industry has been under immense financial pressure
because of last year's terrorist attacks and the economic downturn,
but Vanguard has always had financial difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   The Kansas City-based carrier has not reported a yearly profit
since operations began in December 1994. Its last quarterly profit
was in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Aerospace Exec's Book a 'Scintillating' Tell-All</HD>
<DH>Science: A result of more than a decade of research,
publication examines what causes stars to twinkle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Albert Wheelon, former Los Angeles aerospace executive and onetime
CIA technology chief, has written a tell-all book, but not the sort
likely to create much controversy.</LD>
<LD>   In a research effort that spanned more than a decade, Wheelon has
published the first of at least two technical volumes on
electromagnetic scintillation, the phenomenon that causes stars to
twinkle.</LD>
<LD>   Not exactly light summertime reading, Wheelon's 455-page book is
filled with mathematical equations and charts. It is among the most
definitive examinations of how Earth's atmosphere distorts waves of
light, vital to developing more accurate telescopes, radars, lasers
and even satellite-based global positioning systems.</LD>
<TE>   Wheelon, who holds a doctorate in physics from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, is credited with building the former Hughes
Aircraft Co. into the global leader in commercial satellites. The
satellite operations, headquartered in El Segundo, are now owned by
Boeing Co. He earlier was technical director of the CIA, where he
helped pioneer the agency's development of advanced spy satellites.</TE>
<TE>   After Wheelon's retirement in 1988, he elected to eschew golf and
travel in favor of renewing his research into radio physics and space
technology.</TE>
<TE>   "I found a number of loose ends and apparent conflicts," Wheelon
said.</TE>
<TE>   The book, "Electromagnetic Scintillation, Geometrical Optics"
(Cambridge University Press, 2001), is intended as a handbook for
researchers. The book's preface gives credit to Valerian Tatarskii, a
former Russian scientist who once worked in the field behind the Iron
Curtain.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's not unusual for former chief executives to write
books, but they are typically ego-boosting autobiographies or primers
on how to run a company. Rarely do former executives spend so much
time on what could be described only as an egghead's dream.</TE>
<TE>   Wheelon, who now lives in Santa Barbara, is working on a second
volume, and the publisher has been asking him to write a third.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his wife's illness, Wheelon said he probably won't work
on a third volume, although he said the writing has "been one of the
more joyous parts of my life."</TE>

<HD>After Many Lean Years, Americans Get a 'Do-Something'
Congress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS K. BAKER</AU>
<BD>Ross K. Baker is a political science professor at
Rutgers University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone's heard of the "do-nothing" Congress. Well, call this the
"do-something" Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Before this current two-year session is over in January, the 107th
Congress will be able to boast of the most impressive list of
accomplishments of any Congress since the days of the Johnson
administration in the 1960s.</LD>
<LD>   Whether or not you agree with everything it has done, there is no
way one could characterize this Congress as unresponsive or lazy.</LD>
<TE>   It is true that the homeland security bill will be put over until
after the August recess; this legislation represents the most
extensive consolidation of federal government agencies since the 1948
reorganization that combined the departments of War and Navy and
created an independent Air Force under the new Department of Defense.
And it is true that there is still a major difference between the
White House and the Senate's Democratic majority over the degree of
Civil Service protection for the 170,000 employees in the proposed
agency. But the differences have been so narrowed that ultimate
passage should not be a problem.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the bankruptcy reform bill too will pass. And the list of
other major legislative actions also is impressive.</TE>
<TE>   Congress, for example, finally passed a measure granting President
Bush the power to negotiate trade agreements with minimal tampering
by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   And it overwhelmingly approved--despite the president's early
opposition--legislation to punish corporate corruption and regulate
the accounting industry. Without a doubt, it is Congress that
deserves credit for this bill's toughness.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, we could say that Congress got in gear because members
feared they couldn't go before voters this fall without something in
hand. But that only underscores Congress' responsiveness.</TE>
<TE>   We could name a few legislators who were most responsible for the
record of accomplishment. Maryland Democratic Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes.
Iowa Republican Sen. Charles E. Grassley. Vermont Democratic Sen.
Patrick J. Leahy. Texas Republican Rep. Dick Armey.</TE>
<TE>   Yet everyone has pulled together when the easiest course for both
parties would have been a Saturnalia of partisan demagoguery in which
each accused the other of obstruction.</TE>
<TE>   This Congress reminds us of the observation of Samuel Johnson
about a dog walking on its hind legs: "It is not that the feat is
done well but rather that it is done at all."</TE>

<HD>The Bigger the City, the Bigger the Clout</HD>
<DH>Secession would impede outside aid in emergencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEL LEVINE</AU>
<BD>Mel Levine, an attorney in Los Angeles, represented Los
Angeles and other cities in the area in Congress from 1983 to 1993.
He was a member of the California Assembly from 1977 to 1982.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Fernando Valley's secession from Los Angeles would not only slice
up the city, it would slice up L.A.'s clout in Washington and
Sacramento, making it harder to get badly needed help after
emergencies or to prepare for them.</LD>
<LD>   In 1983, two days before I was sworn in to represent Los Angeles
and eight other cities in the U.S. House, a storm battered the
Southern California coastline, requiring emergency federal assistance
in the communities of Redondo Beach, Malibu and Venice, all in my new
district.</LD>
<LD>   During the next six weeks, I received a quick education in the
federal emergency appropriations process, seeking and securing
federal emergency help for the coastal communities that had been
damaged.</LD>
<TE>   I also learned--very quickly--two important legislative lessons.</TE>
<TE>   The first was that it is enormously helpful in Congress to be able
to enlist and obtain support from the members of the L.A. delegation,
a formidable force when it bands together on behalf of the city in
times that require state or federal help.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, it is much easier to attract official attention when
seeking help for a city the size of Los Angeles than for a smaller,
adjacent city.</TE>
<TE>   These lessons were clearly evident again in 1994 after the
devastating Northridge earthquake. The federal government responded
immediately and generously to the urgent needs of Los Angeles,
largely secured by the clout of the city and its representatives in
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Plainly, it will be much easier in the future as well to attract
the time and attention of our federal officials if they are asked to
meet with the mayor of Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city
and the gateway to the Pacific Rim, than if they are asked to meet
with the mayors of a shrunken Los Angeles and a neighboring city.</TE>
<TE>   After a secession, the focus would be diluted, the clout would be
reduced, the appeal would be smaller. The city will have squandered
much of its legislative influence if it cuts off a sizable portion of
its people from its base.</TE>
<TE>   It is of course impossible to predict what the next emergency will
be or when it will occur. But whether we suffer another trauma like
Sept. 11, another earthquake, another fallout from ocean storms or
more mountain fires, we would be foolish to relinquish the strong,
coordinated and compelling appeal that we now can make on behalf of
the vital and cohesive unit known in the Congress and in Sacramento
as "Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Any reduction in clout will cost us dearly when the next emergency
arises. It is not a chance worth taking.</TE>

<BD>Michael F. Perlis, an attorney in Los Angeles, was an

<LD>Repeated instances of corporate irregularities, fraud and greed have
sent the markets on a roller-coaster ride, caused some to question
the continued viability of capitalism and led our politicians to dust
off every available soapbox. Yet by simply adding another layer of
federal regulation to address the problem, Congress and President
Bush are missing the boat.</LD>
<LD>   What must be done is to change the culture of boards of directors
in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Specifically, we must take a more critical look at what
constitutes "independence" in an outside director and empower those
directors to do their jobs more effectively.</LD>
<TE>   Traditionally, the label "independent director" signified that an
individual was not a member of corporate management. That test is no
longer enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Independent" from now on must mean capable directors who have
neither business nor personal entanglements with their company's
management.</TE>
<TE>   Long-term friends of the chief executive should no longer be
considered independent; neither should law partners of the outside
general counsel to the corporation.</TE>
<TE>   Further, boards of directors should no longer include members who
provide extensive consulting services to the corporation or those
whose compensation is largely through the grant of options.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, it was thought that compensating outside directors
through grants of options would align their interests with those of
the shareholders. However, recent events suggest that it's better to
pay directors primarily cash compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Yet these basic steps, while helpful, cannot overcome a
fundamental trait of human nature. That is, no one sitting on a board
of directors wishes to appear adversarial to other directors.</TE>
<TE>   The motivation to "get along" is a particularly strong one, and
directors must walk a fine line between polite questioning and
intrusive probing.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that would help is if key board committees, such as
audit committees, and outside directors generally retained
independent counsel and independent auditing experts to assist them
in discharging their duties.</TE>
<TE>   These outside professionals would be able to ask the hard
questions on tough issues that may be required and not accept at face
value prepackaged answers on complex topics.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of adding these independent experts would be small
compared with the benefits that could be derived from better
governance and from avoiding potential liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a management team that might consider engaging in an
irregular or improper activity might be deterred simply by knowing
that its conduct would be reviewed by trained professionals whose
loyalty was exclusively to truly independent directors.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, a cultural change of this kind would be far more
effective in curbing corporate fraud and self-dealing than adding yet
another layer of federal law and regulation to our corporate
environment.</TE>

<HD>It's Not the Cannabis, It's the Constitution</HD>
<DH>Medical marijuana controversy turns the feud over
federalism on its head.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Jonathan Turley is a constitutional law professor at
George Washington University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even in a city where cross-dressing is a protected right--if not a
cherished tradition--San Francisco leaders have turned heads recently
by appearing publicly in a new type of trans-political apparel.
Members of the ultraliberal San Francisco City Council have suddenly
taken on states' rights--normally a conservative stance--as their
cause celebre.</LD>
<LD>   Their opponent is none other than ultraconservative Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft--normally a states' rights advocate--who is asserting
the supremacy of the federal government.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is the desire of California citizens to allow seriously
ill patients to use medical marijuana to relieve their pain and
discomfort. Advocates in San Francisco have proposed a program in
which the city government itself would grow and distribute medical
marijuana; a November ballot measure is planned. If San Francisco
voters approve the measure, a major confrontation over states' rights
will be triggered and may prove to be one of the most significant
federalism cases in decades.</LD>
<TE>   Federalism protects the states from the encroachment of the
federal government, leaving the primary decisions of government to
the individual states. It is a principle based on the idea that power
is safest when held closest to the people. Under our system, each
state is allowed to try what U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis
Brandeis once described as "novel social and economic experiments" in
solving contemporary problems.</TE>
<TE>   Federalism is often wrongly seen as a Republican or conservative
position. Liberals have long considered the federal government to be
more enlightened than the states. For example, during desegregation,
federal courts and Congress proved far more protective and active in
the area of equal rights. As a result, liberals have often rallied in
opposition to federalism to the same degree that conservatives have
rallied around it.</TE>
<TE>   Both conservatives and liberals now face a quandary. While
liberals were once happy to see the federal government shape state
policies in its own image, they are less enthusiastic now that the
image is that of Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   In California, advocates found themselves arguing for the use of
medical marijuana to a man who does not smoke, drink or dance and who
probably viewed the 1936 movie "Reefer Madness" as a medical
documentary.</TE>
<TE>   Liberals have suddenly discovered federalism and the right of
state self-determination. While conservatives have long defended
states' rights, they now face states that want to experiment with gay
marriages, medical marijuana and assisted suicide. Accordingly,
conservatives have suddenly discovered the need for uniform federal
laws in traditional state areas.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy over medical marijuana has less to do with pot
than it does principle.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the merits of medical marijuana, Californians are
rightfully aggrieved by the federal government telling them it alone
can approve certain drugs for the use of the terminally ill. While
growing pot in San Francisco may seem less inspiring than dumping tea
in Boston, it is a defiant act that speaks of the right of citizens
to self-determination.</TE>
<TE>   If San Francisco draws this line in the constitutional sand, it
will force conservatives on the Supreme Court to make a choice
between their principles and their personal inclinations.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the court considered a case involving a federal crackdown
on a cooperative in Oakland that distributed medical marijuana,
consistent with state but not federal law. In a decision written by
Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court rejected the cooperative's
claim of medical necessity.</TE>
<TE>   However, in a virtual invitation for challenge, the court
expressly reserved the question of whether the federal government was
violating federalism guarantees in its enforcement of drug laws over
state medical marijuana measures.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco program may finally answer that question.
Frankly, I am more concerned with the Constitution than the cannabis
in this controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever societal risks are presented by terminally ill patients
getting stoned, they pale in comparison with the political risks of
yielding to federal authority in this area. Of course, it may be too
much to hope that there is more than mere opportunism in the recent
embrace of federalism.</TE>
<TE>   Yet perhaps this controversy will show that liberals have much to
gain from federalism, particularly in states like California with a
history of bold social programs and experimentation.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, California may not be right about medical marijuana,
but it has a right to be wrong.</TE>

<HD>Tentacles of Hate From a Racist's Legacy</HD>
<DH>A new generation of bigots is heeding 'Turner Diaries'
writer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEONARD ZESKIND</AU>
<BD>Leonard Zeskind, a 1998 MacArthur Foundation fellow, is
completing a book on white nationalism for Farrar Straus Giroux.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Pierce's life as a neo-Nazi leader stymied the imagination.
Now cyberspace is flying with conjecture that his death in July from
cancer will end the threat from the National Alliance, the
organization he built.</LD>
<LD>   If only it were so.</LD>
<LD>   Pierce's 1978 race war novel, "The Turner Diaries," was wildly
successful. But despite that success, Pierce would be forgotten for
years at a time, until some new killer steeped in "Turner Diaries"
mythology pushed him back into the headlines.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Mathews, leader of a band of bank bandits who killed Denver
talk-radio host Alan Berg in 1984, modeled his cruelly real guerrilla
group, the Order, on the fictional one that Pierce had created in
print.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy McVeigh, of Oklahoma City bombing infamy, sold Pierce's
novel on the gun-show circuit and built his truck-bomb almost to
"Turner Diaries" specifications.</TE>
<TE>   In the public's mind, Pierce's personal influence over Aryan
warriors loomed so large that his National Alliance apparatus seemed
inconsequential. How could it stand and stay together after the
professor's death?</TE>
<TE>   Yet in the months and years ahead, we will ignore it at our
collective peril.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 25 years, white supremacists have changed uniforms
but have not altered their core ideas.</TE>
<TE>   The white majority, they believe, is biologically endowed with a
superior set of abilities and the rights to unquestioned ownership
and control in the land of their fathers. They believe they were
dispossessed, however, by an international Jewish conspiracy that
worked like Satan on God's people.</TE>
<TE>   Klansmen, neo-Nazis, so-called Christian patriots and white-power
skinheads became a single movement with interlocking directorates and
overlapping memberships. In this milieu, Pierce was a unique figure.
He jealously guarded the National Alliance from contamination by
other groups and at the same time created a movement-wide literature
and leadership. And while others foolishly marched in armed formation
before television cameras in the 1990s, Pierce's followers quietly
buried their weapons in containers he personally designed.</TE>
<TE>   In the years since the Oklahoma City bombing, the National
Alliance has placed its more seasoned apparatchiks in organizations
with larger, less politically defined constituencies and
cherry-picked the most disciplined skinheads out of the white-power
youth scene.</TE>
<TE>   The National Alliance's importance has been defined by its
influence over other like-minded organizations and not by the size of
its own apparatus. Its cadres have participated in the fight against
immigration, marched alongside others for the Confederate flag and
staged white-power music concerts and skinhead rallies.</TE>
<TE>   One former National Alliance cadre member is today a serious
contender for leadership of a unit of the Sons of Confederate
Veterans. Another heads up a Holocaust revisionist outfit
headquartered in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The National Alliance's future can be seen in the selection of
38-year-old Erich Gliebe as its next chairman. By keeping the
existing headquarters staff in place and elevating Gliebe from his
position as editor of a white-power music magazine, the National
Alliance maintains organizational stability and makes a bow toward
the source of many of its new recruits: the racist youth scene.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his predecessor, Gliebe is not a rocket scientist. In fact,
much of his stature among skinheads devolves from his past as a
professional boxer. But just as it was a mistake to let Pierce's
biography captivate our attention while we ignored the organization
he represented, we should not let Gliebe's personal history blind us
to the generation of new leaders now emerging.</TE>
<TE>   They are techno-savvy and well-educated. They will eschew Klan
robes, swastika armbands and camouflage fatigues. Having never lived
through World War II, they will not be chastened by the horrors of
Hitlerism. Having never experienced Jim Crow and the struggles
against it, they will be unburdened of its memory.</TE>
<TE>   Their only uniform will be their white skins. They will seek to
establish a white nation-state, with definable economic, political
and racial borders, out of the wreckage they hope to create of the
United States. And from Pierce they will have learned the arts and
sciences of Aryan revolution.</TE>

<LD>The right to unionize and bargain collectively with employers came
late to farm laborers in California, in 1975. In that same year, the
state formed its Agricultural Labor Relations Board, to protect the
interests of both sides.</LD>
<LD>   The reality of the ALRB has not always lived up to its promise.
For instance, despite the fact that workers have voted in 428
elections since 1975 to affiliate with the United Farm Workers union,
only 185 contracts have been signed between the UFW, which is the
chief agricultural union, and farmers.</LD>
<LD>   Growers can drag their feet for years without having to negotiate
a final contract with the UFW or any other labor union that might win
a representation election. It is tough for agricultural workers to
press their case because of the transience and seasonality of their
work.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, this sort of impasse is not unique to farm labor.
Workers trying to get their first contract in other industries fail
almost half the time. But farm workers in California were never
covered by federal labor law, and it is easier to change state law.</TE>
<TE>   Powerful unions like the Teamsters avoid contract arbitration
because they can get more by striking, or by threatening to do so.
But for a union with the built-in disadvantages of farm labor,
arbitration is a way out of deadlock.</TE>
<TE>   Growers argue that there are remedies in state law, that workers
are entitled to monetary damages if state investigators determine
growers have negotiated in bad faith. The problem with this
provision, as Genevieve A. Shiroma, chairwoman of the agriculture
board, recently spelled out in a letter to state Sen. Mike Machado
(D-Linden), is that "because the (1975) act itself contains neither
standards for imposing make-whole nor precise measures for
calculating it," litigation and delays are inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   That is where a bill working its way through the Legislature comes
in. SB 1736, sponsored by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San
Francisco), calls for binding arbitration to resolve deadlocked farm
labor negotiations. It is modeled on legislation enacted last year to
cover the horse-racing industry, which Gov. Gray Davis supported. It
has been approved in the Senate and is expected to clear the Assembly
this week.</TE>
<TE>   California agribusiness is an important source of campaign funds
for the governor in an election year. But a measure like this
equalizes power and avoids, for both sides, the prospect of costly,
acrimonious litigation. Davis should sign it.</TE>

<LD>We all know how vital public hospitals are, but it's been tempting,
in the seven years that Los Angeles officials have been predicting
their imminent fiscal collapse, to tune out the doomsayers.</LD>
<LD>   The taxpayer-funded network of public and private hospitals and
clinics that constitute California's health safety net is not always
a model of cost-efficiency. In addition, Gov. Gray Davis has been
reluctant to support Los Angeles County's new plan to cut costs by
closing 11 public health clinics and an Antelope Valley hospital;
that sad but probably unavoidable move would mean sizable layoffs of
the very union members who have so steadily supported Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Both the state and the county deserve some blame. But Tom Scully,
the Bush administration official who holds the Medicaid purse that
California must tap to keep its safety net intact, seems poised to
punish California and Los Angeles County for the wrong reasons.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, Scully sent auditors to investigate possible abuses in
the way Sacramento funded its Medicaid program, called Medi-Cal.
Afterward, Scully sent us an e-mail that said, "California has pulled
some serious financial tricks on us--that we only recently figured
out. I like their [Medi-Cal] program--and it does some very good
things--but they have to start playing by some set of rules someday."</TE>
<TE>   California health officials worry that Scully will claim they
violated federal laws by reallocating, rather than returning to
Washington, more than $150 million a year in Medicaid savings
generated by the state's notoriously low managed-care payment rates
to doctors. Since the mid-1980s, the state has funneled those savings
to hospitals that serve a higher-than-average share of penniless
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Some states have abused the Medicaid system by channeling extra
dollars to railroads, freeways or prisons. But California is not one
of them. The Medicaid diversion has been approved by presidential
administrations that include Scully's own.</TE>
<TE>   California does need to get going on painful clinic and hospital
consolidation. The state's mind-boggling deficit may require more:
curtailing the coverage it provides. The most draconian path would be
the one Utah has taken, all but cutting off Medicaid access to many
specialists. The milder alternative would be Oregon's, covering only
those treatments that it deems most medically necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The head of L.A. County's health department, Thomas Garthwaite,
recently described a plan to electronically track every patient. That
would save money by reducing duplicated care, ensuring that people at
county hospitals and clinics live in the county and evaluating which
treatments help patients the most. This is smart dollar-stretching.</TE>
<TE>   California's funneling of Medicaid savings back to hospitals
serving a higher-than-average share of indigents is not bad
government. It's the sort of innovation Scully has called for. The
state should be rewarded, not penalized, for it.</TE>

<LD>A proposal to counter secession by dividing Los Angeles into
semiautonomous boroughs didn't quite make it onto the November
ballot. But some of the innovative ideas that came out of the
last-minute effort are being put into action. Secession leaders
deserve some thanks, yet to spite the city they won't even take the
credit.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn last week directed all city department heads
to meet quarterly with Los Angeles' fledgling neighborhood councils
and promised to include the councils in planning next year's budget.
Councilman Tom LaBonge introduced a motion to establish seven
regional offices staffed by City Hall workers so that residents could
apply for permits and work with the city on local problems such as
street repairs and tree trimming without having to make the trek
downtown. And, more symbolically, the City Council voted to meet
regularly in each of the 15 council districts.</LD>
<LD>   All these ideas draw from borough proposals put forth this summer
by state Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg and City Council members Wendy
Greuel and Janice Hahn. Leaders of the San Fernando Valley and
Hollywood secession movements dismiss such efforts as a cynical ploy
to convince residents to vote against a breakup in November. No, it
would be a cynical City Hall that didn't try to address the sense of
alienation and neglect that fosters support for secession.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, last month's actions build on reforms undertaken over the
last three years in direct response to the secession threat. These
include setting up the neighborhood councils, establishing new
regional boards that give residents more say in local planning
decisions and creating a fifth City Council seat in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders rejected those reforms too, even as residents
throughout the city began mobilizing to make the city better, not
tear it apart. At last count, 39 neighborhood councils have
organized, twice the number projected for this stage.</TE>
<TE>   It suits the secession leaders' cause to be negative. They issued
a "Declaration of Independence" last weekend, officially launching
their campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "As our forefathers did before us," they wrote, "we have for
decades petitioned for redress of these inequities.... Our petitions
have not only gone unanswered, they have resulted in scorn and
ridicule from a tyrannical City Hall, led by a modern-day King
George, Mayor James Hahn."</TE>
<TE>   Someone should tell the fellows in the tri-cornered hats that,
rather than expressing Valley concerns seriously, this is the kind of
hyperbole that invites ridicule. It also ignores the quiet revolution
that is underway.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I have no idea about Robert Samuelson's age or credentials, but I
would guess that he is under 50 ("Don't Relax Just Yet, Grandpa,"
Commentary, July 31). The tone of his commentary implies that all of
us over 50 are somehow freeloading if we retire in our so-called
golden years. I find that attitude disrespectful and disgraceful to a
generation that has had to care not only for itself but also for the
generations before and after it as well. It implies that somehow we
have not worked enough and now want the government to take care of us
in our retirement years.</LD>
<LD>   He calls us "economic dropouts" because we are a more fit
generation that, he claims, should work longer. The fact that we are
fit doesn't mean we have to continue working in the "grind." We have
earned the right to enjoy some of the fruits of our labor while we
are still fit enough to enjoy them. Samuelson ignores the fact that
we contributed to our own retirement with Social Security and
Medicare. Those benefits are not given to us.</LD>
<TE>   I am 64 years old. I have had a very happy, healthy and productive
life, but it has not always been easy. I am faced with working at
least another 10 years before I can even consider retirement. I'm
healthy and love my work, but that does not mean I wouldn't rather be
enjoying my grandchildren and pursuing other interests. And if more
baby boomers and elder Americans stay in the work force, that
eliminates jobs for the younger generation. What will the outcry
against older Americans be then? I can only guess!</TE>
<TE>   Juliette Becker</TE>
<TE>   Newport Coast</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Samuelson must be living on another planet, most likely in another
galaxy far, far away: "Retirement shouldn't have to be a sudden shift
from full-time work to full-time leisure. People can develop second
careers, take part-time jobs or become consultants to their former
employers." You wanna bet? My personal qualifications include a
reasonably successful career, an MBA and a Phi Beta Kappa key. But so
far, no takers. Numerous former colleagues similarly "want work's

it either. If Samuelson cares to start a job placement agency for
highly qualified, highly motivated seniors, I will personally
guarantee him a substantial and eager clientele.</TE>

<LD>John Balzar (Commentary, July 31) points to some of California's
problems. But one should not be overly nostalgic for the past. To be
sure, we had some great, far-sighted leaders, such as California
Govs. Hiram Johnson, Earl Warren and Pat Brown. But California's
urban and fiscal problems of today are legacies of an earlier,
lobbyist-dominated leadership that was apathetic to our inevitable
population explosion and that failed to deal with predictable
deficiencies, such as transportation, education and other social
ills. But Balzar is right to have hope in our destiny.</LD>

<LD>Great juxtaposition in your July 31 edition. On the front page you
have "Bush Signs Strict Business Reform Law," with a picture of
George W. &amp; Co. celebrating the signing of corporate responsibility
legislation. (We'll get 'em next time!) Then, on Page A15, you have
"Torricelli Is 'Severely Admonished' " for, in actuality, accepting
bribes from a man (David Chang) convicted of illegally contributing
to Sen. Robert Torricelli's (D-N.J.) campaign. The only reason
Torricelli was cleared by the U.S. attorney's office is because Chang
"could not be trusted."</LD>
<LD>   I hope Torricelli doesn't lose too much sleep agonizing over "how
[he] could have allowed such lapses of judgment." If he can follow
that line with "at no time did I accept any gifts," then I'm sure he
doesn't have too much trouble sleeping at night. At least he will
make amends for his transgression; he will pay Chang back for the
big-screen TV. With interest!</LD>
<TE>   Hey, next time someone robs a convenience store, maybe we should
make that person pay back the store, with interest. Charge them, say,
19%. That will teach them. I am only curious about the mechanics of
the deal. Did Torricelli skate because he is a senator, and senators
take care of each other? Or is it because his party (Democrat) used
its control to keep a lid on the damage, since it controls the Senate
by a slim margin and can't afford to risk his seat and lose control
of the Senate to the Republicans?</TE>
<TE>   The fix is in, folks. Is there any way for a person with an IQ
above room temperature to be anything but cynical when it comes to
our elected officials? We expect this group to clean up the corporate
boardrooms--and they can't clean up their own house.</TE>
<TE>   Robert McKean</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli apparently still does not believe he received gifts but
has apologized to the full Senate for his "lapses of judgment" in
taking them and has agreed to pay the donor the fair market value of
these imaginary but unethical gifts. The last time I saw this level
of contrition I was 6 years old and my mother promptly soaped my
mouth out. Can we at least look forward to the Senate Ethics
Committee following suit?</TE>

<LD>Re "America's Got an Image Problem, Panel Warns," July. 31: According
to a report released by the Council on Foreign Relations, the U.S. is
losing badly in the court of world opinion and needs to revolutionize
the way it communicates its policies and ideas. Even though, as
President Bush assures us, we are good people and a "force for good
around the world," we are often seen as "arrogant, self-indulgent,
hypocritical, inattentive.... " Conclusion: We haven't explained
ourselves well enough. We need the newly established Office of Global
Communications, aimed at improving the nation's image abroad.</LD>
<LD>   Good heavens! Did the panel ever consider the possibility that we
have a problem not of image but of substance, that in too many ways
we are arrogant, self-indulgent, hypocritical and inattentive, and
thus sometimes world opinion is all too justified?</LD>
<LD>   Stanley R. Moore</LD>
<TE>   Claremont</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder that there's anti-U.S. sentiment throughout the
planet? Unilateral U.S. policies since Bush took office have
alienated friends, allies and much of the American public.</TE>
<TE>   How can our country's arrogant attitude toward the very real
crisis of global warming, with its rejection of the Kyoto agreement,
win the respect of our neighbors? When we burn 25% of the world's
fossil fuels with 4% of the population, how can we credibly argue
against the pillaging of the rain forests? Why is the "personal
freedom" of driving bloated SUVs more politically viable than
environmental responsibility? How can we earn the respect of the Arab
world when our bias in favor of Israel ignores the will of the U.N.
and its call for the Israelis to leave the occupied territories? How
can we earn the respect of the rest of the world when our foreign aid
per capita is much lower than that of many less wealthy nations? On
countless other issues, the U.S. has chosen to enforce its "we know
best" policy because we have the economic and military might to do
so. It's time for Bush to realize that arrogance has a price and that
no amount of public relations can erase the real damage our attitude
is doing to the global environmental and political landscape.</TE>

<LD>I don't think state Controller Kathleen Connell is letting the
$75,000 she received from Intuit influence her decision on e-filing
tax returns, and I don't think the public should be able to
conveniently file its tax returns online without paying a private
firm for the privilege ("Free Tax E-Filing System Defeated," Aug. 1).</LD>
<LD>   While we're at it, I think we should stop using public funds for
libraries because they compete with bookstores; public funds
shouldn't be used to field high school or college football teams
because they draw fans away from pro sports; and we should close
publicly funded hospitals since they compete with private ones. Wait
a second, in L.A. we are already doing that last one! How much longer
before we throw the rascals out of government?</LD>

<LD>Re "Prison Guards' Pact Criticized by State Auditor," July 31: I
would like Inspector General Steve White to explain how he is saving
money by retiring the current highly paid guards at 90% of their
salary and hiring new guards at entry-level pay. It seems like he
would end up paying double: once for the retired guard and once for
the new guard.</LD>

<LD>Great. Our government arrests two of the financial geniuses who

There will be much boasting, but the final results will be no more
effective than from the loophole-filled campaign finance reform act.
The public wanted powerful measures taken in both cases as election
scandals and wholesale business corruption were revealed. The public
got the short end of the stick, but corporate executives got reform
measures they could tolerate in return for the millions of campaign
dollars they contribute.</TE>

<LD>Norah Vincent makes an important point in her Aug. 1 commentary.
She's right to point out that the "God" most people worship in our
culture is not the God of Scripture this country was founded on but a
shallow, capricious deity who is more interested in making us feel
good than maturing us into a people with character and compassion.</LD>
<LD>   What isn't so clearly seen, however, is our nagging habit of
failing to take responsibility for our own actions. Instead of
cursing or praising God for everything good or bad that happens, we
need to look around and own up to the fact that people do things.
People make choices; choices have consequences. What we need, then,
is to seek to become people of godly virtue who make the right
choices. Choices of love and justice, not self-centered greed.</LD>

<LD>The comments by Kern County Sheriff Carl Sparks after his deputies

most succinct and satisfying words spoken by a public official I have

<LD>   I defy anyone to tell me that they didn't smile and feel great
satisfaction when the sheriff said: "We don't have to rehabilitate

<HD>El Toro Ready for a Student Invasion</HD>
<DH>Education: After a $1.4-million renovation, classes at Cal
State Fullerton's new satellite campus begin Aug. 26.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Until the Marines pulled out, the aging but graceful building off
Desert Storm Way served as the headquarters for an elite squadron of
pilots. Now, the building at the mothballed El Toro Marine base is on
the verge of rebirth.</LD>
<LD>   By the end of the month, Cal State Fullerton students will enroll
in criminal justice, nursing, public administration, adolescent
behavior and teacher-credential classes at the closed base.</LD>
<LD>   The state university has signed a 10-year lease to use the
46,000-square-foot military leftover as a satellite campus, aimed at
South County students who otherwise would have to drive across the
county to reach the Fullerton campus. Nearly one-fifth of the 30,000
students enrolled at Cal State Fullerton live in the southern part of
the county.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to go where the students are," said George Giacumakis,
director of the new El Toro campus. "So we thought it was time for us
to spread out a little bit in that region. We're running out of space
here."</TE>
<TE>   Classes begin Aug. 26.</TE>
<TE>   The number of students attending class at the old Marine base is
expected to reach 2,500 for the fall semester--nearly double the
enrollment of the college's previous satellite campus in Mission
Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   The college spent more than $1.4 million renovating the two-story
Spanish-style building that once housed the Wing Command
Headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The building will have 22 classrooms and 48 offices, as well as a
cafe and a student bookstore. With the base largely unused, parking
will not be a problem. There will be 550 marked spaces when class
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Plans to move and expand the South County campus to El Toro began
in 1993 after it was announced the base would close. The lease was
signed last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Shuttles will transport students who are enrolled in upper-level
and graduate programs between the Fullerton and El Toro campuses,
university officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that the El Toro campus is closer to the main campus, we
expect students to mix and match courses between the main campus and
El Toro, or enroll exclusively at El Toro," said Sylvia Alva,
assistant vice president for academic programs in Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   The El Toro campus offers complete degree programs, especially in
education-related disciplines.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were our most popular courses at the main campus, so we
want to expand them to El Toro," Alva said. "There's a strong demand
in California to prepare more teachers and so there's more course
work in the teacher-credential area."</TE>
<TE>   Marketing brochures about the El Toro campus have been sent to Cal
State Fullerton students since April.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an exciting venture for the campus. This is a project that
has been in development for a long time and it's nice to see that
it's all coming together," Alva said. "It's like having dual
citizenship; you can move in and out of the two campuses as needed
and it's exciting for the students in terms of the potential."</TE>
<TE>   The history of the base will not be completely lost on students.</TE>
<TE>   Giacumakis, a history teacher, plans to collect information and
memorabilia about the old air base and incorporate it into a
community history class.</TE>

<HD>Patrons Rescue Coffeehouse</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: The cafe, a favorite spot for activists and others,
becomes a cause for its socially minded customers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since it opened two years ago, the Cafe on A Street in downtown
Oxnard has gained a reputation for dispensing social awareness along
with double espressos.</LD>
<LD>   On any given day, local artists can be found mounting bold new
exhibits, student activists conversing about social justice,
farm-worker advocates planning demonstrations and young hip-hop
artists rapping about cultura.</LD>
<LD>   But youthful idealism doesn't pay the bills. So a couple of months
ago, owners Armando Vazquez and Deborah DeVries announced they were
shutting down the coffee shop.</LD>
<TE>   Then something unexpected happened. The cafe's loyal and socially
minded customers rallied to save the place they helped transform into
a community cultural center. Several people offered to work for free.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the cafe reopened two weeks ago. With the help of
volunteers, operating costs have been reduced by more than half,
DeVries said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to help the community," said artist and part-time student
Virginia Sanchez, 27, who is one of two volunteer managers most
committed to the cafe, working five days a week. "I want to make sure
students and the [people] can come in here."</TE>
<TE>   The cafe's volunteers range from students and teachers to
housewives and artists. The coffee shop keeps regular hours in the
morning but follows a more flexible schedule in the evenings and on
weekends, when community groups who frequent the cafe are in charge
of serving drinks.</TE>
<TE>   "I come because of the coffee and the atmosphere," customer
Cuauhtemoc Magana said during the cafe's recent Sunday menudo
breakfast. A carpenter by trade and an aspiring artist at heart, he
enjoys the artwork that hangs on the walls, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Passing out copies of an amnesty plan he wrote and sent to
President Bush and congressional leaders, the soft-spoken Magana said
he is glad the coffee shop is back because the people he meets there
inspire him to "get involved."</TE>
<TE>   A recent schedule of cafe events illustrates what he means. A
women's issues forum met on Saturday, a community breakfast on
Sunday, a screening of a Chicano history documentary on Monday, a
youth hip-hop show and auditions for a local Spanish-language theater
company on Wednesday, a meeting of the Latin American Assn. of Child
Care Providers on Thursday and a late-night Latino comedy showcase on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to prompt social and progressive dialogue, issues of
concern to the community," Vazquez said. "We open it up to anyone
with these goals in mind. And if we sell a cup of coffee in the
process, then that's OK too."</TE>
<TE>   Leaning back in one of the cafe's mismatched chairs, Vazquez said
he and DeVries quickly envisioned such a place when they met 12 years
ago at a bilingual educators' conference in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Vazquez lives in Ventura with his wife and two teenage children.
When he isn't at the cafe, he teaches various subjects, including
English at Santa Clara High School, business courses at a UC Santa
Barbara extension center, children's art for the county and job
skills for women's drug and alcohol recovery centers.</TE>
<TE>   DeVries lives in Malibu and teaches English, creative writing,
art, English as a second language, general equivalency diploma
courses and job skills for Oxnard College, Ventura College, women's
drug and alcohol recovery centers and the city of Oxnard. Both
educators describe themselves as social activists fed up with how
"most people just talk about things and they don't have any
solutions," DeVries said.</TE>
<TE>   They opened the coffee shop in 1999 because they needed a neutral
meeting place to teach GED classes to youths in rival Oxnard gangs.
The coffee bar also gave them an instant job-skills training site for
the youths, a few of whom have moved on to Oxnard College, DeVries
said.</TE>
<TE>   They eventually named the art gallery after Rudy F. Acuna, a
longtime professor of Chicano studies at Cal State Northridge. They
also painted the walls bright pink, stocked hundreds of books to loan
out, then invited local artists and started pouring coffee.</TE>
<TE>   What happened next was beyond their expectations, DeVries said.
The discussions people were having at the coffee shop renewed the
locals' faith in culture as a source of strength and knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "The cafe is the realization of a dream," DeVries said.</TE>
<TE>   "So many people who walk in get the hope that you can be creative
and have a place to do what we did in the '60s. We can change the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Some nights, comics and deejays use the coffee shop's stage to
address racism. Farm workers hold potlucks to map out strategies to
increase their rights. Gang members learn job skills. Students hold
study groups.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great place to gather," said West Hills artist Cyndi
Hidalgo-Knies, whose paintings are on display.</TE>
<TE>   Vazquez said the coffee shop is purposely located in the ombligo,
or bellybutton, of the city that officials have touted as the center
of downtown revitalization.</TE>
<TE>   With its blackboards announcing coffee and menudo overshadowed by
giant hand-painted banners of beret-wearing Chicano activists with
fists of protest high in the air, the coffee shop stands out on the
block that is also home to the Oxnard Police Department and Downtown
Oxnard Merchants Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The cafe is moving toward a more permanent operating structure,
with a percentage of profits going toward the volunteers and the rest
being used for rent and maintenance costs, Vazquez said.</TE>
<TE>   Not too much coffee is being sold yet, he said. But for now the
plan is clear.</TE>
<TE>   "The doors will stay open," Vazquez said.</TE>

<HD>Funding Sought to Credential Viet Teachers for State
Schools</HD>
<DH>Education: Grant would help recruit, integrate qualified
instructors into districts where they are underrepresented.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Helen Le makes a decent wage as a health-care specialist, but the
former math and science teacher longs to teach again.</LD>
<LD>   "I love teaching--to see the look of marvel on a child's face once
they've learned, understood and discovered something new," said Le,
43, of Garden Grove. She taught high school for 10 years in her
homeland of Vietnam, but because of credentialing problems has not
continued her profession here.</LD>
<LD>   But the chance to teach again may come for Le and scores of other
highly qualified Vietnamese American teacher candidates, whom
California educators hope to recruit and integrate into schools.</LD>
<TE>   To help bring that about, educators--led by Cal State Long
Beach--have applied for a five-year, $1.25-million federal grant to
get Vietnamese American teachers credentialed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a tremendous shortage of teachers who mirror the
ethnicities of the student population in certain school districts in
the state," said Sandra Frank, a state Department of Education
consultant involved with minority recruiting. In Orange County, that
shortage is most critical in the Westminster and Garden Grove
districts, which are largely Vietnamese.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, which earmarks $250,000 each year for the Vietnamese
American Teacher Preparation Project, would help as many as 80
teachers obtain their credentials through training and mentoring from
schools and universities. The Asian and Asian American studies
department and Center for Language Minority Education and Research at
Cal State Long Beach are the leading agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The funding would allow educators to tap a pool of teacher
candidates with qualifications for addressing the needs of Vietnamese
American students.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt that Vietnamese American teachers are greatly
underrepresented in California, especially compared to the number of
Vietnamese American students in schools," said Wayne Johnson,
president of the California Teachers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said about 80% of teachers in California are white.
"There's a real social and education need for Vietnamese American
teachers, and we need to do more recruiting for these teachers."</TE>
<TE>   Previous grants have been used to recruit members of other ethnic
minority groups--including Latinos and African Americans--as
teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "Bilingual Vietnamese teacher candidates would bring valuable
resources to the teaching profession" because they share the cultural
and linguistic background as many of the students enrolled in Orange
County schools, said Associate Dean L.Y. "Mickey" Hollis of Cal State
Fullerton's School of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Many teacher candidates are Southern California working
professionals who hold a bachelor's, master's or doctoral degree in
computer science, engineering or literature. They are active in the
Vietnamese American community, acting as community liaisons,
interpreters and volunteer support staff at schools. Some have
already worked as bilingual teachers' aides.</TE>
<TE>   Le has done just that, volunteering to teach 16 to 20 hours a week
at private schools and Vietnamese cultural centers just to be close
to students.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can teach full time, that's what I really want to do," she
said. "I see so many students here who can use my help."</TE>
<TE>   Like Le, many other former teachers and scholars tend to be in
their 40s and 50s. They have not been able to return to their
professions because they've lacked support when they've run into
unfamiliar rules and regulations, said KimOanh Nguyen-Lam, a
professional development specialist at the Cal State Long Beach
Center for Language Minority Education and Research.</TE>
<TE>   The Vietnamese American Teacher Preparation Project would evaluate
the degrees and credentials each candidate has earned in Vietnam or
the United States. Qualified applicants would get assistance with
enrollment in state-approved credential programs with flexible course
schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Stipends for tuition and materials would be provided through a
collaborative effort of the Assn. of Vietnamese Language and Culture
Schools of Southern California and six California State universities,
including Cal State Fullerton. Together, they will also help recruit,
place and support the teacher candidates.</TE>

<HD>New Leader Builds on Experience</HD>
<DH>Nonprofit: Many Mansions executive director hopes to
involve local residents in group that provides low-cost dwellings to
the needy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a time when Rick Schroeder paid little attention to
affordable housing needs in cities such as Thousand Oaks or Simi
Valley. It's not that he didn't care. But like plenty of others, he
figured low-cost housing was provided by someone else in some other
community.</LD>
<LD>   That isn't true anymore.</LD>
<LD>   As the new executive director of Thousand Oaks-based Many
Mansions, Schroeder spends his working hours thinking of nothing but
ways to meet Ventura County's growing demand for affordable housing,
especially in the affluent east county, where rents are high and
vacancies nearly nonexistent.</LD>
<TE>   Although he has been on the job for about a month, the 41-year-old
father of two is already very familiar with the organization, thanks
to his years as a volunteer and board president with the nonprofit
group. Many Mansions provides housing and social service programs to
the poor, developmentally disabled and mentally ill in Thousand Oaks
and Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   And Schroeder comes with a laundry list of goals. Chief among them
is to build support for the organization with local residents, who he
believes will offer their time, money and other resources once they
understand the area's low-cost housing crunch.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to reach the typical person who was like me, the person
who really doesn't give much thought to where people with low incomes
are supposed to live," said Schroeder, a Wisconsin native and UCLA
law school graduate who settled in Oak Park 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, my attitude was like that of a lot of people: I lived in
a very nice area with very nice homes, and affordable housing was
something that other communities had," he said. "The more we are out
there [and] the more people become aware of Many Mansions and the
work we do, the more I think they will be willing to support our
mission."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder points to his own path to Many Mansions as evidence.</TE>
<TE>   He began volunteering with the group in 1995, helping a family pay
its rent through the group's Adopt-A-Family program.</TE>
<TE>   By then he was living in Oak Park and had opened a law office in
Agoura Hills, concentrating on business, bankruptcy and real estate
litigation. He had met people involved with children with special
needs after learning in 1994 that his daughter, Sarah, was autistic.</TE>
<TE>   It was someone in that circle who introduced him to Many Mansions,
and before Schroeder knew it, he was providing free legal help to the
agency's clients and shifting much of his practice to affordable
housing issues.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder joined the board of directors in 1996 and served as
president from 1999 through 2001. When the executive director's post
came open earlier this year, he decided he might as well try jumping
in with both feet. He beat out more than 40 applicants for the post.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor Frank Schillo, who was responsible in
1979 for gathering the civic leaders who launched Many Mansions, is
no longer on the board of directors and didn't take part in the
hiring process.</TE>
<TE>   But he knows about Schroeder's work and believes he was an
excellent choice.</TE>
<TE>   "He's already proven he's really interested in the organization;
he served on the board and gave of his time, and that counts for a
lot with me," Schillo said. "I'm impressed by his background and his
willingness to serve. He's truly giving back to the community."</TE>
<TE>   That is what Many Mansions has been all about for more than 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   Besides providing about 350 apartments to low-income residents in
the eastern part of Ventura County, the group provides housing
education, homeownership counseling, summer camp for children,
after-school programs and a range of health and social service
programs.</TE>
<TE>   With a $2-million annual budget and 35 employees, Many Mansions
owns and manages seven housing projects and has two others at various
stages of development.</TE>
<TE>   The group also has waiting lists for some projects that stretch
two years. And it's trying to provide affordable housing at a time
when the economy is sputtering, wages are stagnant and the rental
market is increasingly tight and high-priced. The average rent for a
two-bedroom apartment in Thousand Oaks is $1,367, well out of the
reach of low-income residents. For Schroeder, that reality was driven
home in January when he attended a dedication ceremony for Esseff
Village in Thousand Oaks, a complex of studio apartments for the
disabled, seniors and small families.</TE>
<TE>   Speakers talked about how much the housing meant to them. They
were able to live on their own and had finally found a community to
call their own.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so moved at that dedication that I thought this is what I
want to do," Schroeder said. "I just wanted to be more deeply
involved in this process. Here as executive director, this is exactly
what I can do."</TE>

<HD>Mothers Push Fight Against Gun Violence</HD>
<DH>Crime: Three years after Valley Jewish center shootings,
the Million Mom March presses on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every time Carol Ann Taylor speaks to community groups,
congregations, lawmakers or reporters about gun violence, she hopes
and prays her words may spare some other mother the pain of burying
her child.</LD>
<LD>   Taylor recounts in agonizing detail to all who will listen how her
17-year-old son, Willie Browning Brooks IV, was fatally shot in the
back while walking a date home in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   "I am a mother who is here to tell you that you don't want to live
this life I'm living," she said. "Let's do something before it
happens to you."</LD>
<TE>   The Inglewood woman is a voice in a growing chorus of concerned
people, primarily mothers, in a nationwide grass-roots effort known
as the Million Mom March. The movement grew out of a shooting rampage
that occurred three years ago this week in the west San Fernando
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 10, 1999, an avowed white supremacist seriously injured
three children, a camp counselor and a secretary at the North Valley
Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills and then fatally shot a
Filipino letter carrier in Chatsworth.</TE>
<TE>   In response to a word-of-mouth call by New Jersey mother Donna
Dees-Thomases, about 750,000 people gathered on Mother's Day 2000 on
the National Mall in Washington to demonstrate their support for
sensible gun laws. Since then, they have mobilized like-minded people
in their hometowns in the war against gun violence.</TE>
<TE>   On the front lines of this fledgling movement are inner-city and
suburban moms who have joined forces for the sake of their children.
Over coffee and cookies in more than 100 chapters around the country,
they hatch plans to lobby lawmakers, raise money and persuade others
to join them.</TE>
<TE>   In the San Fernando Valley, Loren Lieb of Northridge and Donna
Finkelstein of Chatsworth, whose children were seriously wounded in
the attack at the Jewish center, are active in the 75-member local
chapter.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the shooting, my approach to gun control was, 'Yes, it's a
problem, but what can I do about it? I live in a safe community.'
Then I found out that was very false thinking," Lieb said. "The only
way to change things was to become involved--or I could just sit back
and let it happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Finkelstein discovered how steeped in the gun culture young people
are when she returned to her job as a high school guidance counselor
after the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the kids were asking me, 'What type of gun did he use?'
and 'What kind of bullets were they?' I was stopped dead in my
tracks," she said. "They are completely familiar with guns. From that
day forward, I knew that I had to do something."</TE>
<TE>   As president of the Valley chapter, Virginia Classick says it's
her job to keep members, especially those who have not been directly
affected by gun violence, committed to what she considers a lifelong
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Social movements are like relationships: They are a lot easier to
start than to maintain," she said. "It takes a great deal of energy
to keep moving forward, but we see ourselves as active participants
in a process of social change."</TE>
<TE>   This summer, members from 25 California chapters are lobbying Gov.
Gray Davis to sign legislation that would abolish the immunity from
liability that firearms manufacturers have under state law. The
proposal was prompted by a state Supreme Court ruling last August
that held that gun makers cannot be held responsible for crimes in
which their products are used.</TE>
<TE>   Chapters in Michigan have organized strategy sessions to work for
the defeat in Tuesday's primary election of incumbent U.S. Rep. John
D. Dingell, a Democrat, who they say has a dismal record on gun
violence prevention. The group favors the other Democratic incumbent,
Rep. Lynn Rivers, a vocal critic of the gun lobby. (The two Democrats
must face each other in the primary because their representative
areas were merged as a result of redistricting.)</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, the Million Mom March leadership brokered a
deal in October to merge with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun
Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, founded by
Sarah and James S. Brady, the former White House press secretary who
was wounded in the attempted assassination of President Reagan in
1981.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a large, grass-roots network, and Brady has excellent
staffing and expertise in federal legislation," said Mary Leigh Blek,
national director of the Million Mom March. "It seemed like a
marriage made in heaven."</TE>
<TE>   Says Brady Campaign spokeswoman Nancy Hwa: "The moms are an early
warning system. They let us know when something is happening in their
communities."</TE>
<TE>   Patterned to some extent after Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the
Million Mom March hopes to have the same effect on gun violence that
MADD has had on drunk driving and underage drinking.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, it's not cool to keep feeding people drinks until they
fall off the bar stool or say, 'How did I get home last night from
the bar?' People are conscious of their behavior because of laws and
penalties [MADD] pushed for," said Shikha Hamilton, president of the
Million Mom March Detroit chapter. "It took them 22 years to change
the culture of Americans. This is not a sprint; this is a marathon."</TE>
<TE>   MADD National President Wendy J. Hamilton advises the Million Mom
March to stay focused on its mission and prepare to stay in for the
long haul.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though our organization has worked hard for more than 20
years, the problem has not gone away. You have to keep at it," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Million Mom March is not without critics, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Million Mom March has lost credibility with women," said Kelly
Whitley, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Assn. "When they were
formed, they were formed on the premise of promoting gun safety. The
NRA promotes gun safety. We all agree on that. But in reality, the
Million Mom March leadership misled and lost members when they
embarked on a political agenda of gun bans and stringent gun-control
measures that had nothing to do with safety."</TE>
<TE>   Blek is not deterred. "The gun lobby has been at this for 100
years; we are only three years out," she said. "But what we have
accomplished in three years is unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   As the organization grows, Blek expects that it will face
continued challenges from the gun lobby, increased public scrutiny
and pressure to improve its organizational structure. The problems,
she said, will be addressed at national conventions, regional
workshops and chapter meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Blek said there will be a concerted effort to push for racial and
economic diversity within the movement.</TE>
<TE>   The organization faced early criticism from inner-city African
American and Latino mothers who said their white suburban
counterparts did not get involved in gun violence prevention until
weapons were turned on their children in predominantly white
enclaves.</TE>
<TE>   "It will take all of us working together to end gun violence,"
Blek said. "We encourage moms to be inclusive and to keep the
movement diverse because that is our strength."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, the Inglewood mother, exemplifies that principle every
time she meets with other moms in the mostly white West Los Angeles
chapter.</TE>
<TE>   "We must begin to look at each child like he or she belongs to
us--no matter what color, what geographic area or economic
background," she said. "We must respond, because, if we don't save
our children, who will?"</TE>

<HD>Study Seeks Source of Newport Bay Pollution</HD>
<DH>Environment: Student researchers are analyzing data to see
if sewage dumped from boat holding tanks is contaminating the water
and causing closures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newport Beach has begun a study to determine whether the frequent
closures of harbor beaches are caused in part by boaters dumping
sewage from their holding tanks.</LD>
<LD>   Students led by Stanley Grant, professor of environmental
engineering at UC Irvine, spent several weeks sampling the water at
six spots where the Orange County Health Care Agency routinely posts
warnings about pollution. The researchers are now analyzing the
results.</LD>
<LD>   The study is one step the city is taking to comply with a 1996
federal consent decree requiring cleanup of the bay--parts of which
have been off-limits to swimmers for decades. The decree requires
that it be clean enough for swimming by 2013 and for
shellfish-harvesting by 2019.</LD>
<TE>   The rules were written after a suit against the federal
Environmental Protection Agency brought by Defend the Bay, a Newport
Beach-based environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got these [10,000] boats in [the harbor] and ... the
potential is there to dump into the bay," said Tony Melum, manager of
harbor resources.</TE>
<TE>   Boaters, Melum said, "have been fingered in the past, but it's
never been nailed down." He hopes the UCI study will finally
determine whether boaters are to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a boater," Melum said. "And there's absolutely no way we'd
flush our heads in the bay. But there's always been this perception
that [boaters are] contributing to the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Caustin, founder of Defend the Bay, believes the study falls
short of a real answer to the question. He suspects the pollution is
the result of numerous factors, including urban runoff and
pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   Caustin said that at Avalon Harbor on Catalina Island, the harbor
patrol places a dye tablet in the holding tanks of all incoming
boats. If someone empties their tank into the harbor, the fluorescent
dye leaves a telltale sign.</TE>
<TE>   But Dave Kiff, Newport Beach's assistant city manager, said the
size of Newport Bay make such a program difficult there.</TE>
<TE>   The city lacks the resources for 24-hour patrols to look for the
dye in the 154-square-mile bay.</TE>

<HD>Developer to Pay Ventura to Offset Traffic</HD>
<DH>RiverPark: City is expected to approve $4.6-million
settlement for improvements to handle extra vehicles from Oxnard
project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Developers of the massive RiverPark project in Oxnard have agreed to
pay the city of Ventura $4.6 million for roadway improvements to help
offset increased traffic from the development.</LD>
<LD>   The Ventura City Council is expected to approve the agreement at
its meeting tonight, ending a dispute that focused on the adequacy of
the development's draft environmental impact report.</LD>
<LD>   "The developer has been cooperative," City Atty. Robert G. Boehm
said last week, adding that Ventura and RiverPark officials have
"settled their differences."</LD>
<TE>   A primary concern among city officials was over the developer's
traffic study of the $750-million project, which will include 2,800
homes, a vintage town square, a hotel and convention center, three
schools and sports fields.</TE>
<TE>   The study indicated that only the intersection of Johnson and
North Bank drives in Ventura would be significantly affected by the
nearly 79,000 daily vehicle trips expected to be generated by the
project.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the city of Ventura commissioned an independent
traffic study, which identified 14 roadway intersections that would
be affected. The adjacent project site is located on the east side of
the Santa Clara River.</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard Planning Commission recently approved the development,
and the City Council is expected to take up the issue as early as
this month. The developer hopes to break ground before the end of the
year, with the first phase of the residential project set to open by
early 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The opening is set to coincide with the completion of a new
interchange of the Ventura Freeway at Pacific Coast Highway and the
widening of the Santa Clara River bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations between Ventura and RiverPark developers over
additional traffic mitigation measures began in earnest two months
ago. But Ventura officials made their concerns known in January when
they submitted comments based on the developer's traffic study.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just across the river; it's very much connected to the
city," Boehm said of the project, which would be the largest
mixed-use development in county history. "Ventura had to protect its
interests."</TE>
<TE>   Among the needed improvements cited in Ventura's traffic report
were an extension of Olivas Park and North Bank drives, and the
widening of Johnson Drive and Telephone and Mills roads. Plans also
call for widening the northbound offramp of the Ventura Freeway at
Telephone Road and moving the southbound onramp at Johnson Drive to
line up with the new Olivas Park Drive extension.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't dispute the amount of traffic," Ventura senior planner
Paul Calderwood said of the RiverPark project. "What we didn't agree
on is where the traffic was going after [motorists] left the
project."</TE>
<TE>   The settlement agreement also calls for the developer to pay up to
$50,000 for a study of a new Santa Clara River crossing, which could
serve as an alternate route for traffic. The developer will assess a
fee of all residential and commercial developments to help pay for
the traffic improvements.</TE>

<HD>John Cocke, 77; Influential Computer Science Pioneer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Cocke, a revered computer scientist who helped transform
software and microprocessors, has died. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Cocke, who held more than a dozen patents, died July 16 in a
Valhalla, N.Y., hospital after a series of strokes.</LD>
<LD>   A leading IBM designer for 37 years, Cocke was considered the
father of Reduced Instruction Set Computer, or RISC, technology--an
invention that led to faster computation and a key to most computers
in use today.</LD>
<TE>   In 1987, he received the Turing Award, the highest honor for
technical contributions in computing, from the Assn. for Computing
Machinery. The award is often considered the Nobel Prize of the
computer science field.</TE>
<TE>   He was cited for significant contributions in three areas: RISC,
the design and theory of compilers and the architecture of large
systems. He earned a National Medal of Technology in 1991 and a
National Medal of Science in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   RISC, invented by Cocke and a small group of collaborators in the
mid-1970s at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown
Heights, N.Y., is a "back-to-basics" computer architecture that
simplifies computer instructions and reduces operation cycles. It is
used in the microprocessor of many personal computers as well as
large industrial computing systems.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Charlotte, N.C., Cocke earned a bachelor's degree in
mechanical engineering and a doctorate in mathematics at Duke
University, where his father served on the board of trustees. Later,
Cocke also served on the board.</TE>
<TE>   He studied engineering and math, he once said, "because at the
time I came into the field, there were no such things as computer
science courses to take."</TE>
<TE>   Known for a gifted, inventive mind and also for his
eccentricities, Cocke was revered for his brainstorming sessions as
well as rapid-fire conversations in hallways and bars across the
country. He chose downhill skiing as his sport "because I'm a great
believer in having gravity on my side."</TE>
<TE>   Cocke's office was characteristically buried in paper along with
cigarette butts, and the goal-directed scientist had to be reminded
to deposit his paychecks. A janitor once fished $4,000 worth of stock
certificates out of the absent-minded albeit brilliant Cocke's
wastebasket.</TE>
<TE>   Cocke worked as an engineer for a few years before joining IBM in
1956 where he remained until his retirement in 1992, earning numerous
company awards including the designation as research fellow in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Cocke married Anne Holloway in 1989 when he was in his mid-60s. He
is survived by his wife.</TE>

<HD>Helen Robinson, 91; Family Owned Private Hawaiian Island</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Helen Matthew Robinson, 91, owner of Niihau Island and Ranch--home to
the last all-Hawaiian community--died Wednesday in Makaweli, Hawaii.
The cause of death was not given.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Berkeley, the matriarch was married to Lester Robinson
from 1937 until his death in 1969. The Robinson family purchased the
private island and ranch from the Hawaiian monarchy in 1864, and
moved there from New Zealand.</LD>
<LD>   The family founded Gay &amp; Robinson Sugar Co., one of the few
companies still in operation that dates from an era in which sugar
production, rather than tourism, was Hawaii's dominant industry.</LD>
<TE>   Helen Robinson was the last family member of her generation.
Niihau Island, now owned by her sons Keith and Bruce, has about 200
residents.</TE>

<HD>Msgr. James Ryan, 89; Missionary Friar, Bishop in Brazil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Msgr. James M. Ryan, 89, a Roman Catholic missionary friar who served
more than 25 years as bishop of a diocese in Brazil, died of cancer
July 12 in Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   As bishop of Santarem, Brazil, from 1958 to 1985, Ryan
administered a harsh jungle domain that, at more than 125,000 square
miles, was larger than many European countries. He oversaw the
building of clinics, schools, churches and a radio station in a part
of Brazil that was often neglected by the central government 2,000
miles away.</LD>
<LD>   After a military dictatorship took power in Brazil in 1964, Ryan
became known as a staunch defender of human rights and the
environment. He used the diocesan radio station to denounce abuses
and corruption even when local army commanders threatened to have him
expelled.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Chicago in 1912, Ryan was ordained in 1938 and initially
taught English, speech and drama at a Catholic seminary in Illinois.
In 1943, he and three other Franciscan friars from the Midwest
volunteered to go to Brazil.</TE>

<HD>Patrons Rescue Oxnard Coffeehouse</HD>
<DH>Culture: The cafe, a favorite spot for activists and
others, becomes a cause for its socially minded customers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since it opened two years ago, the Cafe on A Street in downtown
Oxnard has gained a reputation for dispensing social awareness along
with double espressos.</LD>
<LD>   On any given day, local artists can be found mounting bold new
exhibits, student activists conversing about social justice,
farm-worker advocates planning demonstrations and young hip-hop
artists rapping about cultura.</LD>
<LD>   But youthful idealism doesn't pay the bills. So a couple of months
ago, owners Armando Vazquez and Deborah DeVries announced they were
shutting down the coffee shop.</LD>
<TE>   Then something unexpected happened. The cafe's loyal and socially
minded customers rallied to save the place they helped transform into
a community cultural center. Several people offered to work for free.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the cafe reopened two weeks ago. With the help of
volunteers, operating costs have been reduced by more than half,
DeVries said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to help the community," said artist and part-time student
Virginia Sanchez, 27, who is one of two volunteer managers most
committed to the cafe, working five days a week. "I want to make sure
students and the [people] can come in here."</TE>
<TE>   The cafe's volunteers range from students and teachers to
housewives and artists. The coffee shop keeps regular hours in the
morning but follows a more flexible schedule in the evenings and on
weekends, when community groups who frequent the cafe are in charge
of serving drinks.</TE>
<TE>   "I come because of the coffee and the atmosphere," customer
Cuauhtemoc Magana said during the cafe's recent Sunday menudo
breakfast. A carpenter by trade and an aspiring artist at heart, he
enjoys the artwork that hangs on the walls, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Passing out copies of an amnesty plan he wrote and sent to
President Bush and congressional leaders, the soft-spoken Magana said
he is glad the coffee shop is back because the people he meets there
inspire him to "get involved."</TE>
<TE>   A recent schedule of cafe events illustrates what he means. A
women's issues forum met on Saturday, a community breakfast on
Sunday, a screening of a Chicano history documentary on Monday, a
youth hip-hop show and auditions for a local Spanish-language theater
company on Wednesday, a meeting of the Latin American Assn. of Child
Care Providers on Thursday and a late-night Latino comedy showcase on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to prompt social and progressive dialogue, issues of
concern to the community," Vazquez said. "We open it up to anyone
with these goals in mind. And if we sell a cup of coffee in the
process, then that's OK too."</TE>
<TE>   Leaning back in one of the cafe's mismatched chairs, Vazquez said
he and DeVries quickly envisioned such a place when they met 12 years
ago at a bilingual educators' conference in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Vazquez lives in Ventura with his wife and two teenage children.
When he isn't at the cafe, he teaches various subjects, including
English at Santa Clara High School, business courses at a UC Santa
Barbara extension center, children's art for the county and job
skills for women's drug and alcohol recovery centers.</TE>
<TE>   DeVries lives in Malibu and teaches English, creative writing,
art, English as a second language, general equivalency diploma
courses and job skills for Oxnard College, Ventura College, women's
drug and alcohol recovery centers and the city of Oxnard. Both
educators describe themselves as social activists fed up with how
"most people just talk about things and they don't have any
solutions," DeVries said.</TE>
<TE>   They opened the coffee shop in 1999 because they needed a neutral
meeting place to teach GED classes to youths in rival Oxnard gangs.
The coffee bar also gave them an instant job-skills training site for
the youths, a few of whom have moved on to Oxnard College, DeVries
said.</TE>
<TE>   They eventually named the art gallery after Rudy F. Acuna, a
longtime professor of Chicano studies at Cal State Northridge. They
also painted the walls bright pink, stocked hundreds of books to loan
out, then invited local artists and started pouring coffee.</TE>
<TE>   What happened next was beyond their expectations, DeVries said.
The discussions people were having at the coffee shop renewed the
locals' faith in culture as a source of strength and knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "The cafe is the realization of a dream," DeVries said. "So many
people who walk in get the hope that you can be creative and have a
place to do what we did in the '60s. We can change the world."</TE>
<TE>   Some nights, comics and deejays use the coffee shop's stage to
address racism. Farm workers hold potlucks to map out strategies to
increase their rights. Gang members learn job skills. Students hold
study groups.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great place to gather," said West Hills artist Cyndi
Hidalgo-Knies, whose paintings are on display.</TE>
<TE>   Vazquez said the coffee shop is purposely located in the ombligo,
or bellybutton, of the city that officials have touted as the center
of downtown revitalization.</TE>
<TE>   With its blackboards announcing coffee and menudo overshadowed by
giant hand-painted banners of beret-wearing Chicano activists with
fists of protest high in the air, the coffee shop stands out on the
block that is also home to the Oxnard Police Department and Downtown
Oxnard Merchants Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The cafe is moving toward a more permanent operating structure,
with a percentage of profits going toward the volunteers and the rest
being used for rent and maintenance costs, Vazquez said.</TE>
<TE>   Not too much coffee is being sold yet, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But for now the plan is clear. "The doors will stay open," Vazquez
said.</TE>

<HD>Officers Sworn to Give Comfort</HD>
<DH>LAPD: An eighth policeman is joining the specialized ranks
of department chaplains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They're an elite corps within the Los Angeles Police Department who,
instead of aiding the public, help their fellow officers and civilian
police employees in times of tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   The seven sworn officers who double as police chaplains will add
another to their ranks today when Senior Lead Officer Ronald Carter
receives his special chaplain's badge.</LD>
<LD>   "Cops are not emotionless, so who do they turn to when they have a
problem?" Carter said in an interview from his Valencia home. "It's
the desire of all chaplains that, if someone has a need, they will
come to us."</LD>
<TE>   If those who work in law enforcement are considered a special
breed, it might be said that those who become police chaplains are
even more unusual. On a daily basis, they listen to the concerns of
dying colleagues, console families who have lost children and grieve
alongside the spouse of the cop who has just committed suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Some of their work is done in the course of their regular police
shift, such as when another officer approaches them in the locker
room or patrol car with a personal problem. Other duties are
performed after hours--and sometimes in the middle of the night--when
they deliver tragic news or sit with a family in crisis. And all for
no extra pay.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes they need religious counseling or sometimes they need
grief counseling," said Sgt. Kieth Moreland, supervisor of the LAPD's
Employee Assistance Unit, which oversees the chaplains. "We have to
respond. If we don't do a good job, there will be suffering people
out there."</TE>
<TE>   Carter, a 20-year LAPD veteran and the only chaplain who is not an
ordained minister, said he decided to become a chaplain after being
approached by another chaplain who is a fellow senior lead officer in
the Van Nuys Division and an elder in the Mormon church.</TE>
<TE>   Carter's application required the approval of the LAPD's Chaplain
Advisory Board, made up of seasoned chaplains, the department's chief
psychologist, the commanding officer of the department's Human
Resources Bureau and the police chief.</TE>
<TE>   A special chaplain's badge, along with lapel crosses that may be
worn while conducting chaplain duties, will be presented to Carter
today at a gathering of the Religious Forum, made up of community
clergy who meet regularly with the police chief.</TE>
<TE>   Raised a Roman Catholic, Carter was drawn to the Baptist faith
after a Baptist minister counseled him after his wife of 20 years
died of cancer in 1994. He became a Baptist in 1997, the year he
remarried. Although he intends to be a sounding board for his
colleagues, Carter expects primarily to be counseling those who have
experienced a death in the family.</TE>
<TE>   "Losing a loved one is a difficult time, and I feel I'm being led
to grief counseling. My feeling is that the Lord is always preparing
you for what He's preparing you for," said Carter, 54, who has two
children, three stepchildren and three grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The chaplain officers represent a variety of faiths and ranks. Two
consider themselves Protestant, two are nondenominational, and the
others are Pentecostal, Roman Catholic, Baptist and Mormon.</TE>
<TE>   Two are senior lead officers, two are sergeants, three are
officers and one is a detective. All are men. Another male sergeant
from the Southwest Division will become a chaplain in about a month,
and a female officer has expressed interest in the program, said
Officer Randy Michaelsen, chaplain coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Although the police chaplains profess a strong faith, they are not
permitted to try to convert fellow workers.</TE>
<TE>   The primary motto of the police chaplains is "Serving those who
protect and serve," Michaelsen said. "It's a ministry of presence. So
much of it is just being there."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the chaplain officers, the department has a reserve
corps of 39 civilian chaplains representing nearly every major
religion. Both the officer chaplains and the reservists assist
members of the "LAPD family," conducting funerals and baptisms and
even weddings, if they are licensed clergy.</TE>
<TE>   A minimum of three training sessions annually--covering such
topics as dealing with air disasters and police suicides--are
organized by the Police Department for all chaplains. They also are
encouraged to attend a weeklong annual meeting of the International
Conference of Police Chaplains.</TE>
<TE>   The primary difference between the sworn officers and the
reservists is that the LAPD chaplain officers have the law
enforcement experience to help them more effectively counsel fellow
officers, especially those involved in a work-related tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're already in the circle. We talk the language and the lingo.
We know what it's like to get shot and shoot people. It brings
credibility. It isn't that the reservist isn't credible; they just
haven't experienced life at the same level as a police officer," said
Officer Steve Hillmann, 47, who received a Medal of Valor in 1977
after saving an officer's life by fatally shooting a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   His advice to fellow officers who become chaplains: "Remember to
stay balanced. Keep God in your life and make your family your

<HD>CHP Directs Safety Message at Black Drivers</HD>
<DH>Highways: Critics fear racial stereotyping in a campaign to
increase use of seat belts and reduce drunk driving among African
Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned that black motorists are disproportionately represented in
fatal car accidents, the California Highway Patrol is preparing to
launch a $2-million campaign aimed a increasing seat belt use and
decreasing drunk driving among African Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign idea was prompted by previous studies that show
African Americans are less likely to wear seat belts and slightly
more likely to be victims of deadly alcohol-related accidents than
whites.</LD>
<LD>   But African American activists worry that the CHP may be sending
the wrong message by targeting blacks. They note that the agency has
been sued by the American Civil Liberties Union, which has charged
that officers stop blacks and Latinos as much as three times as often
as white motorists.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't imagine it will go over big in the African American
community," said Geraldine Washington, president of the Los Angeles
chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People.
"The tone of that could be very negative."</TE>
<TE>   She suggested that the CHP instead reach out to all ethnic groups
with a general traffic safety campaign.</TE>
<TE>   CHP officials say they are sensitive to fears about stereotyping,
particularly over use of alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, the agency plans to meet with African American
representatives throughout the state next month. It expects to begin
the campaign, with billboard, radio and newspaper ads, in February.</TE>
<TE>   CHP Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick said he believes that the
campaign can be effective without bringing protests.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to reach out and understand the best method to get out to
that community," Helmick said. "Our intent is to put a helping hand
out."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign will not be the CHP's first to target a minority
group. In 1987, the agency introduced "El Protector," a similar
safety campaign that employs Spanish-language officers and brochures
to emphasize traffic safety among Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Mothers Against Drunk Driving struggled with the same sensitivity
concerns when it started a campaign last year to educate Latinos
about the dangers of drinking and driving.</TE>
<TE>   MADD is about to kick off a similar campaign in New Mexico,
targeting Native Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "I commend the CHP, because they are doing the same thing we are
trying to do," said Tina Pasco, executive director of MADD's Los
Angeles chapter.</TE>
<TE>   Although traffic fatalities have declined steadily for years, the
CHP reported that the number of African Americans killed in car
accidents in California has increased slightly, from 191 in 1999 to
198 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, Native Americans have the greatest risk of dying in
car crashes, followed by African Americans, Latinos, whites and
Asians, according to a 1994 federal study.</TE>
<TE>   An analysis by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
of accidents from 1990 to 1994 showed that 68% of all deadly crashes
involving Native Americans had been alcohol-related. The rate was 55%
for Mexican Americans, 45% for African Americans, 44% for whites and
28% for Asians.</TE>
<TE>   CHP officials believe that a major factor in the African American
death rate is the low rate of seat belt use among black
motorists--51% nationwide, compared with 63% for whites, according to
the federal traffic safety agency.</TE>
<TE>   A federally funded study released in 1998 found that African
American youths are half as likely to buckle up as white or Latino
youths.</TE>
<TE>   The disparity is the result of a lack of traffic safety programs
in the African American community, according to a federal panel that
studied the problem in 2000. The panel found that nearly half of
blacks surveyed believed that seat belts were just as likely to harm
them as to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   Also troubling is a 5% increase last year in the number of
alcohol-related crashes statewide, according to the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Andrews, assistant director of the Alabama Department of
Public Safety and a member of the National Organization of Black Law
Enforcement Executives, said he supports the CHP's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that Alabama launched a similar seat belt campaign for
African Americans in 2000. He said the program helped increase seat
belt use from 52% to 79% among all motorists in that state.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews also commended the CHP for seeking the advice of black
representatives before kicking off the campaign, saying such guidance
might help avoid misunderstandings and conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   "That is what we did," Andrews said. "We were trying to let people
know upfront that the goal was to save lives."</TE>

<HD>Ventura Weighs Daytime Curfew</HD>
<DH>Truancy: Council is poised to make it illegal for minors to
be in public before 12:30 p.m. on school days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skipping school is at least as old as Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn,
speakers reminded the Ventura City Council last week. But the council
remains poised to implement a daytime curfew today that it hopes will
put an end to school-time surfing excursions.</LD>
<LD>   Even though truancy rates have been decreasing, youngsters still
skip school, supporters of the curfew say. And some of those students
become crime victims when they should be in class.</LD>
<LD>   "If we know that people are being victimized, it's incumbent on us
to do something about that," Councilman Jim Friedman said.</LD>
<TE>   If the "Safe Students Ordinance" is adopted, it would become
illegal for minors who are required to be in school to be out in
public from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. If a police officer were to see
someone appearing to be of school age, the child would be stopped,
questioned and returned to school.</TE>
<TE>   School officials then would decide, depending on the student's
total number of absences, how to proceed. Only the habitually truant
would be likely candidates for referral to an attendance board, a
panel made up of representatives from the school, social services
agencies and law enforcement, a district official said.</TE>
<TE>   Early versions of the ordinance, which was proposed by the Ventura
Police Department, would have made it a misdemeanor to violate the
curfew. However, that language has been softened, and a violation
would not be considered a criminal offense, although offenders could
be referred to Juvenile Court.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be similar to getting cited for skateboarding somewhere
you're not supposed to," Deputy Dist. Atty. Wendy Macfarlane said.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Police Chief Pat Miller told the City Council that
officers would have discretion on whether to cite the student.</TE>
<TE>   "We would enforce the spirit of the law more than the letter of
the law," Miller said. "We take a softer approach with youth."</TE>
<TE>   There are exceptions to the curfew. A student going to a doctor,
work or school activity would be exempt, as would legally emancipated
minors.</TE>
<TE>   But assurances by the Police Department have not quelled parents'
fears that their children may be harassed by police, even if they are
in public for legitimate reasons or are home-schooled.</TE>
<TE>   More than 35 parents and residents addressed the City Council at
its last meeting. One speaker said the ordinance would "traumatize
children for dollars."</TE>
<TE>   "No adult in this meeting has not skipped school," said David
Bianco of Ventura. "Children should not have to live with this sword
of Damocles hanging over their heads."</TE>
<TE>   The first daytime curfew ordinance in the state was enacted by
Monrovia in 1994. The Monrovia Police Department's Web site touts the
city's decrease in truancy and juvenile crime since the curfew was
implemented. However, the constitutionality of that ordinance still
is being challenged in court.</TE>
<TE>   "A local municipality can't circumvent state law," said Michael
Smith, president of the Home School Legal Defense Fund, the entity
that has challenged the Monrovia ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to wait to see if we win this case, and you can bet
if we win there, we will use that ruling" to challenge other daytime
curfews, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   If his group loses in appellate court, Smith expects it to appeal
the Monrovia case to the state Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   School attendance rates already have been improving in the
district over the last few years, thanks to stepped-up truancy
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The efforts netted the district an additional $750,000 in state
funding last school year, said Nancy Bradford, director of
administration support services for the Ventura Unified School
District.</TE>
<TE>   But while the truancy rate is low, only about 1% to 2%, Bradford
estimates, the curfew would lower it even more.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if we just bring one or two more kids back to school, it's
worth it," Bradford said.</TE>

<HD>Publicity Over Firm's Fraud Verdict Forces Simon to Tend to
His Image</HD>
<DH>The GOP candidate might look to the campaigns waged by
corporations after their products fall out of favor, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like a corporation or product suddenly blitzed by bad publicity, Bill
Simon Jr.'s campaign for governor faces the task of turning his image
around--a job that public relations and crisis management experts say
has precedents as diverse as the rescue of Tylenol and the remaking
of Richard Nixon.</LD>
<LD>   "The basic principle applies, whether it's a mom-and-pop grocery
store, a multimillion-dollar corporation or City Hall," said Larry
Smith, president of the Louisville-based Institute for Crisis
Management. "The public will tolerate people making mistakes if they
'fess up, admit to what they've done, and make a commitment to do
better. The public will not tolerate people who cover up, stonewall
or lie."</LD>
<LD>   For Simon, the challenge has been raised by the spate of stories
about last week's fraud judgment delivered by a Los Angeles jury
against his investment firm. The GOP candidate was not accused of
wrongdoing, and has tried to distance himself from the $78-million
judgment against William E. Simon &amp; Sons, which he co-founded and
manages.</LD>
<TE>   Simon and his firm's attorneys have maintained that the firm was a
victim of a bad investment in Pacific Coin, a pay phone company.
However, the jury unanimously upheld the complaint of a former
business partner who charged that Simon's firm had borrowed money to
make the company expand too quickly, leading to its demise.</TE>
<TE>   Simon was able to significantly reduce his federal tax bill by
writing off the loss.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has noted that he was not named as a defendant and has
predicted that the verdict will be overturned on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   But those arguments may not be enough to sway public opinion,
especially at a time when corporate malfeasance is being widely
condemned.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what people fully expect anyone to say in that situation,"
said Doug Dowie, senior vice president of the public relations firm
Fleishman Hillard. "I would make an overt attempt to separate myself
from the executives appearing in handcuffs on a daily basis. In this
atmosphere, the only thing worse would be if he was accused of being
a kidnapper."</TE>
<TE>   Crisis management professionals said Simon must make it clear that
he is disclosing all information and thoroughly answering questions
about his role in the failed investment. Otherwise, they say, he
could be plagued with stories about the case for the next three
months as information trickles out.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got to get the truth out, no matter how damaging it is,"
said Ian Mitroff, a USC business and communications professor who
specializes in crisis management. "The No. 1 rule is that there are
no secrets in today's world."</TE>
<TE>   Several product marketing cases illustrate the importance of
confronting negative publicity head-on, according to Peter Sealey,
former head of global marketing for Coca-Cola and now an adjunct
professor at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   When seven people died from cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules
in 1982, industry observers immediately declared that the brand was
dead. But Johnson &amp; Johnson saved the product by quickly withdrawing
it from the market until safety measures were put in place.</TE>
<TE>   Perrier took the opposite tack in 1990 when the French company
learned that trace amounts of the chemical benzene had been found in
its bottled water. The company first issued a limited recall in North
America. Then it changed its story about the source of the
contamination when benzene was discovered in bottles in other
countries. While the amounts found were not life-threatening, the
scandal seriously damaged the brand, Sealey said.</TE>
<TE>   "Simon may be in the Perrier situation," Sealey said. "The clear
lesson is, you get out in front of the audience, explain what
happened and take responsibility." If Simon really had little to do
with the pay phone investment, as he has said, then he needs to
persuade voters that the failed deal does not reflect his management,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "You say, 'The fraud conviction happened, our books are open and
these are steps we're taking to make sure it doesn't happen again,'
'' said David Shank, president of an Indianapolis-based public
relations firm.</TE>
<TE>   One way to reduce the effect of a bad verdict is to show people
that, even though fault has been found, the company's actions did not
hurt the public, said David Margulies, who runs a Houston firm
specializing in litigation support and crisis management.</TE>
<TE>   A company that Margulies represented was found guilty of
price-fixing, but contained the fallout by demonstrating that its
product was still the least expensive in the United States. "You
don't have to win the argument," he said. "You just have to get
people to say, 'So what?' ''</TE>
<TE>   For Simon, however, the turnaround argument is made more difficult
by the nature of the product he's selling--himself--and the context
in which he's selling it, a contested political campaign with
election day just three months away.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Gov. Gray Davis is capitalizing on questions about
Simon's business practices, running television commercials statewide
that ask, "If he can't run a business, how can he run the
fifth-largest economy in the world?"</TE>
<TE>   "A corporation has time to remake its image and bring people
back," said Joe DePlasco, a public relations executive who advised
last year's unsuccessful New York mayoral candidate Mark Green and
other Democratic officials. "In an election, you're dealing with a
limited amount of time."</TE>
<TE>   Shifting gears at this point in the campaign also has its
difficulties, experts added. After selling himself as a successful
businessman for the last year, Simon may find it difficult to
emphasize a different aspect of his resume as he campaigns for
governor.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be very careful about doing things like that,
because it often comes across as a cynical ploy, like the 'New
Nixon,' " said Ethan Geto, a public relations consultant in New York
who works with public officials.</TE>
<TE>   Given enough time, however, some politicians have made it work.
After losing the race for governor in 1962, Nixon retooled his image
and was elected president in 1968 and reelected in 1972.</TE>

<HD>Housing Group's New Leader Builds on Experience</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a time when Rick Schroeder paid little attention to
affordable housing needs in cities such as Thousand Oaks or Simi
Valley. It's not that he didn't care. But like plenty of others, he
figured low-cost housing was provided by someone else in some other
community.</LD>
<LD>   That isn't true anymore.</LD>
<LD>   As the new executive director of Thousand Oaks-based Many
Mansions, Schroeder spends his working hours thinking of nothing but
ways to meet Ventura County's growing demand for affordable housing,
especially in the affluent east county, where rents are high and
vacancies nearly nonexistent.</LD>
<TE>   Although he has been on the job for about a month, the 41-year-old
father of two is already very familiar with the organization, thanks
to his years as a volunteer and board president with the nonprofit
group. Many Mansions provides housing and social service programs to
the poor, developmentally disabled and mentally ill in Thousand Oaks
and Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   And Schroeder comes with a laundry list of goals. Chief among them
is to build support for the organization with local residents, who he
believes will offer their time, money and other resources once they
understand the area's low-cost housing crunch.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to reach the typical person who was like me, the person
who really doesn't give much thought to where people with low incomes
are supposed to live," said Schroeder, a Wisconsin native and UCLA
law school graduate who settled in Oak Park 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, my attitude was like that of a lot of people: I lived in
a very nice area with very nice homes, and affordable housing was
something that other communities had," he said. "The more we are out
there [and] the more people become aware of Many Mansions and the
work we do, the more I think they will be willing to support our
mission."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder points to his own path to Many Mansions as evidence.</TE>
<TE>   He began volunteering with the group in 1995, helping a family pay
its rent through the group's Adopt-A-Family program.</TE>
<TE>   By then he was living in Oak Park and had opened a law office in
Agoura Hills, concentrating on business, bankruptcy and real estate
litigation. He had met people involved with children with special
needs after learning in 1994 that his daughter, Sarah, was autistic.</TE>
<TE>   It was someone in that circle who introduced him to Many Mansions,
and before Schroeder knew it, he was providing free legal help to the
agency's clients and shifting much of his practice to affordable
housing issues.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder joined the board of directors in 1996 and served as
president from 1999 through 2001. When the executive director's post
came open earlier this year, he decided he might as well try jumping
in with both feet. He beat out more than 40 applicants for the post.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor Frank Schillo, who was responsible in
1979 for gathering the civic leaders who launched Many Mansions, is
no longer on the board of directors and didn't take part in the
hiring process. But he knows about Schroeder's work and believes he
was an excellent choice.</TE>
<TE>   "He's already proven he's really interested in the organization;
he served on the board and gave of his time, and that counts for a
lot with me," Schillo said. "I'm impressed by his background and his
willingness to serve. He's truly giving back to the community."</TE>
<TE>   That is what Many Mansions has been all about for more than 20
years. Besides providing about 350 apartments to low-income residents
in the eastern part of Ventura County, the group provides housing
education, homeownership counseling, summer camp for children,
after-school programs and a range of health and social service
programs.</TE>
<TE>   With a $2-million annual budget and 35 employees, Many Mansions
owns and manages seven housing projects and has two others at various
stages of development.</TE>
<TE>   The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Thousand Oaks is
$1,367, well out of the reach of low-income residents. For Schroeder,
that reality was driven home in January when he attended a dedication
ceremony for Esseff Village in Thousand Oaks, a complex of studio
apartments for the disabled, seniors and small families.</TE>
<TE>   Speakers talked about how much the housing meant to them. They
were able to live on their own and had finally found a community to
call their own.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so moved at that dedication that I thought this is what I
want to do," Schroeder said. "I just wanted to be more deeply
involved in this process. Here as executive director, this is exactly
what I can do."</TE>

<HD>Winds Push Julian Area Blaze in 3 Directions</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JULIAN, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A wildfire east of San Diego spread in three directions Sunday,
prompting authorities to project that containment will take a week
longer than previously anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   Wind and low humidity caused the fire to spread rapidly in recent
days through the dry trees, scrub and grasses of the drought-stricken
mountain region, said Lora Lowes, a spokeswoman for the California
Department of Forestry.</LD>
<LD>   The wildfire, which was about 60% contained Sunday afternoon, had
burned across 39,512 acres.</LD>
<TE>   Firefighters now hope to have the fire surrounded with fire breaks
by Sunday. "It's kicked up," Lowes said. "It's still a very volatile
situation in some places."</TE>
<TE>   Winds gusted at 10 to 20 mph as the fire advanced toward sparsely
populated areas to the north, northeast, and northwest of the town of
Julian, about 60 miles east of San Diego. The former mining town
itself was not threatened.</TE>
<TE>   The Pines Fire has destroyed 16 homes, 24 sheds and other types of
outbuildings as well as 46 vehicles, causing more than $1.4 million
in damage. Fourteen of the 2,300 firefighters have suffered minor
injuries since the fire began July 29, when a National Guard
helicopter on an anti-drug patrol clipped power lines.</TE>

<HD>Running the Risk of a Run as a 'Businessman'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For decades, the word "businessman" has cast a glow of plucky
American virtues upon those who wear it and hear it. "Businessman"
was the first skill Bill Simon offered to the voters of California in
choosing to run for governor. And President Calvin Coolidge declared:
"The business of America is business" (four years before the stock
market crashed in 1929).</LD>
<LD>   An Orange County congressional candidate once polled voters about
which of several ballot designations--the short description summing
up a candidate--would be regarded most favorably. The winner:
independent businessman.</LD>
<LD>   But Enron and its sinning brethren may have changed that, at least
for the nonce.</LD>
<TE>   In California, one major candidate decided at the last minute that
"businessman" could be a golden albatross, and had it removed from
his ballot designations.</TE>
<TE>   Foremost is Democrat John Garamendi, the state's first elected
insurance commissioner, running for that job again.</TE>
<TE>   He changed his ballot listing from "businessman/rancher," which
got him through the primary, to plain old "rancher."</TE>
<TE>   In a San Jose-area Senate district, Republican Jeff Denham hedged
his bets by changing "businessman" to "small business owner," as did
East Bay Republican Assembly candidate Guy Houston.</TE>
<TE>   But some candidates are bucking that trend.</TE>
<TE>   Chula Vista's Shirley Horton, a Republican Assembly candidate,
added "businesswoman" to her title of "mayor."</TE>
<TE>   Longtime legislator Bill Leonard, a San Bernardino Republican
running for the state board of equalization, added "businessman" to
his designation, and Republican Assembly candidate Brian McCabe,
evidently boldly choosing between evils, dropped "attorney" in favor
of "businessman."</TE>
<TE>   In case this gives anyone else ideas--too late.</TE>
<TE>   The deadline for changes was last week.</TE>
<TE>   So Gray Davis is still listed as "Governor of the State of
California," and Bill Simon is still "businessman/charity director."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All the Time Needed, if It's Not Too Long</TE>
<TE>   The recent 3:30-to-9 p.m. press peepshow of Bill Simon's
encyclopedically huge tax returns is still stirring the political
pot.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign is sending out mixed messages about whether
anyone will be able to look at the documents again. Chief strategist
Sal Russo told Timesman George Skelton that the returns will be
available throughout the campaign, and he gave the impression that
reporters were given all the time they needed.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds swell--except a Times reporter was shown the door promptly
at 9 p.m. rather than getting "all the time" he needed. And
"available" turned out to mean, well, you can't look at them again,
but if you have specific questions based on what you already saw,
we'll answer those questions for you. A Times political reporter duly
submitted his list, and nearly two weeks later, still has no answers.</TE>
<TE>   Startlingly--but maybe indicative of a campaign with scores of
staff members, some of them invariably stepping over one
another--press secretary Mark Miner acknowledged that the notions of
reporters having all the time they needed and returns being made
available throughout the campaign were flat wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the campaign e-mailed that untrue passage from The
Times far and wide to supporters to lend credence to what one of its
own had already acknowledged was untrue. The e-mailing was "a
mistake," Miner said; the returns will not be making a return
appearance. But the e-mail was not retracted.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Richman Goes Hat in Hand</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Keith Richman, recently lauded by the California
Journal as rookie of the year in Sacramento, showed a bit more of the
rookie aspect last week: The Northridge Republican is running for
mayor of the proposed San Fernando Valley city even before there is a
San Fernando Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter asking for donations to his campaign, he promised
"freedom from a downtown government that takes taxes from the Valley
and refuses to return a fair share of services."</TE>
<TE>   On the receiving end of one of those letters was L.A. City Council
President Alex Padilla, a honcho among anti-secessionists, who did
not take the characterization well: "I think," he said, "Keith
Richman should worry about passing the state budget before he asks me
for money."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Politicians Take to the Runway</TE>
<TE>   Ohio Democratic representative and convicted felon James
Traficant's threat to wear a denim suit on the floor of the Congress
was the least of his offenses, but it is nonetheless surprising how
few politicians have--or seem to want--any sartorial flair.</TE>
<TE>   Hence the astonished applause as Los Angeles politicos and
poweristas strolled and sashayed down the runway clad in designer
chic as a fund-raiser for the beautification programs of the Sherman
Oaks Homeowners Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Newly svelte L.A. County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo, City Controller Laura Chick, City Council member
Cindy Miscikowski, school board member Caprice Young, Police
Protective League President Mitzi Grasso, and subdistrict school
superintendent Robert Collins all looked quite smart, while the
changing rooms at Bloomingdale's in Sherman Oaks looked like
backstage in Milan, with Donna Karan, Kenneth Cole and Hugo Boss
separates being flung about.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest crowd-pleaser was Delgadillo, playing the "Latino
Elvis Esquire" look to the hilt as women in the crowd squealed and
waved dollar bills. And each of the seven took a turn looking
dignified but delectable--electable is another standard--in outfits
of daywear, playwear and evening wear, or in political parlance,
dressing for quorum, forum and fund-raising decorum.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * The new president of the California Correctional Peace Officers
Assn.--the prison guards group that got juicy pay raises from Gray
Davis and then gave about a quarter-million dollars to his
campaign--swore in its new president, Mike Jimenez. He replaces Don
Novey now, even though--hello, democracy--the election for president
isn't until September. Jimenez was running unopposed, so why wait? He
was sworn in last week on the floor of the state Senate.</TE>
<TE>   * Some political help for furry friends this month from Los
Angeles County Supervisor Don Knabe. Stealing thunder from his
pet-loving colleague Mike Antonovich, Knabe proposed that homes and
apartments with cats or dogs or both put stickers saying so on their
windows, so that if fire breaks out, firefighters can try to rescue
the pets as well as the people. The city of Hermosa Beach has
recently begun a similar program. And in Hawaii, Chris Quackenbush,
the wife of disgraced ex-California insurance commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush, is lobbying to cut the waiting time for quarantining
pets coming to the islands.</TE>
<TE>   * The announcement of last weekend's neighborhood political
convention for Los Angeles' "Congress of Neighborhoods" pointed out
v-e-r-y clearly that the event would be held at the Sheraton
Universal Hotel: "Yes, it's in the city of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   * Rep. Adam Schiff, a Pasadena Democrat, and his wife, Eve, are
parents again, but there the resemblance ends: Shying away from the
obvious and tragic allusions to Cain, Abel and Seth, the couple named
their new son Elijah Harris. His sister's name is Alexa Marion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Speaker, respectful of the bipartisan spirit in which we try
to confront tragic situations in this body, I would ask that when the
Assembly adjourns today, we adjourn in memory of the Simon for
governor campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Rialto Democratic Assemblyman John Longville, following Assembly
protocol but with a sharpened edge, underscoring recent PR problems
in the Simon gubernatorial campaign.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Curious visitors from across Southern California trooped to the
Huntington Botanical Gardens on Sunday, lured by the promise of a
strong whiff of rotting flesh.</LD>
<LD>   But the spiky purple and green Amorphophallus titanum, a rare
plant whose name means "giant shapeless phallus," wasn't cooperating.
Its cabbage-like sheath remained stubbornly closed, hiding its
famously smelly bloom for another day.</LD>
<LD>   As tourists clutching video cameras hovered, curators allowed a
few to slip under the ropes guarding the plant that rarely flowers.
Some flapped their hands in front of their faces, trying to push the
hoped-for stench into their nostrils.</LD>
<TE>   "Take a deep breath," urged Theresa Trunnelle, the Huntington's
nursery manager.</TE>
<TE>   Alison Harvey, a UCLA grad student, pushed her nose up to the
papery purple spear and inhaled with all her might. She pronounced
the faint odor a cross between musty shoes and spoiled vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so bad," she said, her voice tinged with disappointment.
"It wasn't the big corpse smell that I was hoping for."</TE>
<TE>   That pungent blast could come as soon as today, said Trunnelle,
who postponed her summer vacation to await the elusive blooming. The
Huntington, which normally is closed Mondays, will be open today.</TE>
<TE>   It is tough to predict precisely when the so-called "corpse
flower," which is native to the rain forests of Sumatra, will
blossom. After shooting up almost 4 feet, 6 inches over the last two
weeks, the plant's growth is tapering off, suggesting that a bloom is
imminent.</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington, however, isn't waiting to smell the flower before
cranking up its publicity machine. The bookstore is stocked with
postcards, magnets and "I Smelled the Stinky Flower" T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the same plant bloomed here. Billed as the world's
largest flower, its aroma is meant to attract pollinating dung
beetles. Instead it drew 76,000 people over the course of its
three-day flowering.</TE>
<TE>   The scene was similar 65 years ago, at the first corpse-flower
blooming in the United States. The New York Botanical Garden had to
call police to handle the huge crowds.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, there have been about 20 recorded bloomings throughout
the country, including recent events in Fullerton and San Diego
County. It is extremely rare for the same plant to bloom twice,
botanists say.</TE>
<TE>   The strange appeal of the botanical freak grabbed Bob and Beth
Fernley on Friday, when the Burbank couple heard about it on the
news.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to check this out," Bob Fernley said. "Because all flowers
smell good, and this one doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   He gazed reverentially at the plant as a fresh wave of gawkers
crowded close. They had come from as near as Pasadena and as far as
Riverside. They snapped pictures and jotted down the number of the
Big Flower Hotline."I was hoping it was actually going to be
stinking," Bob Fernley said. "Maybe we'll come back tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington will be open daily throughout the blooming cycle
from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Adult admission is $10. For more
information, call the Big Flower Hotline at (800) 200-5566.</TE>

<HD>Daal Tames Phillies</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: His solid effort in 4-3 victory makes Tracy's
decision on who to remove from rotation more difficult.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Omar Daal has already been down this road twice, waiting for Kevin
Brown to return from the disabled list and bump him to the bullpen.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers expect Brown to rejoin them again soon, but Daal might
not be the odd man out after another impressive performance Sunday in
a 4-3 victory against the Philadelphia Phillies before 28,186 at
Veterans Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Daal (9-6) pitched 6 1/3 solid innings in his third consecutive
quality start. He also hit his second career home run, giving Manager
Jim Tracy more to consider about the rotation.</LD>
<TE>   "Omar Daal, early in the season, did some tremendous things for us
out of the bullpen, and in the absence of Kevin Brown, as a starting
pitcher, he's done some very special things for us," Tracy said. "He
had some brilliant outings early on [in place of Brown], and his
performance today.... he returned to that pinnacle. For six innings,
he was brilliant."</TE>
<TE>   Fans booed Daal each time his name was announced, presumably
because he was critical of Phillie Manager Larry Bowa last season.
But Daal maintained a business-like approach in his first start
against the Phillies since being traded back to the Dodgers in
November, striking out the side in the first and escaping a
bases-loaded jam in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander helped himself with a solo homer in the third
against Philadelphia rookie right-hander Brett Myers (1-2), who
pitched seven innings. Adrian Beltre hit a two-run homer--No.
14--after Eric Karros singled in the seventh, increasing the Dodger
lead to 3-0 and continuing his torrid trip.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the All-Star break, things are going good for me," said
Beltre, 14 for 39 with three homers and 13 runs batted in during his
last nine games. "I'm getting good pitches to hit, I'm trying to be
on those pitches, and that stuff is working."</TE>
<TE>   Daal appeared exhausted during the seventh with the temperature at
91 degrees, and the Phillies cut the lead to 3-2 against him and
reliever Paul Shuey.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Cora, earning more playing time because of his production,
drove in the Dodgers' final run with a ninth-inning single, helping
closer Eric Gagne. Marlon Anderson tripled to start the ninth and
scored on Doug Glanville's one-out single.</TE>
<TE>   Placido Polanco then grounded into a fielder's choice, and Bobby
Abreu popped up to give Gagne his 36th save in 38 chances. The
Dodgers (62-49) defeated the Phillies (52-58) for the second time
after dropping the series opener, improving to 6-6 on a season-high
13-game trip that ends today.</TE>
<TE>   They remained six games behind first-place Arizona in the National
League West, and one game ahead of San Francisco in the N.L.
wild-card race with their staff ace close to being activated. The
Dodgers are eager to make room for Brown, but Daal has made a strong
case to remain in the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what's going to happen, so I don't want to think
about that, I just want to do my job," Daal said. "I know I've had
some bad games before, but my last three [games] have been really
good and aggressive. I'm just happy, because I know I'm back now."</TE>
<TE>   Daal gave up six hits and was charged with two runs. He had five
strikeouts and two walks while throwing 54 strikes in 79 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   With Daal still in the game, the Phillies scored their first run
in the seventh on Anderson's sacrifice bunt after Travis Lee and
Jimmy Rollins singled and doubled, respectively, to start the inning.
Rollins scored on a wild pitch by Shuey.</TE>
<TE>   Left-handed specialist Jesse Orosco retired Abreu to start the
eighth, and workhorse setup man Paul Quantrill, pitching for the
fifth straight day, got the final two out, stranding two runners.
Cora singled off first baseman Lee's glove in the ninth to drive in
Cesar Izturis from third, providing the difference and helping Daal
make his case with another victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what I can do," Daal said. "Let's wait and see what
they're going to do."</TE>

<HD>Koskie Pays Price, but Twins Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corey Koskie took one for his teammates on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Koskie was injured on the final, bizarre play of the Minnesota
Twins' 5-4 victory over Kansas City, taking a throw in the chest as
Royal first baseman Chan Perry attempted to get Torii Hunter at home
plate.</LD>
<LD>   Koskie, who grew up stopping hockey pucks as a high school goalie
in Anola, Canada, was standing about 25 feet from Perry when the
throw drilled him between the "n" and "s" on his uniform letters. He
was on the ground for more than five minutes before coming to his
feet, and he was sitting up when he was taken off the field on a
cart.</LD>
<TE>   Koskie was diagnosed with a bruised chest and was taken to Abbott
Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis, where X-rays came back
negative, the Twins said.</TE>
<TE>   Twin trainer Jim Kahmann said Koskie was responsive and able to
walk.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be sore for a few days," Kahmann said.</TE>
<TE>   With the bases loaded and one out in the 10th, Koskie hit a
grounder down the first-base line. Perry dove and gloved the ball,
falling on the bag for the second out, but he had to jump up and spin
to make the throw from foul ground.</TE>
<TE>   Even with an accurate toss, Perry had little chance to get the
speedy Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   Koskie's injury overshadowed another dramatic Twin victory.
Minnesota is now 19-4 since the All-Star break, best in baseball,
while the Royals lost their sixth in a row, the last four by one run.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 10, Seattle 8--Pinch-hitter Bill Selby hit a tiebreaking
single in the ninth inning against Mariner closer Kazuhiro Sasaki as
the Indians blew a six-run lead before winning at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians led 8-2 before the Mariners tied the game with six
runs in the sixth inning. But Cleveland won it with two runs in the
ninth to end Seattle's six-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   With a runner on first and one out, pinch-hitter Lee Stevens
singled off Sasaki (2-5) to move Travis Fryman to third base. Selby
followed with a single to give the Indians a 9-8 lead. Matt Lawton
added an RBI groundout.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 11, Texas 3--Pedro Martinez struck out 10 in seven shutout
innings for his 15th victory, and Nomar Garciaparra homered twice as
the Red Sox won at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez (15-2), who has pitched 23 scoreless innings over his
last three starts, joined teammate Derek Lowe and Oakland's Barry
Zito as the AL's only 15-game winners. He gave up only three singles.</TE>
<TE>   Garciaparra went four for four to lead the Red Sox, who had 19
hits. Shea Hillenbrand and Cliff Floyd, in only his fourth game for
Boston, had three hits each. Every Boston starter had at least one
hit.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 4, Detroit 0--Cory Lidle teamed with three Athletic
relievers on a one-hitter, and Miguel Tejada hit a three-run homer at
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Lidle (4-9) retired Detroit's first 15 batters before Wendell
Magee's line-drive single to lead off the sixth. He faced only 22
hitters in seven innings, striking out six and getting double-play
grounders to kill the Tigers' only scoring chances.</TE>
<TE>   Tejada extended his hitting streak to 24 games--the second-longest
in the majors this season behind Luis Castillo's 35-gamer for
Florida--with his third-inning blast against Mike Maroth (3-4).</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Baltimore 4--Eric Hinske hit a go-ahead single off B.J.
Ryan (2-1) in the seventh inning and the Blue Jays won at Toronto.
Hinske drove in two runs as Blue Jays ended the Orioles' four-game
winning streak.</TE>

consecutive homers and Joe Kennedy threw seven strong innings as the
Devil Rays won at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>

<HD>Ground Ball Only Has Eyes for Yankees</HD>
<DH>Angels: Soriano beats out a perfectly placed bases-loaded
squib hit in 12th, giving New York 7-5 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels and New York Yankees played for 4 hours 47 minutes on
Sunday and might have played a few hours more if not for a
split-second play in the 12th inning.</LD>
<LD>   That was all the time it took speedy Alfonso Soriano of the
Yankees to beat Angel second baseman Adam Kennedy's flip-throw to
first on a ground ball hit off the end of Soriano's bat.</LD>
<LD>   Soriano's two-out infield single with the bases loaded broke a tie
and sent the Yankees to a 7-5 victory before a sellout crowd of
43,455 at Edison Field.</LD>
<TE>   "If it's hit harder, he's out," Angel first baseman Scott Spiezio
said. "If it's hit softer, he's out. If it's hit a foot closer to me,
I probably get it and flip it to the pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those perfect-placement balls."</TE>
<TE>   For the Angels, it was a less-than-perfect ending to a 20-game
stretch against the best teams in the American League.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels played AL Central leader Minnesota, AL West leader
Seattle, the AL East-leading Yankees and wild-card contenders Oakland
and Boston and finished with a 12-8 record.</TE>
<TE>   "This lets the league know we're for real," said closer Troy
Percival, who pitched one scoreless inning Sunday. "To have us come
out and play like we have, it shows that teams are going to have to
know that when we come into town, we're coming to play."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Sunday's loss left the Angels with a split in the four-game
series against the Yankees and a 3-4 record for the home stand. The
Angels took off for Detroit on Sunday night three games behind the
Mariners in the division race and tied with the Red Sox in the
wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still in it," Angel shortstop David Eckstein said. "We just
have to keep playing with the kind of intensity we had these past 20
games."</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees and Angels both came out swinging Sunday and were
tied, 5-5, after two innings.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Giambi drove in a run with a double, Raul Mondesi hit his
20th home run and Derek Jeter, Enrique Wilson and Bernie Williams had
run-scoring singles for the Yankees against Angel starter Ramon
Ortiz, who gave up nine hits in 4 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee left-hander David Wells fared no better. He surrendered a
three-run homer to Troy Glaus, a sacrifice fly by Tim Salmon and a
run-scoring single to Shawn Wooten. Wells, who had won his last five
decisions and had pitched at least five innings in all but one of his
previous 21 starts, lasted only two innings, his shortest outing of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams wasted scoring opportunities over the next nine innings
and each used six pitchers in the game. The Yankees stranded 15
runners, the Angels 11.</TE>
<TE>   Angel reliever Scot Shields pitched out of a jam in the 11th, but
contributed to his own undoing in the 12th by issuing three walks.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried a few different things while I was out there but nothing
worked for me today," said Shields, who was 3-0 with a 1.32
earned-run average in his previous nine appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Shields retired Nick Johnson on a ground ball to start the 12th
before walking Rondell White and Jorge Posada. He appeared to regain
his command when he struck out Jeter for the second out.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that was a pretty good sequence of pitches," Shields
said. "I thought I had found my release point. Somehow I lost it
again."</TE>
<TE>   With MVP candidate Soriano on deck, Shields walked Wilson to load
the bases.</TE>
<TE>   It looked as though Shields might escape when he got Soriano to
hit a low, outside pitch to the right side of the infield. Kennedy
dashed to his left, scooped up the ball and flipped it from his glove
to Spiezio, but umpire John Hirschbeck ruled Soriano safe as White
crossed the plate with the go-ahead run.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio fell to the ground in seeming disbelief over the call, and
that allowed Posada to score.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a good pitch, but those guys shouldn't have been on base,"
Shields said. "I'm not going away thinking we should have been out of
that inning because we should have been out of it way before if I had
made my pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Ramiro Mendoza, filling in for the injured Mariano Rivera as the
Yankees' closer, came in for the home half of the inning. He struck
out Glaus, got pinch-hitter Brad Fullmer to hit a fly ball to center
field and struck out Kennedy to earn his fourth save.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels play a makeup game against the Tigers tonight and will
play 25 of their next 32 games against teams with losing records,
before finishing the season with 20 games against AL West opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "In past years, we've played well against good teams and then gone
into cities where teams aren't playing so good and there's a
letdown," Percival said. "But I haven't seen it this year--and I
don't think I will."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Hamstring Cramps Anderson's Style</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Garret Anderson was not in the starting lineup Sunday in the Angels'
7-5, 12-inning loss to the New York Yankees because of a hamstring
cramp, marking the first time this season--and only the second time
in the last two--that the outfielder did not start.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson felt a cramp in his right hamstring while sliding during
Saturday night's victory over the Yankees. After conferring with
Manager Mike Scioscia before Sunday's game, Anderson ended his streak
of 138 consecutive starts.</LD>
<LD>   "I probably could have played, but it wasn't smart to play," said
Anderson, who could not recall the last time an injury kept him out
of the lineup.</LD>
<TE>   Alex Ochoa started in left field and Orlando Palmeiro started in
center with Darin Erstad as the designated hitter for only the fourth
time this season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rare day when you come in here and don't see [Anderson's]
name in the lineup," Scioscia said. "This guy is automatic, and when
you come to the park, if there's a game, he's playing.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time of the year it is, [with] so much baseball ahead of
us, it just makes sense to let him try to take a day and regroup and
go from there."</TE>
<TE>   With the score 5-5, Anderson pinch-hit for Shawn Wooten in the
ninth inning with one out and runners at first and second. But he
struck out against left-hander Mike Stanton, who was brought in when
Anderson was announced.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Anderson was out of the lineup only once--Aug. 29 at
Kansas City--because of a personal matter regarding one of his
children.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said he was hopeful Anderson could play tonight, at least
as designated hitter, against the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park.
But he did not rule out giving Anderson more time to recover.</TE>
<TE>   "If he needs another day, he's going to get it," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel first baseman Scott Spiezio said he got caught up in the
moment when the Yankees' Alfonso Soriano was called safe on a
bases-loaded infield single in the 12th inning with the score tied,
5-5.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio, frustrated by the call, held onto the ball after falling
to the ground. Pitcher Scot Shields frantically motioned for Spiezio
to throw the ball to the plate before taking it out of Spiezio's
glove and throwing too late to get Jorge Posada, who gave the Yankees
a 7-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "You're so into trying to get that out, I lost track," Spiezio
said. "I don't think that's ever happened to me before."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 43,455 who attended Sunday's game helped the Angels establish
a franchise record for a four-game home series.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels and Yankees drew 173,639 at Edison Field to break the
record of 173,347 set at Anaheim Stadium July 1-4, 1983, against the
Kansas City Royals.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have had 11 sellouts this season, breaking the Edison
Field record of 10 set in 1998, the year the renovated stadium
opened. The Angels have sold out 10 of their last 22 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 12-inning loss to the Yankees gave the Angels a 6-2 record in
extra-inning games this season. Their only previous defeat was a 7-6,
10-inning loss to the Minnesota Twins on May 30 in Minneapolis.</TE>

<HD>Elliott's Comeback Complete With Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ED HINTON</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Bill Elliott closed his eyes and put his hands over them, to keep the
tears back ... and heaved out one hard sob.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-seven seasons of NASCAR racing--and this was as close as
he'd ever come to weeping at a racetrack.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-three Winston Cup victories, including two Daytona 500s, yet
he made Sunday's Brickyard 400, quite clearly, the most emotional win
of his roller-coaster life.</LD>
<TE>   "It feels," he said with difficulty, "like it's taken me a
lifetime to get here."</TE>
<TE>   "Here" was a place Bill Elliott could not yet seem to pinpoint.</TE>
<TE>   But if you'd known him those 27 seasons, you knew exactly where
he'd arrived on this sweltering afternoon at Indianapolis Motor
Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   "Here" was where, at last, Elliott, 46, could actually love and
savor winning. He hadn't been able to do that in his prime.</TE>
<TE>   He'd gone from gangly, bashful North Georgia mountain youth in the
'70s ... to soaring, stunning winner out of nowhere in the '80s, with
a Huck Finn image that was never real ... to an emotional vertigo at
the height of his stardom that made him a surly, troubled winner ...
then into a decade down the slippery slope, far over the hill in the
eyes of the media--on the rare occasions he was mentioned in the
media at all.</TE>
<TE>   Winning wasn't much fun for Elliott, back when he was winning big.
Often, it even seemed to hurt. He'd squirm and wince amid gaggles of
reporters and say, "I don't know how to answer all these QUESTIONS!"</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes he seemed to wonder why he had ever ventured beyond
little Dixie Speedway in the foothills north of Atlanta. All he'd
ever wanted was to race in peace.</TE>
<TE>   And so after he arrived at the top with tremendous force, as
Awesome Bill From Dawsonville with 11 wins and the Winston Million
bonus in '85, he could find but one sanctuary from the frenzy all
around him.</TE>
<TE>   Inside his race car in those days, running flat-out, dominating
all the competition--from the aging Richard Petty to the onrushing
Dale Earnhardt--Elliott would lapse into an amazing tranquillity. He
could think, almost meditate, inside his hurtling cocoon.</TE>
<TE>   And that is how you knew Sunday afternoon that Elliott is really
back. And it's why you believed what he said after the race, when it
would have sounded contrived coming from any other driver.</TE>
<TE>   During and after his complete command of the Brickyard 400,
Elliott said, he was thinking of loved ones who had passed on: From
his grandmother--Miss Audie, they called her; she could remember the
years before moonshine cars, when the liquor was hauled out of the
hollows with mules and wagons ... to his father, George, who'd set
his three sons to racing on a shoestring budget of profits from a
junkyard and a small Ford dealership ... to his gutsy, talented
nephew Casey, his elder brother (and onetime crew chief) Ernie's son,
who was to have been the next star Elliott driver but died of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "All I could think about was all those folks.... I feel like all
those people were right there in the car with me today--from my dad,
my nephew, to my grandmother, my grandfathers--you know, just kind of
holding their hands around me, making me make the right decisions."</TE>
<TE>   He wished more than anything that they could have been here on
this day. Maybe that was because all the big winning was so troubled
when they were alive that none of them could enjoy it thoroughly,
deluged as they were by the encroachment of the American public and
media upon tiny Dawsonville, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   He wished that they could be here, now that he had learned to love
it.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a second chance in life," he said. "This man gave it to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Beside him sat Ray Evernham, the team owner who two years ago
plucked the aging Elliott off the has-been heap and injected him with
an enormous shot of faith and confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Evernham had been the crew chief who sent Jeff Gordon to stardom
in the '90s, then quit Gordon's powerful Hendrick Motorsports team in
'99 to spearhead Dodge's new factory-backed effort in NASCAR.</TE>
<TE>   Evernham saw in Elliott what many had forgotten or ignored:
Elliott hadn't lost his finest trait, his smoothness and precision,
more the touch of a Navy fighter pilot than a NASCAR driver.</TE>
<TE>   When Evernham was bringing Gordon along, "Bill would come over and
talk with us about [chassis] setups," Evernham said. Elliott in his
prime had actually done all his own work on his chassis.</TE>
<TE>   Evernham could see that Elliott knew the cars piece by piece,
inside out. And on the track, "There are just certain things that
great drivers do," Evernham said. "Like today, there were critical
things that Bill had to execute. The great ones always execute
without mistakes. Like the way he set up Rusty and passed him today."</TE>
<TE>   That winning pass on Rusty Wallace was surgical, meticulous,
impeccable. That made two victories in eight days for Elliott, who'd
won at Pocono, Pa., last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   For all Elliott's years of doldrums, Wallace wasn't in the least
surprised at the resurgence.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd seen him in the '80s, when he was flying," Wallace said.
"And Bill hasn't lost a thing."</TE>
<TE>   But he had gained the most important component of his racing
career: the joy of winning.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Trade in Their Miles for Stability</HD>

<LD>Randy Hill of Foxsports.com on the Clippers' decision to trade
popular Darius Miles to Cleveland for point guard Andre Miller. "I
understand the reluctance to embrace a farewell to Darius. The kid
can be exciting as your final car payment.... But Miller, who led the
league in assists last season, provides a legitimate floor leader
capable of steering the Clippers into the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "After reading the Clipper roster, Andre could be considered as
crucial as the only corkscrew at a wedding reception</LD>
<LD>   "So where is Miles right now? As I understand it, he's been in
Vancouver on a movie shoot. The film's working title is 'The Perfect
Score,' and--according to the Clips' media-relations crew--casts
Miles as something he never was, a college basketball player."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: How old was running back Jim Brown when he retired
from the NFL?</TE>
<TE>   Coaching while black: After six seasons with the Baltimore Ravens,
Marvin Lewis is now the defensive coordinator of the Washington
Redskins and a step closer to finally landing a head coaching job,
according to Mike Preston of the Baltimore Sun. "Lewis seems at ease
with the media. In Baltimore, he easily became annoyed with
reporters, and was more elusive than Marshall Faulk during the tough
times in his first two seasons....</TE>
<TE>   "There are no questions about who is running the show in
Washington. Head Coach Steve Spurrier has the title, but Lewis is in
basic control. He deals with salary cap issues, draft picks and even
which field to practice on. Most of Spurrier's time is used tinkering
with his toy, the offense.... Within a year or two, the Redskins will
have one of the better defenses in the league. And then maybe, just
maybe, league owners will hire Lewis as a head coach. There won't be
anything else left for him to prove."</TE>
<TE>   Nike cash: Boxer Roy Jones Jr., who endorses Nike's Brand Jordan,
decided to stage his next fight against No. 1 challenger Clinton
Woods at Portland's Rose Garden after negotiations to hold the fight
in London bogged down. Which works well for [Brand Jordan president]
Larry Miller, who made sure Nike provided enough money to make
Portland the replacement site for Jones' Sept. 7 world
light-heavyweight title defense.</TE>
<TE>   "[Jones has always] done everything we ask him to do as one of our
Brand Jordan athletes," Miller told the Oregonian. "He's a great guy
and we wanted to support him and bring something of this magnitude to
Portland, to help get people of Portland excited about boxing....
We're not getting into the boxing promotions business. It's a
one-time deal."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Brown was 30 when he retired from the Cleveland
Browns in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Kansas City Star columnist Jason Whitlock considers
Chief running back Priest Holmes a bit of an enigma. When surrounded
by reporters, Holmes doesn't offer much in interviews, but he showed
a different side this summer when he performed with a couple of
teammates at the Jim Rome Tour Stop in Kansas City. "The dignified
and deeply religious Holmes grabbed the microphone and transformed
himself into Wu-Tang Chief rapper Old Dirty Running Back.... The
crowd ate it up. And I kind of suspect that Chiefs fans would like to
see Priest add a dash of Old Dirty Running Back to his public
persona. Something tells me that as smoothly as Priest made the
transition into Old Dirty that he's not as humble in private as he is
in public."</TE>

<HD>Brown Could Return This Week</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers said Sunday they're still proceeding cautiously with
pitcher Kevin Brown, but all signs point to him rejoining the club
after his second rehabilitation start this week.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Dan Evans and Manager Jim Tracy were encouraged by
Brown's 3 2/3-inning performance Saturday in his first outing for
triple-A Las Vegas, and the right-hander is expected to start again
for the 51s either Thursday or Friday. Evans said plans for his
second start would be finalized today.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very optimistic after what I heard," Evans said. "He had no
problems with his elbow or his back, and the most encouraging part
for me was that his velocity remained consistent throughout."</LD>
<TE>   John Boles, one of Evans' senior advisors, reported that Brown's
fastball was clocked between 87-93 mph, and consistently registered
91 mph. Brown gave up one hit, one run and walked two with three
strikeouts in a 50-pitch, 32-strike performance.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, recovering from elbow and back surgeries, said he did not
experience pain while pitching. Pat Screnar, the team's physical
therapist, evaluated Brown on Sunday at Dodger Stadium, and the
program moved forward.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said that Brown, eager to be activated soon, would probably
throw about 80 pitches in his next start. The Dodgers said Brown must
be capable of working at least six innings before being activated,
and he might not have the stamina to do that, smoothly, after only
two starts in the minors.</TE>
<TE>   However, Brown has exceeded the Dodgers' expectations throughout
the process, and the longer he's out the more ornery he gets,
prompting players to believe he won't make three starts for Las
Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "A 90-pitch target is a safe target to say a guy could give you
six solid innings," Tracy said. "But then again, we've seen Kevin
Brown give us seven innings with 79 pitches. We've just got to wait
and see."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Infielder Alex Cora changed his approach in winter ball after
struggling last season, shortening his swing and focusing on
improving the quality of his at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Those adjustments helped Cora, batting .299, improve his standing
on the club despite losing the everyday shortstop job to Cesar
Izturis out of spring training. Tracy said Cora has been an asset off
the bench, and plans to utilize him more down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great that Trace said that about me, and I accept the
challenge," said Cora, who had a run-scoring single and walked twice
in a 4-3 victory against the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to accept your role, but you've got to keep pushing, and
the only way you can do that is to just perform. I've given myself a
chance on every at-bat this year, and I've probably gone from the
25th man back in spring training, to someone who Trace thinks should
be out there now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Orosco has retired nine consecutive batters. The left-handed
specialist has given up only two hits and a run in six innings,
spanning 10 appearances, since the All-Star break.... In the second
half, Adrian Beltre has seven home runs and 22 runs batted in. Shawn
Green, Eric Karros, Brian Jordan and Paul Lo Duca have combined for
six homers and 25 RBIs.... Karros, fifth on the club with nine
homers, has not hit a homer in his last 100 plate appearances. He
singled, doubled and scored Sunday.... The Dodgers have had only one
RBI from the cleanup spot in the last 23 games.</TE>

<LD>Doctors say Chick Hearn has probably called his last Laker game.</LD>
<LD>   It's probably true, yet we hold hope that Chick's fairy-tale
career has not been put in the refrigerator. Can't we keep the door
open a crack and the light on?</LD>
<LD>   Don't let the eggs cool. Don't let the butter get hard.</LD>
<TE>   The longer Hearn taunts time the longer we can pretend nothing's
changed when we know everything has. As long as we can dial in
Chick's voice, take an audio ride on that common thread, the more it
prolongs a collective youth and makes us ignore the creeping gray in
our hair.</TE>
<TE>   Chick's permeating voice is the cognitive link to a time when we
were all 10, riding a paper route, listening to the Lakers from
Boston, West vs. Havlicek, on a transistor radio attached to the

<TE>   Second thought: Yep, it took another over-the-hill gang to get
Allen into Canton.</TE>
<TE>   The voting writers unjustly snubbed Allen for years, proving he
was right when he said you never could trust rookies to get the job
done.</TE>
<TE>   Canton's senior committee finally pushed Allen through, almost the
way it was in the old days when balding and aging veterans helped
push Allen's Washington Redskins to the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Allen always believed that line about youth being wasted on the
young.</TE>
<TE>   In waiting 12 years after his death to induct Allen, the selectors
fumbled one of the old coach's favorite axioms: The Future Is Now.</TE>
<TE>   That phrase captured the essence of the man so much more than
Better Late Than Never.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rich Beem had seven birdies and made an eagle on the 17th hole to
hold off a furious rally by Steve Lowery and claim The International
on Sunday at Castle Rock, Colo.</LD>
<LD>   Beem, playing the last six holes gingerly because his back
stiffened during a rain delay of just over one hour, had a 19-point
round for a total of 44 points under the modified Stableford scoring
system used in the event.</LD>
<LD>   Beem beat Lowery by a point for his second PGA career victory. In
his final five holes, Lowery had a double eagle, an eagle and a
birdie.</LD>
<TE>   "This is awesome, I'm so happy," said Beem, who earned $810,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really pleased with the way I played coming down the
stretch," Lowery said.</TE>
<TE>   Beem birdied five holes on the front side and built a four-point
lead. He began the day three points off the pace, but took the lead
with his second birdie of the day on the fifth hole.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Barlow, the third-round leader, had double bogeys at Nos. 4
and 5. He fell to 22 points and off the leaderboard.</TE>

<TE>   Mi Hyun Kim had a late collapse but held off fellow South Korean

grandstand behind the 18th green to finish her final-round 73 for an
eight-under 208. She won $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Han's closing 70 left her at seven under, and the third member of
their playing group, Danielle Ammaccapane, finished in third place at
six under after a 72.</TE>

<HD>Intensively Caring</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Loved ones gather at hospital to support Hearn,
whose condition remains critical but stable. Doctors say broadcaster
'doing as well as can be expected' after two brain operations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As they drove across the desert from Las Vegas to their Encino home
Thursday after attending a Laker fantasy camp, team broadcaster Chick
Hearn and Marge, his wife of nearly 64 years, talked about the
future.</LD>
<LD>   "I think maybe I'd like to spend more time at home with you,"
Chick said.</LD>
<LD>   "Good, then make this season coming up your last," Marge replied.</LD>
<TE>   "I think I will," Chick said.</TE>
<TE>   Marge recalled that moment Sunday afternoon as she sat outside the
intensive-care unit at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where her
85-year-old husband remained in critical but stable condition a day
after undergoing two craniotomies to control brain hemorrhaging
following a fall Friday night at his home.</TE>
<TE>   "He is doing as well as can be expected, especially for a
gentleman his age," said Dr. Marc Kerner, chief of surgery at the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn, who remains under heavy sedation, will undergo a series of
what Kerner called "specialized tests" today to better determine his
condition.</TE>
<TE>   Neurosurgeon Asher Taban had said Saturday that, because of damage
to the left frontal area of the brain, the area that controls speech,
it was "probable" Hearn's broadcasting career was over. He has been
the Laker announcer for 42 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "If he can live a normal life, we could handle that," Marge said.
"I don't care about the games."</TE>
<TE>   Marge said her husband had desperately cared about two bichon
frise dogs the couple had owned. They had been forced to put Oliver
and Ashley, both 17, to sleep several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "All he ever talked about were those dogs," Marge said. "When he
comes home, I think I'll try to get another pair. He'd love that. I
don't want a newborn puppy, but there must be someone out there with
a one-year-old or two-year-old bichon. I think, when he comes home,
something like that will keep him out of the depression I know he
will immediately have. Anyone would have."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting with Marge over the long hours in the waiting room were
her granddaughter Shannon Hearn Newman; Shannon's husband, Louis;
Susan Stratton, who finished her 25th season as Hearn's producer in
June, and publicist Bob Steiner and his wife Mary Jane.</TE>
<TE>   Upon arriving Sunday, Steiner said he had a message for the family
from Laker owner Jerry Buss, who was in London when he received the
news of Hearn's accident. Steiner then kissed Marge on the cheek.</TE>
<TE>   Cards and calls expressing prayers and good wishes have flowed in.
Marge was handed a get-well card from a young child who had drawn
several eggs hatching, with the idea that a healthy chick would
emerge.</TE>
<TE>   One fan had intercepted Shannon and asked if he could get Hearn's
autograph for his son. He was informed that Hearn was unconscious in
intensive care. Undaunted, the fan tried again several hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Marge smiled when she was asked what it had meant to her husband
to make it back in front of the Laker microphone in April after his
streak of 3,338 consecutive games over 36 years had been broken by
open-heart surgery last December, followed by hip replacement surgery
in February. Hearn returned at the end of the season and worked every
game in the playoffs, his last broadcast being the game that clinched
the Lakers' third consecutive NBA championship.</TE>
<TE>   "He was happy he was able to do that," Marge said, "so happy."</TE>
<TE>   When she went home Saturday night, Marge said, she went into the
backyard and retraced her husband's steps over and over, trying to
determine exactly what had caused the injury.</TE>
<TE>   "We were sitting out on the pool deck drinking some juice," she
said, "and he had noticed a planter turned the wrong way."</TE>
<TE>   Marge had told him that's what they had a gardener for.</TE>
<TE>   "But he could be stubborn," she said. "I went in to fix dinner and
he must have tried to turn it himself."</TE>
<TE>   Marge said that when she looked out the window, she saw her
husband lying on the cement, inches from the swimming pool.
Apparently he had pulled on the planter, tumbled backward down two
steps and landed on the cement, hitting the back of his head.</TE>
<TE>   "A little more and he'd have gone into the water," Marge said. "I
ran out and screamed 'Francis' [his given name], but I got no
response. I shook him, jolted him, trying to get any reaction, but I
didn't get any. His eyes didn't look good."</TE>
<TE>   Marge called a neighbor, Sandy Kessler, and asked her to phone
911.</TE>
<TE>   "I went and got a blanket," Marge said, "and put it over him. I
always heard it was good to cover somebody up in a situation like
that. I didn't know what else I could do."</TE>
<TE>   Marge said she contemplated the events of the evening over and
over as she tried to get to sleep Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never really know what happened," she said, "and it doesn't
really matter."</TE>
<TE>   Marge went into intensive care to visit her husband Sunday, spoke
to him without knowing if he heard her and then returned.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's career must end sometime," she said. "But if we can
live decent lives, we'll be fine. Now, that's out of our control."</TE>

<HD>An Easy Ride in the East</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: War Emblem wins first start since Belmont and
death of Bin Salman. Medaglia d'Oro also breezes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About a half-hour after Medaglia d'Oro completed his 1 1/8-mile
"workout" at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., Kentucky Derby and Preakness
winner War Emblem finished his in New Jersey.</LD>
<LD>   Both the $500,000 Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga and the $1-million
Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park turned out to be nothing more
than well-paid exercise for the favorites in those races.</LD>
<LD>   Facing only four opponents after four late scratches--Peekskill,
Easyfromthegitgo and Medaglia d'Oro all ran earlier in the Jim
Dandy--War Emblem, the 3-10 favorite, took care of any mystery early
in the Grade I Haskell.</LD>
<TE>   Making his first start since the Belmont Stakes on June 8, when
his horrible stumble cost him whatever chance he had of becoming a
Triple Crown winner, War Emblem acted up a bit in the gate, then
broke extremely well under jockey Victor Espinoza.</TE>
<TE>   From there, it was clear the others were running for second money
of $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by the late Prince Ahmed bin Salman's Thoroughbred Corp.,
War Emblem never felt any serious pace pressure and wasn't touched by
Espinoza's whip. At the wire, he had four lengths on runner-up Magic
Weisner, completing the 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 1/5. He also had his
seventh win in 11 starts and became the first Derby winner to win the
35-year-old Haskell.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a great wedding present," said Baffert, who was married
Saturday night to the former Jill Moss. "It's great to see War Emblem
back. He's a remarkable horse and I'm glad that he showed up today.
That's the War Emblem we know. He's great for racing. We'll have to
sit down and talk with Richard [Mulhall, manager of Thoroughbred
Corp.] about what we'll do with him next. We don't want to overrace
him, so we'll pick certain spots. We'd like to have him for next
year."</TE>
<TE>   This was the second consecutive Haskell victory for Baffert and
Thoroughbred Corp. In 2001, Point Given won as the heavy favorite in
what turned out to be his final start.</TE>
<TE>   The latest win was bittersweet, because of the sudden death of Bin
Salman two weeks earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "This was in his memory," said an emotional Mulhall. "This means a
lot."</TE>
<TE>   Making his first start since finishing second behind longshot
winner Sarava in the Belmont, Medaglia d'Oro also made the lead over
a track that favored frontrunners all afternoon. Before a record
Saratoga crowd of 69,523--lured in part by a shirt giveaway--he won
by almost 14 lengths in 1:47 4/5.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Ed Gann and trained by Bobby Frankel, the 3-year-old El
Prado colt was ridden by Jerry Bailey to his third win in eight
starts. He is two for six since being purchased privately by his
current connections early in the year.</TE>
<TE>   Quest, a 16-1 shot, finished second under jockey Javier
Castellano, but was disqualified and placed last for interfering with
Iron Deputy in the stretch run. Iron Deputy clipped heels after Quest
drifted in and rider Richard Migliore fell to the ground hard.
Migliore was taken to a hospital and complained of pain in his right
arm. The rider broke the same arm in a spill at Belmont Park in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the disqualification, Gold Dollar, a 22-1 shot, was
moved up to second and Essence Of Dubai, a 14-1 outsider, was placed
third.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baffert failed in the other stake he was supposed to win Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Congaree, the even-money favorite in the $250,000 San Diego
Handicap, faded to third in the stretch after setting the pace and
the Grade II fell into the lap of 14-1 shot Grey Memo.</TE>
<TE>   Outrun early the 5-year-old son of Memo circled the pack and drew
away in the stretch to win in 1:43 2/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. Eddie
Delahoussaye rode for trainer Warren Stute and a partnership that
includes breeder Ridgeley Farm.</TE>
<TE>   This was only the third win in the last 19 starts for Grey Memo,
but he does make his victories count. His other 2002 win came March
23 in the $1-million Godolphin Mile in Dubai. He has now earned more
than $1.3 million.</TE>

<LD>Nine days after baseball and two days after football had their
hall-of-fame inductions, horse racing will get into the act today at
Saratoga Springs, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   The ceremony will take place this morning at the National Museum
of Racing and Hall of Fame and those being inducted are Cigar,
Serena's Song and Noor, along with trainer Bud Delp and the late
jockey Jack Westrope.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by the late Allen Paulson and trained by Bill Mott for the
most successful part of his career, Cigar equaled a modern-day record
by winning 16 consecutive races between the fall of 1994 and the
summer of 1996. His victory streak, which had matched the streak of
Citation set more than 45 years earlier, ended when he was beaten by
Dare and Go in the 1996 Pacific Classic at Del Mar.</LD>
<TE>   Serena's Song was a winner of 11 Grade I races in her career for
owners Bob and Beverly Lewis and trainer Wayne Lukas, and Noor won 12
times between 1947-50.</TE>
<TE>   Delp is best known for training Spectacular Bid, one of the best
horses of all time, and Westrope won more than 2,400 races before
being killed at Hollywood Park in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   After the inductions, a small but well-matched group of six
3-year-olds will get together in the $150,000 National Museum of
Racing Hall of Fame Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on the turf. Smoked Em
and Dubai Tiger were also entered in the race, but will run only if
the bad weather forces a switch to the main track.</TE>
<TE>   Heading the field are Chiselling, the winner of the Lexington
Handicap in his stakes debut last month for Bobby Frankel, and
Patrol, a perfect three for three since being introduced to the turf
by Mott earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The sixth at Del Mar marks the California debut
of Big Apple, a $2-million yearling purchase by the late Prince Ahmed
Salman's Thoroughbred Corporation. The son of Deputy Minister broke
his maiden at Churchill Downs May 25. There is a pick six carryover
of $230,217 to spice up what is probably the worst card of the first
two weeks of the meet.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Greg Gilchrist. The trainer won six of his first 15
starters at Santa Rosa.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Victor Carrero. The apprentice jockey, who was hot at
Belmont Park, was only two for 47 to begin Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: Exactas in the fifth keying Luxury Jewels
with Davene and Wicked Mood.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/23. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $14/$145.80. Total money bet: $190.</TE>

<HD>Morariu Still Encouraged</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Corina Morariu's comeback continued Sunday with her first singles
match in over a year.</LD>
<LD>   The 24-year-old was encouraged despite dropping a 4-1 lead in the
third set as Marie-Gaianeh Mikaelian of Switzerland rallied to win,
3-6, 6-3, 7-5, in the first round of the JPMorgan Chase Open tennis
tournament Sunday at Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Before returning to the tour two weeks ago, Morariu had spent 15
months laid up either in a hospital or at home in Boca Raton, Fla.,
being treated for acute promyelocytic leukemia.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought I played well after 15 months of not playing," she
said. "Unfortunately, I just couldn't close it out."</TE>
<TE>   The cancer now in remission, Morariu and partner Kimberly
Po-Messerli played doubles last week in the Acura Classic at
Carlsbad, losing their first-round match in three sets to Chanda
Rubin and Meghann Shaughnessy. Sunday's match lasted 2 hours 25
minutes. "I definitely had her. I'm disappointed, but obviously I'm
not devastated. I've had worse things happen in my life, so I have
that perspective. It's just a matter of playing matches," said
Morariu, who also will play doubles at Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Mikaelian won six of the last seven games after being down a
break, at 4-1, in the third set. She won her first WTA tournament
title in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, last month, and rallied against
Morariu after taking a medical timeout between the first and second
sets, when she called on a trainer to massage a strained lower back.</TE>
<TE>   In other matches, Amy Frazier, Meilen Tu and Marissa Irvin also
prevailed. Frazier defeated Barbara Schett of Austria, 6-4, 6-4. Tu,
a Granada Hills High graduate, topped Tatiana Poutchek of Belarus,
6-2, 7-6 (2). Irvin, a Santa Monica resident and Studio City
Harvard-Westlake High graduate, routed qualifier Greta Arn of
Germany, 6-0, 6-3.</TE>

<HD>Two Drivers Face Disciplinary Action</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Saturday night's race card at Irwindale Speedway was one of the
wildest in the facility's four-year existence. And at the end, two of
the drivers in the Jani-King Super Late Model series were facing
disciplinary action, and the leader of the Grand American Modified
series found himself finished for the season.</LD>
<LD>   Super Late Model drivers Tommy Fry and Ben Walker each face
hearings today with the track's race director, Lester Boyer, after
incidents during the shortened main event. Fry was black-flagged from
the race for rough driving on Lap 5, which started a chain-reaction
collision that took out five cars. Fry was disqualified.</LD>
<LD>   Forty laps later, Walker, the Miller Lite Big Ten Challenge Series
leader, had his engine explode going into Lap 45, sending his car
careening into the infield grass. Walker struggled with the fire
safety crew as they attempted to keep him from returning to the car.</LD>
<TE>   Roger Carufel Jr., of Santa Clarita, the Grand American Modified
points leader, was suspended from the track for the rest of the
season and had his points erased following his refusal to accept a
$750 claim on his engine by driver Robert Rice, as permitted by
NASCAR and Irwindale Speedway rules. Tony Solorzano</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tony Stewart's temper got the best of him yet again when he
punched a photographer after the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis.
NASCAR spokesman Jim Hunter said the sanctioning body was
investigating the incident and he would not speculate on any
penalties Stewart might face. ... John Force defeated Ron Capps in
one of four final-round photo finishes in the NHRA Nationals at
Sonoma, Calif. Force covered the quarter-mile in 4.953 seconds at
303.09 mph to Capps' 4.956 at 300.46 in the funny car final.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Herbert won for the first time in more than a year in top
fuel, Larry Morgan won his first pro stock title since 1994 and Craig
Treble posted his fourth pro stock motorcycle victory this season.</TE>

<HD>Angels Hope to Finish What They Started</HD>

<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would be nice to say that the only thing the Angels have to fear
in their ongoing attempt to reach the postseason is Don Fehr himself,
but it's not that simple.</LD>
<LD>   They are still three games behind Seattle in the American League
West, still in a wild-card dogfight with Boston and Oakland, still
have 52 games left and, yes, still face the specter of their union
leader, whom they are under peer pressure to support, soon setting a
strike date that could interrupt--or even end--their special season
before they have exorcised the ghosts of so many previous seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiations resume in New York today, and Fehr could ask his
executive board to set a strike date by midweek--or by next week at
the latest, depending on developments.</LD>
<TE>   If a date is not set until next week, it is likely to be Sept. 1
or Sept. 16. If it is set Tuesday or Wednesday, it could be as soon
as Aug. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Any interruption, Angel right fielder Tim Salmon said Sunday,
"would be a disappointment, of course, but I've honestly been focused
on the game. In my heart of hearts, I just can't believe they won't
get together and get something done. I'm cautiously optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   It has reached the point where it is impossible to escape the
labor shadow, just as it was impossible again Sunday to escape the
October overtones as the New York Yankees beat the Angels, 7-5, in 12
tense innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels rued the loss, their ultimate inability to overcome
another struggling start by the enigmatic Ramon Ortiz, to produce a
run over the final 10 innings and to do more than split a four-game
series that was sold out from start to finish.</TE>
<TE>   But in the big picture, they completed a 20-game crucible against
the American League's best teams with a 12-8 record and sent the
Yankees back to the Bronx with a calling card similar to the one they
laid on Seattle in winning five of six earlier in the 20-game span.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels continue to prove they can compete.</TE>
<TE>   "We're good enough to beat any team anywhere," Salmon said. "We're
good enough to be a postseason team."</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees know the postseason. Manager Joe Torre wasn't making
any predictions about encountering the Angels in October, but he said
they are as competitive as any his team has faced.</TE>
<TE>   "They're energetic, managed very well, know what's expected of
them, don't back off from a challenge and play unselfishly," Torre
said. "I give a lot of credit to [Angel Manager] Mike Scioscia
because that's the way he played. I mean, we haven't ever played
particularly well here, but that's not to take anything away from the
Angels. They certainly make you work hard to beat them."</TE>
<TE>   It took 4 hours 47 minutes Sunday, and if it could have ended
better for the Angels, it didn't shake Scioscia's belief in his team
or prompt him to disavow his one-at-a-time mantra.</TE>
<TE>   Across the clubhouse Sunday, as Salmon was calling the 20-game
stretch the Angels had just finished "probably our biggest challenge
to this point" and a "make-or-break span I certainly don't think
broke us," Scioscia sat in his office and insisted he "didn't need to
see us play these teams to know how we'd do. I mean, no matter how we
did it wasn't going to change my opinion that we have a
championship-caliber team. We just need to keep our vision on the
game coming up."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels left Sunday night for Detroit, Chicago and Toronto, and
the letdown risk has strangled the Angels in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "We're within striking distance, but the next test is to beat the
teams we should beat," Salmon said. "People are excited, talking
about us, coming to the games. That's a pretty good indication of how
well we're playing, but we've got to keep playing well. That's what
Seattle does, what the Yankees do. They come to play every day."</TE>
<TE>   There are scouts and others who have questioned whether the
talented Ortiz brings his intensity and focus to every start. It is
difficult to believe he wouldn't have had both with a full house at
Edison Field and the Yankees in the batter's box, but he perpetuated
his second half struggle by giving up nine hits, five runs and his
major league-high 31st homer in 4 1/3 innings and 96 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   In his last five starts, as Jarrod Washburn continues to soar past
him on the developmental ladder, Ortiz has given up 37 hits, 22
earned runs and five homers in 24 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Bud Black made two trips to the mound during the
right-hander's brief stint against the Yankees, delivering long
lectures each time.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia would later acknowledge that Ortiz lacked presence, but
said his recent struggle is strictly a matter of mechanics, flying
open with his front shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a click off," the manager said, "but when he's on, he's
shown us that he can run the table, put seven or eight good starts
together. His last four or five haven't been great, but you have to
look at the [final package of] 32 or 33 and where he's going to end
up."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but it's going to be difficult looking if the rest are
like the last five.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, in a game tied, 5-5, after two innings, Ortiz forced
Scioscia to go to the largely anonymous relievers in his bullpen
earlier than he would have liked, but Brendan Donnelly and Ben Weber
came up big again, working 3 2/3 scoreless innings before Troy
Percival and Al Levine each pitched a scoreless inning and Scott
Shields pitched another only to walk three batters in the 12th,
leading to the decisive runs.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Percival, the Angels head into the stretch with a
basically untested relief corps, and they have been somewhat
sensitive about media comments on that and the failure to add a
seasoned reliever before the non-waiver deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Was it a mistake? Time will tell, providing Fehr doesn't decide
time is up.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guillermo Canas defeated Andy Roddick, 6-4, 7-5, Sunday in the final
of the $2.95-million Tennis Masters Canada at Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   Canas became the first player from Argentina to win the Canadian
ATP Tour event since Guillermo Vilas in 1976.</LD>
<LD>   The unseeded Canas, ranked 20th, defeated five seeded players and
earned $392,000 for the title. He won his second title of the season
and the third of his career.</LD>
<TE>   "Day by day, I felt more confidence in my game," the 24-year-old
Canas said. "It's nice to feel you can beat anybody on the tour.
Maybe I surprised myself. I knew before that I could do it, but I
never did it. It feels great to beat five of the top 10 players in
the world in one tournament."</TE>
<TE>   The 19-year-old Roddick, ranked No. 12, made 26 unforced errors.
Canas made only six.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't give you anything," Roddick said.</TE>
<TE>   Canas dropped onto his back after the final point. He then threw

<KH>AROUND THE NFL</KH>
<HD>Tonight Marks First for Texans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OK, Houston Texans. Let's see if you're ready for some NFL football.</LD>
<LD>   The league's newest expansion team will take another historic step
tonight, when the Texans make their exhibition season debut against
the New York Giants in the Hall of Fame game at Canton, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   "It will be the first time anyone has seen the Texans," Coach Dom
Capers said. "Right now, nobody knows a thing about the Houston
Texans."</LD>
<TE>   We're about to learn. On prime time national TV. In broadcaster
John Madden's debut with partner Al Michaels in ABC's Monday night
booth. And against the Giants, a veteran team eager to put a 7-9
season behind.</TE>
<TE>   It would be understandable if the Texans were feeling a little
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   No time for that though.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know how fast you're going to progress, but the most
important thing is you continue to progress," Capers said. "These
guys have been working hard, and now they've got to get ready for the
Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have much time to sit around and evaluate this. We have
to look forward to the next game."</TE>
<TE>   It's been nearly three years since the league awarded Houston an
expansion franchise, and now the Texans will get a chance to showcase
what they've been up to.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie quarterback David Carr, the No. 1 overall pick in April's
draft, is expected to play the first few series, but Capers said
Houston will keep its game plan "fairly simple."</TE>
<TE>   The Texans have been pleased with Carr's progress, and their young
quarterback won over a few more teammates by jumping into the middle
of a fight with the Dallas Cowboys on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "You see your center on the ground and somebody on top of him and
you step in to help," Carr said. "It just shows you how far we've
come as a team."</TE>
<TE>   Houston's defense is eager to get off on the right foot too.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to see where we are," linebacker Kevin Mitchell said.
"It's time to stop talking and take this chance to see how far along
we are as a defense. We've got a lot of young guys who are going to
have to learn to be aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Jet defensive end John Abraham received treatment for his
sprained left knee Sunday and will undergo an MRI today.</TE>
<TE>   The injury, sustained in practice Saturday, typically causes a
player to miss anywhere from 10 days to three months, according to
Dr. Nicholas DiNubile, spokesman for the American Academy of
Orthopedic Surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Bear starting right guard Chris Villarrial will miss 10
days of training camp after undergoing surgery on his broken right
thumb Saturday. Villarrial, 29, was injured in practice on Friday.
He's started 73 of the 74 games he's played over the last five
seasons.</TE>

<HD>Bonds' Homer Total Is at 598</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds is two away from historic home run No. 600. He might have
passed that number a long time ago if he had played his Pittsburgh
years in PNC Park.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds took advantage of the short right-field porch there to hit
his 598th career homer, one of six San Francisco home runs, and J.T.
Snow had a three-run shot and five runs batted in as the Giants
roughed up the Pirates, 10-5, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds went three for four and scored three times, homering for the
second game in a row. His 31st home run of the season led off the
ninth inning and left him two short of joining Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth
and Willie Mays as the only players with 600.</LD>
<TE>   "Things happen so fast in my career," Bonds said. "I remember
hitting No. 400 when [Jim] Leyland was managing the Marlins, and now
I'm two away from 600, and that [No. 400] doesn't seem that long ago.
Time has gone by so fast."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds has four homers in six games at PNC Park, which opened last
year--nine years after he left the Leyland-managed Pirates to play in
San Francisco. He hit No. 597 on Saturday night, and just missed
another homer later in the game when a long drive fell at the base of
the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he would have liked playing his seven Pirate seasons in
PNC, he said, "Oh, yeah.... This is a small ballpark."</TE>
<TE>   Snow hit a two-run double in the second against Kris Benson (4-6),
then followed with a three-run homer during a five-run sixth.</TE>
<TE>   After going all season without hitting consecutive homers until
Saturday night, when Kent and Snow did it in an 11-6 victory, the
Giants hit three in a row in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Sanders followed Snow's drive with his 16th, and David Bell
greeted reliever Josias Manzanillo with his second of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 15, San Diego 10--Russell Branyan homered three times
and scored the go-ahead run on Brandon Larson's ninth-inning single
off Trevor Hoffman at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Branyan hit a two-run homer in the first inning and a solo home
run in the fourth off Padre starter Bobby J. Jones. Branyan then hit
a two-run homer in the seventh off reliever Mike Holtz as the Reds
overcame a five-run deficit to tie the score, 10-10.</TE>
<TE>   With a chance to tie the major league record for homers in a game,
Branyan was walked in the ninth by Hoffman (1-4) after a single by
Austin Kearns.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 4, Colorado 1--Mark Prior struck out 13 in his first
career complete game, pitching a five-hitter to lead the Cubs at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Prior (5-3), in his 14th career start, took a shutout into the
eighth inning. He walked two and finished the game by striking out
Jack Cust for the third time on his 136th pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 12, New York 7--Luis Gonzalez hit a tiebreaking three-run
homer in the seventh inning off Mark Guthrie (5-1) to lift the
Diamondbacks at New York. Arizona has won 11 of 13.</TE>
<TE>   Ty Wigginton, recalled by the Mets from the minors earlier in the
day to replace ailing Roberto Alomar at second base, was four for
five with a homer and double.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 5, Montreal 4--Kirk Saarloos won his fourth consecutive
start and got his first career RBIs with a two-run double to lead the
Astros at Montreal before 20,027 for a Gary Carter bobblehead
promotion.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 7, Milwaukee 2--Kevin Millar had a homer and three RBIs to
lead the Marlins at Miami.</TE>

<HD>Sheffield Puts Away Cardinals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Cardinals finally got a hit off Damian Moss. It didn't
do them any good.</LD>
<LD>   The Australian left-hander gave up only one hit in eight innings,
and the Atlanta Braves beat the Cardinals, 2-1, on Gary Sheffield's
leadoff homer in the ninth Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   The Braves, running away in the NL East, won their sixth in a row
and swept the three-game series against the Central-leading
Cardinals.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, St. Louis has a five-game losing streak, tying its season
high and bringing second-place Cincinnati within two games.</TE>
<TE>   Moss pitched seven no-hit innings in his other appearance against
the Cardinals on May 3. He was lifted after throwing 116 pitches and
didn't get a decision as the Braves won 2-1 in 11 innings.</TE>
<TE>   These days, hardly anyone is hitting Moss. In his last three
starts, the rookie has given up four hits in 22 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been one of those guys who gave up a lot of hits,"
Moss said. "I don't know what it is because I've never faced myself.
I can't explain it."</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals can't figure him out either.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy on the other side was awesome," said St. Louis starter
Andy Benes, who gave up only four hits in 7 1/3 innings. "There are
days when you have to go out and win the game 1-0."</TE>
<TE>   The Braves scored the tying run in the eighth and Sheffield gave
Atlanta the victory, hitting a 397-foot shot into the left-field
stands to lead off the ninth against Dave Veres (4-7).</TE>
<TE>   Down 0-and-2 in the count, Sheffield basically hit the ball
one-handed, lunging at a split-finger fastball that didn't break
outside far enough.</TE>
<TE>   "When the count is in your favor, you can take a shot for the
fences," he said. "I was just trying to make contact."</TE>
<TE>   Veres was stunned when the ball sailed over the fence.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take that pitch nine out of 10 times," he said. "It was two
inches in front of the plate and two inches outside. It's amazing he
could hit it that hard that far."</TE>
<TE>   John Smoltz (2-2) got the victory with a scoreless ninth, but Moss
did most of the work with another dominating performance. Mike
Matheny had the lone hit for the Cardinals, a third-inning single
that led to an unearned run.</TE>
<TE>   Benes took a shutout into the eighth, but was taken out after
Henry Blanco's one-out double off the left-field wall.</TE>
<TE>   The slow-running Blanco was replaced by Jason Marquis, a starting
pitcher who got the victory Saturday. That proved to be a key move.</TE>
<TE>   Marquis stayed put when Michael Crudale struck out pinch-hitter
Matt Franco on three pitches. But Rafael Furcal, who barely missed
making the third out when a foul pop dropped between three players,
singled up the middle to bring home the tying run.</TE>
<TE>   Matheny blocked the plate and Cardinal Manager Tony La Russa
argued that Marquis never touched home. But umpire Jeff Nelson ruled
that the sliding runner barely nicked the plate with his left foot
before tumbling over backward.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to push his front leg out of the way," Marquis said.
"By the time he tagged me, I was already by him."</TE>

<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>It was on the second point of the final game of the last set of
Sunday's Acura Classic final.</LD>
<LD>   Even though she had an upset stomach and an aching body, Jelena
Dokic was driven to keep plotting winning shots on each point. So
Dokic hit a nice forehand return of serve. She pushed her opponent
farther and farther back on the court. She kept her opponent running,
on the defensive.</LD>
<LD>   When the opponent had to lunge forward to scoop a forehand back,
Dokic played a beautiful lob. The ball climbed high, toward the sun,
and dropped gently on the baseline. The opponent swung, all long arms
and desperation and the ball came back. Dokic didn't give up. She hit
a drop shot, a clever ploy against almost any player who had been
pinned so deep by a lob.</LD>
<TE>   "In two steps she was there," Dokic said later, in awe and
wonderment. "What can you do?"</TE>
<TE>   The opponent ended up winning the point. Dokic walked back to the
service line. She was laughing.</TE>
<TE>   What else could she do?</TE>
<TE>   A desperate search for signs of life from the non-Williams portion
of the women's tour has proven hopeless so far this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams, the opponent, won her third consecutive Acura
Classic title. She beat Dokic, 6-2, 6-2, in 55 minutes. The title was
Williams' 27th. Williams keeps track of the numbers even if history
isn't in her sights yet. For example, Martina Navratilova has won 167
tournaments. Williams has four Grand Slam titles. Margaret Smith
Court has 24.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, Williams said, if she had started taking tennis more
seriously when she was younger, the record chase might seem more
compelling.</TE>
<TE>   "But then," Williams said, "I might be tired of tennis by now."</TE>
<TE>   There is a sense of purpose to Williams. She is 22, a young woman
who is aware of her responsibilities and her place in the game. And
that place is on top everywhere and all the time except when her
younger sister, Serena, is playing.</TE>
<TE>   Her opponents speak of being able to beat Williams only if, as
Dokic said, "she commits 50 or 60 unforced errors."</TE>
<TE>   Looking ahead to Sunday's final, Lindsay Davenport had said: "It's
hard to imagine Venus not winning. Is that mean to say?"</TE>
<TE>   Not at all.</TE>
<TE>   All the vanquished women here left as happy losers, which is a
mark of Williams' domination.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic beat Jennifer Capriati in three tough sets, then came back
12 hours later to beat Anna Kournikova in an emotional matchup in
which the crowd impassionedly backed Kournikova.</TE>
<TE>   This was a good week for the 19-year-old who has advanced her
career in spite of her father-coach, Damir, who has a history of
drunken and abusive behavior at tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Kournikova made it to the semifinals of a big tournament for the
first time in forever and she couldn't stop smiling, even after
losing to Dokic. Finally, it seems, Kournikova has decided to be
serious about nurturing the fabulous athletic ability she has.
Kournikova has the graceful speed of Steffi Graf and the creativity
to hit solid volleys and exceptional drop shots.</TE>
<TE>   If only Kournikova could conjure up Graf's mental fortitude and
find, somewhere, the desire to work into top physical shape.
Kournikova always seems to have a muscle pull or the need to have
some body part wrapped tightly.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport is not used to taking beatings like the one Williams
gave her Saturday night, 6-2, 6-1. But this was Davenport's second
tournament after a nine-month injury layoff. She still is searching
for her serve and trying to regain her timing. Reaching the
semifinals of her first two tournaments left Davenport relatively
content.</TE>
<TE>   The Williams' sisters, Venus and Serena, have an entirely
different outlook. Everybody else is looking for nuggets of joy in
the debris of their losses to the sisters. Venus and Serena march
ahead counting the days until they get to the finals of another Grand
Slam.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic bravely said that she was "not so far away" from beating
Venus or Serena. Some tightening up on her groundstrokes, a little
more power on her serves and returns, "minimal changes," Dokic said,
"would make a big difference."</TE>
<TE>   After knee surgery in January, Davenport has returned to the
tennis court in the best condition of her life. She is thinner than
she has ever been, the better to run down those Williams' pounding
groundstrokes, and she has been a champion, a three-time Grand Slam
winner, a former No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   But after losing to Venus Saturday night, Davenport said that what
she had faced from Venus, in terms of power and variety and
steadiness, "was on another level" higher than anybody she had played
in the previous two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Seles is injured, again. Jennifer Capriati has become
heavier and slower and crankier in the last six months. Capriati had
nothing much to offer in the third set against Dokic here in the
quarterfinals. She is losing serious ground to Venus and Serena.</TE>
<TE>   This week Serena returns to the WTA tour at the Manhattan Beach
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   From where will her challenge come? Kim Clijsters won a set from
Venus here. Could she win two from Serena? Maybe Davenport's progress
will go warp speed. In any case, the search for life continues.</TE>

<HD>Newport Water Polo Wins Senior Title</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Newport Water Polo Foundation, behind a barrage of outside shooting
and a stingy defense, defeated New York Athletic Club, 8-5, in the
final of the U.S. Men's Senior Water Polo Championships on Sunday at
Corona del Mar High in Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Newport, which had relied on the play of two-meter man Ryan Bailey
for much of the tournament, went to the outside shooting of Jeff
Powers in the final. Powers, a national team member, scored five
goals in the final, three of them from outside 15 feet.</LD>
<LD>   Bailey, a 2000 Olympian and considered among the top two-meter men
in the country, had two goals against New York, only one from the
two-meter hole.</LD>
<TE>   Powers and Bailey were selected co-most valuable players of the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "They started double- and triple-teaming [Bailey] so we went
outside," Powers said. "We were expecting something like that. The
more experienced teams know who Ryan is."</TE>
<TE>   Newport goalie Gemai Kerr, a member of the national team, had 10
saves and the Newport defense had 10 steals.</TE>
<TE>   New York, the defending champion and winner of three of the last
five titles, converted only two of seven man-advantage opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a real team out here," Newport Coach Ted Newland said.
"New York has players from all over the world but we're all local
guys from UC Irvine. That makes a big, big difference."</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERICHO, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Hubert Green made a 25-foot birdie putt on the seventh playoff hole
Sunday to beat Hale Irwin and win the Long Island Classic.</LD>
<LD>   Green and Irwin began the final round tied and each shot a 68 to
finish with a 14-under 199 at the par-71 Meadow Brook Club</LD>
<LD>   It was Green's fourth victory as a senior and first since 2000. He
earned $255,000 to lift his total for the year to $830,515, his
second best total in seven years on the tour.</LD>
<TE>   Green's winning putt was a downhill one and it came on the fourth
time the two played the par-three 18th hole Sunday. Each had parred
the 167-yard hole the first three times, but Irwin's chip from pin
high went just by the hole.</TE>
<TE>   They played a playoff rotation of Nos. 18, 12 and 13, the latter
two par-fours, twice with all pars until the deciding hole.</TE>
<TE>   It was the seventh playoff on the tour this year and third in as
many weeks. Irwin lost to Bob Gilder on the first extra hole at the
SBC Senior Open in Chicago last week.</TE>

<HD>Two Clubs Vie for Ronaldo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brazilian striker Ronaldo is the subject of a $100-million tug-of-war
between the club that owns him, Inter Milan of Italy, and the club
that wants him, defending European champion Real Madrid of Spain.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, Inter's owner, Massimo Moratti, said in an interview
with La Republica newspaper that he did not believe reports that
Ronaldo wanted to leave Inter, which acquired him from Barcelona in
1997 for $27.9 million.</LD>
<LD>   And even if he does, Moratti said, Inter is not interested in
selling him.</LD>
<TE>   "Inter [has] no intention of giving in on this," he said. "He is
not for sale. We have only fixed a base price, below which we would
not go, and that begins at 100-million euros ($98.91 million)."</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo, 25, is on vacation in Brazil and is not expected back in
Milan until later this week. But his agent, Alexander Martin, told
the Spanish sports daily Marca on Friday that the 2002 World Cup's
leading goal scorer wants a change of scenery.</TE>
<TE>   "Ronaldo is sad in Italy," he said. "He has had four unhappy years
there and he doesn't feel it is going to change next season."</TE>
<TE>   Martin said negotiations between the clubs are at a "very advanced
stage," but the price remains an issue.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid's president, Florentino Perez, bought Portuguese
midfielder Luis Figo from Barcelona for $56.1 million in 2000 and
French midfielder Zinedine Zidane from Juventus for $64.45 million in
2001, but is balking at the nearly $100-million price tag Moratti has
slapped on Ronaldo.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid, which lost to Bayern Munich of Germany, 1-0, on
Sunday in the final of its four-team Centenary Tournament in front of
60,000 at Madrid, also is interested in acquiring Mexico defender
Rafael Marquez.</TE>
<TE>   Honduras to Conduct Investigation</TE>
<TE>   The Honduran government is launching an investigation to determine
whether players on the country's national team accepted bribes to
lose a vital World Cup qualifying match to Mexico in November.</TE>
<TE>   Honduras, which needed only a tie to qualify for Korea/Japan '02,
lost the Nov. 11 game, 3-0, in Mexico City, allowing Mexico to reach
the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors have surfaced that the outcome was influenced by bribes and
the Honduran Congress has authorized an investigation. Honduras
defeated Mexico, 3-1, in Honduras in an earlier qualifying game in
June.</TE>
<TE>   "A motion was unanimously approved for Congress' sports commission
to investigate," a congressional spokesman told Reuters. "And
anticorruption authorities have also been asked to open a probe into
the elimination of the team from the 2002 World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   North Korea Will Play South Korea</TE>
<TE>   Only a few weeks after a gunboat battle between the two countries,
South Korea announced that North Korea has agreed to a match between
the national teams Sept. 8 at the World Cup stadium in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement followed three days of negotiations in North
Korea aimed at improving relations between the two nations. North
Korea and South Korea have not played each other since playing two
games in Pyongyang and Seoul in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Australia Seeks to Stage World Cup</TE>
<TE>   Australia officially entered the race to stage the World Cup in
2014, the same year the United States would like to play host to
soccer's premier event.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, president of FIFA, was at the announcement
ceremony on the steps of the Sydney Opera House and called
Australia's bid "a realistic initiative."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the hugely successful men's and women's soccer
tournaments at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, Australia staged the FIFA
World Youth Championship in 1981 and 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The states of New South Wales and Victoria will spearhead the bid,
but Basil Scarsella, the Australian who Saturday was elected
president of the Oceania Football Confederation, said New Zealand
conceivably could be a joint host in 2014, based on the success of
2002 co-hosts South Korea and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Gascoigne Spurns Offer</TE>
<TE>   English midfielder Paul Gascoigne, who last week was turned away
by D.C. United of Major League Soccer, has rejected an offer to play
from Darlington in the English third division.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul does not want to play in Division Three, it's as simple as
that," said Ian Elliott, his agent.</TE>
<TE>   Gascoigne, 35, also has been approached by Dundee of the Scottish
Premier League.</TE>
<TE>   Gomes Returns to Benfica</TE>
<TE>   Portugal World Cup striker Nuno Gomes, 26, has rejoined Benfica of
the Portuguese league after spending the last two seasons with
Fiorentina in Italy. Gomes signed a four-year contract, but the terms
were not revealed.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorentina, fighting bankruptcy for several seasons, last week
folded after 76 years in existence when it could no longer stave off
creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Picerni Fired in Brazil</TE>
<TE>   Jair Picerni, who coached Sao Caetano to the final of the Copa
Libertadores, only to lose the South American club championship on
penalty kicks to Olimpia of Paraguay on Wednesday, has been fired by
the Brazilian club.</TE>

<HD>Sparks' Win Leaves a Lot to Be Desired</HD>
<DH>WNBA: They blow 17-point first-half lead, then rally from
six-point deficit in last six minutes to beat Utah, 90-86.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lately it seems as if the Sparks are trying their best to spoil their
great achievements.</LD>
<LD>   Two home games ago, Lisa Leslie's shining moment with the first
dunk in WNBA history was tarnished by a loss to Miami. Then on Sunday
against Utah, they set a league record for points in a first half but
managed to let the Starzz threaten to continue their losing streak at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Latasha Byears' putback with 11 seconds left helped the Sparks end
their two-game home drought and escape with a 90-86 victory Sunday
night after blowing a 17-point lead. The win enabled them to pull one
game ahead of idle Houston heading into a first-place showdown
against the Comets Thursday night at home. It also sent the 12,306
home with smiles on their faces. But did it please the Sparks? Not at
all.</LD>
<TE>   "We got the win," Spark Coach Michael Cooper said. "There's
nothing we can be happy about other than that."</TE>
<TE>   After 20 minutes, the Sparks (22-6) looked as if they were about
to repeat their July 7 performance against the Starzz in which they
tied their club record of 102 points in a 27-point rout. They scored
a league-best 55 points in the first half, making 58.1% of their
shots.</TE>
<TE>   Everything seemed to come easy. Lisa Leslie passed her four-point
output Saturday against Sacramento in the first minute and had a
game-high 26. Point guard Nikki Teasley left Starzz defenders
stumbling on the court with dazzling moves. Even little-used reserve
Vedrana Grgin-Fonseca had eight points, including a three-point shot
that gave them a 55-38 lead late in the half.</TE>
<TE>   They were speeding past Utah. Then they let up off the pedal.</TE>
<TE>   "People got comfortable," said Mwadi Mabika, who had 25 points.
"We thought it was going to come easy."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Utah (18-10) charged back with a 20-5 run to open the
second half. Reserve Semeka Randall had 12 of her 16 points after
intermission, two coming on a jumper that gave the Starzz their first
lead with 13:01 left. The Starzz, who needed a victory to stay in the
race for the Western Conference title, pushed the lead to six on
Marie Ferdinand's layup with 6:01 left.</TE>
<TE>   "Our first half was perfect, but Utah kept fighting back," Leslie
said. "I looked over and saw [their players] dancing on the sideline.
We got motivated, we had to get this game."</TE>
<TE>   Mabika sensed the urgency. She had a spinning layup, a
three-pointer and a baseline jumper in a 10-2 run that put the Sparks
back ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Randall tied the score, 83-83, with two free throws, but Leslie
made four free throws for a four-point lead with 49 seconds
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Azzi sank a three-pointer to trim the lead. The Sparks
then struggled to get into their offense at the other end, and Mabika
was forced into a bad three-point try with the shot clock running
down. Byears caught the ball under the basket and laid it in as the
shot clock sounded for an 89-86 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks' defense finally showed up at the end. Their forced a
jump ball, which Leslie easily tapped to Mabika. Utah had to foul,
and Mabika made the second shot to secure a less-than-satisfying
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We get complacent when we get a big lead like that," Cooper said.
"We get into bad habits. We need to get that killer instinct and put
teams away.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a 16-point lead against Houston earlier in the year and
let them come back. The good teams aren't going to let that happen."</TE>
<TE>   Ferdinand led Utah with 25 points, and Adrienne Goodson and
Natalie Williams each added 13. But Starzz Coach Candi Harvey wasn't
thrilled with her team.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got to make up their minds that they want to play,"
Harvey said.</TE>

<HD>Robb Wipes Out His Can't-Win Reputation</HD>
<DH>Surfing: Ten-year pro is victorious in Philips U.S. Open at
Huntington Beach, his first title on World Qualifying Series tour and
second overall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surfing has taken Kalani Robb to hundreds of hard-to-reach places
during his 10-year professional career. The victory stand wasn't
supposed to be one of them.</LD>
<LD>   But Robb finally got there, too, on Sunday at the Philips U.S.
Open in Huntington Beach. He won the men's final in dwindling two- to
three-foot surf alongside the pier, earning his second professional
victory and first on the World Qualifying Series tour.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll start adding them up now," said Robb, 25, a resident of
Oahu's North Shore.</LD>
<TE>   Robb's only other victory came two years ago at the Rio Surf
International in Brazil, an event on the more competitive World
Championship Tour. He said he's trying to go deeper into contests by
taking a more serious approach to conditioning. He recently returned
from altitude training in Big Bear, where he spent time with boxer
Oscar De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's starting to pay off," Robb said.</TE>
<TE>   He was matched against Tim Curran of Oxnard and Australians Trent
Munro and Tom Whitaker in the final, which was scored by tabulating
the competitors' three best wave scores. Paddling out, Robb gave
himself a quick pep talk.</TE>
<TE>   "I was yelling at myself, 'Are you going to finally win this
thing?' " Robb said. "I don't know what it is, but I always seem to
miss by a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Robb received the highest wave score of the final in the opening
minute, starting well south of the pier near "Rob Machado's Peak," an
area named after the two-time U.S. Open winner who prefers trolling
for waves away from the pier.</TE>
<TE>   Robb worked the waist-high wave nearly to the shore for a score of
7.00. He backed it up about seven minutes later with a 6.00, again
surfing from right to left and milking the wave inside. "I knew that
going down the line and making a lot of maneuvers is what the crowd
and judges want to see," said Robb, who rode a six-foot, one-inch Al
Merrick design.</TE>
<TE>   After scoring a 5.43 with about 17 minutes left, Robb enjoyed a
comfortable nine-point lead. Munro moved into the second spot midway
through the final and came within five points with three minutes
remaining, but Robb sealed the victory by scoring a 6.33 in the
closing seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Robb finished with 19.33 points, earning $10,000 for the victory.
Munro was second with 17.27 points, Whitaker was third with 16.14 and
Curran fourth with 10.43. Curran, who is hoping to earn enough points
to requalify for the WCT, was the best performer in the semifinals,
easily winning the second four-man heat with 16.67 points, the
highest two-wave heat score since Friday's round of 96.</TE>
<TE>   The heat was highlighted by a 180-degree aerial spin during which
he gripped the side rails with his hands. He earned 8.67 points for
the ride, the second-best wave score of the day. Curran said he was
in the wrong places at the wrong times during the final.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a bit out of rhythm," he said. "There [were] waves in the
final, but you just have to be at the peak. It seemed like I was
dodging them."</TE>
<TE>   Munro, 23, was the most experienced of the finalists, owning three
career victories, two in the WQS. Munro, ranked 18th in the WCT, made
it into the final after a wave score of 7.67 with just under four
minutes remaining leapfrogged him over fellow Aussie Taj Burrow.</TE>
<TE>   C.J. Hobgood of Florida, the 2001 world champion, finished fourth
in the same semifinal. Robb won the other semifinal with 12.77
points, narrowly edging Whitaker (12.66). Shea Lopez of Florida,
ranked third in the WCT, finished last in the same heat.</TE>
<TE>   Among the popular surfers eliminated in the quarterfinals and
round of 32 were former world champions Tom Curren of Ventura and
Sunny Garcia of Hawaii. Kekoa Bacalso of Mililani, Hawaii, won the
junior division and $2,500. Bacalso, 17, borrowed Robb's strategy and
spend most of the time further south than the remaining finalists.</TE>
<TE>   "I ended up getting some good waves," Bacalso said.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Reyes of Huntington Beach was second and Hawaii's Joel Centeio
and Jordy Brough finished third and fourth, respectively.</TE>

<HD>There's No Lull in Venus' World</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Williams sweeps Dokic in final at La Costa to give
her hard-court titles in consecutive weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>For those who looked at Venus Williams' sad face and glistening eyes
after she lost for the first time in three years at Wimbledon,
wondering about her immediate future after a devastating loss to her
younger sister Serena, those concerns have been rendered moot by
back-to-back titles in California.</LD>
<LD>   This was not like 1999 all over again.</LD>
<LD>   After Venus watched Serena win the 1999 U.S. Open she went into an
emotional and physical tailspin, missing the first four months of
2000 with tendinitis in both wrists. But four Grand Slam singles
titles have a way of improving someone's recuperative powers and
self-belief.</LD>
<TE>   After losing to Serena in a well-played final at Wimbledon, Venus
has responded by losing only one set in two hard-court tournaments.
That included a 6-2, 6-2 victory in 55 minutes over a weakened Jelena
Dokic of Yugoslavia in the Acura Classic final Sunday at La Costa
Resort and Spa. For the top-seeded Williams, it was her third
consecutive championship here, a first at this tournament.</TE>
<TE>   She was loose on the court, losing serve only once, hitting six
aces, 23 winners and, more important, committing only 24 unforced
errors. A bit of summertime cleaning took care of the latter annoying
problem, reducing an unacceptable 73 unforced errors against Kim
Clijsters in a three-set quarterfinalto a more acceptable number.</TE>
<TE>   Having taken care of those matters, Williams turned her attention
to the mundane during the trophy presentation, going on an amusing
riff about cutting down on her speeding tickets and her conversation
with a Samsung vice president earlier in the tournament. She has been
talking here about having no remote control for her TV, meaning the
channel stays on Lifetime Network, all day and all night.</TE>
<TE>   "He promised to update me," she said, and apparently the "update"
may be something in the form of a flat-screen TV.</TE>
<TE>   She was enjoying talking about all her new gifts but seemed coy
about a shiny new ring on her left hand, talking with reporters in
the hallway on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm too young to be engaged," said the 22-year-old. "Not this
girl."</TE>
<TE>   The way things are going for her opponents, the distraction of a
Williams' engagement or marriage might be their only chance. Williams
has won six titles in 2002 and three of her six losses this year have
been to Serena. The others were to Monica Seles at the Australian
Open, Sandrine Testud (who has now retired) at Dubai and Clijsters at
Hamburg in May.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, Venus seems increasingly engaged.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always counting the numbers now for titles," she said. "This
was 27.... I really got interested this year because it started to be
a [bigger] number than it used to be. I'm never going to get close to
[Martina] Navratilova. I don't know if I can make it that far because
I'm not sure I can play as long as she did."</TE>
<TE>   The Venus-Serena Era is becoming a lot like the days of
Navratilova-Chris Evert. They may be pushing one another, continually
raising the bar, but the gap between the top two and the rest of the
field is widening.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport, 26, a former No. 1, took only three games from Venus in
the semifinals and was losing consistently to both sisters even
before her knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   Of the younger challengers, there is Clijsters. And anyone with
Dokic's groundstrokes and attitude should be taken seriously. At La
Costa, the 19-year-old, seeded sixth, made a breakthrough by beating
Jennifer Capriati for the first time and was pleasantly surprised by
reaching the final, acknowledging the support of her boyfriend,
Formula One driver Enrique Bernoldi of Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was weakened by a stomach virus in her semifinal
against Anna Kournikova--in which she saved two match points--and
needed the attention of a doctor before Sunday's final. Still, the
culprit may be too much tennis and suspect scheduling. Dokic is
supposed to play this week at Manhattan Beach, followed by Montreal
and New Haven, Conn., which would be five consecutive weeks of
tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "I've beaten some very good players this week," Dokic said. "It
was a little disappointing today. Considering how I was feeling, I
don't think I could have done very much today."</TE>

across Southern California, offering fresh tortillas, signs in
Spanish and bin after bin of colorful chili peppers.</LD>
<LD>   After all, he points out, Los Angeles is home to more Spanish
speakers than any other city apart from Mexico City. And Latinos
outnumber whites in dozens of nearby communities.</LD>
<LD>   But Anaheim, where Frias wants to open Gigante's first Orange
County store, is resisting. After discouraging the company from
moving into a shopping center near Knott's Berry Farm, city officials
now have pushed it away from a mall they want to rejuvenate, finding
the store to be too Mexican for the surroundings.</LD>
<TE>   "When I first started this, I was a little naive. I didn't think
prejudice toward Latino entities really existed," Frias said.
"Regretfully, it does. The fact that we sell tacos and bolillos
[Mexican rolls] instead of chicken Kiev to go, that is the reason."</TE>
<TE>   Others are less diplomatic. "It's the most thinly veiled act of
discrimination I've seen in quite some time," said Ronald Stockdale,
a leasing agent for one of the sites.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say discrimination has nothing to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   They say the problem is the location Gigante most recently sought
for a store. Anaheim Plaza, a renovated regional mall off the Santa
Ana Freeway, is where city redevelopment officials hope to expand a
discount retail complex that draws people from beyond the immediate
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no problem with Gigante coming into Anaheim,"
redevelopment director Elisa Stipkovich said. "I think it belongs in
our city.... The issue is whether that is an appropriate shopping
center."</TE>
<TE>   In the Anaheim census tract where Gigante wants to open, Latinos
make up 60% of the population, a powerful retail demographic. In
1990, their share was 27%.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, they're not reading their own demographics," said
Steve Soto, president and chief executive of the Mexican American
Grocers Assn. Too many city officials are stuck with outdated images
of their communities and reject the idea of specialty Latino
businesses, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Cities are not keeping pace, and they're losing business because
of that," Soto said. "There's no such thing anymore as just East L.A.
or South Gate or Pacoima. I don't know if it's the old-boys mentality
that some of these cities have, but it doesn't make business sense.
The color of money is still green."</TE>
<TE>   Gigante has more than 200 stores in Mexico, where it is one of the
country's top retailers. In 1999, it entered the United States with
three stores in Southern California. Five more are on the way.
Anaheim, where nearly half the population is Latino, was considered a
prime place to expand.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante offers all the amenities of a mainstream grocery store but
boasts an expanded produce department bursting with such items as
tomatillos and cactus pears, and a bakery where Mexican pastries and
tortillas are made fresh.</TE>
<TE>   While it caters to Latinos, Frias said, the grocery chain also
attracts people seeking Mexican items they might not find at Ralphs.</TE>
<TE>   The company first sought to open a store in a shopping center on
Beach Boulevard, but in 2001 acceded to a request by Anaheim Mayor
Tom Daly that it look elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The city wanted to see a store in that space that would generate
sales taxes; most groceries are exempt from sales tax. "I have to
respect the mayor," Frias said.</TE>
<TE>   Later he was disturbed to find that the shopping center owner is
negotiating with Albertson's--another grocery chain. Daly did not
return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Frias turned to Anaheim Plaza and reached a deal with its
owners and the previous tenant. But Stipkovich, the city's
redevelopment director, warned the mall's managers in a letter that
Anaheim could withdraw a city subsidy because Gigante is too
specialized and "does not cater to the public at large."</TE>
<TE>   She wrote that the "product selection catered primarily to the
Hispanic market" and city staffers were "surprised to find that the
store signage and music were predominantly in Spanish."</TE>
<TE>   Stipkovich said the city's concern has nothing to do with
ethnicity. Rather, the city simply does not want a grocery store in
the mall, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But mall officials say Stipkovich urged them to pursue mainstream
grocery store chains as tenants. None, as it later turned out, were
interested.</TE>
<TE>   "On more than one occasion ... they indicated that they didn't
have a problem with a grocery store at that location," said Bill
Williams, an investment advisor to the property owners. "They just
have a thing about putting a Hispanic grocery store in Anaheim
Plaza."</TE>
<TE>   City officials say they tried repeatedly to help identify
alternate sites.</TE>
<TE>   But Frias said that effort was halfhearted. One site the city
suggested was half the size of the Anaheim Plaza store. Another he
described as a "little mom-and-pop, old-fashioned strip center, which
did not have a view to the street."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, despite the city's objections, Gigante signed a lease
at the Plaza, and was preparing to open this fall.</TE>
<TE>   But in June, on the advice of city staff, the Anaheim Planning
Commission unanimously rejected the company's application for a
liquor license, a critical item for any major supermarket chain.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante appealed the decision to the City Council, which will
consider the question Aug. 20.</TE>
<TE>   "It should not be this difficult to open a supermarket," Frias
said.</TE>

<HD>Detour Sought for Roadblock Over Budget</HD>
<DH>Politics: Democrats and Republicans have battled to an
impasse over Davis' call to hike car license fees. Alternatives
appear equally contentious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In proposing to more than double the vehicle license fees paid by
California motorists, Gov. Gray Davis is asking Republican lawmakers
to roll back a tax cut that they fought hard to win, and thus hold
dear.</LD>
<LD>   The Democrats' foray onto Republican sacred ground has contributed
to a standoff over a new state budget that would close a
$23.6-billion revenue shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   With the spending plan now six weeks overdue, Davis and his fellow
Democrats are scrambling to find a way to break the impasse.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats assumed they could find just enough Republicans to vote
for a $99-billion spending package that includes the car fee
increase.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy worked in the Senate, which approved the budget June
29. But it failed in the Assembly, where most Republicans remain
staunchly opposed to it and cite analysts' projections that it would
set the stage for at least five more years of budget deficits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the single most objectionable tax," said Assemblyman John
Campbell (R-Irvine).</TE>
<TE>   "Cars are not only necessities for Californians because of the
size of the state and because of our transportation system, but
they're also a significant part of our culture. This is the car
capital of the world."</TE>
<TE>   So the majority Democrats are examining how they might eliminate
the proposal, possibly through a combination of substitute tax
increases and spending cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Another option that is guaranteed to send shock waves through
California communities would be for the state to keep the reduced
fees but no longer to reimburse cities and counties for the cut as
the state has been doing since it began slashing the fees in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with dropping the license fee proposal, according to
Democrats, is that raising almost any other tax would have a ripple
effect that would increase the amount of money the state must pay
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, they contend, eliminating the car tax hike and the
$1.3 billion it is expected to raise in the current fiscal year,
which began July 1, would force them to scrape together $1.8 billion
to cover the added school costs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the [the vehicle license fee] is very significant in the
minds of Republicans," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve
Peace (D-El Cajon). "They see it as symbolism, and that's getting in
the way of the math."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans say a different brand of symbolism is at play.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the only tax that was permanently reduced, and that sticks
in the craw of the spending lobby," said Sen. Tom McClintock, the
Thousand Oaks Republican senator who has crusaded to abolish the tax
entirely. "It is a symbolic objective."</TE>
<TE>   The impasse illustrates the difficulty of finding a middle ground
in a partisan budget battle. After approving the spending package in
June, the Senate adjourned on a summer break that ends today.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's return could pave the way for a breakthrough because
upper house lawmakers must sign off on any changes made to the plan
they have already approved.</TE>
<TE>   "Having the Senate come back gives us an opportunity to close this
whole thing out," said Assembly Budget Committee Chairwoman Jenny
Oropeza (D-Long Beach).</TE>
<TE>   The fee increase is the centerpiece of the tax package sitting in
the Assembly. It would more than double the fees levied on all
registered vehicles to raise $2.4 billion during the 2003 calendar
year.</TE>
<TE>   Davis proposed increasing the fees as an alternative to raising
personal income taxes, which in recent years have proved to be a
volatile source of revenues.</TE>
<TE>   But his proposal received a chilly reception, even from Democratic
legislators, many of whom would prefer to tax the rich.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans successfully sought a reduction in vehicle license
fees in 1998 as a nod to taxpayers who had been hit with the biggest
tax increase in the state's history as former Gov. Pete Wilson
struggled in 1991 to close a $14-billion budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   State officials crafted a $7-billion tax package that, because of
the recession, brought in $5.4 billion through higher vehicle license
fees in addition to boosts in sales, income and other taxes.</TE>
<TE>   They latched onto the car tax after watching Republican Jim
Gilmore win a landslide victory in the 1997 Virginia's governor race,
partly on his pledge to eliminate the commonwealth's vehicle license
fee.</TE>
<TE>   Voters booted Bill Clinton from the Arkansas statehouse in 1982
after he raised the state's annual car registration fee from $17 to
$25.</TE>
<TE>   In California, a 2% fee has been reduced by slightly more than
two-thirds since 1998 in a series of rebates.</TE>
<TE>   To help close a $23.6-billion budget gap, the governor now wants
to suspend part of the rebate--restoring the fee to 1.5% of a
vehicle's depreciated value--for the 2003 calendar year.</TE>
<TE>   California is home to 29.6 million cars, motorcycles, trucks and
trailers that are subject to vehicle license fees.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Democratic proposal, the charge for a car valued at
$9,200--the state average--would rise from $60 to $138, an increase
of $78.</TE>
<TE>   The state has been paying local governments, which receive the
bulk of vehicle license fees, for the state-ordered cut in the car
fees. Last year, those payments totaled about $3.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing the fees would thus reduce the amount the state owes
cities and counties.</TE>
<TE>   Peace said the same goal could be accomplished if the state
stopped reimbursing local governments for the cut.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials note that the 1998 legislation authorizing the tax
cut was written in such a way that, if times got tough, the fees
could go up.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone says times aren't tough right now, I'd like to know
what they think is tougher," said Steve Szalay, executive director of
the California State Assn. of Counties.</TE>
<TE>   Driving the Republican push to eliminate tax hikes is their belief
that state revenues and spending are out of whack.</TE>
<TE>   GOP lawmakers point to forecasts by state analysts that the
spending plan they are being asked to approve will leave the state in
the red for the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   A decision by state officials to rely on onetime solutions to
balance this year's budget--as well as solutions that will come back
to haunt the state later, such as deferring expenses and
borrowing--is contributing to the threat of future imbalances.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are calling for a spending limit to correct the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "It becomes a question of what permanent tax increase do you want
to make, because there are deficits for as far as the eye can see,"
said Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, Cox views all of the Democrats' proposed tax
hikes as equally offensive, as does Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-San
Bernardino).</TE>
<TE>   "I cautioned the Republican caucus not to focus on the car tax
because they might win that one in exchange for a substitute tax
increase," Leonard said. "But I don't know where the Republicans are
individually."</TE>

<HD>Legislator Votes Her Passion, Not Her Party Line</HD>
<DH>Assembly: Jackie Goldberg has gained respect, though some
colleagues have grumbled about her approach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The debate ended, the bill went down in defeat, and Jackie Goldberg
began to cry.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't even her measure--just another legislator's proposal to
require safety features on swimming pools to prevent toddlers from
drowning. But when her fellow Democrats failed to provide the votes
to pass it this spring, Goldberg wept at her wooden desk in the rear
of the California Assembly, because she could not hold back her
frustration.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a very little thing to ask to save babies' lives," the Los
Angeles lawmaker recalled, "and the first time it went up, there were
not 41 of 50 of us willing to vote for it because of opposition from
a special interest."</LD>
<TE>   The California Assn. of Realtors had lobbied against the bill
because it would have required that any home with a pool have at
least one safety device before it could be resold. Only after
Assemblywoman Gloria Negrete McLeod (D-Chino) removed that provision
from her bill and the real estate organization rescinded its
opposition did Democrats, who hold 50 of the Assembly's 80 seats, put
up the votes.</TE>
<TE>   For Goldberg, who will complete her first two years in the
Assembly this month, life as a rookie in the California Legislature
has often been difficult to stomach.</TE>
<TE>   The fiery former Berkeley radical, teacher, Los Angeles school
board president and City Council member has made a life's work of
rattling cages to advance a progressive social agenda. She was
reluctant to run for state office, in part because she worried that a
40-year liberal activist would fare poorly in party politics.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, that proved true. Goldberg's arrival at the Capitol
last year went over with a thud, several colleagues said. Many
legislators were taken aback by what they saw as her preachy
personality.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, she has gotten her clock cleaned on most major
legislation she has carried. A proposed ban on Native American
mascots at public schools, a move to limit the state's
"three-strikes" law to violent criminals and, perhaps the most
contentious bill of the legislative session, an effort to give
teachers power to pick textbooks--all have been defeated.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues privately have grumbled about Goldberg's
hard-headedness and said she is unwilling to settle for "half a
loaf," as they often do to make progress--a criticism Goldberg said
she considers unfair. Some have questioned whether she can ever be a
successful legislator.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite her initial misgivings and early stumbles, Goldberg
said she is glad she came to Sacramento. She is convinced she can
make a difference on the issues she cares most about, from making
improvements to public education to protecting the poor.</TE>
<TE>   And though her uncompromising stands have not always made her
popular with colleagues, particularly moderate members of her own
party, they have earned her respect from Democrats and Republicans
alike. "This place can't operate without individuals who work on
passion," said Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), an
admittedly more pragmatic politician, who gave Goldberg the coveted
position of Assembly Education Committee chairwoman. "That's what
Jackie is. You need those people to balance the rest of us out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Her Take on the Capitol</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg, 58, continues to be outspoken.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg on Assembly Republicans, most of whom are socially
conservative:</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a time warp. I feel like I've stepped back into the
1950s."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg on the "Business Democrats," lawmakers whose votes,
coupled with those of GOP legislators, often kill liberal bills:</TE>
<TE>   "Business Dems drive a lot of us crazy. The notion of a 'Business
Democrat' as someone who will vote with the Chamber of Commerce on
every issue is a very narrow one."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg, an open lesbian, on what she considers the hateful
rhetoric of some Republicans on gay-rights issues:</TE>
<TE>   "I'd never heard elected officials really speak the homophobic
line with pride: 'You are immoral and going to hell.' "</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg on gifts from special interests, which she does not
accept:</TE>
<TE>   "People do not want to believe that their elected officials can be
bought. I want them to know that, if I did something they did not
like, I did it because I am stupid, not because I am corrupt."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Activist to Assembly</TE>
<TE>   When term limits were about to force Goldberg from the L.A. City
Council, backers began talking to her about running for the Assembly
seat being vacated by then-Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, representing
a stretch from East Los Angeles to Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   But Goldberg had little interest in going to Sacramento. She did
not want to leave her longtime home in Echo Park, where she lives
with her domestic partner, Sharon Stricker, a poet and activist she
met during the school busing fights of the 1970s. And she feared
becoming just another face among 120 senators and Assembly members
voting the party line.</TE>
<TE>   However, Goldberg received recruiting visits from a few
influential liberals, including state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa
Monica) and Assemblywoman Dion Aroner (D-Berkeley), who had been
Goldberg's roommate at Berkeley's Delta Phi Epsilon sorority.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg ran and won.</TE>
<TE>   Like most newcomers, she expected to ease into the job. But then
blackouts began to darken swaths of the state early in 2001 and she
was immediately thrust into action.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg carried no major legislation during the energy crisis.
She spent much of her time in a behind-the-scenes role. Yet she still
managed to get 10 bills signed into law dealing with kindergarten
education, food stamps and child support, among other issues. The
feat, she said, led colleagues to nickname her "41" in a nod to her
knack for mustering the minimum vote needed.</TE>
<TE>   This was going to be the year Goldberg had a major effect on
public policy. But her more ambitious efforts all failed.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing from a desperate constituent who said her husband
faced life in prison for bouncing bad checks, Goldberg discovered
many Californians faced life terms under the voter-approved
"three-strikes" law, even though they had never been convicted of
violent crimes. She carried legislation to change the law, but found
little support among colleagues concerned about being painted as soft
on crime.</TE>
<TE>   After Native American activists told her about having to hear
"scalp the Indians" at football games, Goldberg carried legislation
to banish all Native American mascots from public schools. The bill
sped through committees without formal opposition and garnered
national headlines. But it hit a roadblock on the Assembly floor when
she refused to take an amendment allowing for exemptions. Republicans
blasted the legislation as "political correctness run amok," and it
fell far short of 41.</TE>
<TE>   "I admire Jackie and Jackie's passion," said Assemblywoman Carol
Liu (D-La Canada Flintridge), who believes Goldberg's refusal to take
her amendments swayed other Democrats and led to the bill's defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "She feels so deeply about the issues she believes in. Sometimes
it interferes with her ability to gain success because she does not
compromise.... She needs to understand that, unless she works with
people, she is going to encounter the same type of opposition."</TE>
<TE>   The same week, Goldberg suffered her worst defeat to date.</TE>
<TE>   She caused a sensation in Sacramento when she introduced
legislation to give teachers a say in textbook choices and other
issues traditionally left to administrators. The bill was strongly
backed by the California Teachers Assn., but opponents assailed it as
an outrageous power grab by the union.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg moved the measure to the Assembly floor--and, she
pointedly noted, made numerous concessions along the way. But Wesson,
a supporter, said he personally pulled the plug there because it was
going down.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg felt betrayed by some colleagues who she said had told
her they shared her views but then failed to back her when it
mattered.</TE>
<TE>   But she insisted she never felt bitter, and said she is convinced
most of the politicians in Sacramento are honorable. The problem, she
said, is their ambition, and the way others will manipulate it to
influence their votes.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone comes up here believing in what they believe. The
problem comes when they take votes that they are told will affect
their political careers," Goldberg said. "There are a lot of
people"--lobbyists, staffers and fellow legislators--"that tell them,
'This vote will kill you in the next election.'</TE>
<TE>   "I learned in my first office that reelection is not the most
important thing in the world. It makes you free" to realize that, she
added.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Earning Respect</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg's reluctance to back down has won her the unwavering
support of a potent political ally: Wayne Johnson, the head of the
California Teachers Assn., who was not always on her side when she
served as L.A. Unified's board president.</TE>
<TE>   The Goldberg he sees in Sacramento is more skilled at
consensus-building--and far more willing to engage in it--than the
one he knew in Los Angeles, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "She understands the educational issues and the political side of
things better than anyone I have seen in my life," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Across the aisle, even among conservative Republicans, Goldberg's
positions have earned respect. Assemblyman Sam Aanestad (R-Grass
Valley) recalled a hearing last year at which farmers in the Klamath
River basin described how drought was destroying their livelihoods.
Most urban legislators didn't even bother to show up, he said, but
Goldberg did.</TE>
<TE>   "There were tears in her eyes," Aanestad said. "I just found it
amazing that someone from Southern California would sit there and
listen, because most of them wouldn't."</TE>
<TE>   And the progressives who encouraged her to step up to statewide
politics have said Goldberg's attitude reaffirms their faith.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a proclivity over in the Assembly to duck," said Kuehl,
who suffered her share of early defeats in the Assembly. "Sometimes,
the members who do not want to be recorded [on a tough vote] are mad
at you.... Instead of being mad at themselves for being weenies, they
get mad at you."</TE>
<TE>   Friends said that beneath Goldberg's brash demeanor she is a
sensitive soul who takes criticism to heart, and that her big
legislative losses left her feeling down.</TE>
<TE>   But she has begun to turn a corner, they said. She has become a
player in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, which is
increasingly dominating statehouse politics.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, she has become a loyal defender of moderate
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis on the Assembly floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got six years here and things that I need to get done," she
said. "I'll take half a loaf--I'll even take a slice of bread
sometimes--if it moves an issue forward in a real way."</TE>

<HD>Richman Charting His Own Course</HD>
<DH>Politics: The maverick GOP assemblyman has big plans for a
Valley city if elected its mayor, but he risks little if secession
measure fails.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He's a political newcomer, in office just two years.</LD>
<LD>   But that's two years longer than almost everyone else seeking
seats in the proposed San Fernando Valley city, making Assemblyman
Keith Richman (R-Northridge) the secessionists' marquee player as the
campaigns spin toward November.</LD>
<LD>   Richman, a moderate Republican who practiced medicine for 22 years
before being elected to the Legislature, was the first to announce
his bid for Valley mayor. He remains the likely front-runner in a
field of relative unknowns as Friday's filing deadline approaches.</LD>
<TE>   But in the weird world of secession, it's possible to win the race
but still lose the office. That might be one reason more high-profile
candidates aren't running. If voters reject Valley cityhood, the
mayor's post and 14 city council seats would be stillborn.</TE>
<TE>   Richman appears unfazed by the prospect. So what, the beefy doctor
with a booming voice asks, if some polls showed that voters outside
the Valley are leaning against secession? Who cares if secession
opponents have raised 25 times the amount collected by Valley
separatists?</TE>
<TE>   Breaking off from Los Angeles, he is certain, is the best cure for
what ails the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely convinced we can make the San Fernando Valley a
better place to live and work," he said. "I'm not making my decisions
based on political expediency. This whole movement for a Valley city
is about not doing politics as usual."</TE>
<TE>   Richman, 48, is accustomed to charting his own course: He's a
Republican in a city dominated by Democrats. A fiscal conservative
who champions health insurance for the poor. The lone physician in a
Legislature awash in lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   He's so proud of a wooden giraffe he won from Planned
Parenthood--a "Stick Your Neck Out" award honoring his work as a
Republican who supports legal abortion--that he keeps it in his
office between framed photos of his daughters.</TE>
<TE>   The secession campaign, however, doesn't carry much political risk
for Richman. Even if the breakaway bid flops, he would probably hang
onto his Assembly seat--he's running for reelection even as he
campaigns for Valley mayor. If he wins both races and secession
passes, he plans to resign from the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Richman has little to fear from the municipal unions and
other Democratic allies who oppose a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a win-win for him, even if secession fails," said Allan
Hoffenblum, a Republican political strategist. "He risks absolutely
nothing, but he enhances his reputation within the San Fernando
Valley."</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the case with state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar).
He initially voiced enthusiasm for running for Valley mayor, but
under pressure from unions he decided against it. Alarcon declared
his opposition to secession the week after a Times poll showed that
voters citywide were inclined to reject it.</TE>
<TE>   While Richman's moderate politics could help him in the heavily
Democratic Valley, his stance on one of the area's most controversial
developments--Ahmanson Ranch--puts him at odds with many of the
people he seeks to represent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rethinking Ahmanson</TE>
<TE>   He has supported the proposed 3,050-home project just across the
Ventura County line. Most Los Angeles politicians and many Valley
residents vehemently oppose the development, which would funnel its
traffic through the West Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely shows he's not in step" with the community, said
Dorothy Smith, a Woodland Hills homeowner who supports secession. "If
Ahmanson Ranch goes through, I shudder to think what the consequences
would be. Anyone who is for it, I'm afraid, will not get my vote."</TE>
<TE>   Richman, who recently met with a group of Ahmanson Ranch
opponents, said this week he is reconsidering his position.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, Richman is generally well-regarded on both sides of
the aisle. The California Journal recently named him "Rookie of the
Year," a title bestowed after the magazine polled lawmakers, aides,
lobbyists and the media about the talents of various legislators.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been honest and straightforward and not concerned about
partisan politics," said Assemblyman Joseph Canciamilla
(D-Pittsburg), who teamed with Richman to find solutions to the
state's energy crisis. "That's real refreshing up here."</TE>
<TE>   So far, none of Richman's bills have made it into law. But he has
swayed the debate on several fronts, particularly health care,
several colleagues said. He has pushed for HMO reform and expanded
health coverage for California's 7 million uninsured patients.</TE>
<TE>   "Keith Richman, in my view, marches to his own drummer," said
Steven Thompson, a lobbyist for the California Medical Assn. "In
health care, he's been a strong progressive voice, a voice not
usually heard from a Republican."</TE>
<TE>   His willingness to go his own way has raised eyebrows within his
party's caucus, Thompson added.</TE>
<TE>   "They think he's a cowboy," he said. "That ain't the party line,
and Keith ain't touting it."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Syracuse, N.Y., Richman has lived in the Valley since he
was a toddler. He went to Birmingham High School in Van Nuys and then
to UC Davis, playing baseball and cracking the books so hard that he
won early admission to UCLA medical school. After he earned his M.D.,
the son of a Sun Valley doctor got a master's degree in public
health.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Medicine in the Family</TE>
<TE>   Richman went into practice with his father as an internist in a
gritty industrial neighborhood in the northeast Valley. Many of their
patients were poor, some lacking insurance. About a third spoke only
Spanish, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also became a businessman, founding a health-care company that,
after a series of mergers, is known as Lakeside Medical Associates.
The Glendale-based group treats 100,000 patients, most of them in the
Valley. Richman, who was board chairman before joining the Assembly,
owns a small stake in the business and serves on the board.</TE>
<TE>   Married with two grown daughters, he has lived in the same house
in Northridge for more than 20 years. His wife, Deborah, is a
homemaker and a former psychiatric nurse.</TE>
<TE>   When he's on a roll, Richman is equal parts bullhorn and broken
record. It's hard to get a word in edgewise, and he says the same
thing over and over again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that the San Fernando Valley doesn't get its fair
share of services. We need a more efficient, effective and
accountable government," he said. He frequently cites figures from a
state report showing that City Hall takes more than $100 million in
Valley tax revenue yearly than it gives back in services.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first things he would do as mayor, he said, is slash
the new city's business tax in half to attract more jobs. He hopes to
deploy more police officers and adopt a "zero tolerance" policy for
even minor crimes, such as vandalism.</TE>
<TE>   On the campaign trail, Richman loudly assails Los Angeles Mayor
James K. Hahn for the "conceit and condescension" he shows the
Valley. But among friends, the candidate displays a more relaxed
side.</TE>
<TE>   At a punch-and-cookies gathering last week at a friend's law
office, Richman mingled easily with about 30 people who had come to
sign his nominating papers. He cajoled the real estate agents present
into having a group picture taken, at one point whipping out a red
plastic comb to style his silver hair.</TE>
<TE>   "At least it's not a Brad Sherman comb!" he joked, referring to
the Democratic congressman's penchant for handing out campaign combs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Switched Parties</TE>
<TE>   The Valley isn't a natural audience for Richman, who switched
parties in 1992. Democrats outnumber Republicans by a wide margin,
51.4% to 28.7%, according to voter registration records.</TE>
<TE>   When Richman won his Assembly seat in 2000, it was the more
conservative Ventura County portion of the 38th district that carried
him to victory. On the Los Angeles County side, his Democratic rival
narrowly beat him.</TE>
<TE>   Richman loaned himself $420,000 in that campaign. Special
interests, such as insurance companies, medical groups and the
building industry, also contributed heavily.</TE>
<TE>   All the races in the Valley cityhood campaign are nonpartisan. So
far, nine candidates--all men--have taken out nominating papers to
run for Valley mayor, according to the county registrar-recorder.</TE>
<TE>   The others are Benny Bernal of Mission Hills, Henry Divina of
Chatsworth, David Hernandez Jr. of Valley Village, Gregory Roberts of
Universal City, Leonard Shapiro of Tarzana, Scott Sobhani of Valley
Glen, Marc Strassman of Valley Village and Johnny Walker of Woodland
Hills. Several have also pulled papers to run for a council seat.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists are counting on a bumper crop of candidates to raise
interest (and money) for the breakaway campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, most of the announced contenders are hardly household
names.</TE>
<TE>   The best-known council candidates are Paula Boland, a former
assemblywoman; Richard Leyner, former United Chambers of Commerce
chairman; and Scott Svonkin, chief of staff to Assemblyman Paul
Koretz (D-West Hollywood).</TE>
<TE>   That makes Richman all the more vital to secession proponents,
although he says he will contribute only a small amount, perhaps
$1,000 or $2,000, to the cityhood campaign. He said he will not spend
his own money on the mayoral race.</TE>
<TE>   Some political strategists are doubtful that the efforts of a
one-term assemblyman will make much of a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "The dearth of credible candidates is a tremendous problem for the
secession campaign," said John Shallman, a Democratic consultant who
plans to campaign against the breakaway measure.</TE>
<TE>   "Keith Richman is standing up there by himself. It's a Broadway
play and all the headliners, all the key actors didn't show up."</TE>

<HD>Should Workers Share the Poverty They Fight?</HD>
<DH>VISTA: Volunteers are barred from second jobs. A bill that
would change that has set off a debate about the program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Once a month, Whitney Easton leaves his AmeriCorps VISTA national
service job running a Sacramento teen program to stand in line at a
local food stamp outlet.</LD>
<LD>   The $9,300 or so that Volunteers in Service to America pays him
and his colleagues annually to work on anti-poverty projects in
low-income communities is just not enough to make ends meet, Easton
said.</LD>
<LD>   Since VISTA members are prohibited from working second jobs,
Easton and many members of what is often described as a domestic
Peace Corps rely on savings and parental aid, work off the books or
apply for food stamps.</LD>
<TE>   Pending legislation would change that, allowing them to hold
additional jobs. The proposal has raised debate about the nature and
effectiveness of the 37-year-old federal program, which employs 7,000
people nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Easton runs a "Weed and Feed" program, "weeding" out crime and
"feeding in" new opportunities for low-income teens, such as starting
a community garden in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   He understands why VISTA workers are expected to live at the
economic levels of the communities they serve and why they are not
allowed to do anything that might lure them away from their
24-hour-a-day responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "When we're working in the community, it'll give us better
judgment," Easton said.</TE>
<TE>   But he supports the proposed change to allow part-time jobs for
those who think they must supplement VISTA incomes. Time spent
applying and waiting for food stamps takes the volunteers away from
their tasks anyway, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The 24-year-old, originally from Providence, R.I., has simple
tastes and is not afraid of hard work. A Northeastern University
graduate, Easton furnished his Sacramento studio apartment with items
that other people had discarded--he calls it "trash picking." He
can't remember when he last bought new clothing. If he and his
friends go out, they hunt for bars without cover charges.</TE>
<TE>   VISTA workers "tend to find great deals," said Easton, who is to
finish his yearlong stint in the program at the end of August.</TE>
<TE>   He had some savings and paid off most of his debts before moving.
Easton also concedes that he bent the rules by working occasional odd
jobs--a few hours on weekends landscaping or doing light
carpentry--but said he would not take a second job that required
regular commitment.</TE>
<TE>   By January, his savings had dwindled. But VISTA officials told him
he could apply for food stamps. Before he could pick up his $130
worth of monthly food coupons, he was so broke that he went to a food
bank for groceries to hold him over.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the apparent hardship, Easton loves his VISTA experience.
He believes in the philosophy of 24-7 immersion, which dates back to
the early days of the program, started by President Lyndon B. Johnson
as part of his War on Poverty.</TE>
<TE>   But the proposed Citizen Service Act of 2002 offers to reform
different federal service organizations, including AmeriCorps, which
encompasses VISTA. In phases, the bill would limit the workweek of
VISTA workers to 40 hours instead of the open-ended commitment and
allow second jobs and part-time education.</TE>
<TE>   This will fundamentally change the program, said Mimi Mager, board
member of Friends of VISTA, an alumni association that opposes the
change.</TE>
<TE>   With a 24-7 commitment, "you are totally involved; you are totally
engaged in the community. [Volunteers] would understand and know the
community in a deeper way, and never just be sitting there punching a
clock," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the proposed change simply recognizes that VISTA life should
allow time for other activities, said Les Lenkowsky, chief executive
of the Corporation for National Service, which manages AmeriCorps and
USA FreedomCorps, the volunteer program President Bush introduced in
his State of the Union speech. Lenkowsky supports the proposed
changes.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody does 24-7," he said. "That's always been one of those
mythical qualities" of the program.</TE>
<TE>   The other 43,000 members of AmeriCorps, including those working on
environmental, health and literacy programs, already can work second
jobs. "We just want one standard rule with as much flexibility as
possible," Lenkowsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Most full-time AmeriCorps volunteers receive about $9,300 a year,
an amount based on the federal poverty level. VISTA workers in areas
where the cost of living is higher get paid slightly more.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, all AmeriCorps volunteers can defer payment on
student loans and receive health insurance and child care allowances.
When they complete their yearlong commitments, they also get
educational awards of $4,725 apiece that can be applied toward
outstanding debts or future schooling. VISTA workers have the option
of receiving stipends of $1,200 instead of educational awards.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping stipends small weeds out people who aren't serious about
service, Lenkowsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "We do feel members in AmeriCorps are to be expected to make
sacrifices," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Having the financial freedom to volunteer at such a low wage is a
luxury, said Pittsburgh native Claire Lobes, a 25-year-old VISTA
worker.</TE>
<TE>   She works in microeconomic development at JobStarts, Inc. in
South-Central Los Angeles. She graduated from Georgetown University
and got a master's degree in political theory at the London School of
Economics.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than being allowed second jobs, Lobes thinks VISTA workers
should be paid 200% of the federal poverty income level. "If you have
nothing to go back to, you could end up in a bad financial
condition," Lobes said. "If you're financially vulnerable, you can't
afford to do VISTA."</TE>
<TE>   To pay for her apartment in Brentwood, Lobes relies on her savings
from her previous job developing strategies for CEOs. Living at the
federal poverty level, "you can't eat. It's just not sustainable,"
Lobes said.</TE>
<TE>   VISTA members tend to be young--47% are younger than 30, and 31%
are 20 to 24--and some come into the program with credit card debt or
car payments in addition to their expenses for the year. Some rack up
additional debts.</TE>
<TE>   Ashlie Mildfelt, 24, ended up owing hundreds of dollars to
creditors after finishing her VISTA project reorganizing a teen
anti-discrimination program at the L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian Center in Los
Angeles in January. The Texas native believes that prohibiting VISTA
workers from taking second jobs is unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "My argument was working poor people have second jobs. They have
three to four jobs," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Shelter during the year for Chris Hunter, a 26-year-old VISTA
worker in Portland, Ore., took the form of his father's couch,
friends' houses and brief stints house-sitting.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I am living like a member of the 'hidden homeless,' I
have support I can fall back on. There's definitely family assistance
for food--showing up at mom's house at 6," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He had planned to tutor children on the side but dropped the idea
because of VISTA regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Lobes said many VISTA participants gain the experience needed to
launch careers at nonprofits. "It's sort of irresponsible to have
people take on debt to go into a low-paying field," Lobes said. "It's
a program designed to alleviate poverty in the United States, yet it
forces its members to live in poverty."</TE>
<TE>   But Lobes believes she has learned a lot from the program. "It's
fundamentally reshaped the way I see the world," she said.</TE>

<HD>A Deadly Place for Blasphemy</HD>
<DH>In Pakistan, those accused of sacrilege against Islam face
life in prison or execution, if mobs or inmates don't kill them

<DL>LAHORE, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Swirling in the mists of Anwar Kenneth's mind is a messianic vision
of his reign over a world where Christians are saved and Muslims burn
in hell.</LD>
<LD>   The former provincial fisheries official believes he is the son of
Christ and will ascend the throne as king of Israel. Then, he
prophesies, the Islamic holy city of Mecca will be destroyed by fire.</LD>
<LD>   But first Kenneth must die and come back to life. So he and the
family members who believe in his divinity were encouraged when a
Pakistani judge ruled recently that he was a blasphemer and must hang
by the neck until dead.</LD>
<TE>   Kenneth's pronouncements are grave violations of Pakistan's
blasphemy laws, which give a judge only two options when punishing
someone "who defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Muhammad":
life in prison or death at the gallows.</TE>
<TE>   Saadia Khalid, Kenneth's court-appointed lawyer, insists that her
client's preachings are not the hateful sacrilege of an infidel but
the demented ravings of a sick man.</TE>
<TE>   "He is completely a psycho case," said Khalid, a Muslim and a
member of Punjab province's human rights commission. "He is a man of
cool temperament and very confident. He told me: 'I don't need a
lawyer. God is my counsel. He will protect me.' "</TE>
<TE>   In many other countries, Kenneth would be tolerated as an annoying
but harmless eccentric. In Pakistan, a country carved out of India in
1947 to give Muslims a South Asian homeland, he is considered a
dangerous enemy who deserves no mercy.</TE>
<TE>   Colonial laws inherited from British rule over the subcontinent
prohibited blasphemy against any of Pakistan's various faiths. In
1986, Pakistani dictator Gen. Zia ul-Haq rewrote the laws to apply to
Islam alone. Human rights activists say Zia in effect invited
extremists to threaten Pakistan's 15 million Christians--who make up
roughly 10% of the population--and other religious minorities, many
of them members of Muslim sects.</TE>
<TE>   Filing a blasphemy charge in Pakistan is so easy that the laws are
often used to pursue private vendettas and settle disputes over land
or money. Those accused are often killed by village mobs, or by
fellow prisoners in jail, before their cases can be heard. Perhaps
most worrisome, the activists say, is the prosecution of mentally
disturbed people such as Anwar Kenneth.</TE>
<TE>   President Pervez Musharraf has vowed to curb religious extremism,
but critics say that will remain a hollow promise as long as he
leaves the blasphemy laws on the books.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't want to take on any more hassles simply because a few
people are suffering from extremists," said Asma Jehangir, one of
Pakistan's most respected human rights lawyers. "He is allowed to
select what he wants to do as long as he keeps showing some kind of
liberal face to the West. There is an extremely dangerous game being
played."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Musharraf seized control of the government in a 1999
coup, he suggested changing the laws to make it more difficult to
charge someone with blasphemy. Before an arrest could be made, a
deputy police commissioner would have to verify that a crime had been
committed. Musharraf backed off the proposal after Muslim leaders
threatened strikes and unrest.</TE>
<TE>   The president's spokesman, Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, said the
threat of violence was not a factor in Musharraf's change of heart.
The safety of those accused of blasphemy was the president's prime
concern, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Tempers in such cases run so high that before a person is taken
into custody, a crowd may lynch him," Qureshi said. "So therefore, it
is better for a person to be taken into custody immediately."</TE>
<TE>   The problem, Jehangir and other activists say, is that police and
jail guards often turn a blind eye while extremists take justice into
their own hands.</TE>
<TE>   In June, a fellow prisoner shot and killed convicted blasphemer
Mohammed Yusuf Ali in Lahore's Kot Lakhpat jail.</TE>
<TE>   Ali was a Muslim reformer who founded the World Assembly for Human
Excellence. His stated mission was to work at the "grass roots to
develop a culture of peace, tolerance and respect for each other by
promoting values of human dignity and human excellence."</TE>
<TE>   "Today, [the] Islam portrayed in Muslim countries by religious
clergy is a highly distorted version of real Islam, a way of living
with love and peace, and serving the creator and creation," Ali is
quoted in a profile circulated by his followers.</TE>
<TE>   Police charged Ali with blasphemy in March 1997. He stood accused
of writing sacrilegious newspaper columns and claiming to resemble
the Prophet Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Islamic scholars, including a Harvard University
professor, testified or wrote letters in Ali's defense. He was
convicted, and officially declared an infidel, in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Police identified his suspected killer as an inmate who was
charged with three previous murders. They couldn't explain how he got
his hands on a gun and managed to shoot Ali as he was being
transferred to another cellblock.</TE>
<TE>   Broad Support for Laws</TE>
<TE>   Support for the blasphemy laws runs broad and deep in Pakistani
society. Grand imam Maulana Ahmad Ali Kasuri, founder of the True
Muslim Family Values Ministry, said executing blasphemers is the only
way to protect Pakistani society from an illness that seeks to
destroy it.</TE>
<TE>   Muslims view the Koran as God's final, definitive revelation and
Muhammad as the last of the prophets. So any proclamation of a divine
vision such as the one Kenneth made violates a fundamental tenet of
Islam, which holds that there can be no further revelations.</TE>
<TE>   From 1987 to 2001, police charged at least 300 Pakistanis with
differing degrees of blasphemy, according to a study of police and
court records by the nongovernmental Pakistan Human Rights Commission
and a legal aid agency.</TE>
<TE>   The offenses ranged from speaking ill of holy figures, such as one
of Muhammad's wives--punishable by three years in prison or a
fine--to the most serious: defiling the name of the prophet himself.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those charged with blasphemy are convicted. The death
sentence is imposed in fewer than half the cases and is usually
upheld on appeal, Jehangir said. Nevertheless, the government says,
no one has ever been executed for blasphemy.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim Sect Targeted</TE>
<TE>   Those charged under the laws include members of the Ahmadiyya
sect, who believe that Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, a 19th century
Muslim reformer, was the promised messiah. Orthodox Muslims consider
Ahmadis heretics, and the Pakistani Constitution forbids them to call
themselves Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Two Ahmadis charged with blasphemy in March 1996, women in their
60s, were stabbed by their accuser, a tailor in the port city of
Karachi. The victims went from the hospital to prison. The attacker,
who said he had received orders from God in a dream, was never
charged.</TE>
<TE>   Those able to buy their way out of prison go into exile. Prison
justice has taken care of others.</TE>
<TE>   Tahir Iqbal, an air force mechanic, was charged with blasphemy in
December 1990 after converting from Islam to Christianity. In Islam,
apostasy--the abandonment of the faith--is a particularly grave
offense, punishable by death.</TE>
<TE>   Iqbal, paralyzed from the waist down, was denied bail. The night
before his trial began in July 1992, he died in his jail cell. His
lawyer, human rights advocate Naem Shakir, said Iqbal had been
poisoned.</TE>
<TE>   Ayub Masih, a Christian, was arrested in October 1996 after a
villager claimed to have overheard him say, "If [you] want to know
the truth about Islam, then read Salman Rushdie."</TE>
<TE>   Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses," published in 1988, enraged
many Muslims with its whimsical, sometimes outrageous retelling of
Muhammad's life. For years, Rushdie lived under a death sentence
imposed by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who denounced the
novel as a work of blasphemy. In 1998, Khomeini's successors in
effect rescinded the edict.</TE>
<TE>   Masih was not so fortunate. One of his accusers, Mohammed Akram,
shot him during the trial in the Punjab town of Sahiwal. Akram was
never charged. Masih survived, only to be found guilty and sentenced
to death in April 1998. He remains in prison, waiting for the
country's Supreme Court to hear his appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Nine days after Masih's conviction, Roman Catholic Bishop John
Joseph of Faisalabad led a protest march to the courthouse. Once
inside the building, the bishop put a gun to his head and committed
suicide, according to police. Some of the bishop's followers believe
he was murdered.</TE>
<TE>   Blasphemy allegations are commonly used to settle scores, such as
village disputes over land, or to cover up crimes such as sexual
abuse or land theft, said Jehangir, the human rights lawyer. Judges
are loath to throw out even weak blasphemy cases because they fear
retaliation from radical Islamists, she said.</TE>
<TE>   At least two mentally disabled women were physically and sexually
assaulted by village mobs who accused them of blasphemy in recent
years, Jehangir said. One was raped and set on fire in Punjab's Rahim
Yar Khan district in 1999, the study of police and court records
found.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a mob dragged a mentally ill man from his home, beat
him unconscious with iron rods and sticks, then stoned him to death,
allegedly on the instructions of a local Muslim cleric.</TE>
<TE>   The victim, Zahid Shah, had been convicted of blasphemy in 1994
for claiming to be a prophet. An appeals court ordered his release
three years later after concluding that he was mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   Anwar Kenneth's troubles began after he quit his government job
and began preaching that Muhammad was a false prophet and that Jesus
Christ was the only savior. Kenneth, who lived across the street from
a police station, taunted officers, challenging them to arrest him.</TE>
<TE>   In an Aug. 27 letter, he informed a local Muslim leader that he
and all other followers of Islam were damned. Kenneth then invited
Muslims to charge him with blasphemy and execute him.</TE>
<TE>   That would speed his rise to "the throne of the Lord in
Jerusalem," where, Kenneth wrote, he would rule for 1,260 days until
"the beast ascends from the bottomless pit" and kills him again.</TE>
<TE>   Though Kenneth refused to let anyone defend him, Khalid, his
court-appointed lawyer, met with him four times in jail. Each time,
she said, she left more certain that he was sick.</TE>
<TE>   She asked the judge to order a psychiatric examination before his
trial began. Kenneth's state of mind was irrelevant, the judge ruled,
because he had confessed to declaring Muhammad a false prophet and
had bragged about the crime. He found Kenneth guilty July 18 and sent
him straight to Kot Lakhpat jail, where his defenders fear he could
be harmed.</TE>
<TE>   Bush Seen as Antichrist</TE>
<TE>   While in prison awaiting trial, Kenneth scribbled calculations
with formulas he said he had derived from the books of Daniel, Isaiah
and Revelation. In the numbers, he saw the truth: He wrote that the
antichrist, marked by the sign of 666, is none other than George
Walker Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "He will try to change the world order and belief," Kenneth wrote
in his prison cell May 27. "He will force people to surrender, and
those who will not will be destroyed. When George Walker Bush
completes 42 months of his rule, he will be killed and the world be
ruled by the pious people."</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth sent 188 copies of the neatly typed four-page letter to
foreign leaders, Muslim and Christian clerics, foreign diplomats in
Pakistan and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Jesus Christ was resurrected three days after his
crucifixion, Kenneth said, he would rise from the dead. Then the
holiest sites of Islam, Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia, "will be
destroyed with fire and brimstone by the Lord Jesus Christ and its
land shall become burning pitch," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "God bless you all," the letter ended. "Amen."</TE>

<HD>Centrist Returns as Bolivia's President</HD>
<DH>South America: Congress chooses former leader Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LA PAZ, Bolivia</DL>
<LD>Bolivia's Congress on Sunday elected Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada--a
U.S.-educated, pro-market former president--to lead the nation for
the next five years as it confronts economic malaise and growing
social unrest.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez de Lozada, who opened up Bolivia to foreign investment
during his 1993-97 presidency, won by an 84-43 margin over Evo
Morales, an Aymara Indian and a leading opponent of U.S.-backed
efforts to eliminate the farming of coca leaves, from which cocaine
is derived.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Mesa, a 53-year-old journalist and political newcomer who
shared Sanchez de Lozada's ticket, was elected vice president during
the 24-hour legislature session. Congress had yet to release the
final official tally, but it confirmed that Sanchez de Lozada
received enough votes to win.</LD>
<TE>   Sanchez de Lozada finished first in a June 30 vote--the closest
presidential election in Bolivia's history--but fell short of the
majority needed for an outright victory. The newly elected Congress
had to choose between him and Morales, the runner-up.</TE>
<TE>   Following the vote, Sanchez de Lozada called for the country's
fractious political parties to work together. "We can't be fighting
each other and misunderstanding each other, because the country is in
crisis," he told reporters in his front yard.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez de Lozada, who will be sworn in Tuesday, aims to revive
Bolivia's stagnant economy. About 60% of the nation's 8 million
people live in poverty. The budget deficit is 6.9% of the gross
domestic product, and the International Monetary Fund has said it
wants spending cuts.</TE>

<LD>With armed riot police surrounding parliament, lawmakers today
elected Michael Somare, the founding father of modern Papua New

minister.</LD>
<LD>   His appointment followed a chaotic election marred by vote-rigging

send armed officers to parliament in Port Moresby, the capital, ahead

<LD>   The horseshoe-shaped stadium--a major tourist attraction--was the
site of the first modern Olympics, in 1896.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery came as part of an effort to topple the once-elusive
November 17 terrorist group, which has suffered its first blows after
outwitting authorities for 27 years.</LD>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear whether the cache belonged to
November 17 or other, smaller urban guerrilla cells, police said.</TE>

<LD>China said today that Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian's backing of
a referendum on formal independence would cause severe damage to
cross-strait relations and lead the island toward disaster.</LD>
<LD>   "We seriously warn Taiwan [separatist] forces not to wrongly judge
the situation, to immediately stop the horse at the edge of the
precipice and to stop all [separatist] activities," said Li Weiyi,
spokesman for Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office.</LD>
<LD>   Chen said Saturday that holding a referendum was a "basic human
right" and there was basically "one country on each side" of the
Taiwan Strait.</LD>

<HD>Long-Buried Land Mines Still Taking a Toll on Kurds</HD>
<DH>Iraq: Groups working to clear war zones fear another
invasion could reverse hard-won gains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>DIYANAH, Iraq</DL>
<LD>The temptation to kick around an empty tin can--why is it so
irresistible? That is the question 13-year-old Hawkar Mostafa
continues to ask himself as he sits in a wheelchair, his right leg
amputated at the knee.</LD>
<LD>   Hawkar lost his leg in late April after setting off what he
discovered--too late--was a land mine.</LD>
<LD>   "I was gathering herbs with my friends in the mountains when I saw
this rusty old can and kicked it," recalled the freckled youth,
mustering a wry grin. "Nothing happened, and I kicked it again, and
the next thing I knew I was flying in the air."</LD>
<TE>   Hawkar, who lives in this remote mountain town bordering Iran, is
among scores of Iraqi Kurds injured every year in land mine accidents
in the Kurdish-controlled north, a region that is counted among the
world's grimmest war zones.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraqi Kurdistan is easily one of the riskiest areas in terms of
unexploded land mines and military ordnance," said Michael Parker of
the Mines Advisory Group, a British nongovernmental organization that
specializes in mine-clearing operations in various countries.</TE>
<TE>   The group has demarcated about 230 square miles of mined territory
and destroyed 85,000 land mines--mainly along the Iranian border--in
the decade since it began clearance work in northern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Between 5 million and 10 million land mines are thought to be
still buried under the flower-carpeted mountains near the border with
Iran, Parker said. The majority are believed to have been planted
during the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq that ended in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Kurdish rebels who until three years ago fought an insurgency
against Turkey's army are also known to have laid thousands of mines
along the Turkish-Iraqi border.</TE>
<TE>   As speculation grows about a U.S.-led military operation to
overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, many officials here voice
concern that years of painstaking de-mining work will be seriously
disrupted, if not undone.</TE>
<TE>   "Land mines have long been a curse for the Kurdish people, and
with each war the problem gets worse," said Sami Abdurrahman, a
senior official in the self-styled Kurdish regional administration
that has been running northern Iraq since the end of the 1991 Persian
Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "Thousands of my people have been maimed, killed. We want this
suffering to end."</TE>
<TE>   Parker says his group concentrates chiefly on minefields that are
close to villages, where the risk of accidents is greatest.</TE>
<TE>   Up in the Balek Valley about 19 miles northeast of Diyanah,
workers with the Mines Advisory Group, weighed down by heavy flak
jackets and helmets, do much of their mine detection on impossibly
steep, gravelly slopes.</TE>
<TE>   "One slip of the foot, and boom, we could get killed," said Wirya
Mustafa Ali, an Iraqi Kurd who supervises work in what locals call
the Valley of Death.</TE>
<TE>   The other danger is Hussein. The Iraqi leader has put a $50,000
bounty on the head of all Western aid workers in northern Iraq,
saying they are spies for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurdish enclave, protected by U.S. and British warplanes
patrolling a "no-fly" zone, has remained outside Baghdad's control
since the end of the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a car bomb, thought to have been planted by Iraqi agents,
went off outside the Mines Advisory Group's headquarters in the city
of Sulaymaniyah.</TE>
<TE>   Donor contributions have dwindled, Parker said, since the 1997
death of Britain's Princess Diana, who was a leading advocate for a
worldwide ban on land mines.</TE>
<TE>   "With Diana gone, land mines have slipped off the public's
agenda," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Iraqi Kurdish officials, the greatest challenge of
all is creating awareness of the land mine problem among locals. One
way is to train Islamic clerics, who can warn their congregations
against collecting firewood and herbs in demarcated areas.</TE>
<TE>   Booklets with pictures of different types of mines and shells
published by Parker's group are handed out to schoolchildren and to
those smuggling alcohol and tobacco between Iraq and Iran, who, with
farmers, are considered the highest-risk groups.</TE>
<TE>   Eighty families live in the village of Derbend in the Balek
Valley, and at least one member of every family has suffered a mine
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail Mustafa Nabi, a 49-year-old farmer, lost his legs when he
set off a mine as he was planting wheat 18 years ago. His 14-year-old
daughter, Safiya, lost an eye after picking up an unexploded mortar
shell near their house last year.</TE>
<TE>   Nabi, who has nine children, sounds undaunted.</TE>
<TE>   "I am ready to give my daughter's hand [in marriage] for free, to
anyone who offers me a second wife," he said. "Legs or no legs, life
goes on, and I intend to enjoy every minute I have left."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Lends $1.5 Billion to Uruguay</HD>
<DH>Latin America: The emergency move is a bid to ease the
formerly stable nation's banking crisis and avoid an Argentina-style
collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration made an emergency $1.5-billion loan to
Uruguay on Sunday in a bid to halt the country's banking crisis and
limit the possibility of another Argentina-style economic collapse.</LD>
<LD>   The loan was described as a "bridge" or short-term loan until the
International Monetary Fund and other multinational lenders can act
on Uruguay's behalf later this week.</LD>
<LD>   Considered until recent months to be so stable and secure that it
was described as the "Switzerland of South America," Uruguay
experienced an outbreak of social unrest last week after the
government closed all banks Tuesday to stop a run on the banking
system.</LD>
<TE>   Banks have remained shut since. The U.S. loan is intended to make
it possible to reopen banks today.</TE>
<TE>   The action appeared to mark a departure for the administration,
which has generally opposed bailouts. But failure to act might have
led to financial problems elsewhere in Latin America, where Argentina
and Brazil are already facing trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Although Uruguay has just 3.3 million people, it acts as a banking
center for many South American nations, especially Argentina, whose
citizens have come to rely on Uruguayan bank deposits as their own
country's banking system remains tightly restricted in the aftermath
of a January devaluation and a partial banking freeze that began in
December.</TE>
<TE>   A steady withdrawal of funds from Uruguay this year by cash-
hungry Argentines has accelerated in recent weeks as rumors swirled
that Uruguay would follow Argentina's example and impose a freeze of
its own. The bank holiday imposed Tuesday was the realization of
those fears.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign reserves have dwindled to $655 million from $3 billion a
year ago. Violence erupted last week as depositors vented their
outrage at being unable to access their funds.</TE>
<TE>   In confirming the loan late Sunday, the Treasury Department
praised Uruguayan President Jorge Batlle for "courageous commitments
to ensure that Uruguay remains a strong financial center."</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident that this enhanced program will help Uruguay
address the intense external pressures it has faced in recent
months," Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said in a statement. He
arrived in Brazil on Sunday and will visit Uruguay and Argentina
later in the week.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. acted after Uruguay's Congress approved emergency
legislation that blocked access to long-term deposits, similar to
certificates of deposit, for three years in exchange for higher rates
of interest. Checking and savings accounts will not be affected.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts noted parallels between the action on behalf of Uruguay
and policies of the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration has been critical of President Clinton's
willingness to respond to the Mexican and Southeast Asian crises,
saying that too much money had been used to bail out countries
suffering because of bad policy or because foreign investors had made
bad decisions," UCLA economics professor Sebastian Edwards said. "The
key question is whether this [loan] signals a change in U.S. attitude
with respect to currency crises and whether the U.S. will be willing
to give other large aid packages to countries in financial
difficulties."</TE>
<TE>   Other than a $10-billion assistance package to Turkey in April
2001, the Uruguay loan is the only sizable financial bailout
President Bush has made since taking office.</TE>
<TE>   But Uruguay poses a danger of financial contagion in Latin
America. Argentina, mired in a a four-year recession, continues to
plead for a bailout from the IMF and World Bank. Brazil may soon need
assistance because of debt and a weakening currency.</TE>

<HD>16 Die as Violence Sweeps Mideast</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Among the dead are nine bus riders killed by a
suicide bomber in northern Israel. Gunmen attack in Jerusalem, West
Bank.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY and TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MERON, Israel</DL>
<LD>In a day of bloodshed, nine soldiers and civilians were killed Sunday
when a Palestinian suicide bomber blew up a commuter bus in northern
Israel, and three more people died hours later in a gun battle
outside the Damascus Gate of Jerusalem's walled Old City.</LD>
<LD>   The violence continued after midnight, when Palestinians opened
fire on a car near the West Bank settlement of Shiloh, killing an
Israeli couple and injuring two of their children, the army said.
That attack followed several other ambushes Sunday that left 10
Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers wounded. And an armed
Palestinian in a wetsuit was shot dead by soldiers as he emerged from
the Mediterranean in the northern Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   The militant Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
bombing. The organization is pressing ahead with a campaign of
revenge for Israel's slaying last month of the head of the group's
military wing. Hamas has vowed to kill 100 Israelis for every one of
its leaders assassinated by Israel; other Palestinian groups vowed to
join in.</LD>
<TE>   Angry Israeli officials promised to retaliate for Sunday's carnage
and postponed high-level talks with officials of the Palestinian
Authority planned for this week. But the Israeli government appears
to be running out of options as it attempts to head off what seems
like a steady supply of Palestinian suicide bombers and gunmen.
Reoccupation of most of the West Bank has slowed but not stopped the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Israel is resorting to demolishing homes belonging to the families
of suicide bombers--nine were destroyed overnight Saturday--and will
attempt to deport relatives of some attackers. Maj. Gen. Yitzhak
Eitan, head of Israel's Central Command, signed an order Sunday to
expel the sister of a man Israel believes sent two suicide bombers to
a Tel Aviv bus station last month. Two male relatives of other
militants are appealing their deportation orders. The army maintains
that these relatives had some link to the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's blast in the northern Galilee hills during the
start-of-the-week rush hour turned the crowded passenger bus into a
fireball. Mangled bodies were hurled from the vehicle, whose roof was
peeled away and whose sides were twisted and shredded.</TE>
<TE>   Other passengers were trapped in the burning bus, screaming for
help, witnesses and rescue workers said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been working in the field for 22 years and have never seen
such an atrocious scene," said Hanan Sofer, head of the local Magen
David Adom emergency ambulance service.</TE>
<TE>   Boaz Altshuler, a passenger who was wounded, was about to get off
the bus when flames engulfed him. "I went to the door to get off and
just then there was an explosion," he told Israeli television. "I
felt a ball of fire in the face and parts of people flew by."</TE>
<TE>   Avraham Freed, who owns the Meron Inn at the intersection where
the bus exploded, was one of the first to rush to the scene in the
normally tranquil pocket of Israel north of the Sea of Galilee.</TE>
<TE>   "There were things shooting through the roof and bodies were
tossed out of the windows," he said. "There was nothing we could do.
Who could have believed that something like this would happen here?"</TE>
<TE>   Freed reached the bus, about 50 yards from his inn, and used a
bottle of water to wash blood from the faces of survivors. No one on
the bus escaped injury. Nine people plus the bomber were killed and
about 50 were injured. The fire, which raged for more than 10 minutes
before rescuers could extinguish it, will make identifying the dead
difficult, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, who survived his second bus bombing in six years, told
police that he did not recall a suspicious passenger boarding the
bus, which departed from the port city of Haifa about 7 a.m. and
traveled east toward Safed, a mystical religious city that is also
the site of a major army base. The route has several stops in Arab
villages.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas said the attack was the work of a suicide bomber. In a
departure from previous cases, the group would not identify him, to
protect his family from Israeli retaliation. In a bombing at the
cafeteria of Jerusalem's Hebrew University last week, a Hamas
operative planted the explosive and fled, detonating it by remote
control.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the passengers on Bus 361 were soldiers returning to base
after weekend leave. But Arabs were also aboard and were among the
dead and injured, said Dr. Oscar Embon, director of the Rebecca Seiff
Hospital in Safed, where most of the victims were taken. A
22-year-old soldier, Aryeh Shenkar, was among the wounded. He was
undergoing surgery to remove metal fragments from his back. His aunt,
Nitzhya Buschbaum, was visibly angry as she waited in a hospital
corridor.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to put all of the Israelis into the sea, but that, we
don't give them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sami Hamud, a Druze from the village of Beit Jan, rushed to the
hospital when he received a call alerting him that his wife, Dina,
was wounded. She had caught the bus early to reach school in Safed in
time for an exam. Hamud feared she was dead.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy because I've been given my wife back," he said from her
bedside once they were reunited.</TE>
<TE>   Her face and neck were badly cut.</TE>
<TE>   The dead included three Israeli soldiers, an Israeli Arab woman
and two Filipino women, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis were only beginning to absorb the news from the north
when a gun battle erupted in bustling East Jerusalem, just outside
the Old City's Damascus Gate.</TE>
<TE>   A 19-year-old Palestinian armed with a pistol leaped onto the
passenger-side running board of a truck from the Israeli telephone
company Bezeq. He fired into the cab, killing a security guard, then
opened the door, pulled the guard out and fired at the driver,
according to witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli paramilitary border police, stationed throughout the area,
heard the shooting and descended on the site, firing pell-mell, the
witnesses said. They shot the gunman dead, and a 51-year-old Arab man
sitting in a cafe also was killed. About 16 people were wounded,
including border guards and Palestinian workers, shoppers and
merchants. A few were shot, apparently by police, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   "When a terrorist is in an area crowded with civilians, it's very
possible that some of the civilians would be hit," said Jerusalem's
police chief, Mickey Levy.</TE>
<TE>   Before he was killed, the gunman had time to reach the strip of
cafes and fruit stands across from Damascus Gate and reload his gun,
witnesses said. He looked calm and steady as he returned to continue
shooting before being shot himself, they said.</TE>
<TE>   There was pandemonium. "So many people came running into my shop,
scared, crying," said Ala Sublaban, 25, who runs a tobacco store.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the worst thing I'd seen since 1967," the year of the
Middle East War, said money changer Samir Dajani. "They were shooting
from all directions and at everything, coming up Salahadeen Street
and up from Damascus Gate. People were running in all directions."</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia affiliated with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah organization, claimed
responsibility for the incident as well as several other attacks
Sunday in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   In two separate attacks, seven Israeli soldiers and Jewish
settlers were injured while driving between settlements north of
Ramallah and near Tulkarm. Three soldiers were injured during raids
in Nablus.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the northern Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers shot and
killed a Palestinian in a wetsuit as he came ashore along the
Mediterranean coast. The man had an automatic rifle and grenades and
apparently swam along the coast before emerging near the Jewish
settlements of Dugit and Alei Sinai, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's Palestinian Authority condemned Sunday's bus attack but
said in a statement that Israel's policy of "mass detentions,
repressive measures and home demolitions" was responsible for the
cycle of violence.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush said he was "distressed" over the latest Middle
East bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a few killers who want to stop the peace process that
we have started. We must not let them," Bush told reporters in
Kennebunkport, Maine, where he was vacationing.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy reported from Meron and Safed, and Wilkinson from
Jerusalem. Times staff writer Edwin Chen in Kennebunkport contributed
to this report.</TE>

<HD>Bombing in Spain Leaves Two People Dead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>Two people, including a 6-year-old girl, were killed and several
others were injured Sunday when a car bomb exploded in front of a
military police barracks in southeastern Spain, police and a
government official said. At least 25 people were injured.</LD>
<LD>   A 50-year-old man, identified as Cecilio Gallego, who was waiting
at a bus stop next to the barracks, died in the blast, Interior
Ministry official Francisco Camps said.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the car bomb exploded shortly after 8:30 p.m. in the
resort town of Santa Pola, about 225 miles southeast of Madrid.</LD>
<TE>   Investigating Judge Gordiano Casas said the unidentified girl, the
daughter of a military police officer, was playing in her bedroom
inside the barracks when the bomb went off.</TE>
<TE>   The other 25 people injured suffered cuts and burns; two of them
remained hospitalized in serious condition, Camps said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the cause of the blast had yet to be confirmed, Interior
Minister Angel Acebes blamed the attack on the Basque separatist
group ETA. "ETA kills whenever it can, and when it doesn't kill it is
only because the security forces have taken apart their commandos....
Now they have attacked a little girl, the daughter of a Civil Guard
[officer]," Acebes told Antena 3 television at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. ETA typically
waits several weeks before admitting its attacks.</TE>
<TE>   ETA has killed more than 800 people since 1968 to press its
demands for an independent state in Basque areas of northern Spain
and southwestern France. It is listed as a terrorist organization by
the European Union and the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   ETA's last fatal attack came March 21, when a Socialist politician
was shot dead in a bar in the Basque town of Orio.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the group has claimed responsibility for several car
bombings around the country, including five blasts that coincided
with the EU summit in Seville in June. No one was killed in those
incidents.</TE>

<HD>The Drums Beat, but Is War With Iraq on Horizon?</HD>
<DH>Military: Despite hawkish rhetoric from the Bush
administration and discussion in the media, the sequel to the Gulf
War may wait.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The rumble of war drums for Gulf War II began in early spring. That's
when Ken Pollack got the call from Random House asking if he could
speed-write a book on Iraq. The publisher wanted it out by
fall--pegged to what then looked like the launch of a U.S. offensive
against Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   "It was about the time Afghanistan was quieting down," said
Pollack, a former Iraq strategist for both the Clinton and current
Bush administrations now at the Council on Foreign Relations. "The
hawks at the Pentagon began saying: 'Heck, that was easy. Let's do
Iraq too.' The media picked up on it. Then others began to take
note."</LD>
<LD>   With the first Senate hearings on Iraq last week, the rumble is
now a roar. News networks have lined up talking heads to dissect
whatever happens. Think tanks are hosting seminars on the potential
impact on world oil supplies, a postwar government in Baghdad, and
the plight of ethnic Kurds. And Pollack's manuscript for "The
Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq" went to Random House
two weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   But is war really that close? Or will the sequel to Operation
Desert Storm wait until next year--or maybe even President Bush's
second term, assuming he has one?</TE>
<TE>   The rhetoric may be way ahead of the reality, even advocates of an
Iraq war admit.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, a leading
administration hawk, recently told U.S. troops in Afghanistan: "It's
too dangerous to wait 10 years for them to hit us. Sept. 11 was
nothing compared to what an attack with chemical and biological
weapons would be--we're not going to wait forever to solve it."</TE>
<TE>   "But we aren't fixed on any particular solution," he conceded.
"There aren't answers yet."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the hearings last
week, said Sunday that he believes there probably will be a war. But
he added, "There's a lot more to do," echoing his earlier prediction
that it won't happen this year. "This is very difficult to do by
yourself. There's a lot to do after [Hussein is] taken down," he said
on NBC's "Meet the Press."</TE>
<TE>   Bush faces daunting obstacles to pull off an operation as smooth
as the lightning campaign run by his father to liberate tiny,
oil-rich Kuwait from Iraq in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   To begin with, the aim differs. In 1991, Bush's father had a
military goal: to force Iraq out of Kuwait. Now the U.S. is facing
the political mission of eliminating Hussein's government and
building a new Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The planning for this operation is very much influenced by
political objectives. And so far, there's not a consensus on the
precise political route we want to take," said Charles Duelfer,
former deputy chairman of the U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The difference redefines both strategy and targets.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1991, the Iraqi army was the enemy. Now Iraqi troops could
actually be an ally. So should we target them? Or should we be
telling them that their future is bright under new management, so
help us make this possible--defect or at least don't fight us?"
Duelfer said.</TE>
<TE>   Other operational considerations are just as complex:</TE>
<TE>   * Iraq's neighbors still have to be convinced to provide bases or
at least allow refueling, overflight and other rights. Visiting
Washington last week, Jordan's King Abdullah II blasted the idea of
war as "ludicrous" and a "tremendous mistake." Saudi Arabia and
Turkey, the two strategic neighbors of Iraq, publicly oppose war. And
the 22-member Arab League has unanimously rejected force against
Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Among Europeans, Britain is quietly warning about the dangers. And
in Germany, which helped foot the $60-billion cost of the Persian
Gulf War, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder warned Saturday against
rushing into action. "Germany is no longer a country where checkbook
diplomacy replaces politics," Schroeder said. "At least not under
me."</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. intelligence has limited "human assets" in Iraq available
to carry out vital pre-military operations, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   * Iraq's searing weather makes almost half the year dangerous for
troops and tanks. Supplying enough water in either the southern
deserts or northern mountains--the two best entry routes--would be a
logistical nightmare. The preferred time to start is between October
and February.</TE>
<TE>   * Afghanistan is still a distraction, with Osama bin Laden and
Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar still unaccounted for and much of
the country not under the new government's full control.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, once again
escalating, also looms. Administration hawks argue that there is no
link between the two regional hot spots, but trying to launch a war
when the other conflict is raging would tax U.S. diplomatic resources
and credibility, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to do this properly, we should wait to make sure
the Mideast peace process is calm enough to allow moderate Arab
states to support it, and Al Qaeda to be brought under tighter
control so we're not subject to new terrorist attacks," Pollack said.</TE>
<TE>   "We should wait until we've built the kind of coalition of
European, Arab and Asian states that will make an invasion
politically easier and reconstruction much less costly to us, not
just financially. Having them on board will be an enormous benefit,
and if we don't have them, we'll really regret it."</TE>
<TE>   Other diplomatic hurdles are just as challenging.</TE>
<TE>   An especially unpredictable variable will be the U.N. weapons
inspection program. After stalling for four years, Iraq on Thursday
invited the top inspector, Hans Blix, to Baghdad for technical talks.
But Blix and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell rejected the offer as
a smoke screen.</TE>
<TE>   The real danger is down the road, if Iraq allows inspectors to
return at the eleventh hour before a U.S. strike--and then delays
cooperation, limiting U.S. options.</TE>
<TE>   Crafting a post-Hussein government from disparate opposition
groups would be another major challenge.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department this week will host a summit of top exiles to
sketch a postwar vision for Iraq. But some groups spend more time
squabbling among themselves than opposing Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic issues, including fall elections and a plummeting stock
market, may further influence the administration's timing on Iraq,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there's what policymakers call the "X" factor: a new
crisis to divert the decision-makers.</TE>
<TE>   The hurdles didn't stop the Weekly Standard, which first beat the
war drums against Iraq, from running a cover story last week
heralding "The Coming War With Saddam."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Editor William Kristol said, "My view is that
Bush has made the decision, and he's going to implement it sooner
than later ... I'm confident."</TE>

<HD>Elvis Poised for His Next Comeback</HD>
<DH>Music: The King is the latest bygone act whose hits are
being mined for profit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of this year's best-selling albums is likely to come from a
Mississippi singer and onetime delivery truck driver toting a radical
sound and wicked dance moves. But he won't be touring--Elvis Presley
has been dead for a quarter century.</LD>
<LD>   Next month "Elvis: 30 #1 Hits" will arrive in stores, backed by a
$10-million marketing blitz that runs from a network TV special to
random "Elvis sightings" on the Internet to a traveling exhibit of
items, including the late singer's karate uniform, borrowed from his
Tennessee estate. Bertelsmann, the German conglomerate that owns RCA
Records and the Elvis Presley music catalog, hopes to sell 10 million
copies of this collection of hit singles.</LD>
<LD>   With the album's release, RCA joins a growing list of music
companies that are betting big on the past as sales of their new
acts' albums continue to plunge. Many are dreaming of duplicating the
recent eye-popping success of the Beatles' "1" CD, a compilation of
hit singles that has sold 23 million copies worldwide since British
music conglomerate EMI Group released it two years ago. But major
record labels, which long viewed archive sales as an afterthought,
also are rushing to generate profits from their decades-old music
libraries before digital piracy in the Napster era threatens their
value.</LD>
<TE>   Last year album sales in the United States, the world's biggest
music market, declined 3%, the first drop-off in a decade. And so far
this year music sales are down an additional 10%. Meanwhile, blank
CDs that can copy music downloaded from the Internet are flying off
retail shelves. Blank CD sales are expected to jump nearly 40% this
year to more than 1.2 billion units, according to the Consumer
Electronics Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Record companies are reeling from the market shifts. Universal
Music Group, the world's biggest record conglomerate, said operating
income for its most recent quarter plunged 61%. Sony Music
Entertainment, the second-biggest music company, recently reported a
quarterly loss of $86 million, compared with a $37-million profit a
year earlier. So major record labels are scrambling to cut costs and
create blockbusters cheaply.</TE>
<TE>   Catalog sales have long been crucial to record labels. In the
music divisions of AOL Time Warner Inc. or Sony Corp., as much as 65%
of their annual profits have come from catalog sales and the
licensing of songs from their libraries, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a record company's value hinges in part on the size and
quality of its music library. That's why labels demand ownership of
the master recordings when they sign artists to long-term contracts.
A big label like Warner Bros. or Columbia may have 125 current
artists on its rosters and release 60 new albums per year, of which
only five or six will turn a profit. But the label's parent company
may hold the master recordings of thousands more artists in its
vaults.</TE>
<TE>   Repackaging older artists' work is typically cheaper than
financing a new act's concert tour, filming music videos and paying
for radio promotion. As a result, labels often earn profit margins
twice as large on catalog albums compared with successful new albums.</TE>
<TE>   And in the case of the new Presley album, RCA has an added edge:
It doesn't have to give the Presley estate much of the profits. In
1973, Presley and his manager, "Colonel" Tom Parker, accepted a
$5.4-million payment--which they split--and agreed to forgo future
royalties from the singer's recordings made until that date. As a
result, Presley's estate has not profited from much of his worldwide
album sales for nearly 30 years. In exchange for providing photos and
artifacts on the "Hits" album, however, Presley's estate will be a
"participant" in sales of the album, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann Music Group, long a money-losing division, expects
brisk sales of the Elvis collection to help it generate a
$100-million operating profit this year.</TE>
<TE>   At BMG, often criticized for failing to develop its catalog, the
Presley archive is a sore point. Record executives inside and outside
the company say it has flooded the market with a hodgepodge of
low-quality Presley compilations and failed to steward his legacy as
rock 'n' roll's first superstar. In the last decade Presley has sold
more than 18 million albums in the U.S.--heavy volume, but well
behind the 28 million sold by the Backstreet Boys or the 54 million
by country singer Garth Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been so much Elvis catalog in the market, I think it was
mismanaged," said Joe DiMuro, senior vice president of strategic
marketing for BMG, who is leading the Presley campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But mismanagement is part of the Presley mythology.</TE>
<TE>   Executives still marvel at the decisions made by "Colonel" Parker,
the carnival promoter who took Presley under his wing after meeting
the singer in 1954 as Presley was gaining popularity. Parker then
went on to negotiate the sale of Presley's early recording contract
with Sun Records to RCA and obtained some of the biggest paydays of
the time for his client.</TE>
<TE>   But Parker, whose "colonel" rank was an honorary title bestowed on
him by the governor of Louisiana, was criticized for pushing Presley
into a string of mediocre films at the expense of his music, badly
misjudging the singer's talent and for allegedly cheating his client
to finance his gambling addiction. Presley died at the age of 42 from
a heart attack 25 years ago next week. Parker died in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   For the "Hits" blitz, BMG received some help from Walt Disney Co.,
which licensed six Presley songs for its animated film "Lilo &amp;
Stitch," and from Nike, which used a remix of an obscure 1968 Presley
tune, "A Little Less Conversation," as the soundtrack for an
estimated $100-million TV ad campaign during soccer's World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   RCA is now promoting the song to pop radio stations and plans to
include it on the "#1 Hits" compilation, which is dominated by
earlier hits such as "Jailhouse Rock." Bertelsmann also is pushing
Presley through its Random House division, which is publishing three
new Presley books, and has cut deals with online services such as
Lycos and America Online, where animated photos of Elvis riding a
motorcycle or swiveling his hips will appear.</TE>
<TE>   RCA has been trying to learn from EMI's success with the Beatles'
"1" hits collection. EMI had sold millions of Beatles compilation
records and outtakes in recent years. But the company then embarked
on consolidating a package of the band's No. 1 singles.</TE>
<TE>   To market the album, EMI's Capitol record label and the Beatles'
Apple Corps targeted an audience of young teens and kids. EMI
purchased TV time hyping the Beatles album on kid-oriented outlets
such as cable TV's Nickelodeon, and shifted away from traditional
record stores to promote it at Wal-Mart and Target, which tend to
stock hit albums sought by younger consumers. The record company also
timed the Beatles CD release for the holiday season, aiming to set it
up as a go-to gift.</TE>
<TE>   The album's success helped create a 14% jump in EMI's profit at a
time when the company was otherwise absent from the Billboard pop
chart. The explosive sales helped the Beatles earn $31.9 million last
year, according to Rolling Stone magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Ayeroff, an architect of the marketing campaign behind "1,"
said as more catalog-based releases emerge, record labels run the
risk of appearing exploitative. "There's enough in the vaults to
create a lot of garbage and enough to create a lot of great stuff,"
he said. "The trick is take the appropriate road."</TE>
<TE>   But pressure is mounting on record labels to generate sales from
their catalogs as the economics of the music business continue to
unravel. Record labels, including BMG, are considering overhauling
the contract system to cut shorter deals with artists--but that means
each label's library would grow more slowly.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the rise of file-swapping services on the Internet and
CD-burning is threatening to wipe out in a few years the value of the
music libraries that labels have built over decades.</TE>
<TE>   Konrad Hilbers, who heads Napster, said during the file-sharing
service's heyday, about 35% of the songs copied were older titles or
others not available in the U.S. That traffic, he said, represents a
promotional opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "In the movie industry, Disney revised all of its stuff again and
again and brings it back to introduce to a new generation of kids. I
think that content will reappear and will revive, and the music
industry has not seen the beginning of that," Hilbers said.</TE>
<TE>   But several music executives dispute the idea that free
file-sharing encourages interest in older material.</TE>
<TE>   Record label executives also worry that they are now selling
against the clock. Young music fans weaned on downloading pirated
hits may develop an appetite for older material. Yet many retail
stores are removing older albums to allocate more shelf space to DVDs
and video games, making it harder to get new "old" collections in the
stores.</TE>
<TE>   "You are no longer in a world where you can dump out a product,
label it 'remastered' and expect it to sell," said Bruce Resnikoff,
president of Universal Music Enterprises, the catalog division of
Universal Music Group. "For higher-profile catalog releases, the
marketing plans today are as intricate as those for new artists."</TE>
<TE>   This year BMG started Heritage, a catalog division that guided the
release of Barry Manilow's collection of hits in "Ultimate Manilow,"
which has sold about 900,000 copies so far.</TE>
<TE>   Other record labels have plans for big-budget collections by the
Police, the Rolling Stones and Fleetwood Mac.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, to market Pink Floyd's double-CD "Echoes," Capitol
Records pursued an audience of men 35 years and older. It aired some
5,000 direct-order TV commercials on ESPN, Speedvision (now the Speed
Channel) and other media outlets, and underwrote the cost of midnight
screenings of the band's film, "The Wall." Capitol also handed out
eight-song samplers from the album at performances of a touring laser
show featuring the band's music. So far "Echoes" has sold an
estimated 5 million copies worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting together these kinds of albums has to be done
selectively," DiMuro said. "You can't do it with all of your back
catalog. Effective catalog management has been absent from the record
industry."</TE>

<HD>White House Signals It Will Move to Forestall West Coast
Port Strike</HD>
<DH>Labor: Officials have warned of steps the government could
take to avert a job action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has intervened aggressively in labor talks at
West Coast ports, with high-level officials signaling that they are
prepared to take strong action to prevent an economically crippling
strike or slowdown.</LD>
<LD>   Soon after negotiations between dockworkers and shipping lines
began in mid-May, the White House convened a working group to monitor
them, with representatives from the departments of Commerce, Labor
and Transportation and the Office of Homeland Security.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, a Labor Department official has met with the union
negotiating committee twice in San Francisco and made almost daily
phone calls. That official, who spoke on the condition that he not be
named, confirmed that he suggested four steps the administration or
Congress might take if the union were to call a strike or a slowdown,
all of which would keep cargo moving.</LD>
<TE>   One option, and perhaps the most likely, would be for the
president to declare a national emergency and invoke the Taft-Hartley
Act, which would force the delay of a strike for 80 days. The act was
last used in 1978 during a coal miners' strike.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said the economic importance of the ports
and the level of animosity between the union and employers warranted
federal intervention. "The way these guys have negotiated, they make
demands and when they don't get what they want, they engage in
slowdowns," the Labor Department official said of the dockworkers.
"This time, before the normal historic pattern was allowed to unfold,
we went in to assess the situation.... It would be irresponsible to
wait for the meltdown."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union say the
government's involvement has blunted their bargaining strength and
actually prolonged negotiations, which are in their third month. They
also view it as part of a pattern intended to weaken unions.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the union's ability to disrupt national commerce
has given it unusual clout at the bargaining table. It has parlayed
that power into some of the best wages and benefits in blue-collar
America. Members working the docks earned on average $80,000 to
$158,000 last year, including premiums and overtime. They also have
fully paid medical benefits and generous pension contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Ports from San Diego to Seattle move about $300 billion worth of
goods a year, accounting for about 7% of the nation's gross domestic
product and supporting 1.4 million U.S. jobs, federal officials
estimate.</TE>
<TE>   A coast-wide strike could cost the national economy as much as $1
billion a day, according to a study by UC Berkeley planning professor
Stephen S. Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   A contract covering 10,500 dockworkers was due to expire July 1
but has been extended by both parties since then. Negotiations,
suspended by the union last month, are set to resume Aug. 13.
Conflicts center on the introduction of labor-saving technology and
the outsourcing of union jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The union has not threatened a strike, but last month officials
made it easier for its negotiating committee to call one. There has
not been a port strike since 1971.</TE>
<TE>   According to a member of the union's negotiating team, the
administration threatened to force members to work if a strike were
called by invoking the Taft-Hartley Act. Other options mentioned
included running the ports with U.S. Navy personnel, moving to break
up the union's coast-wide bargaining unit or backing legislation that
would restrict the union's ability to call a strike.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some pretty harsh statements," said Bob McEllrath, a
vice president of the ILWU. "I've negotiated these contracts for the
West Coast since '93, and I've never seen this before."</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department official confirmed that the options were
mentioned but said it was in response to union questions and in the
context of a job action occurring during wartime.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been very candid," the official said. "We have told them
if they act in a manner that is disruptive, we will use any means
necessary to make sure our troops in the field get what they need."</TE>
<TE>   The implication angered union officials, who said they never have
held up military shipments.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department official said the administration is neutral
on the contract and has applied equal pressure to the shipping lines
to avoid antagonizing or locking out union members.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Miniace, president of the Pacific Maritime Assn., an employer
group, said the administration pushed him to sweeten medical benefits
in his latest contract offer.</TE>
<TE>   "They ought to sit in my seat if they think they're feeling
pressure," he said of the union.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said the administration had
made no contingency plans but is monitoring the negotiations and is
in close contact with both parties. "We expect the parties to resolve
their differences and wouldn't speculate on what would happen if they
fail to do so," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Several anti-strike options cited by administration officials
would take months or years to implement and would require the support
of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   In the most likely response, President Bush would declare a
national emergency and invoke the Taft-Hartley Act. Taft-Hartley was
last used by President Jimmy Carter.</TE>
<TE>   An AFL-CIO official said Taft-Hartley allows Congress to impose a
contract settlement eventually, but the provision has never been
used.</TE>
<TE>   A long-term strategy would be to break up the coast-wide
bargaining unit into bargaining by individual ports. That would allow
shippers to stagger contract expiration dates, eliminating the threat
of a coast-wide action, and thus would allow cargo to be diverted to
neighboring ports in the event of a strike. The Labor official said
the employers group or any member of Congress could ask for a
reconsideration of the bargaining unit, saying that it now has a
monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   The use of Navy personnel to operate port equipment such as cranes
would be a severe move that the official said would be contemplated
only in time of war.</TE>
<TE>   Most troubling to organized labor is the option that would move
the Longshore union to the jurisdiction of the national Railway Labor
Act, which now governs union activity in rail transport and airlines.
The act gives courts and the administration far more power to prevent
strikes and impose contract settlements than does the National Labor
Relations Act, which governs most private sector labor negotiations.
That change would require legislation.</TE>
<TE>   ILWU officials said that merely by raising the options, the
administration has tilted the negotiations in the employers' favor.
"What power does a union have other than withdrawing its labor?"
asked ILWU spokesman Steve Stallone. "These have been recognized as
legitimate worker rights since 1934, and they are still the law of
the land."</TE>
<TE>   Union officials complained that they have not been given equal
access to the administration. For example, an internal memo from an
employers association shows that the White House group met with
representatives of shipping lines and major retailers during its
formation, on June 4. At the time, officials solicited ideas for
"concrete steps the administration might take to back up strong
statements" it might make to the union. Employers were given a direct
phone line to senior White House economics advisor Carlos Bonilla.</TE>
<TE>   Stallone said the union learned of the White House group two weeks
later, through a bulletin issued by the employers. At the union's
request, U.S. Sens. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and others asked the Bush
administration to withdraw. "We strongly believe that the parties
should be left to resolve their differences through good-faith
bargaining," they wrote in a June 28 letter.</TE>
<TE>   The shipping lines and dockworkers began negotiating in May but
still appear to be far from an agreement. The shippers have offered a
17% wage hike over five years, but the real fight is over
jurisdictional questions.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, for example, the union offered to accept new
technologies that it said would boost productivity and lead to a 30%
reduction in highly paid marine clerk jobs. Marine clerks document
the movement of goods in and out of the ports, checking trucks at
terminal gates and containers moving on and off ships.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, the union asked that only union clerks be used for vessel
planning, the configuration of thousands of containers on a given
ship. That planning is now done by computer, often at remote
locations by nonunion workers.</TE>
<TE>   The shippers rejected that demand, saying those jobs do not belong
in the union and that including them actually would increase the
union's ranks. It also would not agree to bring under the union all
jobs created by new technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Observers in the labor movement as well as the administration said
a long history of distrust on both sides has hampered progress. And
indeed, the shippers and the union have general complaints about each
other.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which primarily represents
foreign-owned shipping companies, says the union has never had to
bargain because it has traditionally used the threat of a strike to
get whatever it wants.</TE>
<TE>   The ILWU, on the other hand, says the employers group is not
negotiating seriously in this round because it is counting on federal
intervention if a strike is called.</TE>
<TE>   National labor leaders, including the AFL-CIO, are watching the
ILWU talks closely as a bellwether for future negotiations in which
the White House also might intervene.</TE>

<LD>Uncle Milton's Ant Farms are sold with the habitat, sand and
instructions, but no ants. To populate an ant farm, customers must go
through the following steps:</LD>
<LD>   Send the order form included in the kit to receive the live ants
by mail. A postage and handling fee is required.</LD>
<LD>   When the ants arrive, they should be refrigerated for 15 minutes.
This makes them less active, facilitating the transfer of the ants
from the shipping tube to the ant farm.</LD>
<TE>   The worker ants (no queens are included) have a two- to
three-month lifespan. Additional ants can be ordered.</TE>

<HD>Ant Farm Creator's Lowly Workers Still Pull Their Weight in
a High-Tech World</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Milton Levine took the pledge years ago: "I will not kill an ant," he
says reverently. "They put my three kids through college."</LD>
<LD>   At a time when scientists were splitting atoms and building
rockets, Levine harnessed the power of the harvester ant; and with
his brains and their brawn, he built an empire based on sand and
plastic.</LD>
<LD>   His Uncle Milton Ant Farm rocked the novelty world when it was
launched in 1956, and since then more than 20 million units have
sold. "I expected it to last two seasons like most toys do," said
Levine. "But the ant farm today is as stable as the Barbie Doll."</LD>
<TE>   The resolutely low-tech toy has held its own in a high-tech world
of slick computer games and short attention spans, with an average of
30,000 ant farms--and 900,000 ants--sold every month.</TE>
<TE>   "That's pretty solid," said Sean McGowan, analyst for PlayDate, a
marketing firm that tracks toy and game sales for retailers
nationwide. "If Milton Bradley has a game that sells 100,000 units a
year, that's considered a good seller. If it sells a million, that's
considered great."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the ant farm thrives because of nostalgic parents who
owned them as kids or because they're a "primitive society you can
keep in your room," McGowan says, "Uncle Milton is the kind of
success story that makes people go out and invent things."</TE>
<TE>   Levine's inspiration came at a Fourth of July picnic in Studio
City, in a moment that would lead a hawker of cheap novelties to
become a millionaire toy mogul.</TE>
<TE>   There in the yard, ants were building small towers, lugging cookie
crumbs 20 times their size and rapping each other's heads to pass on
messages. There were undertaker ants stashing the bodies of dead
co-workers, and ants forming bridges so others could cross cracks in
the earth.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a kid, I used to go to my uncle's farm and put ants in
a jar and watch them cavort," recalled Levine, 88, of Culver City.
"Then we saw a bunch of ants in the corner of the house in Studio
City and I said we should make an antarium."</TE>
<TE>   An antarium? He reconsidered, calling it an ant farm instead.</TE>
<TE>   A son of Russian immigrants, Levine grew up in Pittsburgh, where
his father ran a chain of dry-cleaning stores, charging 24 cents to
wash, press and fold an item of clothing. It was a business lesson
Milton would later perfect: giving customers a lot for little money.</TE>
<TE>   Levine was managing a furniture store when World War II broke out.
He was drafted into the Army and served in England, France and
Germany. After the war, Levine read a newsletter that said the path
to riches lay in bobby pins or plastic toys, both in short supply.</TE>
<TE>   He and his brother-in-law went into business. They discovered a
Pennsylvania company that made the prizes for Cracker Jack boxes and
began buying them wholesale and selling them by mail.</TE>
<TE>   For a dollar, a kid could get 100 plastic soldiers, circus
animals, cowboys or Indians. The toys, dime-thin and undeniably
cheap, came inside paper "footlockers," tents and corrals.</TE>
<TE>   "We got so many orders, you wouldn't believe it," said Levine, a
wiry man with twinkling eyes and a high-pitched cackle. "I'd go to
the bank with 1,000 one-dollar bills!"</TE>
<TE>   After a few years, he stuffed a suitcase with money and drove his
family to Los Angeles, where he sold sprinklers, toy trains and
children's records. There were also potato-firing "spud guns" and
dwarf trees, which he now admits would take "about 100 years to
grow."</TE>
<TE>   His "shrunken heads" were a huge hit. Greenie beanies--hats that
grew real grass on top--bombed.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that item would sell 800 million copies," he said,
still baffled by its failure. "They were like one of those Chia pets.
I called the Beatles' manager to see if they would wear them." (They
said no.)</TE>
<TE>   His miniature sea horse corral also tanked when the animals
arrived belly-up in the homes of children nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   He tried his luck with balloons, writing a book on how to twist
them into animal shapes. And he penned the forward to a book called
"How to Turn Junk Into Fun and Profit."</TE>
<TE>   With the ant farm, he hit pay dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the ants, the first models had some bugs in the system.
Toxic glue vapors killed some ants; others climbed out. Modifications
were made. Red harvester ants, Pogonomyrmex californicus, were
obtained in the Mojave Desert by a collector who was paid a penny per
ant.</TE>
<TE>   While the city ants Levine had been using knocked off at dusk and
lazed around till morning, the new desert ants toiled night and day.
And the harvesters' slippery feet meant they couldn't crawl out.</TE>
<TE>   Orders poured in. Levine appeared on "The Merv Griffin Show." He
made an "executive" ant farm of mahogany and glass for Dick Clark.</TE>
<TE>   Money flooded in. Levine bought out his partner for $150,000 and
moved his family from the Fairfax District to upscale Ladera Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Levine, who never attended college, gave lectures, wrote chatty
books about ants and made appearances on "The Shari Lewis Show." "I
spoke to Lamb Chop for a half an hour about ants," he said. "I felt
like an idiot."</TE>
<TE>   He quickly became known as the "Ant Guy." To ward off any "Ant
Milton" jokes, he dubbed himself "Uncle Milton."</TE>
<TE>   His son Steven, then about 10, was planted in the audiences of the
"Bozo the Clown" show and other children's shows. The hosts would
spot him in the middle row holding an ant farm and invite him to
stand up and talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I would usually flub my lines, but it gave us a lot of exposure,"
recalled Steven, now 49 and running the family business in Westlake
Village.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, the elder Levine wrote "Ant Facts and Fantasies," in
which he discussed the politics of the colonies. "This writer is of
the opinion that ants are truly Socialist," he wrote. "After all,
their life is truly a communal one."</TE>
<TE>   The multimillion-dollar company Levine founded now has a product
line that features butterflies, frogs and dozens of new science toys.
Its ants are still gathered from secret locations in the California
and Utah deserts, with collectors still paid a little more than a
penny per ant. The sand has been replaced with volcanic soil, lighter
and easier to tunnel through, and formulas are being developed to
extend an ant's two- or three-month captive lifespan. Once $1.98, the
ant farms now cost $10.99.</TE>
<TE>   The genial hucksterism of the elder Levine has given way to
corporate marketing strategies and talk of product placement and
demographics.</TE>
<TE>   "We started out as a novelty, but over the years went into science
and nature. We are now in the 'edu-tainment' business," said Frank
Adler, vice president for sales and worldwide marketing for Uncle
Milton Industries, which employs about 30 people and has its own
research and development department. "A good toy must have the 'wow'
factor. It's not just shipping live animals, it's putting them in the
right context."</TE>
<TE>   Spinoffs include the Ant Farm Village, with an ant-sized town
square, and "Xtreme Ants," featuring "antrageous skate loop" and a
tiny rock-climbing wall. Talks are underway with Louisiana turtle
farmers to bring back tiny green turtles taken off the market years
ago because some carried salmonella.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, selling animals as toys makes some folks antsy.</TE>
<TE>   "Ants are sentient beings, like we are, and have a right to life
like we do, and they shouldn't be shown the level of disrespect the
producers of ant farms show them," said Stephanie Boyles, a wildlife
biologist with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. "We can
learn about ants without having an ant farm. Kids end up getting
tired of them and they perish."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but that hasn't hurt demand, which peaks annually around
Christmas with about 100,000 orders a month.</TE>
<TE>   Ants arrive every Monday, packed 30 to a tube. The tubes are
placed in envelopes with booklets, water droppers and food, and sent
to customers who have already bought the farm.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a small business and everyone works together," said Steven
Levine, watching assembly line workers inspect ants and fill orders.
"They do what it takes to get the job done, just like the ants."</TE>
<TE>   Customer letters adorn the offices. A girl writes that she won a
school science competition with her ant farm. Another pleads, "Please
send me some more, as my ants have all passed."</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Milton calls "two or three times a day" just to check on
things, and occasionally pops in. "I go up there and raise hell," he
cracked. "I say this thing or that thing won't sell. Everything I
hate sells like crazy."</TE>
<TE>   And he still quotes Solomon, who said, "Go to the ant, thou
sluggard; consider her ways and be wise."</TE>
<TE>   Levine has considered her ways.</TE>
<TE>   "Perseverance is the secret of success, and procrastination is the
secret of failure," he said. "Ants work day and night, they look out
for the common good and never procrastinate. ... Humanity can learn a
lot from the ant."</TE>

<HD>District Offers Teachers Shelter From Housing Costs</HD>
<DH>Schools: Officials in pricey Silicon Valley hope their
subsidized apartments will attract and retain educators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA CLARA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>If you build a low-rent but upscale enclave for teachers, they will
come. Maybe they'll even stay.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's what the Santa Clara Unified School District
superintendent, Paul Perotti, believes. Desperate to attract and
retain teachers, the school leader has pinned his hopes, along with
$7 million, on that very idea.</LD>
<LD>   In April, the school district, in a Silicon Valley area where
housing costs have soared, became the first in the nation to open a
rent-subsidized apartment complex built strictly for public school
educators.</LD>
<TE>   In the middle of a sleepy neighborhood of one-story homes and
lackluster 1970s apartment buildings, the 40-unit, pastel yellow,
two-story complex--complete with two imported palm trees and a
recreation center with a big-screen television--sticks out like a new
teacher driving a Mercedes-Benz.</TE>
<TE>   Some teachers, Perotti joked, might even be able to afford
Mercedes if they live on the 2-acre site called Casa del Maestro,
where the rent is $650 for a one-bedroom and $1,090 for a
two-bedroom--half the rate for rundown apartments in the area. But
the goal for the 800-teacher district, Perotti said, is for educators
to save money, buy homes and stay in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Measured against its median income, Santa Clara County has the
least affordable housing market in the state, according to a recent
survey by the California Assn. of Realtors. The median price of a
home there is $575,000, more than double the figure for Los Angeles
County, real estate agents say.</TE>
<TE>   New teachers in Santa Clara generally earn $45,000 to $50,000.
That mismatch means that some teachers and civil servants must split
rental costs with friends or move an hour or more away from work,
where they can afford a house.</TE>
<TE>   So it was no surprise that nearly 100 teachers entered a lottery
for the 40 apartments. The winners are allowed to stay for as long as
five years.</TE>
<TE>   For $1,090 a month, teacher Jennifer Spackman, 25, and her
companion, Jamie Steinson, 28, rent a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment
with a patio wide enough for a table, four chairs, potted plants and
a large barbecue grill.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an excellent opportunity to save money" for a house,
Steinson said. He and Spackman used to pay $1,500 a month for a
one-bedroom apartment three blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   Universities long have offered subsidized housing to faculty
members. An increasing number of kindergarten-through-12th-grade
school districts are now doing the same thing to counter a nationwide
teacher shortage. Some have teamed up with apartment companies to
offer rent discounts; others have created mortgage assistance
programs.</TE>
<TE>   But, according to the American Federation of Teachers, the Santa
Clara project is the first built for teachers only.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost of living is out of control, basically, for all school
districts," Perotti said. Teachers "were just walking out of the door
and walking into jobs with stock options."</TE>
<TE>   With about half of all new teachers leaving for other districts or
professions within their first four years, the 16,000-student system
has had to hire an average of 140 teachers annually.</TE>
<TE>   Perotti has attracted national attention and said he has fielded a
"mind-boggling" number of phone calls from districts as far away as
Alaska and Massachusetts that are considering the Santa Clara housing
plan. Among those that have considered such projects are districts in
San Francisco, San Jose and Bellevue, Wash., although San Francisco
recently put its plans on hold. Neighbors of a proposed 43-unit
project in that city's Sunset District objected to the idea of
subsidized housing in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The opening of Santa Clara's Casa del Maestro had its glitches.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Schlink, 27, worried at first that living among co-workers
would be like being trapped in a raucous college sorority.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been a couple of parties, but it's pretty normal
living," she said. Most people keep to themselves, she said.</TE>
<TE>   More troubling have been construction problems. In June, when
Schlink moved in, the washer, the dryer and part of the stove didn't
work. The air-conditioning system leaked and some electrical outlets
had never been connected. Neighbors' pipes have exploded, and one
resident could get only hot water in the toilet. Most repairs have
been completed.</TE>
<TE>   Schlink, who is paid $45,000 a year, said she used to pay $1,000 a
month for a one-bedroom apartment in downtown San Jose. Now she pays
$650 a month and is chipping away at school loans.</TE>
<TE>   "For all the problems I have had with this apartment, even though
they've been quite irritating, it's worth it," Schlink said. "If
other districts want to do this, I think it's a really good idea."</TE>
<TE>   But some educators say such programs are only Band-Aid solutions
to the real issue, which they say is low teachers salaries.</TE>
<TE>   "These kind of gimmicks that school districts are toying with to
provide some sort of housing for a qualified teaching force is simply
not going to work," said Wayne Johnson, president of the California
Teachers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone wants to live with co-workers in subsidized housing,
he said. "Today, people who graduate from college--the best and the
brightest--are not willing to go into a profession and stay there for
years, if it will not provide them a middle-class lifestyle," Johnson
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the 55 teachers in Santa Clara's Casa del Maestro don't seem
to be sacrificing their quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Kevin Keegan, 26, had trouble finding a permanent
residence he could afford, and even slept for a while on a friend's
couch. He said he had planned to cope for one or two more years, then
to leave the district.</TE>
<TE>   But then, in the lottery, he won a one-bedroom apartment, complete
with a garage, washer and dryer, patio and full kitchen, for $650 a
month. His initial discomfort about having fellow teachers as
neighbors faded as he made good friends in the building. Now, Keegan
said, he may stay in Santa Clara forever.</TE>
<TE>   He and all other Santa Clara teachers receive another benefit:
Under a program sponsored by Intel Corp. and Linear Technologies
Inc., a teacher may receive as much as $30,000 toward a house down
payment that would have to be repaid in five years.</TE>
<TE>   The school district began planning Casa del Maestro in 1999, and
hired contractors to build it on district-owned land where a school
had closed and been demolished. To finance the complex, the district
sold $7 million in bonds, which it will pay back over 30 years with
tenants' rent. The rents are fixed by the apartments' size, not by
teachers' income.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got land, and you have the same problem, it can work
anywhere," Perotti said.</TE>
<TE>   Others have turned to simpler solutions. The Palm Beach County
School District in Florida teamed up with apartment companies to
offer rent discounts or to waive security deposits for teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District offers home-buying
programs in conjunction with the Los Angeles Housing Department. The
program, called Extra Credit Homes for Teachers, offers a 6.5% fixed
interest rate on 30-year loans. It also offers $7,500 down payments
and closing-cost assistance in the form of loans forgiven over five
years. The home must be purchased in the city of Los Angeles by a
credentialed teacher who agrees to work at a low-performing school
for five years.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the district introduced $2,000 relocation grants for
out-of-state credentialed teachers who agree to teach in certain
areas and $1,000 grants for some credentialed teachers who agree to
teach in low-performing schools.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the federal government began the Teacher Next Door
program, modeled after the Officer Next Door program. The programs
allow police officers and teachers across the country to buy homes
foreclosed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in
economically depressed areas at half the market rate.</TE>
<TE>   Under the program, HUD will reduce the down payment to just $100
if a teacher purchases the house with an FHA-insured mortgage. The
teacher must live in the home for at least three years, and it must
be in the school district where the teacher is employed.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Weiner, a human resources specialist for Los Angeles
Unified who works in teacher recruitment, said district-run housing
sounds nice in concept but might not work in a district desperate to
find land for schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Districts use their funds for the education of children," he
said. "I don't think an educational institution would want to provide
funds for building homes for teachers when we have so many problems
in our education system here."</TE>

<HD>Women's Advocates Assail Ruling Blocking Abortion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Abortion rights advocates are urging courts to immediately overturn a
judge's unusual decision to temporarily bar a woman from ending her
pregnancy.</LD>
<LD>   The order came in a lawsuit filed by a man who is seeking to force
former girlfriend Tanya Meyers to carry her pregnancy to term. John
Stachokus says he is willing to take full or partial custody of the
child and claims in his suit that Meyers is being pressured by her
mother to have the procedure.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers representing Meyers called the order "a miscarriage of
justice," while abortion opponents and fathers' rights groups praised
it, saying men should have a say in the outcome of a pregnancy they
helped create.</LD>
<TE>   Luzerne County Common Pleas Judge Michael Conahan issued the
temporary injunction Wednesday. He did not say when he would issue a
final ruling but asked both sides to submit briefs by today.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Meyers, 23, who is 10 weeks' pregnant, has been
forbidden from having an abortion.</TE>
<TE>   "There is truly no legal basis for the injunction to be in effect;
it's a miscarriage of justice, an abuse of the legal system and an
absolute disgrace," said Susan Fritchey, an attorney for the Women's
Law Project and co-counsel for Meyers.</TE>
<TE>   Fritchey and other women's advocates said the judge's decision
runs counter to legal precedents establishing that the decision
whether to have an abortion is the woman's choice alone.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers' lawyers filed an emergency appeal Thursday in state
Superior Court in Harrisburg seeking to lift the injunction. That
court instead asked Stachokus' attorney to submit additional legal
papers by Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers' lawyers filed a similar petition with the state Supreme
Court, which denied the appeal but reserved the right to revisit the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Antiabortion and fathers' rights groups defended the judge's
action.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about fathers negatively so often, about how they don't
want to be responsible for their children, and this guy is doing
everything he can to be sure his unborn child isn't aborted," said
Dianna Thompson, executive director of the American Coalition for
Fathers and Children.</TE>
<TE>   Stachokus' attorney, John P. Williamson, said Meyers, who has a
2-year-old child, had been coerced into deciding on an abortion by
her mother.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Meyers nor Stachokus returned calls seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>'Mass Exodus' of Agents Leaves INS Scrambling</HD>
<DH>Border: Low pay and job dissatisfaction drive exit. Losses
'detrimental' to security, ex-official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Immigration and Naturalization Service, whose mission of
safeguarding U.S. borders became a household concern after Sept. 11,
has been shaken by an unprecedented exodus of Border Patrol agents
and immigration inspectors this year.</LD>
<LD>   Lured by a combination of better pay and more satisfying jobs,
about 2,000 Border Patrol officers and immigration inspectors--the
men and women whose tasks include catching terrorists and other
criminals--have left the INS since Oct. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Ironically, many have moved over to the Transportation Security
Administration, the new federal office responsible for ensuring the
safety of the airways. There are 15,000 Border Patrol officers and
immigration inspectors, about 1,500 fewer than the agency is
authorized to employ.</LD>
<TE>   Within the INS, the Border Patrol, which is responsible for
blocking illegal crossings, is running hard just to stay in place,
much less to meet its ambitious expansion goals. It has hired 1,499
agents this fiscal year, but it lost 1,459 veterans at the same time,
for a net gain of 40. That's just a fraction of the 744 additional
agents that the Border Patrol is racing to hire before the fiscal
year ends Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Observers fear that even if the INS can ultimately expand its work
force as planned, the departure of seasoned veterans will take a toll
in experience within the ranks of critical border security jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's detrimental to the border security effort," said Bill King,
a retired Border Patrol sector chief and onetime high-level INS
official in California, "extremely detrimental."</TE>
<TE>   INS Commissioner James Ziglar and other officials, conscious of
the talent drain, helped persuade Congress to approve pay hikes for
Border Patrol agents and immigration inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   INS employees have long complained that their pay, particularly in
law enforcement positions, lags behind that of similar government
jobs and even some urban police departments. A recruit at the INS
might start at $30,000 to $35,000 a year, about $10,000 less than the
same person might earn at the Transportation Security Administration.
But the scale of this year's stampede out the door is something new.
The turnover rate for Border Patrol jobs could be as high as 23% for
the fiscal year, according to INS projections, more than double the
previous fiscal year's 10%.</TE>
<TE>   The turnover rate for immigration inspectors, who personally
examine foreign travelers entering the United States, could be as
high as 16%, also up from 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't show any sign of slowing down," said T.J. Bonner,
president of the National Border Patrol Council, an employees union,
and a veteran Border Patrol agent in San Diego. "I think it's pretty
alarming."</TE>
<TE>   Typically, people hold on to jobs with the federal government
longer than in the private sector. Although there may be great
variation by type of job, about 6% of federal employees left in 2000,
according to a survey by the American Management Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the effect of such turnover on government efforts to
bolster border security after Sept. 11, Bonner replied: "It certainly
hampers that goal. You simply cannot afford to run a law enforcement
agency like this."</TE>
<TE>   At the rank-and-file level, particularly in the Border Patrol,
salary is only one of the factors propelling agents out the door.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally know agents dropping out of the Border Patrol
without even another job lined up," said Jeff Hampton, a Border
Patrol agent in the remote ranching country south of El Paso. "That's
how dissatisfied they are."</TE>
<TE>   "You talk about a mass exodus from the Border Patrol and you're
talking about low job satisfaction, low pay and the inability to
transfer to a more desirable location," added Hampton, who is looking
for another law enforcement job, possibly within the federal
government.</TE>
<TE>   INS employees face a particular set of uncertainties, not the
least of them being whether their agency will continue to exist.
Under a bill that passed the House last month, the INS' law
enforcement arm would be moved into the proposed Department of
Homeland Security, while routine immigrant services would remain
inside the Justice Department. Competing proposals would shift all
the operations to the new department.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the INS' public image as an agency most noted for
blunders that range from losing people's files to losing track of
terrorists. Even before the debate over the Department of Homeland
Security, the Bush administration had made it clear that the INS was
in line for a major shake-up.</TE>
<TE>   It was late last year that INS personnel officials began to see
complaints translate into a jump in resignations.</TE>
<TE>   "In January, we were hoping it was a one-time thing," said Sid
Waldstreicher, INS program manager for human resources. "By March, we
knew it wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Personnel officials soon discovered a major culprit: Sky marshal
jobs with the transportation security agency were luring many away,
often for pay hikes of several thousand dollars or even more. Many
federal law enforcement agencies have lost employees to the new
agency, which is adding 60,000 jobs to the federal payroll, although
none at the magnitude faced by the INS.</TE>
<TE>   "The transportation security agency is getting some of the best
and brightest employees in the federal government, and we're trying
our hardest to backfill these positions," Waldstreicher said in an
interview. "It may not happen this year. And if it doesn't happen
this year, we'll try to recruit and fill these positions next year."</TE>
<TE>   To ease the money frustrations, Congress has agreed to upgrade
Border Patrol and immigration inspector jobs. It could mean pay
raises in the range of $5,000 for many employees.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a co-sponsor of the pay-hike
legislation, said: "For our system of homeland defense to work, it is
critical that we have a cadre of well-trained, well-paid individuals
working at the border."</TE>
<TE>   Yet others contend that money, although important, is not the
cure-all for INS turnover. They say that the INS should do more to
make its careers rewarding, and that employees may feel more
optimistic if the agency's performance--and image--improved.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, Border Patrol agents are often under orders to stay
in one spot all day, in an official strategy meant to deter illegal
border crossings. Agents complain of painfully monotonous work shifts
and a self-defeating lack of mobility.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys go to work and they sit there 10 hours a day in a
truck, staring at a fence," said Rich Pierce, vice president of the
National Border Patrol Council and a Border Patrol agent in Tampa,
Fla. "That's all they're doing. It's not the exciting law enforcement
job they hoped for."</TE>
<TE>   The publicity over INS gaffes has also affected enthusiasm for
working there, he added. "Every time they open a paper and they see,
'INS bumbles again,' it's terrible," Pierce said. "Morale is down."</TE>
<TE>   While the 31,000-employee INS has been hiring at top speed, it has
made only modest progress toward its goal of increasing the Border
Patrol force by 744 this year.</TE>
<TE>   In a similar pattern, the INS this year has hired 842 immigration
inspectors, but it has lost 540 experienced inspectors. The
administration wants to increase the current inspector corps of 5,000
by an additional 1,000 next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're losing people in the three- to five-year range, just when
we get them to a level where we're confident we can get them to go
out and do the job they've been trained to do," Bonner said. "It's a
cause for great concern."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, thousands of job applications are pending, and
the agency plans to run radio, magazine and billboard ads to attract
still more. It is even offering hiring bonuses of up to $5,000 for
certain of its greatest needs, including immigration inspectors at
San Francisco International Airport and Washington Dulles
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   For all the turmoil surrounding the INS, officials maintain that
the agency's mission translates into rewarding careers and that
today's punishing rates of attrition will ultimately ease.</TE>
<TE>   "A career at INS can offer tremendous opportunities due to the
[agency's] growth and change that will occur over the next several
years," said Kimberly Weissman, an INS spokeswoman. "The INS serves
as an attractive career choice for those looking for a real challenge
protecting the diversity and security of the country."</TE>

<LD>Public opinion concerning the media has fallen to pre-Sept. 11
levels, according to the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press. Coinciding with the decline are a rise in suspicion about
corporate America and a return of partisan politics.</LD>
<LD>   "When the news becomes more contentious, the public becomes more
critical of the messenger," center director Andrew Kohut said.</LD>
<LD>   Almost 75% of poll respondents in November said that news
organizations are highly professional. That percentage since has
dropped by about half. In November, fewer than half those polled said
news organizations are biased; 6 in 10 feel that way now.</LD>

<HD>Hawaii Church Sees Courthouse as the Way to God's House</HD>
<DH>Zoning: After Hale O Kaula's building permit was denied,
Justice Dept. joined the group's fight to force the county to allow
multiuse facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KULA, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>The congregation of the Hale O Kaula church dreamed of bringing the
Scriptures to life, of building an agricultural ministry on these
sunny slopes and teaching their children to grow food nourished by
prayer.</LD>
<LD>   But when they applied to build a meeting hall on their land in
this small rural community on Maui, the neighbors thought otherwise.
One put up a sign at the top of the road, which appeared to be
directed at the church. "Are you sure the road you're on leads to my
house? God," it said.</LD>
<LD>   "Jesus loves you," said another sign, placed prominently on a
mailbox. "Everyone else knows you're an [expletive]."</LD>
<TE>   The Maui County planning commission turned down the church's
permit request, citing state zoning laws, which prohibit churches on
agricultural land except by special permit. But church members didn't
believe it was the building that the county and neighbors objected
to. It was, they believed, the church itself the neighbors didn't
like.</TE>
<TE>   That was how this stunning greenbelt in the South Pacific became a
battleground over religious freedom. Last month, attorneys for the
U.S. Justice Department joined a Washington-based public interest law
firm, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, to help Hale O Kaula
defend a 2-year-old federal law that provides protection for churches
from prohibitive regulation under local zoning laws.</TE>
<TE>   Hale O Kaula's lawsuit against the county is one of a growing
number across the country challenging how far counties can use zoning
laws to prevent the construction of increasingly large, multiuse
facilities in residential areas deemed inappropriate by
neighbors--even as churches are being forced out of their traditional
downtown homes because they do not provide sufficient tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   It is an area breaching the usual political divide. The Religious
Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act has rallied conservative
church groups on the right and civil libertarians on the left; its
sponsors included Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Orrin G.
Hatch (R-Utah), who normally would have trouble putting their names
on the same grocery list.</TE>
<TE>   The law says local governments cannot "substantially burden" the
free exercise of religion through zoning laws unless they demonstrate
that the zoning is the least restrictive means of advancing a
"compelling government interest."</TE>
<TE>   Local government officials say the law often doesn't take into
account the myriad conceptions of religious facilities these days.
Gone, they say, are the days when a church was a sanctuary used for
Sunday services and Wednesday night prayer meetings. Increasingly,
churches also are day-care centers, homeless shelters and health
centers--or, in the case of the Hale O Kaula facility, a working farm
and meeting center.</TE>
<TE>   At least three cases involving the religious land-use law are
pending in California, including one in Los Angeles, where neighbors
have challenged the Missionaries of Charity Brothers' homeless
mission in a historic mansion near downtown, and in Cypress, where
the city is trying to take over 18 acres of prime redevelopment
property from a church and sell it to Costco. A hearing in that case
is set for today in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   The 60 members of Hale O Kaula, or House of Prophets, are
followers of the Joseph Ministry, which requires the church to
"provide sustenance from a life-enriched environment that preserves
God's people alive and healthy."</TE>
<TE>   In their view, that mission includes food production, storage and
distribution, along with organic farming practices to assure a
healthful environment.</TE>
<TE>   "In hard times or natural disasters, we want to make sure that we
can get by and feed the people, but the real thing is our connection
to the land. We're stewards of the land, and while working the land,
we teach our kids spiritual principles as well," said David Jenkens,
a housing designer who is pastor of the church.</TE>
<TE>   The congregation has been meeting in a regular church in the town
of Haiku, several miles away, but outgrew it and bought about six
acres of farmland on a residential road in the town of Kula, a rural
community of large homes and small family farms on the verdant slopes
of Maui's largest volcano. The plan was to grow food there, and hold
worship services tied to planting and harvesting rituals.</TE>
<TE>   Their initial application for an 8,500-square-foot facility,
including a sanctuary, fellowship hall, restrooms, kitchen and
offices, was denied, but the church reapplied for a much smaller
expansion of its existing barn in 1999. The planning commission
denied it, citing zoning laws that restrict the land to agricultural
uses and problems with water service that could make it difficult to
fight a fire.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the half a dozen neighbors voiced concern about traffic on
the unpaved private road that leads to the church property, and in
public meetings also raised questions about the Hale O Kaula
congregation, sometimes describing it as a cult.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that we're against the church. I love the idea of using
[agricultural] land to grow things and teach the children how to
farm. But it's a half-mile private road, and they have to pass
everybody else on that road. We don't think that's fair," neighbor
Frank Caravalho Jr. said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many other places that are so much more suited for a
church than this property," added Jon Thuro, another neighbor. "I
told 'em, 'Why do you guys want to be so hidden and away from
everybody? Down a dead-end street? What do you have to hide?' It just
makes you feel strange."</TE>
<TE>   Questions about the nature of their religion, affiliated with the
nondenominational Living Word Fellowship of Churches, are precisely
the kinds of questions churches shouldn't have to answer in zoning
hearings, Becket Fund lawyers say.</TE>
<TE>   The planning department reviewer told the church it was entitled
to farm the property and even hold occasional gatherings there, said
Derek L. Gaubatz, who appeared on behalf of the Becket Fund in a
hearing on the case July 24 in Honolulu. "But he said as soon as they
gather five people to pray before they plant a potato, that's
illegal."</TE>
<TE>   Church lawyers also presented evidence that a large private school
lies on one edge of the property, and plans have been approved for a
major commercial mixed-use development on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   But James Takayesu, corporate counsel for Maui County who is
defending the planning commission against the Hale O Kaula lawsuit,
said neither of those adjacent projects are on agricultural land. He
said the nature of the church was irrelevant to the zoning decision,
which turned mainly on fire safety issues, and noted that the church
could continue to worship at its existing chapel.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought we were pretty tolerant here. It's always been
kind of a hang-loose, whatever-you-want-to-do kind of place," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably sell more crystals here than anywhere else, per
capita."</TE>

<HD>Pa. Miners, Rescuers Honored at Church</HD>
<DH>Service: Colleagues and community are honored for rescuing
those trapped for three days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SOMERSET, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Nine miners who spent more than three days in a flooded coal mine 240
feet underground joined hundreds of people at a church service Sunday
night to give thanks for their rescue a week ago.</LD>
<LD>   Family, friends and neighbors filled Christ Casebeer Lutheran
Church, about 100 yards from where the men were trapped for 77 hours
in a shaft at Quecreek Mine in western Pennsylvania.</LD>
<LD>   Early in the service, a man in a white T-shirt emblazoned with the
word "America" lighted 10 candles placed behind 10 miners' helmets on
a table near the altar.</LD>
<TE>   The candles were lighted in honor of the nine miners who escaped
immediately, thanks to a warning radioed by the trapped men. The 10th
candle was lighted for the person who guided those men to safety.</TE>
<TE>   "These candles represent the vigilance of the nine who escaped and
how they stayed vigilant while the other nine were still
underground," said the Rev. Joseph Beer of Mount Laurel United Church
of Christ.</TE>
<TE>   Rescuers bored through the ceiling where the remaining miners were
trapped at 10:16 p.m. July 27--a feat hailed by some as a miracle.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Davis, assistant manager for the Mine Safety and Health
Administration, was one of the first on the scene and worked at the
command center during the rescue.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent a number of hours of my life here, three or four days; I
wanted to share some of the blessings they received," Davis, 60, said
following the service.</TE>
<TE>   The miners did not speak during the service, attended by religious
leaders from different denominations, but they posed for photos
outside with those in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   The miners were trapped when an abandoned, water-filled mine
flooded the shaft where they worked. During their ordeal, they vowed
to "live or die as a group," tying themselves together.</TE>
<TE>   "It's divine intervention. We needed something like this to
happen," said Lei Hennessy, 41, of Seattle, who was at the service.</TE>

<HD>Teen Accused of Using Lighter on Shoe as Plane Arrived at

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>A 17-year-old Canadian passenger on a US Airways flight from Toronto
has been arrested for allegedly using a lighter on his shoe,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The teen told police he was burning loose material off his tennis
shoes as the plane taxied into Pittsburgh International Airport on
Saturday. The boy's father was seated next to him.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said the teen would not be identified because of his
age. He was cited for disorderly conduct and released into the
custody of his father, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Federal authorities interviewed the boy and his father after a
flight attendant found the boy flicking a butane lighter and took it
away from him, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the boy and his father were connecting in Pittsburgh
on a flight to California, but US Airways asked them to make other
travel arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   In another incident, FBI agents arrested a man early Sunday for
allegedly trying to pass through a security checkpoint at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport with razor blades in his shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The man had set off a metal detector Saturday night and when asked
to remove his shoes at least four razor blades fell out, said airport
spokeswoman Clare Impett.</TE>
<TE>   Impett had no information on the man's identity or which airline
he was planning to board.</TE>

<HD>Drought Takes Color Out of Colorado</HD>
<DH>Nature: In the driest summer in 70 years, a scant
wildflower season means fewer profits for those whose livelihoods
depend on floral fields.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.R. MOEHRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>IDAHO SPRINGS, Colo.</DL>
<LD>The dirt is dry, the grass is dry, the alpine pond that normally
glistens here is a pathetic puddle. But as he pulls off the road and
scans the scene, Bill Bonebrake notices what's not in the picture.</LD>
<LD>   "This would normally just be all flowers," he says, looking at the
field unfurling beneath him. "A sea of color."</LD>
<LD>   Normally. But not much is normal in Colorado, as the worst drought
in 70 years continues to squeeze the Rocky Mountains, wringing the
last drops of moisture from an already arid landscape.</LD>
<TE>   If a lack of water is said to have a ripple effect, then the
ripples of this drought grow wider every day. The first victims were
the most visible: farmers and ranchers. Then it was homeowners in the
path of burning forests. Now the drought can be measured in what
can't be seen: flowers.</TE>
<TE>   After scant winter snow, sparse spring rain and an unusually hot
summer, Colorado's wildflower season has been altered, shortened and
in some places hasn't come at all.</TE>
<TE>   For nature lovers, this means a less colorful summer. For people
who depend on wildflowers--from botanists to beekeepers to
photographers like Bonebrake--it means a less profitable year.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer fields of harebell and columbine will mean fewer pictures
for Bonebrake's line of postcards and greeting cards, which will mean
fewer deposits in his children's college fund. Customers demand new
work each year, he explains. "And I didn't get a lot of new work this
year."</TE>
<TE>   Like the hunters and trappers of old, Bonebrake rises before first
light and heads into the Rocky Mountains to bag his prey. Today he's
after a specific wildflower. One of his manufacturers wants pictures
of asters, purple-leafed flowers with yellow centers, and he aims to
oblige.</TE>
<TE>   Besides filling special orders, however, Bonebrake always has in
mind his main quarry: color. He's obsessed with finding that dazzling
yellow sneezeweed and that dizzying orange paintbrush, set against a
backdrop of green grass and white-capped mountains.</TE>
<TE>   It's the idyllic image of Colorado he seeks--and sells. But this
year, the search feels more like a quixotic quest.</TE>
<TE>   "This is money out of my pocket," Bonebrake says of the drought,
as his truck and the sun creep toward the top of Mt. Evans, a
location that has provided countless pictures during the 10 years
Bonebrake has been in business.</TE>
<TE>   During wildflower season, from June to August, Bonebrake will put
1,500 miles on his truck each week, crisscrossing the state and
region. At 42 years old, he won't hesitate to camp near a clump of
flowers he wants to photograph. He won't think twice about sleeping
in his truck. His goal is 50 new pictures. In a great season, maybe
100.</TE>
<TE>   So far, he has six.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Lorraine, co-owner of JAMIT Publishing, which produces
his works, sees the drought through his demeanor. He can't hide his
disappointment after a day of tramping through brittle fields where
wildflowers once came to his hips, or skirting mud flats scattered
with bleached fish bones, which used to be lakes.</TE>
<TE>   "So?" Lorraine says as he comes through the door at night.</TE>
<TE>   "Dry," he says.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just the money. Wildflowers give him an optic rush.
"Color," he says. "Color is what excites my eyes. It's all about
color."</TE>
<TE>   Such passion for color makes him typical here. Flowers are to
Colorado what swallows are to San Juan Capistrano. Their return not
only attracts droves of tourists but gives natives an annual,
reliable thrill. Many Coloradans know precisely which week the pink
fireweed will be up. They plan hikes and backpacking trips for those
days when the red rose crown will be in bloom.</TE>
<TE>   The names of wildflowers are deliberately beautiful, a kind of
lyric poetry enthusiasts can recite to each other every season. Did
you see any northern bedstraw yesterday? Is the winged buckwheat out?
How are the snow buttercup and yellow monkey flower and fairy trumpet
doing?</TE>
<TE>   None is visible as Bonebrake pushes above the tree line, into the
tundra, his truck growling around sharp curves on Highway 5, the
highest paved road in North America. At more than 14,000 feet above
sea level, where snow doesn't melt until August, if at all,
conditions are ideal for mountain goats, marmots and the
kaleidoscopic meadows envisioned by Hollywood set designers.</TE>
<TE>   "Carpets of flowers as far as the eye can see," Bonebrake says,
remembering the good years.</TE>
<TE>   This year, just carpet remnants.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists who study Colorado wildflowers are also concerned about
the drought.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of very rare plants in Colorado, and we're
worried about them in places where they're already stressed by
humans," says Dave Anderson, a botanist with the Colorado Natural
Heritage Program, which tracks exotic species in the state. "They
might be pushed over the brink and be extirpated."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 500 species of rare plants exist in Colorado, Anderson
says. "About 30 of those species are extremely rare and only known
from less than five occurrences worldwide."</TE>
<TE>   Schmoll's milk vetch, for instance, occurs nowhere else in the
world except Mesa Verde National Park, in southwest Colorado, and it
simply didn't appear this year. "I was supposed to go to the park and
map the area where the plant is located," Anderson says. "But the
park service called and said don't bother."</TE>
<TE>   At the famed wildflower festival in Crested Butte last month,
first-time visitors were excited, as usual, but longtime organizers
could tell this year wasn't normal.</TE>
<TE>   "Very dry," says Lee Renfro, festival director. "You have to
promise yourself that, yes, they're there, and they will come up next
year."</TE>
<TE>   Bonebrake presses higher and higher, until at last he spies
something purple sprouting from a rock. He stops. He gathers his gear
and stalks toward the asters, as if any sudden movements might scare
the flowers off.</TE>
<TE>   A fat marmot watches dubiously as Bonebrake crouches over the
flower and takes aim. The camera's click is nearly lost amid the
howling wind and the cheeping pikas in the rock crevices.</TE>
<TE>   Mission accomplished. It's not a sea, or a carpet, but it's color.
Bonebrake climbs back into his truck. The marmot slides back into its
hole.</TE>
<TE>   You have to stay optimistic, Bonebrake says, rounding another
curve in his truck. Our time on Earth is a blip, and we don't
understand its cycles. You have to focus on the big picture, even
when you don't have any big pictures to sell.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the part of being a photographer people don't see," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "The amount of time and the amount of miles I spend driving,
looking for pictures. If I don't get them, then I just have a nice
walk in the woods. There are worse ways to make a living.</TE>
<TE>   "But I really would prefer coming home with work that blows you
away."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Overfishing of shark prey in the Atlantic Ocean means sharks are
coming closer to shore to find food and may mistake swimmers for a
meal, according to research by U.S. oceanographers. Stocks of a
common shark prey known as menhaden fish are at critically low levels
in the Atlantic, said Richard Condrey, associate professor of
oceanography and coastal studies at Louisiana State University.</LD>
<LD>   "That means sharks are getting more aggressive about finding
alternative food sources and are more likely to come closer to shore,
where they mistake swimmers for prey," Condrey said. While the Gulf
Coast had a large stock of menhaden, with 50% of the adults
reproducing under current fishing conditions, Condrey said the
Atlantic menhaden population has dwindled to a 3% reproduction rate.</LD>

<HD>Brain Chemicals May Calm Bad Memories</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frightening or painful memories may be calmed or even erased by
marijuana-like chemicals produced in the brain, according to a study
of mice chronicled in Thursday's issue of Nature. Mice bred to be
unresponsive to the chemicals, called cannabinoids, couldn't control
their reaction when they heard a reminder linked to pain. Normal mice
eventually stopped flinching at the reminder. The brain naturally
produces cannabinoids in response to pain and fear, which might have
helped the normal mice recover, researchers said.</LD>
<LD>   New treatments for anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress
syndrome might be developed based on the cannabinoids, which are also
the active ingredient in marijuana, said Beat Lutz of the Max Planck
Institute of Psychiatry in Munich, who led the study.</LD>

<LD>Question: How can my electric toothbrush get recharged in its holder
when there is no electrical connection?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: It is charged through a phenomenon known as inductance.
The end of the toothbrush contains a coil of wire and the base
contains a matching coil. When the brush sits in the base, the two
coils are close together, effectively forming a transformer. When an
electric current is passed through the coil in the base, it induces a
similar current in the opposite coil, which recharges the batteries.
The base often has a vertical protuberance that passes into the
center of the brush. This helps hold the brush in place, but it also
contains an iron core that increases the efficiency of the induction
process.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The first six months of the year have been the second-warmest ever,
and average global temperatures in 2002 could be the highest ever
recorded, according to British weather experts. . The British
Meteorological Office said global temperatures were 1.03 degrees
higher than the long-term average of about 59 degrees in the period
from January to June. In the nearly 150 years since recording began,
only in 1998 has the difference been higher, 1.08 degrees, and that
was caused by the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon.</LD>
<LD>   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body that
advises governments on long-term climatic variations, blames global
warming, caused by rising emissions of greenhouse gases that trap
heat in the atmosphere, for the rise in temperatures.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stuttering, which affects about 1% of people after childhood, is
caused by an abnormal structure of the left side of the brain, German
researchers reported in Saturday's edition of the British journal The
Lancet. The study used magnetic resonance imaging to look at 15
stutterers and 15 people with normal speech and found the impediment
results from a disconnection of speech-related areas in the cortex, a
team from the University of Hamburg said.</LD>
<LD>   About 7% of children stutter, with about four boys affected for
every girl, said Christian Buchel, who led the research.</LD>

<LD>Physicist Frank Oppenheimer used to say that artists and scientists
are the official "noticers" of society: people whose business it is
to notice things that other people never learned to see or have
learned to ignore.</LD>
<LD>   I've never known anyone with quite the knack for noticing as San
Francisco artist Bob Miller. Since I've known him, countless things I
used to think quite ordinary have been animated by his imagination.
Once he asked me: How would you suspend 500,000 pounds of water in
the air with no visible means of support?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Build a cloud.</LD>
<TE>   Needless to say, clouds have never looked quite the same to me
since.</TE>
<TE>   Neither has dawn. Before I met Bob, I never thought about the
continual wave of people rising from their beds that sweeps around
the globe as the shadow of night lifts time zone by time zone, much
like the wave that runs through a crowd at a ballgame, except that
the tide of waking people is a wave that never ends.</TE>
<TE>   I think of this wave as a kinetic sculpture that Bob placed
permanently inside my head.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office didn't get this concept at
all. One of Bob's sculptures is an optical illusion in which a
concave object appears to pop out and follow you as you walk by. The
sculpture is made up of an inside corner of a box that appears to
turn into a cube, and so he calls it his "Far Out Corner."</TE>
<TE>   Oppenheimer encouraged him to patent this optical
illusion/sculpture many years ago. They were both amused when the
request was turned down. The reason? The bureaucrats maintained that
he couldn't patent an effect that existed only in someone's mind. As
if there's a piece of art or science that doesn't. The patent office
later relented.</TE>
<TE>   Bob's signature piece is probably his "Sun Painting," which begins
with a beam of plain white light from the sun, refracted through a
rack of prisms, then sliced with thin mirrors into a palette of pure
colors--Bob's "paints."</TE>
<TE>   The late poet Muriel Rukeyser was inspired by this work to write a
poem for Bob, describing the work as "a lashing of color."</TE>
<TE>   "Not color, strands of light. Not light but pure deep color beyond
color."</TE>
<TE>   You have invited us all. Allow the sunlight, dance your dance.</TE>
<TE>   Before I met Bob, I labored, like most people, under the
misconception that the green of the grass, the red of the car outside
my window, the yellow of the neighbor's cat, came from the objects
themselves. But no, they come from the sun: The purple of that Laker
flag is a gift from a star 93 million miles away.</TE>
<TE>   In my mind's eye, Bob "painted" white light in brilliant colors as
surely as Lewis Carroll's playing cards painted the Queen's white
roses red.</TE>
<TE>   He's done the same thing with shadows, which I used to see as
black and white. Now I see a shadow as a "negative" image that
contains as much information as a "positive" image. Bob makes a
spellbinding case for this in a piece of performance art called "Bob
Miller's Light Walk."</TE>
<TE>   Here's a taste. A pinhole camera (in essence, a box with a pinhole
poked in one end) can make an image of any scene, moving or static.
But suppose instead of a hole, you use its complement: not the hole
in the doughnut, but the doughnut "hole" you eat; not a pinhole, but
a pin "speck." The shadow cast by the speck is a complementary image.</TE>
<TE>   Astonishingly, if you dangle a pin speck, you don't just block
light, you can create a perfect negative image of a scene.</TE>
<TE>   During a solar eclipse viewing in the Black Sea, after Bob wowed
astronomers with his light tricks, he did the same for artists that
night sitting in a bar. Using a small piece of cheese suspended on a
hair as a pin speck, he cast colored shadows of some brightly colored
lights. The shadow image appeared not only upside down and reversed,
as you might expect, but also in complementary colors: The red turned
to turquoise, the blue to yellow.</TE>
<TE>   Creating a pin speck image can be tricky, especially in a bar. It
requires just the right lighting and geometry to make its magic work.
But everyone can see it during even a partial solar eclipse.</TE>
<TE>   Even the tips of your fingernails can serve as pin specks that
cast a clear complementary image of the sun--dark crescents
decorating your hands like claws. (All of Bob's works can be seen at
the Exploratorium in San Francisco. You can also see them on the Web
at www.exploratorium.edu.)</TE>
<TE>   To Bob, there's no such thing as uninteresting, diffuse white
light. It's awash with images, bursting with brilliant colors; they
need only to be separated out, like voices in a crowd. Whether we do
it with holes or specks doesn't matter. (Making lifelike portraits
out of holes and specks is one of Bob's specialties.)</TE>
<TE>   Bob often says that the worst disease afflicting humankind is
"hardening of the categories": our futile attempts to cram things
into boxes and keep them there. Boxes like "art" and "science," for
example.</TE>
<TE>   These categories become blinders that prevent us from noticing:
the weight of clouds, the colors of white, the light in shadows, the
opportunities in obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   Bob's "artist's statement" sums it up: "Blobs, spots, specks,
smudges, cracks, defects, mistakes, accidents, exceptions and
irregularities are the windows to other worlds."</TE>

<DH>Biology: When it's time to come up with monikers for
species and genes, sedate scientists let their sharp wit show
through.</DH>

<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists are an amazingly competitive lot. Bestsellers have been
written about the race to decipher the structure of DNA, sequence the
genome and identify a new solar system.</LD>
<LD>   But another, more amusing race is taking place largely out of the
public eye: the scientific effort to find the wittiest names for
subatomic particles, species--and especially genes.</LD>
<LD>   Biologists have been the pacesetters in the competition, coming up
with such unusual names as Abra cadabra for a clam and Heerz tooya
and Heerz lukenatcha for some wasps. But among biologists, the
indisputable champions are the somewhat odd researchers who study
Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as the fruit fly.</LD>
<TE>   Drosophilists have so far identified more than 26,000 fruit fly
genes--in 46,000 variations--and the majority of them have names that
will tickle your funny bone.</TE>
<TE>   Cultural references, science-fiction references, literary
references, Latin puns and a host of other in-jokes festoon the
official archive of Drosophila gene names, found at www.flynome.com.
Despite its esoteric nature, the archive is actually a good evening's
read.</TE>
<TE>   Sophie Rutschmann of the University of Strasbourg, for example,
found a mutated gene that causes adult flies to die within two days
after they are infected with certain bacteria. She named the gene
Kenny, after the "South Park" character who always dies before the
end of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Another group found a pair of genes that cause male and female
flies to lack external genitalia. The gene names: ken and barbie,
after the dolls with the same features. How about a mutant gene that
causes some cells to divide uncontrollably? That gene, of course, is
named tribbles, after the classic "Star Trek" episode "The Trouble
With Tribbles."</TE>
<TE>   "There is a long tradition in Drosophila research that genes get
named in a way that is descriptive and memorable," says Lawrence
Goldstein of UC San Diego. "There are some organisms and systems that
you name systematically, but that doesn't provide a lot of
information about what they are doing or the phenotype [appearance]
of the animal. They are hard to remember."</TE>
<TE>   Inventive names make it much more easy to recall what the gene
does. Besides, he added, "it's fun. Scientists aren't really that
boring."</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein's lab found a family of gene mutants that cause the
movement of materials through the cell to be disrupted. The obvious
names were chosen: roadblock, gridlock, sunday driver. "Sunday driver
is a particularly antique colloquialism," Goldstein said. "A Japanese
scientist asked me about it once. He couldn't figure out what it
means because the concept doesn't exist there."</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein noted that his lab has a blackboard with a list of cute
names waiting for the right gene to be discovered.</TE>
<TE>   "There's also a certain amount of one-upmanship," he noted. "Dave
Susuki [a fly researcher] years ago, wanted to give something a
profane name. He went to Japanese to find the name shibere, which
means messed up. It is abbreviated 'shi,' and it is
temperature-sensitive, so it gets the superscript 'ts.' "</TE>
<TE>   If you ask Seymour Benzer of Caltech why Drosophilists use funny
names, he replies, "Why not? Science should be fun if you can manage
it .... There have always been descriptive names for [fruit fly]
mutants going back to the '20s, so why not make them humorous at the
same time?"</TE>
<TE>   Benzer discovered a mutated fly that was learning-deficient, so he
called the responsible gene dunce. When several similar mutant genes
turned up, they had a problem finding enough similar names. Because
the flies were practically brain-dead, "we decided to name them after
vegetables, names like rutabaga, turnip, cabbage and so on." Others
had brain degeneration, and his group named them after foods whose
appearance they resembled under a microscope: bubble gum, spongecake,
popcorn.</TE>
<TE>   Inventing names "is simply a great tradition," says Tim Tully of
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. "If a gene is discovered
for the first time, your name takes precedence in all other similar
discoveries and homologues in other species. If you are the first
one, that is the name forever. It's romantic and fun."</TE>
<TE>   Tully's first scientific achievement was the development of a
Pavlovian learning task for flies. The Russian psychologist Ivan
Pavlov is famous for having taught dogs to salivate when a bell was
rung, a so-called learned response. "Because it is so simplified,
this response is a building block for all other more complicated
forms of learning," Tully said. "Rats can learn lots more complicated
things than flies, but the elemental change is always caused by the
association of two stimuli."</TE>
<TE>   Tully has so far found 47 gene mutations that affect the learned
response in flies. He wanted to name them after Pavlov's dogs, but
there was a problem. In all of Pavlov's papers, only one dog is
mentioned by name: Bierka, which means "whitey."</TE>
<TE>   Tully went to the Pavlov Institute outside St. Petersburg. Its
director was Pavlov's last graduate student, but he couldn't recall
any of the names. Then Tully "just happened" to go on a private tour
of Pavlov's home, which the curator stated was left as it was the day
Pavlov died.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the tour, I just happened to ask the curator if she
knew about the dogs," Tully said. "She walked to a cabinet and pulled
out a photo album with the pictures and names of all the dogs." Now
Tully's genes are named jurka, jack, marka, joy and so on.</TE>
<TE>   None of the fly scientists seems able to explain why researchers
in other fields don't follow the same naming practices. A few
researchers do, of course. There is a wasp called Verae peculya.
There is also Agra sasquatch, a beetle with big feet. There is even
Myzocallia kahawaluokalani, an aphid whose name reportedly means, in
Hawaiian, "you fish on your side of the lagoon, I'll fish on the
other, and no one will fish in the middle."</TE>
<TE>   But most researchers shy away from such humor, and the worst
offenders seem to be nematologists--biologists who study
nematodes--who give each gene a three-letter code, sometimes followed
by a number, such as unc-1.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't quite seem to latch on to the fun," Tully said.</TE>
<TE>   Drosophilist Jeff Hall of Brandeis University near Boston added:
"You can't dynamite an interesting name out of a nematologist."</TE>
