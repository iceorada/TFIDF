<DH>Comedy* TV funnyman Sid Caesar, 80 on Sunday, isn't much
different than in his heyday, though Mel Brooks is in less danger.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sid Caesar, who turns 80 on Sunday, hasn't lost the touch that
side-split a nation during his reign as early television's king of
comedy.</LD>
<LD>   Not one for the quick-hit zingers typical of that other TV pioneer
Milton Berle, Caesar was always a sketch comedian who could lose his
own persona in a variety of outrageous characters and "languages."</LD>
<LD>   During a recent interview at his sprawling hilltop estate, Caesar
delivered hilarious monologues that sounded alternately like French,
Italian, German and Japanese but actually were pure gibberish.</LD>
<TE>   During his heyday, Caesar--along with co-stars Imogene Coca and
Nanette Fabray, and second bananas Carl Reiner and Howard
Morris--brought a new, more sophisticated kind of comedy to the
American public.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, however, there was a different Caesar--the
madman portrayed in the play "Laughter on the 23rd Floor" by his
onetime writer Neil Simon. Caesar acknowledges that some of his
actions might have seemed over the top.</TE>
<TE>   On a hot day in the writers room, he would strip down to his
shorts. He recalled: "People would come in and say, 'Where's your
pants?' I'd say, 'It's a hot day; I don't want to get them creased.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the famous episode involving another of his writers,
Mel Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   Caesar was performing nine shows a day at the Chicago Theater.
Before the last show, he returned exhausted to his suite at the
Palmer House and was enjoying a hearty meal when Mel complained about
the stifling heat. "I wanna go out," he kept insisting until Sid
angrily said, "You wanna go out?!"</TE>
<TE>   "I opened up the window, and we're on the 18th floor," recounted
Caesar, who in those days lifted weights and was remarkably strong.
"I grabbed him by the seat of his pants and his neck and I held him
outside the window. 'You wanna go out farther?' I asked. My brother
Dave grabbed me and pulled us both back in."</TE>
<TE>   Caesar attributes at least part of his behavior to the pressure of
maintaining high-quality material while turning out 40 shows a year.
He was unable to sleep and began relying on alcohol and sleeping
pills. Years of psychotherapy and the patience of his wife, Florence,
helped him acquire a degree of well-being. Also helpful:
conversations with his alter ego.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, Caesar was in Paris filming "The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu
Manchu," Peter Sellers' final film and a box-office bomb. The job was
supposed to last six weeks, and went on for six months. Caesar was
going nuts. So he began a conversation between himself, Sid, and the
young Sidney.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd talk to myself every morning," he said, "and you can't lie to
yourself, because you know what you feel." When Sid complained about
being stuck on the location, Sidney chastised him for complaining
when he was being paid to stay in Paris. Sidney won out, and Sid
began appreciating the art museums and making friends with locals.</TE>
<TE>   Today's television generation scarcely knows Sid Caesar. Unlike
most TV classics, "Your Show of Shows" (1950-1954) and "Caesar's
Hour" (1954-1957) did not fit the sitcom pattern. And having been
broadcast live, they were preserved as kinescopes, a crude form of
video recording, not the 35-millimeter motion picture film of
sitcoms. Hence they lacked appeal for syndicators.</TE>
<TE>   But now, thanks to digital enhancement, young people can see what
enthralled their parents and grandparents. Blagman Century Media of
Santa Monica has released "The Original Sid Caesar Collection," a
three-tape set of videocassettes with selections from his two TV
series picked by Caesar himself. "They look brand new," he said
proudly.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder the shows were great; they boasted the most talented
writers in show-biz history. They included Simon, Brooks, Reiner,
Larry Gelbart (creator of the TV version of "MASH"), Michael Stuart
("Hello, Dolly," "Bye, Bye Birdie"), Joseph Stein ("Fiddler on the
Roof") and a 20-year-old named Woody Allen.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, it was the shows' smartness that helped bring their
demise.</TE>
<TE>   Demographics played the villain. Television's early growth was
centered in the big cities where the audience appreciated the quality
of a sophisticated Broadway revue. As the Federal Communications
Commission issued licenses across the country, television spread to
the hinterlands. The networks' search for an ever-widening audience
resulted in the dumbing down of programming.</TE>
<TE>   When his second series was canceled, Caesar was in the midst of
his own "20-year blackout," as he recounts in his 1982 autobiography,
"Where Have I Been?" Not until the 1970s did he reach a degree of
stability.</TE>
<TE>   He took over the leads in two Neil Simon plays: "Last of the Red
Hot Lovers" and "The Prisoner of Second Avenue" (he had starred in
another Simon play, "Little Me," in 1962). He appeared in such films
as "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World" (1963), "A Guide for the Married
Man" (1967), Mel Brooks' "Silent Movie" (1976) and "History of the
World, Part I" (1981), and Simon's "The Cheap Detective" (1978).</TE>
<TE>   Caesar and his wife of 59 years live high above Beverly Hills in a
spacious house that resembles an overstocked art gallery; several of
the paintings are by modern classic artists. Though he appears on a
few TV shows, often to receive an award, he quit performing eight
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a time to know when to hold 'em, and a time to know when
to fold 'em," he said, quoting the Kenny Rogers song. "You're never
going [to perform] as you did when you were 27. After you get past
60, you don't want to be seen like that."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Caesar wears his 80 years well, considering the
self-destructive period, triple-bypass heart surgery and other health
problems. His round face has thinned, and he uses a cane to get
around. But he walks up and down the hills near his house every
morning and spends much of the day pursuing his favorite hobbies:
reading history and physics books. Not bad for a boy whose formal
education ended with a diploma from Yonkers High.</TE>
<TE>   Caesar's Polish immigrant father ran a restaurant in a multiethnic
section of Yonkers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where I learned to do the languages," Sid remarked. "When
I picked up the dishes, I listened to the Italians, the Germans, the
French. Each language has its own rhythms."</TE>
<TE>   Young Sid didn't set out to be a comedian; he started as a
musician, playing sax, clarinet and sometimes flute in the bands of
Charlie Spivak, Shep Fields, Claude Thornhill and Benny Goodman.</TE>
<TE>   While appearing in the Catskills with a five-piece combo, he was
asked to do a slapstick skit. The audience roared, and he was hooked.</TE>
<TE>   Contemplating his Sept. 8 birthday, he mused:</TE>
<TE>   "Eighty years old, that's a good number. My legs are not as good
as they used to be, my back gives me a little trouble--the usual
things that go along with age. These are the cards you're dealt; play
them. You can't keep taking pills for the pain. You live with the
pain."</TE>
<TE>   He added slyly: "I wanna stick around to see how it all comes
out."</TE>

<HD>A Rainy but Rousing Night at the Bowl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rain came, but the concert went on. The Hollywood Bowl Orchestra,
conducted Thursday night by the strangely silent John Mauceri--he led
the entire concert without saying a word to his audience--played its
scheduled Tchaikovsky-Shostakovich program at the Bowl despite steady
misting, which dripped rain onto the smaller-than-usual audience
throughout the evening.</LD>
<LD>   Still, those hardy music lovers heard a very satisfying
performance, led with his usual panache by the vigorously gesturing
Mauceri, whose soloist in the Violin Concerto by Tchaikovsky was the
imperturbable Gil Shaham, a veteran of outdoor events, but probably
few as wet as this one.</LD>
<LD>   A tarpaulin usually used for shading daytime rehearsals was
installed at the concert's beginning, no doubt to protect the
performers, but the sound, well-managed by the Bowl's acoustical
engineers, emerged largely undistorted and quite clear by Bowl
standards.</LD>
<TE>   Shaham, who gave a resplendent, virtuosic and serene performance
of the same concerto at the Bowl four years ago, repeated the feat.
Nothing fazes him. Clearly, he has the Tchaikovsky urgency, passion
and lyricism deep in his blood and fingers. Thursday night, he again
made the old warhorse seem young and fresh. He created as much joy as
the beloved and familiar piece probably contains. He was seconded
neatly by Mauceri &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   After the intermission, the orchestra gave its own display of
strong accomplishment and musical integration. Shostakovich's popular
Fifth Symphony received an appropriately colorful, dynamically broad,
well-considered reading replete with telling details and a grand
design.</TE>
<TE>   The bombastic outer movements showed off the ensemble's polished
string-section resources and its powerful brass. And the touching
slow movement revealed strong contributions from concertmaster Bruce
Dukov and from clarinet, horn and harp soloists. Only the sardonic
Scherzo lacked its characteristic lightness in setting up the
seriousness of the following Largo.</TE>

<HD>A Little Attention, Not Too Much, for Edward Gorey</HD>
<DH>Art* The late eccentric illustrator was not one for the
spotlight. Family and friends have created a tribute to his life and
work in his Cape Cod home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THEO EMERY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>YARMOUTH, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Edward Gorey never passed up a chance to give a gift--unless it
involved a birthday bash, a Christmas gala, an anniversary party or
any event where an admiring stranger might thrust the shy author and
illustrator to the center of attention.</LD>
<LD>   So he probably would have grumbled aloud about the spotlight on
his life at the Edward Gorey House, a tribute to all things Gorey
that opened in July in his beloved Cape Cod home, where he suffered a
fatal heart attack in April 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Secretly, however, Gorey might have been pleased by efforts from
friends, family and an anonymous foundation to preserve his eccentric
legacy.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought, initially, he would hate the idea, but now I don't
know," says Herb Senn, 77, a longtime friend. "I think he liked a
little adulation.... Not too much, but some, and from the right
people."</TE>
<TE>   Gorey's famed art work, clutter and vast library are carefully
culled into exhibits chronicling his life. The four walls of the
200-year-old cedar shingle home can barely contain the bulging legacy
of the artist idolized for his morbid depictions of domestic life,
prim murders, Edwardian intrigue and fantastic characters.</TE>
<TE>   The house might have been sold to a home buyer had a private
foundation not stepped in, bought the property and helped open a
museum in his honor, says another friend, Andreas Brown, the owner of
Gotham Book Mart &amp; Gallery in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe that Gorey was one of the creative geniuses of the
20th century, and the tribute that's paid to him by the foundation
and the people on the Cape is deserved," says Brown, who is also the
executor of Gorey's estate.</TE>
<TE>   Gorey, 75 when he died, is best known for just a handful of works.
His sets and costumes for the Broadway production of "Dracula" won
him a Tony Award in 1978, and the introductory animation he drew for
the PBS series "Mystery!" introduced him to millions of television
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   The macabre PBS sequence depicts a string of seemingly unconnected
vignettes--a gowned damsel in distress, sinister men in bowler hats
and handlebar mustaches, dark figures playing croquet in a rainstorm.</TE>
<TE>   Another unforgettable work is his book, "The Gashlycrumb Tinies,"
part of his three-volume "Vinegar Works" and one of his more than 100
books. "The Gashlycrumb Tinies" chronicles the grisly demise of 26
children, beginning: "A is for Amy who fell down the stairs," and
ending with "Z is for Zillah, who drank too much gin."</TE>
<TE>   But those works are only a tantalizing sample of his work. Despite
the grim--if facetious--nature of his best-known art, Gorey's playful
sense of humor left an impression remembered among his tightknit
group of friends and family, and gained him a near cult-like status
among admirers.</TE>
<TE>   "In his day-to-day life, it would be hard to believe that he would
be someone who would create the works he did. He was not a morbid or
macabre person," says Gorey's cousin, Ken Morton, who was consulted
by the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Bizarre characters and creatures perch, mope and pedal through his
dreamy artwork, such as an alligator that rides a bicycle upside
down, the "Doubtful Guest" that stumps through a book by the same
name, wearing tennis shoes and a scarf, and Mr. Earbrass, who plays
an unstrung harp in a massive fur coat.</TE>
<TE>   His verse was as mischievous as his art. In a miniature book
titled "The Eclectic Abecedarium," published in 1983 (there are only
300 copies, numbered 101 through 400), he advises, "Pick up loose
crumbs upon your thumbs," and "Be loath to drink Indian Ink."</TE>
<TE>   Gorey left thousands of books and jumbled piles of bric-a-brac,
artwork and found items in his home, which he purchased in the early
1980s and where he lived with his cats.</TE>
<TE>   After he died, much of the house's contents were dispersed to
friends and family, who were invited, according to his will, to come
help themselves. Many items were eventually donated to the museum.</TE>
<TE>   On view in the house are bowls of rocks he displayed around his
kitchen, his doorknob and cheese-grater collection, rusty spoils from
yard sales, and the stuffed toy animals he made: frogs, elephants and
his "Figbash," a long-limbed character in some of his works.</TE>
<TE>   There were also posters that he made for Cape Cod theater
productions, such as one for Theater on the Bay's 1995 production of
"Salome," depicting Salome kicking John the Baptist's head in the
air. The production's opening act was a Gorey puppet show titled "Six
who pass while the lentils boil."</TE>
<TE>   A back room for children is dedicated to animal welfare
organizations Gorey supported, among them the Tufts Veterinary School
in Grafton and the Xerces Society, which protects invertebrates such
as butterflies, beetles, squids and snails.</TE>
<TE>   Gorey, a Taoist, delighted in all animals--with a particular love
of creatures shunned by humans, such as bats. Later in life, he
became a passionate animal rights supporter, permanently shedding his
trademark fur coat.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his more oblique art was quite misunderstood, filled with
underlying violence that made audiences queasy, and some works were
even "quite awful," Senn said, but now are brilliant for their puns,
riddles and grim mischief.</TE>
<TE>   "All those things seem so much better in retrospect. I think he
can't help but to become more famous and more respected and more
mysterious," says Senn.</TE>
<TE>   Gorey's legacy sprawls far beyond the walls of which he was so
fond. In nearby Jack's Outback restaurant, where he dined virtually
every day for years, Jack Braginton-Smith proudly points to Gorey's
artwork on the walls, and to where Gorey parked each day for his bowl
of cereal and invariably miscalculated his own bill.</TE>
<TE>   Braginton-Smith, 77, has drawers stuffed full of Gorey-bilia in
his apartment above the restaurant, including a knitted yellow sock
containing a rock and a note reading: "The more attention given this
stone, the more likely it is to turn back into a frog." It was a gift
from Gorey.</TE>
<TE>   "Edward gave his talent to unbelievable numbers of organizations
and people. He never charged anybody anything," said Braginton-Smith.
"He was one of the most generous people with his talent that you can
think of."</TE>

<HD>Tracing Hitler's Nightmare Visions</HD>
<DH>Art* An exhibition in Massachusetts explores how his years
living in Vienna influenced later evils of the Third Reich.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM GORLICK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass.</DL>
<LD>The images of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich forever will be linked with
evil: The menace of the swastika, the perfect but intimidating
columns of marching Nazi soldiers and the horror that followed.</LD>
<LD>   An exhibition at Williams College Museum of Art here argues that
it wasn't a study of warfare, politics and military strategy that
influenced the background and symbols for Hitler's visions. It was
art: Richard Wagner's operas; dark and simple German paintings;
Viennese architecture.</LD>
<LD>   "Prelude to a Nightmare: Art, Politics, and Hitler's Early Years
in Vienna 1906-1913" traces the dictator's artistic aspirations,
disappointments and influences during his seven years in the Austrian
city.</LD>
<TE>   The exhibition uses about 275 paintings, posters and clips of film
from Nazi rallies to illustrate art's influence on Hitler. Displays
of anti-Semitic pamphlets that circulated around Vienna in the early
1900s show that Hitler mimicked the pamphlets for his own propaganda
decades later.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after visiting Vienna for the first time, Hitler moved
there in 1908 as a 19-year-old aspiring artist. Twice rejected by the
city's art academy, he drifted, staying in homeless shelters,
attending operas and watching sessions of Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   A friend encouraged him to sell his paintings, mostly postcards
and watercolors of Vienna landscapes, some of which are displayed in
the Williams exhibition. According to a memoir kept by the friend and
on display at the exhibition, some of Hitler's highest-paying and
most loyal customers were Jews.</TE>
<TE>   His work never rose to critical acclaim.</TE>
<TE>   "He was known for copying from other images," said Deborah
Rothschild, the curator who organized the Williams exhibition. "He
had no originality."</TE>
<TE>   While living the life of a struggling artist, Hitler was drawn to
the politics of the Pan-German Party, a right-wing anti-Semitic group
that claimed Aryan superiority.</TE>
<TE>   Hitler shared the Pan-Germans' taste in art, favoring folksy
paintings that asserted German dominance. He railed against modern
art. As fuhrer, Hitler staged an art show of ''degenerate art,''
comparing works by artists such as Vincent van Gogh and Picasso to
images of human deformity.</TE>
<TE>   The Williams exhibition, mostly strung together with pieces on
loan from museums in Vienna, shows original works and reproductions
of the art to which Hitler responded. There are the images he
loved--like the painting of drunken monks by Eduard von Grutzner--and
those he loathed, including a self-portrait of Van Gogh.</TE>
<TE>   "His taste was very conservative," Rothschild said. "He had an
ideal of what art should be, and he hated what didn't fit that
ideal."</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Hitler seemed to have an obsession with opera--most
notably the work of Wagner. Hitler began forming the aesthetic and
philosophical groundwork for his Third Reich in Wagner's operas,
anti-Semitic politics and pro-German writings, according to the
exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved Wagner," Rothschild said. "He loved the timing, the
presentation and the design."</TE>
<TE>   Wagner's set designer, Alfred Roller, had an obvious influence on
Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   "Prelude to a Nightmare" juxtaposes scenes from Wagner's operas
against photos of rallies orchestrated by the dictator.</TE>
<TE>   A painting of Roller's set design for "Rienzi" shows smoke and
fire rising from Rome's capitol. The image is displayed next to a
photograph of a Nazi night rally held in 1934, with smoke and fire
set against large buildings. A set design from "Parsifal," with
imposing high arches and thick columns, mirrors an image of a
swearing-in ceremony for Hitler's bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at this, and you see where Hitler got some of his
ideas," said Sherwin Fink, a business owner from Hillsdale, N.Y., who
visited the exhibition recently. "It gives a different perspective on
someone we know a lot about."</TE>
<TE>   Rothschild designed the exhibition, which runs through Oct. 27, as
part of a project highlighting art from Vienna being sponsored by 11
Berkshire galleries and museums.</TE>
<TE>   "As a college museum, I wanted something that would be a catalyst
for thinking and discussion," she said. "I wanted to give people
something to talk about."</TE>

<KH>Venice Film Festival</KH>
<HD>Light Shed on Church Asylums' Dark Deeds</HD>
<DH>A drama about practices in now-closed Catholic institutions
draws praise while filmmaker sparks anger by comparing nuns to
'Taliban militants.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRITTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>VENICE, Italy</DL>
<LD>Peter Mullan, the Scottish director, screenwriter and actor, is
someone who doesn't shy away from controversy. So he knew that
criticizing the Catholic Church in Italy, of all countries, would
attract enormous attention.</LD>
<LD>   So it has turned out. Mullan has attended the 59th Venice
International Film Festival, where his feature "The Magdalene
Sisters," which he wrote and directed, was in competition. Set in
rural Ireland in 1964, the film deals with a Magdalene asylum, one of
that country's supposedly benevolent religious institutions.</LD>
<LD>   These asylums were run by Catholic nuns, and took in poor girls,
some of whom had had illegitimate children they had been forced to
give up for adoption. Other girls had been labeled as promiscuous;
some were sent to the asylums for little more than flirtatious
behavior.</LD>
<TE>   The nuns' mission was to put these young women back on the path to
righteousness. But the treatment they meted out was often harsh and
cruel. The girls often worked 364 days a year in prison-like
conditions; typically they worked long hours in an asylum laundry.
Misdemeanors were rewarded with beatings. They were brutalized and
humiliated. Theirs was a life resembling slavery. The last of these
asylums closed down in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "The Magdalene Sisters," an angry, emotional film, has been among
the best-received by audiences and critics at this year's Venice
festival, which ends Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   But Mullan raised the stakes of controversy at one press
conference earlier this week when he compared the activities of some
Magdalene nuns in the 1960s to those of "Taliban militants." His
remark made him headline news in the Italian press.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I stand by those comments," Mullan, 41, said in an
interview. Smiling mischievously, he added: "I knew that [comparison]
would be an incendiary device."</TE>
<TE>   He is not a man to shrink from a public fight: When his British
distributors withdrew backing from his first feature film, "Orphans"
(which went on to win four prizes in Venice in 1998), he castigated
them for wanting to change his script. "I'd rather burn in hell," he
said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled that he was in the middle of cutting "The Magdalene
Sisters" when Sept. 11 happened. "Suddenly, everyone knew about the
Taliban. But we [he and his producer Frances Higson] had been
demonstrating against the Taliban for three years. We'd been
exchanging e-mails, signing petitions and supporting benefits, all
because of the way women suffered under the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "The more I looked into the Magdalenes, there really seemed to be
not that great a difference between the Taliban and the Catholic
Church in Ireland in terms of the treatment of women. I stress the
phrase 'not that great.' [With the Taliban] it seems more extreme.
But then when you look at the Magdalenes, you wonder: Is it more
extreme? And I'll stand by that, in relation to the Magdalenes in
1960s Ireland--it's obviously not the case now, and hasn't been the
case for 10 or 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   "But just in relation to women, it's not that huge an imaginative
leap to see the connection between the Taliban and the Catholic
Church."</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by Documentary</TE>
<TE>   Mullan has chosen to dramatize the conditions in the Magdalene
asylums by tracing the fictional stories of four young girls (all
played by virtually unknown actresses) who enter such an asylum. One
has protested that she was raped by a young cousin, another had a
child out of wedlock, a third simply hung around boys in the
schoolyard, while the fourth, a simple-minded innocent, descends into
madness while inside the institution.</TE>
<TE>   Best known for playing the title role in Ken Loach's film "My Name
Is Joe," Mullan takes a minor role as the brutal father of a fifth
girl who tries to escape the asylum. The British stage actress
Geraldine McEwan plays the villainous and sometimes sadistic
presiding sister.</TE>
<TE>   Mullan, who was raised in a Catholic family in Scotland, was
inspired to write the story after having seen a TV documentary on the
subject.</TE>
<TE>   "I was channel-hopping one night, and came across this program,
Sex in a Cold Climate,' on [British TV's] Channel 4. I saw these
Irish women telling all these stories. One said: 'I was too pretty,
that's why they locked me up.'</TE>
<TE>   "I think the reason it stayed with me for so long and I wanted to
write it was that I felt so angry. I didn't know much about these
places. I knew there had been a similar one in Glasgow, and that
there had been a riot there in 1964. But when I researched it, it
turned out it was a one-off [one of a kind]. And it was a Protestant
institution, run by the Church of Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   "At one point, I had considered making the film in Scotland, but I
thought it would be better in Ireland, because Ireland's a theocracy,
and [these abuses were] happening everywhere. So in the film you can
indict the system more, rather than give [the church] a get-out
clause."</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for writing the story, Mullan talked to nuns who had
served inside Magdalene asylums, and to young women who had survived
them.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard some really terrible stories, stories far worse than the
events depicted in the film. It got to me so deeply. When you come
across a story like that, it's the opposite of what I was led to
believe. It's so unlike the Ireland I was brought up to believe in.
Ireland was a kind of promised land for Scottish Catholics."</TE>
<TE>   He made a conscious decision not to put the most extreme stories
of abuse he heard into the film. "One reason I didn't include the
really awful stuff is because I know the church may come at me and
say: 'It's lies, you've exaggerated.' And I could say: 'No, I've done
the opposite.' Another reason is that as a filmmaker, you're having
to think: If I put all the horrors in there, it may make me feel
better, but you need to take the audience along with you, and not
completely turn them off. If nobody sees the film, I've lost the
audience."</TE>
<TE>   'A Prison Film'</TE>
<TE>   Judging by the reception in Venice to "The Magdalene Sisters,"
that has not happened. Audiences cheered each time one of the girls
tried to escape or found a way to rebel against the nuns.</TE>
<TE>   Mullan also made a conscious decision to steer away from the issue
of homosexuality inside the asylum: "When I started writing, I was
aware that I was writing a prison film. And in prison films, there's
always a homosexual scene, a fight scene and a dining-room scene,
when someone throws a plate against a wall. So I was aware that in
the prison genre there was a minefield of cliche. If you went there,
you'd better do it either in a way that's not been done before or one
that progresses the narrative.</TE>
<TE>   "I was certainly interested in whether there were lesbian affairs.
But the vast majority of people from the asylums that I spoke to told
me they were too exhausted to have time for sex. It was 364 days a
year working in that laundry, and at the end of each day, you slept."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Catholic Church has remained silent about "The
Magdalene Sisters," though Mullan expects the film to receive
criticism when it plays in Catholic countries. (It opens in Ireland
in November, while U.S. distributors have been bidding for rights in
Venice.) At the festival, a lone priest was reported to have waited
outside one screening, holding a placard that stated it was a sin
even to watch the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Mullan could not resist linking the abuses he highlights in "The
Magdalene Sisters" to current sexual abuse scandals in the church "I
can't think of a time when the Catholic Church had a lower esteem
than it has now," he said. "What began as the odd scandal in the
1980s is now pandemic. The church knows it's going to have to face up
to all the things it's done.</TE>
<TE>   "The church may look at my film and say these things never
happened. But frankly, I'm not that good a dramatist. I couldn't have
made it up. And there'll be people lining up to say it happened to
them."</TE>

<KH>Jazz Review</KH>
<HD>Hamilton's Feeling Spontaneous</HD>
<DH>The saxophonist and his combo enchant a crowd at Catalina
Bar &amp; Grill with an instinctive, inventive set that is utterly their
own.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pianist Paul Bley once said that "the sound you hear is the sound you
get," implying that what comes out through a jazz artist's instrument
is the external manifestation of an inner perspective. It's an
intriguing viewpoint, and one that seems to accurately describe a
great deal of what has happened in jazz.</LD>
<LD>   But lately the sounds that a lot of players are offering appear to
have more to do with exteriors than interiors--with emulating
favorite models rather than attempting to hear and express one's own
personal voice.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, a few musicians such as tenor saxophonist Scott
Hamilton are still on the scene. Surrounded by a plethora of
second-and third-generation Coltrane clones, he goes merrily on his
own way, playing whatever music appeals to him--whether it be old
jazz, new jazz or pop music--via a sound and improvisational style
that are utterly his own.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday night at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, Hamilton--working with
pianist John Campbell, bassist Bob Maize and drummer Paul
Kreibich--offered one of the more appealing club sets of the year.
And he did so in completely spontaneous fashion, selecting tunes on
the spot, interacting casually with his musicians as well as the
full-house audience.</TE>
<TE>   The material ranged from the old standard "Love Letters" to the
Woody Herman jump tune "Apple Honey," gathering Fats Waller's
"Jitterbug Waltz" and another standard, "My Foolish Heart," along the
way.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton approached the ballads with a warm, sensual sound,
frequently remaining in the instrument's darker low register rather
than the high-note harmonics currently favored by so many young
players. On the faster-paced numbers, his solos bristled with
rhythmic drive and forward movement enlivened by riff-filled instant
melodies, occasionally tossing in a few crowd-pleasing honks and
repeated notes.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton's playing was jazz as invention, as personal expression,
jazz as entertainment, embracing all those qualities without
diminishing any of them--the product of a masterful artist at work.</TE>
<TE>   He was brilliantly aided by the presence of Campbell, a not
particularly well-known pianist who deserves far wider attention. His
soloing, especially on the ballads, was a stunning example of the
extraordinary results that can accrue when a player allows air and
space for his improvisations to breathe freely. Maize and Kreibich,
superb accompanists, were up to their usual high standards, with
Kreibich making the most of several rare solo opportunities.</TE>

<HD>It's Over 30; Can Rolling Stone Be Trusted?</HD>
<DH>As the magazine changes to pursue younger readers, it loses
some of what was valuable in its past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's going on with Rolling Stone magazine?</LD>
<LD>   It's a common question these days, and you can tell a lot about
the person asking it by the degree of frustration in the voice.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone who thinks the Sept. 19 issue of the rock magazine--the
first under a new editorial mandate that will reportedly deliver
shorter stories and flashier design features--is reason to start
shedding tears must not have been paying attention to the magazine
for a l-o-n-g time.</LD>
<TE>   The challenge facing Rolling Stone isn't its format, but its soul.</TE>
<TE>   Editor-publisher Jann S. Wenner needs to figure out how to make
the magazine essential again in a publishing world that has been
inspired by it and has long been chipping away at its relevance.</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Stone's own editorial decisions in recent years have
probably done more to harm the magazine's credibility, however, than
any threat from its direct rivals, which ranged from Spin and Vibe in
the '90s to Blender and others now.</TE>
<TE>   It's not wise to judge a book by its cover, but you can tell a lot
about a magazine from it, and Rolling Stone's cover has reflected its
slow, steady descent from a publication that brilliantly reflected
the pulse of pop culture (especially music) to one whose chief
purpose seems to be preserving its circulation figures.</TE>
<TE>   All too frequently, the covers these days are more suited to Teen
People (Britney Spears and all the boy bands) or Victoria's Secret
catalogs (lacy lingerie on starlets) than a magazine whose legacy is
tied to John Lennon, Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 5 cover--the last one before the redesign--featured an
actress whose chief credit in this country is her co-starring role in
a two-bit summer action movie.</TE>
<TE>   About Asia Argento, the cover language proclaims breathlessly:
"She Puts the Sex in 'XXX.' "</TE>
<TE>   The story itself, most of which deals with Argento's uninhibited
language, barely fills two pages, though the editors found room for
two more full pages of lingerie photos.</TE>
<TE>   A far more noteworthy subject in the same issue--turntable master
DJ Shadow, whose "The Private Press" is widely regarded as the best
electronica album in ages--has to settle for far less space, and not
even a mention on the cover. Some of the magazine's compelling
cultural coverage also tends to be slipped inside.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the magazine has been lucky enough to camouflage its
pin-up fascination by getting pop stars to adopt sexy poses.</TE>
<TE>   The Dec. 6, 2001, cover featured Spears in a low-cut bra next to
the words: "Britney Takes Charge. Her Life, Her Music and the
Future." The photo made an additional point: Her Breasts.</TE>
<TE>   All too often, however, Rolling Stone has simply gone for
starlets.</TE>
<TE>   On the Feb. 14 cover, TV actress Jennifer Garner was showcased
provocatively over the headline: "Just Your Average Butt-Kicking Coed
in Leather."</TE>
<TE>   On May 23, the cover was Kirsten Dunst (in lingerie): "Dark Side
of a Bright Star."</TE>
<TE>   On June 20: "Sex, Brains &amp; Star Wars: The Very Private Side of
Natalie Portman."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't making too much of the cover subject. Wenner is so
proud of the Rolling Stone cover legacy that in an introduction in
1998 to "Rolling Stone: The Complete Covers," a coffee table book
that reprinted every cover from 1967 to 1997, he wrote: "Our subjects
have been the most creative people of these times, presidents and
poets, the outsiders and insiders with their shoulders to the wheel
and their pictures beneath the logo."</TE>
<TE>   And now we add: Asia Argento.</TE>
<TE>   Wenner points out in his essay that the first cover--a publicity
still of John Lennon from director Richard Lester's movie "How I Won
the War," "speaks volumes about the marriage of music and movies and
politics that came to define Rolling Stone."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure even Wenner imagined at the beginning that the movie
component would consist chiefly of pin-ups. The first actress didn't
appear on Rolling Stone's cover until 1972--109 issues after that
first Lennon image. It was Jane Fonda, and she wasn't wearing
lingerie. She was on the cover because of her opposition to the
Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   This aura of compromise about cover subjects is a virus that has
spread throughout much of the magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Wenner was able to build Rolling Stone into a publishing empire
because he saw far faster than other magazine moguls that rock 'n'
roll was the language of choice for a generation around the world. He
also had the insight and daring to move beyond music into noteworthy
cultural issues.</TE>
<TE>   The results were some cover stories that were thrilling in their
timing. It took us to Woodstock and Altamont and into the bloody
streets outside the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. It also
led us inside the minds of some of the greatest artists of the
time--often with long, penetrating Q&amp;A interviews by Wenner himself
that remain definitive documents.</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Stone showed respect for the music and attracted some of
the finest young writers in the country, including Greil Marcus and
Jon Landau on music and Hunter S. Thompson and Tom Wolfe on culture
and politics. The magazine also featured the work of such gifted
photographers as Annie Leibovitz.</TE>
<TE>   It was an honor for writers to be published in the magazine and
for musicians to be on the cover. The masthead still has some
distinguished editors and writers, including Mikal Gilmore and Gerri
Hirshey, but the question is where Wenner wants to lead them.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine's musical focus is blurred. It stopped years ago
being the most reliable guide to new sounds. Rap's 1980s trailblazers
N.W.A and Public Enemy, for instance, never appeared on Rolling
Stone's cover, and Spin moved more aggressively in the '90s into
alt-rock and metal.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, Rolling Stone began accepting mere fame as a reason for
coverage, rather than significance or talent. Like MTV, it treats the
most disposable artists with the same respect it does great ones.
Only sales matter. Hence, all the Britney covers.</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Stone was pushed into this position because it now has
hundreds of competitors, both magazines and newspapers. Many do
excellent jobs, from the cockiness of the Village Voice to the sheer
passion of Q and Mojo, two British monthlies whose design features
are now being employed by Rolling Stone and Blender.</TE>
<TE>   The theme of Rolling Stone's Sept. 19 cover story--the return of
passion in rock--was outlined months ago in the New Yorker, whose pop
coverage is sporadic, but always smart and lively.</TE>
<TE>   How can it fight back?</TE>
<TE>   Above all, it needs to win our trust again by giving clear signs
that it is committed to covering the most significant developments in
pop culture rather than simply the most popular. If that costs it
some circulation, so be it. A better Rolling Stone is preferable to
simply a fatter one.</TE>
<TE>   Wenner could begin by making bold, inspiring statements on the
cover.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to picture the editors sitting around a table back in
the days when the magazine was starting out in San Francisco,
debating which great artist to put on the cover.</TE>
<TE>   Now transfer that meeting to 2002 in New York and imagine what
went on when someone held up a photo of Asia Argento in her bra and
unbuttoned jeans. Instead of ridiculing the idea of the shot on the
cover, someone must have declared, "Great idea. That'll sell!"</TE>
<TE>   If that thinking persists, anyone who ever counted on Rolling
Stone as a barometer for pop music may even stop asking the question
about what's going on at the magazine. They just may not care.</TE>

<LD>The man who brought film projects to Iowa, including "Field of
Dreams," "The Bridges of Madison County" and "Twister," is resigning
because his office's budget has been cut in half.</LD>
<LD>   Wendol Jarvis, who created the Iowa Film Office in 1984, said the
budget is being reduced to $140,000 and he is losing two assistants.</LD>
<LD>   "Budget cuts throughout state government didn't give me the tools
I needed," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Jarvis brought 54 films and hundreds of smaller TV and commercial
projects to the state.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Pedersen, communications manager for Iowa's Department of
Economic Development, said applications are being taken to fill the
manager's position.</TE>
<TE>   "Working in the film office has been a real important time in my
life," said Jarvis, who is leaving Tuesday to become a franchise
owner of Papa Murphy's pizza in Kansas City, Mo.</TE>

<HD>Stations Strengthen Ties as They Study Aftermath of the
Attacks</HD>
<DH>Television* KCBS and KCAL pool anchors and reporters for
first-hand stories from New York and the Persian Gulf.</DH>

<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Viacom's recently merged KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV, which have promised an
unprecedented amount of sharing between local stations, premiere
their first joint news special Sunday, traveling to the East Coast
for a special report focusing on the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The one-hour special, titled "The Day That Changed America," will
first air Sunday at 6 p.m. on KCBS, with four other air times on the
two stations over the next several days. It was taped in New York,
Washington and Pennsylvania and features newly arrived KCBS anchor
Laura Diaz and KCAL anchor Pat Harvey, as well as a reporter from
each station, Drew Griffin from KCBS and KCAL's Joel Connable.</LD>
<LD>   The special, which will air without commercials, is part of an
ambitious package of original coverage for a local station. In
addition to the special, the two stations are sending a number of
reporters to the East Coast for news reports next week, and a
reporter and cameraman were also sent to the Persian Gulf for some
reporting.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, the Sunday joint program will take on a special
significance with the news Friday that cameraman Larry Greene, a
24-year KCBS veteran who was part of the team that taped the show on
the East Coast, was killed in the crash of a U.S. Navy helicopter in
Bahrain.</TE>
<TE>   Greene was in the gulf with KCBS-TV reporter Randy Paige, who was
not on the helicopter, shooting footage for next week's Sept.
11-related coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why two local stations needed to go across the country for
their own perspective on the anniversary, Nancy Bauer Gonzales, vice
president and news director for the two stations, said: "It sounds
cheesy, but we just really wanted to do something as a combined
newsroom for our viewers. It's very simply an idea I had ... to offer
them hope from that terrible day."</TE>
<TE>   In New York in mid-August, interviewing the project coordinator of
Columbia University's Muslim Communities in New York City Project,
Diaz deftly brought the topic around to a Los Angeles angle. In a
segment titled "Divided We Fall," Diaz profiled Arab Americans in
L.A. as well as New York who were victims of threats or actual
violence following the terror attacks.</TE>
<TE>   She said later that it was an advantage to be on the scene of the
devastation, instead of reporting on the anniversary from afar.
"There is no substitute for being here.... It adds greater depth and
detail," she said, and moreover, "it is personally rewarding to hear
the stories firsthand."</TE>
<TE>   Cool despite the New York heat in a black blazer, white pants and
funky platform sandals, Diaz seemed perfectly comfortable with her
new KCBS team, even though it was her first week on the job, after 19
years at rival KABC's "Eyewitness News." Although it is an adjustment
changing professional homes, "the act of gathering the news is the
same," she said. And she has known many of her new station's
management for years, including Bauer Gonzales. The two worked
together in the early 1980s in San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   The special also features KCAL newcomer Connable, 29. It was a
plum assignment, Bauer Gonzales concedes, but she wanted him because
he grew up in the New York area, on Long Island. He is also a former
Nassau County paramedic, who trained in New York City and knew some
of those who died when the towers fell, giving him added insight for
his reporting.</TE>
<TE>   Bauer Gonzales says the special turned out to be a good way to get
the two newsrooms used to working with each other very quickly. She
said other specials planned include a KCBS special to air Sept. 18,
related to the Latin Grammy Awards, that will feature personnel from
KCAL. There will also be a joint special surrounding the CBS program
"Survivor."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Day That Changed America" also will air Monday at 9 p.m. on
KCAL. On Wednesday, it will air at 10 a.m. on KCAL, 4 p.m. on KCBS
and again at 7 p.m. on KCAL.</TE>

<LD>Obsession is always beguiling. Located beyond the clipped and
rationally tended territory of reason, it dovetails nicely with art.
Put the two together, and art obsession serves pretty well as a
working definition of just what grips collectors.</LD>
<LD>   At East Los Angeles College's Vincent Price Gallery, a show of 125
works from the collection of Robert E. Holmes is a modest yet
appealing example of the affliction. The exhibition is nicely
overstuffed. Holmes, a former music industry executive, has acquired
art for more than three decades. Works jostle one another for
attention in a crowded installation, loosely recalling the back
corridors and side bedrooms of a house where an inveterate collector
inevitably ends up squeezing in just one more drawing or collage.</LD>
<TE>   Sculpture and painting are included, but most of the Holmes
collection consists of works on paper--especially drawings, prints
and several antique book plates, with just a few photographs. The
most compelling of the latter is a casual black-and-white snapshot of
Fidel Castro and Che Guevara fishing off the back of a boat, by the
late Alberto Diaz Gutierrez, known professionally as Korda. In its
easy camaraderie--between the two subjects and between the subjects
and the artist, who lingered behind them to take the journalistic
picture--the photograph couldn't be more different from Korda's
famous revolutionary icon of Che as part god, part rock star.</TE>
<TE>   The show opens with a number of engraved book plates by anonymous
artists. The earliest, dated 1723, depicts majestic sailing ships in
the background and a classically attired figure in the foreground,
seen inscribing something on a massive port-side column. Between the
ships and the scribe is a scene of abject horror, as white masters
shackle and beat black slaves. What the unidentified book's title is
and what its text might say are anybody's guess; clearly, though,
technological power and historical authority are used by the line
engraving to frame--and justify--an event of callous violence.</TE>
<TE>   The collection's earliest drawing couldn't be more different. An
1880 "Portrait of a Young Boy" by T.S. Moser is a self-assured pencil
study of an African American youth wearing a large face-framing hat
and seated in a chair. The supple drawing radiates affection.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of a gestural oil painting and a calligraphic
watercolor by Matsumi Kanemitsu, a silk-screen print of brightly
colored disks by Sonia Delauney and a composition of angular abstract
shapes by sculptor Richard Hunt, all the work is figurative. Art as
an emblem and conveyor of social consciousness, especially as
displayed in African American, Latino and gay culture, is perhaps the
clearest thread that runs through the Holmes collection.</TE>
<TE>   Several lithographs date from the 1930s and were produced under
the socially minded auspices of the WPA Graphic Arts Division. They
including Saul Kovner's rural street and David Feinstein's
lamp-lighted outdoor scene, in which young lovers in the background
and men playing cards in the foreground juxtapose different games of
desire and chance.</TE>
<TE>   Twentieth century black artists are represented in abundance,
including works by Hunt, Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence, William
Pajaud, Dox Thrash, Charles White and several others. Among them is a
terrific work by David Hammons, one from a series of "body prints"
done around 1970, in which actual human flesh was inked and printed
directly onto paper.</TE>
<TE>   With black images then still rare in both art and popular culture,
Hammons' method was startlingly blunt. "The Couple" shows a kiss
between a man and woman, their lips pressing together much the way
their bodies were also physically pressed onto the sheet. Cut out and
collaged against multi-patterned wallpapers, as in a latter-day
Matisse, the figures embody two mantras of their era: Black is
beautiful, and art is love.</TE>
<TE>   Two paintings by Bob Thompson--one featuring languorous nudes on a
draped bed, the other a strange pink bird attending to a reclining
figure as a ghostly pair of green figures look on--employ brushy oil
paint and smeary pastel to evocative effect, in which color becomes
the agent of a mysterious, ecstatic vision. Color as quiet rapture
describes the crouching figure surrounded by mottled yellow and
"crowned" by a slather of paint in a large portrait by Beauford
Delaney, an American who worked mostly in Paris. The writer Henry
Miller once described Delaney's work as characterized by "solar
radiance," and this gently hypnotic work shows why.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Catlett, represented by several graphics, appears to be
a special favorite of the collector. Catlett sometimes seems to have
carved her sitters, given the strength and stony solidity of their
features, as if from the lithographic stone on which the print was
made. The head in her intaglio print, "Roots," is backed by the
suggestion of a red, white and blue flag, provocatively assembled
from African-print cloth.</TE>
<TE>   Among other artists represented by several works, Dan McCleary
stands out with two fine paintings, an oil sketch, a drawing and a
print, all from the last decade. The most compelling of the five is a
double portrait of two young ushers at a generic movie theater, both
dressed in a uniform of red jackets and black bow ties. Unlike Edward
Hopper's famous 1939 painting of a female usher--captured unawares in
an almost cinematic moment as an urban daydreamer while the movie
plays in the other room--these young men self-consciously pose. Your
daydreams, not theirs, become its animating force.</TE>
<TE>   The Price Gallery exhibition frames the Holmes collection as
having a "cross-cultural" theme based in ethnicity. It also
identifies music as a secondary theme. (The collector is a former
general counsel at Motown Records, vice president of Arista Music
Publishing and executive at Sony; a pair of gold records hang by the
entrance.) But, disappointingly, gay culture goes unremarked, even
though it's self-evident in the show.</TE>
<TE>   A certain curatorial nervousness about the subject can be
discerned in various wall texts, where, for example, Delaney's
romantic relationship with the great American writer James Baldwin is
euphemistically described as a "friendship." In the process, notable
artistic shifts are obscured. A fine ink-wash drawing of two men at
the beach by Bay Area figurative painter David Park is a 1950s
version of a classic post-Eden subject of secular renewal--bathers by
the sea. That Cezanne-esque tradition is given a contemporary spin by
Roberto Gil de Montes, whose lovely acrylic wash on un-stretched
canvas shows two boys sunning at the beach while hooked together in a
casual embrace.</TE>
<TE>   The collection also includes some surprise curiosities, which are
what one expects of any obsession. One is a 1973 figure study done in
Zaire by Betty Parsons, the legendary New York gallery owner who
championed a number of Abstract Expressionist painters and sculptors.
Van Freeman, the Silver Lake folk artist whose elaborately decorated
house became a source of admiration last year after his sudden
disappearance (followed by an equally sudden return), is represented
by a window-like relief in wood and smashed tiles that spell out
"freedom."</TE>
<TE>   You cannot see through Freeman's window. But that doesn't mean
art's not a powerful and poetic avenue of liberty.</TE>

<HD>Rosenberg on Scully: Brush-Back Pitch or Down the Middle?</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm not qualified to judge the accuracy of Howard Rosenberg's
comments on baseball announcers, save for one ("Aiming Some Chin
Music at Major League Baseball Announcers," Sept. 2). His attempt to
satirize Vin Scully was both silly and sophomoric. Scully is to
baseball broadcasting what Roy Hobbs was in "The Natural": "The best
there was, and the best there ever will be."</LD>
<LD>   For more than 50 years, he has been expert, congenial,
entertaining, colorful, relentlessly cheerful, exasperatingly fair
and, above all, thoroughly decent. If Rosenberg can't appreciate
those qualities, as I have since 1958 when the Dodgers and Scully
first arrived in L.A., he should return to skewering "reality" shows
and other TV nonsense. In that arena his humor is more often on
target.</LD>
<LD>   PAUL C. REISSER</LD>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What, exactly, is Rosenberg's gripe with Scully? Is there
something wrong with an announcer who revels in the fact that
children attend baseball games? His sing-song voice? His trademark
greeting to fans before every game? The fact that he shows up three
hours before the first pitch to do his research?</TE>
<TE>   No. It's that Scully has to think on his feet when he speaks to
thousands of Dodger fans every night, and that he's the best at it.
Rosenberg, however, hides behind the printed word and has the
opportunity to refine his every statement. His ill-masked jealousy
pervaded the entire column.</TE>
<TE>   GEOFF KERTESZ</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I never thought anyone could be low enough to criticize Vin
Scully. The most trusted man in Los Angeles? The kindest person on
the air? I mean, what did Vinny do to incur Rosenberg's ire? Did he
diss his no-talent column? Did he vote against him in the Pulitzer
voting? Did he draw devil horns on his picture? No, worse yet, he
featured ordinary children of every color and age on camera and said
nice things about them between innings! And he speaks understandable
English in a very literate way that is music to the ears! What a
crime!</TE>
<TE>   JULIE T. BYERS</TE>
<TE>   Temple City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Congratulations for being the first person in memory to not fawn
over Vin Scully's announcing of Dodger games. I, too, come close to
gagging when he picks still another in the inexorable string of
children out of the crowd and uses another of his seemingly scripted
comments regarding them. If I wanted to see cute kids, I'd tune in
some "cute kid show," not a baseball game.</TE>

<TE>   We don't know what planet Rosenberg is from, but the world in
which the rest of us live could sorely use all the kindness,
intelligence and positive vibes Vin Scully blesses us with. Listening
to Scully is as close to God as you can get without dying.</TE>

<LD>Thanks to Brian Lowry for his excellent article about the "Crossing
Over" show and others of that ilk ("Room for Doubt? There Ought to
Be," Sept. 4). For years, my good friend Michael Shermer has been in
the front line battling the charlatans and has been looking for
responsible representation in the media to present his point of view.</LD>
<LD>   The James Randi Educational Foundation has held endless meetings
with network executives in the past decade to discuss the possibility
of a TV series to examine--and test--the talking-with-the-dead con
artists, as well as faith-healers and other quacks.</LD>
<LD>   Inevitably, the marketing reps have insisted that for them to
support such a project, "at least 20% of it must be shown to be
true." This is simply not so, and the foundation has refused to
promote or support that fiction.</LD>
<TE>   However, we are presently contracting with a Korean network to
produce a definitive investigative series in that country beginning
before the end of the year, and an L.A.-based production company is
seriously discussing with us a possible series here in the U.S. This
is very encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   People really do want to hear the truth. And it is "out there."</TE>

<LD>John Zavesky is way off-base with his criticism of Bruce Springsteen
("The Boss Prefers Green to Blue Collar," Sept. 2). From his
perspective, Springsteen's $75 ticket prices and expensive home
disqualify him from being considered "one of us." If Zavesky had
grown up with me on the Jersey shore in the '60s and '70s, I'm sure
he'd feel differently.</LD>
<LD>   Does Zavesky think Springsteen was born into the wealth he has
earned? Please. Bruce went to high school with my sister-in-law and
competed with my brother in local teen band contests.</LD>
<LD>   Zavesky contends that Bruce is just another artist who has "taken
the money and run." I beg to differ. He has chosen to make the Jersey
shore his home and supports the local communities in many, many ways.
His recent "Today" show concert was performed not in Rockefeller
Plaza but on the boardwalk in Asbury Park.</LD>
<TE>   Along with considerable financial donations, his love of New
Jersey is expressed with his daily patronage of local shops and
restaurants. He and his wife are frequent browsers in the antique
store my brother used to own, and he often pops into the record shop
where my nephew works to sign autographs.</TE>
<TE>   He was, is, and always will be "one of us."</TE>

<TE>   John Zavesky's Counterpunch was the most accurate critique I have
read in a long time. I used to be a huge fan of Springsteen but now
can only nod my head in agreement with Zavesky's assessments.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to continue rooting for someone who rehashes "Nebraska"
into that "Tom Joad" album or his other work into mega-double albums.</TE>

<TE>   There were and are many "blue-collar folk" who were able to see
Springsteen's show at the Forum and all the others he is performing.
Just as the price of books, movies, etc., has escalated, so have
concerts. I doubt that these "blue-collar folk" could attend Paul
McCartney for $250 or the Rolling Stones for more.</TE>
<TE>   In these hard times, $75 is a bargain and Springsteen's shows are
more welcomed and appreciated than ever.</TE>

<LD>I don't usually make a habit of responding to reviews (it reeks of
sour grapes), but Lewis Segal's blatant condescension and
dismissiveness in his review of my newest work, "Edgewalkers," begs
to be addressed ("Mizeranydance a Marvel for Its Moves Alone," Sept.
2).</LD>
<LD>   I have found that when Segal is truly perplexed by a dance or
theater work, he usually responds with overreaching hyperbole and/or
not-so-clever one-liners. This was the case in his review of
"Edgewalkers." Though it seems he made no real effort to truly
understand the dance work, I must admit, I did find a few of his more
constructive criticisms helpful. Yet when the review is laced with
such acrimony and insolence, it's hard to take those criticisms
seriously.</LD>

<LD>In Monday's "Counterpunch" column ("Circling Wagons in Defense of
Alien 'Crop' Theory," Sept. 2), Suzanne Taylor puts forth
citation-free hand-waving to assert that crop circles are an
"otherworldly phenomenon" and that "to close one's eyes to
overwhelming evidence that indicates the formations are outside human
bounds is something else again."</LD>
<LD>   What overwhelms me is how Taylor, who purports to be dedicated to
furthering "humanity's oneness," can have so little respect,
appreciation and knowledge of those human bounds, which include art,
architectural wonders, amazing scientific discoveries and our
footprints on the moon.</LD>
<LD>   The idea that humanity, capable of such works, could not have made
patterns in remote fields is incredible to me. The idea that mere
humans could outwit her had apparently not occurred to Taylor, but it
certainly occurred to me after I read her jejune remarks.</LD>

<LD>   Twin Towers Disappear From 'Sopranos' Credits</LD>
<LD>   Tony Soprano still is battling crises in both his families, but
there is one change in the acclaimed HBO series that begins its
fourth season Sept. 15: There is no longer a glimpse of the World
Trade Center towers in the gritty opening credits of the David Chase
mob drama.</LD>
<TE>   The first two episodes of the new season were premiered Thursday
night for the cast, crew, HBO executives and a few thousand guests
invited to New York's Radio City Music Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Tony (James Gandolfini) and his pals do not ignore the impact of
Sept. 11, making several references to the past year's events. But
fans will be pleased to know that the landscape otherwise looks
familiar: The Jersey boys are still trying to take their cut any way
they can (from a construction project this time), Tony is stashing
away the cash and, yes, another Soprano (the third) may be seeing a
shrink.</TE>
<TE>   Bergman Preparing to Direct TV Movie</TE>
<TE>   Ingmar Bergman, at 84, isn't resting on his laurels. Later this
month, he plans to start shooting a TV movie called "Sarabande"--a
project being billed as a sequel to his 1973 miniseries and feature
film "Scenes From a Marriage." The title refers to a slow, dignified
Spanish dance, Variety points out, hinting at the pace of the film.</TE>
<TE>   The project, created for Sweden's SVT broadcasting, reunites Liv
Ullmann and Erland Josephson in the lead roles--the first time that
the actress has starred in a Bergman film since "Autumn Sonata" in
1978.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Pia Ehrnvall says nothing has changed: Every camera angle
has been mapped out in advance--evidence of the director's famed
perfectionism.</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   From Radio Contest to Date at the Greek</TE>
<TE>   That "American Idol" sensibility is spreading. When Chicago--a
band with a 35-year heritage, two dozen albums and a long list of
hits--visits the Greek Theatre on Sept. 20, its opening act will be a
band with a far more modest resume: five years, two self-promoted
CDs, a lot of club dates and one contest victory.</TE>
<TE>   The band JND, a six-member outfit from San Luis Obispo, was
announced this week as the winners of an unsigned artists contest
staged by syndicated rock radio hosts Mark &amp; Brian. The group was
among six finalists forwarded to Chicago members, who named JND as
the most worthy opening act for the first night of their two-night
stand at the Greek. JND's jazz-minded members mix R&amp;B grooves and
some funk into their sound--and their horn section probably didn't
hurt their chances with Chicago, a band long known for its brass.</TE>
<TE>   RADIO</TE>
<TE>   KMZT Offers Daily Fill of the L.A. Phil</TE>
<TE>   Beginning Sunday, the Los Angeles Philharmonic will have a daily
presence on KMZT-FM (105.1).</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra Festival," showcasing the best
of the band's recorded performances, will air Sundays from noon to 2.
Every other day of the week at noon, the station will present "The
Masterpiece of the Day With the Los Angeles Philharmonic."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   The Tony Award-winning musical "Raisin," which hasn't been
professionally produced in L.A. since its national tour in 1977, will
open International City Theatre's 2003 season at the 349-seat Center
Theater in Long Beach, Feb. 7-March 9. It will be followed by a
revival of John Pielmeier's "Agnes of God," starring Linda Hamilton
and Michael Learned, April 25-May 18.... Garry Marshall, director of
such films as "Pretty Woman," "Runaway Bride" and "The Princess
Diaries," tells Variety he expects to direct an opera in L.A. during
the 2004-05 season, probably Jacques Offenbach's "The Grand Duchess
of Gerolstein." ... Whoopi Goldberg will return to Broadway next
season in a revival of August Wilson's "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"
the New York Post reports.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Note: Aspiring screenwriter Emily Polsby attended the Fade In
magazine pitch festival last month in West Hollywood. Here's what
happened:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "It's the story of my life, and our Lord Jesus Christ told me
DreamWorks was going to produce it," the fiftysomething woman in line
ahead of me said, her reflective American flag cap blinding me as she
leaned forward into my face. "Do you have a relationship with God?"</LD>
<TE>   We were waiting with 250 other people outside a hotel ballroom
filled with TV and movie professionals. We had each paid $345 for the
opportunity to pitch our script ideas for three minutes to the people
inside: agents, managers, producers and a handful of sought-after
development executives from studios.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors were rampant that past years' participants had sold scripts
on the spot for between $300,000 and $700,000, so the ambience was
what you would get if you sent out a notice that everyone who liked
money should show up at a certain hotel, just in case they had a
winning lottery ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "I like God," I ventured after some thought. At this point, I
hoped he really, really liked me too. I had spent more than two years
and five drafts on my romantic comedy about an aging basketball
player. I found myself coveting this woman's divine pipeline to
Steven Spielberg's studio.</TE>
<TE>   As the line snaked slowly forward, a pockmarked man with a shirt
buttoned up to his chin and a pocket full of pens emerged from the
ballroom, triumphant.</TE>
<TE>   "They loved my script!" he crowed to the rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   "What's it about?" I asked, glaring.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, this kid whose mother is just a pair of eyeballs and there
are lots of explosions and then the kid blows up and he's just a pair
of eyeballs too!"</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds great," I lied.</TE>
<TE>   I surveyed the crowd. Mostly white men between 25 and 40, like Mr.
Eyeballs. I turned to the crisply coiffed African American woman in
line behind me.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I were black," I told her sadly. "Everybody here looks the
same."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't make me laugh," she admonished me. "I'm lactating. And be
glad you're white. So are most of the executives. How easy do you
think it's going to be for me to sell my story about a homie who goes
back in time to before the Civil War? Not many people are open to the
idea that slavery can be funny."</TE>
<TE>   "Stop," I begged her. "You had me at 'I'm lactating.' " Her name
was Tanya, and she really was lactating.</TE>
<TE>   My turn came, and I stumbled into the room. It was filled with
card tables. At each table sat a big studio executive. The one at my
table looked about 25. "So my story is about a basketball player
who's trying to get his PhD."</TE>
<TE>   "Wait," said the 25-year-old big shot. "Is this a comedy?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," I admitted, "it is."</TE>
<TE>   "Then forget it," he replied. "I hate comedies. No one wants to
make a comedy."</TE>
<TE>   I wondered if anyone had told this guy that "Austin Powers in
Goldmember" was grossing almost $200 million right that minute, but I
smiled and pretended to take notes.</TE>
<TE>   "Comedy bad," I wrote in my notebook.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, comedies have no shelf life," he said, launching into a
complicated analysis of the video aftermarket.</TE>
<TE>   "So what kind of movies are you interested in making?" I
interrupted him as they were sounding the bell that my time was up.</TE>
<TE>   "Movies where they blow something up," he said. "Action."</TE>
<TE>   Back outside, I returned to the end of the line. A
leathery-looking man with the watery eyes of a longtime drug user
handed me a sheet of paper that said, "69 Reasons Not to Deal Drugs."</TE>
<TE>   "It's my life story," he told me. "I was a drug dealer for 30
years. Then the day I got out of prison, I got thrown from a
Greyhound bus and there was blood coming out of my penis."</TE>
<TE>   "I have to find my friend!" I said as I went to search for Tanya.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking I should blow all of my characters up," I told her.
"Apparently no one likes comedy."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't let it get you down," she said. "Most of the meetings I've
had, I don't even think they're listening to me. After I did my
pitch, one guy asked me, 'So, is your character black?' "</TE>
<TE>   A skinny man in a tropical hat turned to us with a wide smile.</TE>
<TE>   "My movie is a story about how the Nazis really won World War II!"</TE>
<TE>   "Is it your life story?" I asked, desperate to keep my own spirits
up.</TE>
<TE>   "What did I tell you about making me laugh?" Tanya warned me.</TE>
<TE>   My next meeting was with a midget. Or small person. Or whatever
the correct term is. She looked extremely unwell, and if I hadn't
been so thrown off by her size, I would have stopped pitching and
just asked her if she was OK. As it was, I was like a train with no
brakes. "And the basketball player gets in a fight with the coach
and...."</TE>
<TE>   The more I jabbered, the sicker she looked. Finally my time was
up. I shook her hand and dashed out the door.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't pitch the midget," I whispered to Tanya, who was right
outside. "I think she's...." At which point the little person pushed
past, her hand over her mouth, on her way, presumably, to throw up.</TE>
<TE>   My last meeting was with a thirtysomething man with adorable
floppy black hair and a lovely smile. I ditched the basketball script
and pitched a story about an autistic guy who hires a stranger to
have his child. When I was done he said, "I like it. Send me the
script."</TE>
<TE>   "Really?"</TE>
<TE>   "Really!" I rushed outside to tell Tanya. She high-fived me.</TE>
<TE>   I might not have won the lottery, but I was still a winner. Except
now I had to write the script about the autistic guy--which I am
still writing.</TE>
<TE>   "You go, girl!" Tanya said. "And the E! channel likes my TV show
idea."</TE>
<TE>   The day I got home from the event, mixed in with the e-mails that
said, "Epolsby, have you tried intestinal cleansing?" was a message
from Tanya. "Meeting you was the best part of the event for me," she
wrote.</TE>

<HD>California Arts Council Faces Big Cut in Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>California Arts Council officials say the state's new budget, sealed
Thursday with Gov. Gray Davis' signature, means their agency's
support for artists and arts organizations statewide will drop
roughly 40%--from $28 million last year to $16.4 million in the
2002-03 fiscal year.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, council officials said they don't expect to fill any
of the seven jobs opened through attrition during the last year and
will instead make do with their current 37 staffers.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a difficult time," said the council's Adam Gottlieb.</LD>
<TE>   However, the state's spending plan shelters the largest single
recipient of California Arts Council money, the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles, which for the last few years has been getting
$2 million in state money to support its "tools for tolerance"
education program. The Wiesenthal allocation, specifically set aside
by the governor and legislature, is exempt from the peer-review
requirements attached to most of the agency's organizational grants.</TE>
<TE>   At the 25-year-old Wiesenthal Center's headquarters, Executive
Director Rabbi Meyer May said the "tools for tolerance" program has
provided diversity training to more than 40,000 police officers and
30,000 educators over the last six years. May credited the governor
with protecting the program "because most people, reacting after
9/11, [realize] we need to have more diversity training, not less."</TE>
<TE>   The council's overall annual budget, which includes the money
granted to artists and arts organizations, staff salaries, other
operating expenses and the Wiesenthal Center's allocation, was $32
million in 2000-01. It was trimmed to closer to $30 million as the
state responded to the wavering economy in 2001-02. In the next year,
that figure will decrease to $20 million, with $16.4 million of that
earmarked for grants. Council officials say the governor's move
formalizes an agreement forged in early summer among legislators.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, the agency's efforts varied from the June
selection of UC San Diego professor Quincy Troupe as state poet
laureate (a post that includes a $10,000 honorarium) to the
earmarking of $127,334 each to the Center Theatre Group's Mark Taper
Forum in Los Angeles (for outreach programming, educational programs
and new play development) and the San Francisco Symphony (for free
outdoor concerts and school programs). Smaller grants included $2,426
to the Redwood Coast Writer's Center in Eureka for readings and
workshops and $11,600 to artist Bella Peralta for an 11-month
residency in Weaverville, where she enlisted at-risk teens to create
murals around Trinity County.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest challenge posed by this year's cuts, the council's
Gottlieb said, may be to sparsely populated counties like Trinity,
where arts groups get little or no underwriting from other government
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   In many respects, the 2002-03 budget marks the end of a winning
streak for the 26-year-old California Arts Council. Spurred by a
$6-million bump in 1998 as Gov. Pete Wilson's tenure as governor was
winding down and another $12-million bump in 2000 as the Davis
administration was setting up, the council's annual budget more than
doubled between 1997 and 2001, according to Gottlieb.</TE>

<HD>New Doctor for 'Strong Medicine'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Sunday, Patricia Richardson reports for duty as Col. Andy
Campbell, an Army doctor who segues to civilian life by replacing
Janine Turner's Dr. Dana Stowe on the Lifetime network series "Strong
Medicine" (9 p.m.).</LD>
<LD>   Turns out, running a chaotic medical clinic may not be so
different from running the chaotic Taylor household for eight seasons
on ABC's "Home Improvement." In the new show, as in the old one,
Richardson faces challenges with quiet strength, surpassing warmth
and an understated sense of humor.</LD>
<LD>   Now in its third season, "Strong Medicine" is driven by the
different approaches to medicine taken by the co-directors of a
Philadelphia women's clinic. Dr. Luisa Delgado (Rosa Blasi) is guided
by instinct and experience as she treats her mostly low-income
patients. Turner's Stowe--a high-powered research doctor--was a
by-the-numbers sort of gal.</LD>
<TE>   With Stowe having departed to raise two newly adopted daughters,
Delgado believes she will have a say in choosing her new partner.</TE>
<TE>   When her bosses make the decision without her, she takes an
instant dislike to Campbell and begins behaving like a 5-year-old as
she pokes fun of the former colonel's military bearing and crisp
speech by, for instance, calling her "Gen. Powell." In the midst of a
misunderstanding, Delgado even explodes with that childish standby,
"You are not the boss of me," in this episode written by series
creator Tammy Ader and Richard Alexander, and directed by John Perrin
Flynn.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's episode indicates that Richardson and Blasi will be a
zesty combination of oil and vinegar. In addition, the episode offers
a new entry point to the series. Those who haven't watched before
will be quickly brought up to speed as Richardson is familiarized
with her role at Rittenhouse Women's Health Center.</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11 Proved to Be Turning Point for the Predator</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: San Diego maker of the drone ramps up production
and works to develop an armed version.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a recent test that demonstrated a key advance in drone aircraft, a
remotely controlled Predator was able deploy a smaller unmanned
aircraft that carried sensors designed to detect chemical weapons.</LD>
<LD>   The Predator was flying at 10,000 feet when it released the second
plane. The smaller aircraft was able to fly for 25 minutes and take
air samples before returning to its home base--along with its mother
ship--at Edwards Air Force Base.</LD>
<LD>   The successful test buoyed prospects for the use of the unmanned
aerial vehicles in hostile countries such as Iraq where chemical
weapons are considered a likely threat. Both UAVs were controlled by
pilots using video monitors in a trailer miles away.</LD>
<TE>   The test also highlighted the utility of the Predator, which has
grabbed the attention of Pentagon strategists and reversed years of
criticism and indifference to development of pilotless aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   It was exactly a year ago--just days before the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks--that the Predator's developer stood at a desert airfield
watching one of his newest remotely controlled aircraft gently
gliding above as he wondered about the prospects for unmanned spy
planes.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from NASA and federal firefighting agencies were there
as well. The firefighters saw the possibility of using the
long-endurance aircraft to fly over wilderness areas in search of
wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   But the Predator's biggest potential customer was nowhere in
sight.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly a decade, Thomas P. Cassidy had been pushing the
Pentagon to use more remotely controlled planes.</TE>
<TE>   But critics harped on the dismal crash record of past UAVs and
fighter pilots snarled at the possibility of robotic planes taking
over their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Cassidy's firm, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. of San
Diego, had perfected a bigger and more powerful drone, but the
Pentagon seemed slow to respond.</TE>
<TE>   That all changed after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The Predator quickly became a common feature in news reports as it
hovered over Afghanistan and provided live video of Taliban and Al
Qaeda forces to intelligence personnel, some as far away as Florida.</TE>
<TE>   And it made aviation history when a Predator, jury-rigged with
Hellfire antitank missiles, attacked a Taliban convoy.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time a UAV had tracked, identified and then fired
on a target. It even hung around to assess the damage.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon hopes that one day the Predator's recent feat of
launching a smaller unmanned plane will become a common battlefield
occurrence.</TE>
<TE>   Because the mini-aircraft is expendable, it can be flown over
hostile regions or through areas where hazardous conditions such as
deadly chemical weapons are suspected.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the Predator can hover for more than 24 hours in a
particular area and launch the mini-planes at a moment's notice.</TE>
<TE>   With an eye toward using the technology if a conflict occurs in
Iraq, the military is pushing development of a miniature UAV with
sensors that can collect air samples, analyze them and relay the
findings to troops on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its unusual feats, Predator's near-celebrity status
among aviation buffs has grown thanks in part to President Bush, who
cited the aircraft as one of the more important U.S. weapons used in
Afghanistan and a key example of the military's transformation. Bush
became a fan of the aircraft after watching a video of a military
operation that was transmitted live from Afghanistan to the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 had a very dramatic impact" on increasing interest in
the plane, Cassidy said. "It got an awful lot of visibility both with
Congress and the Pentagon. All of a sudden we were bombarded with how
many can we make a month and how quickly we can increase
[manufacturing] capacity."</TE>
<TE>   Within months, the production rate doubled and hundreds of new
employees had to be hired. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems'
factory quickly ran out of space, prompting it to begin looking for
more.</TE>
<TE>   Cassidy no longer needed to fly to Washington to pitch the
Predator to the Pentagon brass. They were coming to him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been hectic," Cassidy said, noting that the Defense
Department has been asking the company to step up development of new
uses for their UAV. For instance, the new and larger Predator B
version is being outfitted to carry two Hellfire missiles and has
been renamed Hunter-Killer.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it now is quick reaction work," Cassidy said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Pentagon weapon developers tested a new antitank
weapon that could be launched by a Predator. Unlike the Hellfire, the
new weapon uses acoustic and infrared sensors to detect, follow and
then destroy moving tanks.</TE>
<TE>   The worldwide attention to pilotless planes represents a
vindication for Cassidy, a former Navy admiral, and six engineers who
formed General Atomics Aeronautical Systems in 1992 and toiled for
nearly a decade pushing a technology that to many critics seemed more
Buck Rogers than reality.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the war, the Predator had skeptics, because it did not fit
the old ways," Bush said a few months into Operation Enduring Freedom
in Afghanistan. "Now, it is clear the military does not have enough
unmanned vehicles."</TE>
<TE>   To some, having a tragic event improve their fortunes may seem
bittersweet, but Cassidy said he is proud that his UAVs are being
used to fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "People were asking, 'What are we going to do about Sept. 11?' "
Cassidy said. "These airplanes are helping us do something about it."</TE>

<HD>Jobless Rate Drops Unexpectedly</HD>
<DH>Economy: The decline to 5.7% in August heartens investors.
But experts say U.S. payrolls are not growing enough to prevent
rising unemployment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to 5.7% in August as
health-care companies, building contractors, temporary-help agencies
and the government expanded their payrolls, the Labor Department
reported Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The decline from July's 5.9% rate and the net increase of 39,000
jobs during the month heartened investors, who had been expecting a
jump in joblessness.</LD>
<LD>   But the latest numbers suggested anew that the economy is headed
for another "jobless" recovery like that of the early 1990s, when it
took more than two years for employment to improve after the
recession was over.</LD>
<TE>   "There's nothing more important to the economy than job growth,
and August was not very encouraging on that front," Los Angeles
economist Donald H. Straszheim said. "The blunt reality is we need
faster job growth."</TE>
<TE>   The most immediate effect of the August numbers may be to dampen
fears of renewed recession. Analysts have been confused by recent
statistics that show U.S. manufacturing stumbling after a brief
recovery even as American consumers continue buying. But most agree
the economy can weather most difficulties as long as employment holds
up.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve probably will react to the new figures by
leaving its signal-sending, short-term interest rate at a low 1.75%,
rather than cutting the rate further as some economists and
investment managers have asked. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan may
signal the central bank's intentions when he testifies before
Congress Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks rallied Friday on news of the unexpected drop in
joblessness. The Dow Jones industrial aver- age rose 143.50 points,
or 1.7%, to close at 8,427.20, while the technology-laden Nasdaq
composite index jumped 44.30, or 3.5%, to 1,295.30.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the major market measures lost ground for the week, and
stocks appear headed for a third straight year of declines, their
longest losing streak since the three-year period ended in 1941.</TE>
<TE>   Key bond prices fell, raising their market interest rates from
near four-decade lows earlier in the week.</TE>
<TE>   Economic optimists found more to crow about in the new numbers
than just the decline in the jobless rate.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the August job gains, the Labor Department revised its
July figures to show a 67,000-position jump in employment, rather
than its previous estimate of just 6,000.</TE>
<TE>   Service sector employment in August rose by 100,000, aided by the
addition of 26,000 health-care workers and 51,000 temporary workers.
The temporary hiring represented a turnaround from July's loss of
30,000 jobs and was part of a comeback for an industry that bore much
of the brunt of last year's recession.</TE>
<TE>   The construction industry added 34,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, analysts pointed to a small increase in the average
work week for production and nonsupervisory workers--who account for
more than two-thirds of the nation's 140 workers--as a sign that the
economy is on the mend. They found further evidence in a 4-cent, or
0.6%, bump in average hourly earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's weak, but it's healing," said Steven Wieting, an economist
with Salomon Smith Barney in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The new jobs numbers can only be considered good news against the
bleak backdrop of what had been expected. Before Friday's report,
most economists had predicted the unemployment rate would rise to 6%
in August and 6.5% later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The economy is thought to have emerged from recession last fall
and has been growing for three straight quarters. However, companies
have remained exceedingly cautious about resuming hiring.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. employers hired more than 200,000 new workers a month in the
late '90s and in the first years of the new decade but have been
taking on an average of 25,000 a month for the last six months.
Analysts say the country needs to add 100,000 to 150,000 a month to
prevent rising unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   To the surprise of many, U.S. manufacturers, which had been
thought to be on the mend, shed an additional 68,000 jobs in August.
Overall, the number of private-sector workers slipped by 2,000. The
monthly jobs total rose only because governments at all levels added
41,000 workers, many of them airport security officers.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all of the decline in the August unemployment rate was
accounted for by a sharp drop in joblessness among adult women, whose
unemployment rate fell to 4.9% from 5.2% in July. The adult male rate
was unchanged at 5.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Among blacks, unemployment fell to 9.6% in August from 9.9% in
July. Among Latinos, it slipped to 7.5% from 7.6%. The jobless rate
among whites declined to 5.1% from 5.3%.</TE>

<HD>American Drivers Racing to Flex Their Muscles Again</HD>
<DH>Detroit is joining foreign rivals in fueling the need for
speed</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The thunder is getting louder.</LD>
<LD>   America is on an automotive performance binge, with the engines
getting bigger and bigger, and the cars and trucks punching out ever
more power.</LD>
<LD>   "There has been kind of a rebirth of performance but in a much
more sophisticated way than in the '60s," said Jim Wangers, an
automotive consultant in Vista, Calif., and the head of marketing for
the father of all muscle cars, the Pontiac GTO, when it came out in
1964.</LD>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. announced this week that it formed a new unit, the
Ford Performance Group, to develop more powerful versions of Ford,
Lincoln and Mercury models.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division unveiled
its high-performance line, the V-Series; in June, GM had announced a
new performance division.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Europeans, Porsche this year has the all-new 911 GT2, at
456 horsepower the fastest Porsche on the market; Lamborghini has
just come out with the 571-horsepower Murcielago; and the new Ferrari
Enzo tips the scales at about 680 horsepower. There's even a
turbocharged New Beetle from Volkswagen.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental concerns are essentially nonexistent. With gasoline
relatively cheap, and many of the performance cars getting
respectable mileage, buyers aren't burdened by such civic
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   The race to pour on the horses is primarily in the luxury segment,
with the more established performance units--the AMG line of
DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes-Benz, BMW's M-Series and the S-Series from
VW's Audi division--being challenged by new and upcoming entries from
Ford's Jaguar and Lincoln brands and Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus.</TE>
<TE>   These brands attract more educated, affluent buyers who look for
more than raw horsepower and torque, a measure of acceleration and
towing ability. Such owners tend to be fairly knowledgeable--and
enthusiastic--about their cars and become, in effect, walking
billboards for the brand.</TE>
<TE>   "If you stop a BMW M3 owner and ask him about his car, he'll talk
for half an hour," said Wes Brown of the automotive consultancy
Nextrend in Thousand Oaks. "So as a manufacturer, by having these
types of vehicles out there, you get publicity without having to pay
for it."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Kiddoo, a computer consultant from Northridge, is that kind of
enthusiasm personified. He grew up rebuilding cars in his garage and
today owns a 1998 BMW M Roadster and a 2001 M5, both black.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the cornering and the handling, and I consider these cars
works of art," said Kiddoo, 42. "The braking is fantastic; the
steering is light and quicker. The M5 sedan has nothing but luxury
but does zero to 60 in 4.8 seconds. And the M Roadster has all the
perfect roadster aspects: You hear the engine, feel the road, but
with all the creature comforts of a BMW."</TE>
<TE>   He also likes the subtle external design features that to a novice
may look no different from those of a standard BMW.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to stand out massively from the crowd by driving
something that looks strange," Kiddoo said. "The M cars allow me to
drive something that a lot of people relate to, but a performance
edition of it. I can pull into any parking lot and the general
populace doesn't notice--but the parking attendants sure do."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not just the luxury and exotic brands that are tweaking
their lineups for greater performance. More and more mainstream
brands are adding engine displacement, spoilers, larger tires, better
seats and finely tuned suspension to beef up their cars' handling and
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   In the heyday of the muscle car, auto makers routinely dropped the
biggest engines they could fit into existing cars, resulting in such
creations as the Plymouth Roadrunner or Ford Torino Talladega and
muscle-bound versions of the Chevy Nova and Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the muscle cars of the '70s were just engines," analyst
Brown said. "They were the same as the rest of the cars, and suddenly
did zero to 60 in five seconds. But go around a corner and the car
couldn't handle it."</TE>
<TE>   Today's jazzed-up models are far more sophisticated, even at the
more affordable end, often sporting bigger brakes, stability control
and sometimes all-wheel drive.</TE>
<TE>   The appeal to mainstream non-luxury brands is to attract a more
educated, wealthier and hip consumer who might not otherwise give the
brand a second thought.</TE>
<TE>   Ford has made inroads with the performance version of the Focus,
which has 170 horsepower, compared with 110 to 130 horsepower for
standard models.</TE>
<TE>   So have Japanese makers, such as Honda Motor Co. with the Civic
Si, whose engine is bumped to 160 horsepower from the stock 115.
Nissan Motor Co.'s Sentra SE-R with 175 horses is only 10 more than
the standard Sentra but has a sturdier suspension and transmission
and bigger tires and wheels. Subaru, made by Fuji Heavy Industries
Ltd., has the WRX, a version of the Impreza based on the racer that
has won World Rally Championships.</TE>
<TE>   "Buyers are 30-to 35-year-olds with an $80,000 income, well-
educated males," Brown said. "Look at the regular Impreza and the
demographics don't even come close. Buyers know it won the World
Rally and they play PlayStation World Rally games, and you get
waiting lists for the car."</TE>
<TE>   Turning usually meek Asian imports into tire-melting rockets, as
seen in the recent street-racing movie "The Fast and the Furious,"
started more than a decade ago in Southern California and has spread
throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota, which has had a Toyota Racing Development subsidiary in
Tustin for years, started churning out performance parts last year
including superchargers for its V-6 and V-8 engines.</TE>
<TE>   Honda reintroduced the Civic Si for 2002, and the company's Acura
division produces the RSX Type S, which has 200 horsepower, compared
with 160 in the regular RSX.</TE>
<TE>   Ford-controlled Mazda always has marketed itself as the sporty
Japanese car company. This month, it is set to begin Mazdaspeed, its
performance line, which will sell complete cars or parts and
accessories at designated dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Big Three are catching on.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Chrysler said it was establishing its Performance
Vehicle Operations for its specialty and racing cars and trucks.
Dodge will get SRT versions of most of its models, starting with the
500-horsepower Viper SRT-10 going on sale next month.</TE>
<TE>   In June, GM announced its GM Performance Division. Ford already
had its SVT division--for Special Vehicle Team--which develops such
versions as the SVT Focus, SVT Mustang Cobra and the SVT Lightning, a
380-horsepower edition of the F-150 pickup truck, which has 220
horsepower in its base V-8 model.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's move Wednesday puts the SVT division into the Ford
Performance Group with operations including aftermarket performance
parts and sales.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the auto maker won't say what models will get performance
versions, but executives say privately that the Lincoln LS sedan and
a resurrected version of the now-canceled Mercury Cougar coupe would
be prime candidates.</TE>

<HD>Genentech Wins Suit Over Rights to Cancer Drug</HD>
<DH>Courts: A jury decides that Chiron's patent was invalid,
quashing its hopes for millions in royalties from the sales of
Herceptin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Genentech Inc. prevailed over Chiron Corp. on Friday in a patent
dispute concerning rights to one of Genentech's best-selling
medicines, the breast cancer drug Herceptin.</LD>
<LD>   A federal court jury in Sacramento ruled that Chiron's patent on
breast cancer antibodies was invalid, a blow to the Emeryville,
Calif.-based firm. Chiron had been seeking as much as $300 million in
royalties from Genentech.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous verdict by the 10-member panel gives Genentech an
important victory at a time when its business practices have come
under scrutiny. Genentech is appealing a $500-million judgment
against it by a Los Angeles County jury that found it cheated City of
Hope National Medical Center out of royalties.</LD>
<TE>   The verdict also protects Genentech's monopoly in antibody drugs
that target a breast cancer protein called Her-2, which plays a role
in tumor growth.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute between the companies arose from a race during the
1980s to find the molecular cause of breast cancer. Chiron, in its
suit, claimed that in 1984, two scientists at Cetus Corp. developed a
mouse antibody that targeted the human breast cancer protein. Chiron
acquired Cetus in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Chiron didn't develop a drug based on the Cetus invention but
pursued a patent for it. The patent was issued in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech argued, and the jury agreed, that Chiron's patent was
not valid. The South San Francisco-based firm said the Chiron patent
was not useful or well described, two important tests. It said Chiron
invented a mouse antibody that, if used in people, would be destroyed
by the immune system before it could attack a cancer cell.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech also argued that Chiron did not mention Her-2 by name in
its patent application until 1995, 11 years after it was filed. By
that time, Genentech scientists had published a paper describing
Her-2.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech also asserted that it makes Herceptin by a different
process than the one outlined in the Chiron patent. The Herceptin
antibody is part human, part mouse.</TE>
<TE>   Chiron says it continues to believe its patent is valid and will
pursue "multiple courses of action" to overturn the verdict,
including an appeal, if necessary. On Friday, the company asked U.S.
District Judge William B. Shubb to set aside the jury verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Chiron said it will continue to pursue a second patent
infringement lawsuit against Genentech over Herceptin. That suit
involves a 1998 patent on the same antibody invention. It is
scheduled for trial next year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Sean Johnston, Genentech vice president for
intellectual property, said the company will continue its challenge
to Chiron's patent already underway at the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. In that dispute, Genentech claims that two scientists at the
University of Pennsylvania are the actual inventors of human breast
cancer antibodies. Genentech has an exclusive license on the
university's intellectual property.</TE>
<TE>   When it launched in 1998, Herceptin was hailed as an important
breakthrough in breast cancer treatment. It has posted total sales of
about $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Chiron shares rose 96 cents to $36.63 on Nasdaq, and Genentech
climbed 30 cents to $31.70 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>SEC Chief Acts to End Snag Over Arbitration</HD>
<DH>Securities: The NYSE and the NASD are told to resume
hearings involving 500 investors despite objections to a California
ethics law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's securities arbitration standoff--a two-month dispute
that has more than 500 disgruntled investors waiting for a
hearing--may be nearing an end as a result of action by Securities
and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt.</LD>
<LD>   Pitt sent a letter Thursday to both the New York Stock Exchange
and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers that said their
unhappiness with a new law governing securities arbitration cases in
California was insufficient justification for their refusal to
schedule arbitration hearings.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of the NYSE and the NASD said Friday that they
would work with the SEC to help California investors resolve their
securities disputes. But they stopped short of saying they would do
so by resuming the scheduling of arbitration hearings.</LD>
<TE>   "We will, of course, comply with the chairman's request," NYSE
spokesman Ray Pellecchia said. "We will work closely with the SEC to
ensure that the best and most appropriate steps are taken to achieve
that goal."</TE>
<TE>   Both the NYSE and the NASD, which operate national arbitration
programs to resolve disputes between investors and their brokers,
have refused to schedule new hearings since July 1, when the new
California law went into effect.</TE>
<TE>   About 500 cases have been put on hold as a result--450 filed with
the NASD, by its count, and 50 with the NYSE, the exchange says.</TE>
<TE>   The California law, aimed at averting conflicts of interest in
settling securities disputes, bars arbitrators from taking gifts or
speaking fees from the brokerages whose disputes they arbitrated.</TE>
<TE>   Arbitrators also are barred from discussing employment with a
party to a dispute while in the midst of an arbitration case.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal of the new ethics standards is to promote public
confidence in the private arbitration system by assuring parties in
the system that their appointed arbitrator is going to be as fair and
as impartial as a public judge," said Gene Wong, chief counsel for
the California Senate's Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   However, representatives of the NASD described new disclosure
rules that are part of the law as time-consuming and costly. The
agency and the NYSE also object to the law because they believe it
could allow individuals and firms to draw out proceedings
indefinitely, defeating the purpose of arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE and the NASD have jointly filed suit in San Francisco
asking to be exempted from the California law. That case is set for
its first hearing Sept. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Prompted by California legislators who charged that the NYSE and
the NASD were retaliating against the state by refusing to schedule
hearings, Pitt demanded in his letter that they "immediately either
provide investors with available arbitration panels in California, or
take other steps to ensure that California investors have available
to them convenient and expeditious resolution of disputes."</TE>
<TE>   Since the standoff started, the NASD has been referring California
cases to arbitrators in Nevada and other states.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller cases that can be handled through paper pleadings also
have been able to proceed, simply by being sent out of state, NASD
representatives said. In addition, the agency has encouraged parties
to mediate cases and has waived its administrative fees.</TE>

<HD>Retired GE Chief Lives Lavishly on Firm's Dime</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Welch, who retired as chief executive of General Electric Co.
last year, is still living large on the company's dime, enjoying
freebies such as country club memberships and tickets to New York
Knicks basketball games, according to a court filing by his wife in
their divorce case.</LD>
<LD>   The exhaustive catalog of expenses GE covers for Welch represents
another example of corporate largess and is likely to fuel investor
outrage about lush pay packages for top executives.</LD>
<LD>   The papers also disclosed perks that were showered on Welch and
his wife by GE during their 13-year marriage. GE pitched in more than
$7.5 million of the $32.5 million the couple spent on houses and
furnishings, according to the papers filed by Jane Beasley Welch in
Bridgeport, Conn., and first reported in the New York Times.</LD>
<TE>   GE and Welch defended the arrangement Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "GE prospered during this transition period," Welch said. "During
my full tenure, GE's market capitalization increased by about $400
billion, with shareowners, including myself, our employees, retirees
and the like, benefiting greatly from that increase."</TE>
<TE>   GE said the company has complied with all disclosure requirements
and that Welch's benefits have been public for years.</TE>
<TE>   The company said in its proxy statement in 2001 that after Welch's
retirement it would provide him with "continued lifetime access to
company facilities and services comparable to those which are
currently made available to him by the company."</TE>
<TE>   Welch has remained a consultant to the company.</TE>
<TE>   Welch, who earned about $16.1 million in salary and bonuses from
GE last year, according to regulatory filings, will continue to have
free access to the corporate jet. This perk alone could be worth $3.7
million a year, analysis by an aviation consulting group hired by
Welch's wife shows.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the company provides Welch with an apartment adjacent
to New York's Central Park that the court papers value at $80,000 a
month. GE helps furnish the apartment, gives him GE appliances and
pays for routine expenses such as groceries, toiletries and postage.
The papers did not give a dollar amount for these items.</TE>
<TE>   When Welch travels, the company picks up the tab for limos and
also pays for country club memberships including one at Augusta
National, the exclusive club that is home to the Masters golf
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The Welches separated earlier this year after public disclosures
that he was having an affair with Suzy Wetlaufer, editor of the
Harvard Business Review, who left her job in April.</TE>
<TE>   Welch has been providing his wife $35,000 a month, an amount she
accepts "under protest," according to the filing.</TE>
<TE>   "Such funds are patently inadequate to maintain the marital
standard of living," the filing reads.</TE>
<TE>   Executive compensation has become a hot topic. Dennis Kozlowski,
the former CEO of conglomerate Tyco International Ltd. who has been
indicted in New York for alleged sales tax avoidance, received $135
million in company loans to fund a lavish lifestyle, according to
published reports.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Heymann, a GE analyst with Prudential Securities in New
York, said the generous arrangement with Welch is unusual, but his
tenure was unusually successful.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, you don't keep all of the toys when you retire,"
Heymann said. "Given what he did, it's not way out of control."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of GE stock were up 30 cents, closing at $28.30 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup, FTC May Be Near Deal</HD>
<DH>Finance: The company says it is 'in advanced discussions'
over allegations of sub-prime abuses, a possible barrier to its
merger plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Addressing a potential barrier to Citigroup Inc.'s takeover of Golden
State Bancorp, Citigroup's top executive said Friday that the banking
giant was "in advanced discussions" on settling a Federal Trade
Commission lawsuit alleging sub-prime lending abuses.</LD>
<LD>   FTC officials have insisted on a settlement worth hundreds of
millions of dollars, topping the agency's previous record in a
predatory lending case set in March when Irvine lender First Alliance
Corp. settled charges it cheated 18,000 home-equity borrowers. That
settlement, up for final court approval next week, would yield $75
million for the borrowers, FTC attorney Anne M. McCormick said.</LD>
<LD>   The FTC charges stem from practices at Associates First Capital
Corp., once the nation's largest sub-prime lender, which Citigroup
acquired two years ago for $27 billion and merged with its own
Citifinancial sub-prime unit.</LD>
<TE>   The FTC contends the lender abused customers--mainly people with
spotty or limited credit histories--by misleading them about
high-interest debt-consolidation loans, charging unreasonably high
fees, pushing costly mortgage insurance and using harassing
collection tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups and some public officials have raised questions
about Citigroup's practices with banking regulators, who must approve
its planned acquisition of San Francisco-based Golden State, the
parent company of California Federal Bank and First Nationwide
Mortgage Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter last week, California Treasurer Phil Angelides urged
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to require the New York
company "to make a significant and real commitment to all California
neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Citing concerns over "the appropriateness of Citifinancial's
sub-prime lending," Angelides said that "well-respected community
organizations" were complaining that Citigroup markets its best loans
only to higher-income customers.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup spokeswoman Christina Pretto said the company has
striven to clean up its sub-prime business and has committed $120
billion in loans and investments over 10 years to minority and
lower-income customers in California and Nevada. Pretto said the
Golden State transaction is "on track to close as planned" in the
final quarter of this year.</TE>
<TE>   At a presentation for analysts and investors Friday in New York,
Citigroup Chief Executive Sanford I. Weill said the company was "in
advanced discussions on settling" the FTC suit. Citigroup and FTC
officials declined to describe the settlement under discussion. The
Wall Street Journal, which first reported the development, said
Citigroup will pay about $200 million to settle the FTC suit.</TE>
<TE>   Weill also described Citigroup's efforts to clean up its sub-prime
business, which include:</TE>
<TE>   * Discontinuing single-premium credit insurance on real estate
loans, in which a single large payment added to the mortgage provides
assurance the loan will be paid if the borrower dies or is disabled.
The insurance typically expires after five years even if the loan
isn't paid off.</TE>
<TE>   * Severing relationships with 5,000 brokers who had referred
customers to Associates First Capital but didn't meet Citigroup's
professional and ethical standards.</TE>
<TE>   * Reducing rates on 200,000 sub-prime loans and "referring up"
more than $47 million in loans to programs with better terms.</TE>
<TE>   Weill discussed the firm's sub-prime lending while making a
wide-ranging defense of the numerous thorny issues facing his
company. They include allegations of analyst conflicts of interest at
Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit and improprieties in allocating
shares of initial public offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup's liability for lawsuits over its role in high-profile
corporate failures such as Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. may be as
high as $10 billion, Prudential Securities analyst Michael Mayo
estimated this week.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup shares rose 98 cents to $30.28 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Despite a recent rally, the shares have fallen about 44%
since peaking on Aug. 28, 2000, compared with a 13% decline by the
Philadelphia/KBW index of the 24 largest U.S. banks and thrifts.</TE>

<HD>FDA Moves to Speed Biotech Drug OKs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration announced internal changes Friday
that had been sought by the pharmaceutical industry to speed approval
of biotechnology drugs.</LD>
<LD>   The agency said that beginning next year, the Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research would review approval applications for
biotechnology drugs, a job now performed by the Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research. An agency spokeswoman said the shift was
being made to "improve efficiencies" in the drug approval process.</LD>
<LD>   The Biotechnology Industry Organization, the lobbying arm of the
industry, hailed the move. It said that last year the agency took
eight months longer to approve biotechnology drugs than it took to
approve other types of medications. Biotechnology drugs are produced
in living organisms, such as bacteria or yeast, and typically are
administered by injection.</LD>
<TE>   The industry has complained about inconsistencies in the review
process for biotechnology drugs. The agency's handling of ImClone
Systems Inc.'s experimental cancer drug Erbitux drew scrutiny during
congressional hearings that focused on alleged insider trading by the
company's former chief executive, Samuel D. Waksal.</TE>
<TE>   Carl B. Feldbaum, president of the biotechnology organization,
said the center that will be taking on biotechnology drugs has a
reputation for working closely with companies to avoid delays.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel this is a welcome development," Feldbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   However, some analysts questioned whether the switch would result
in faster approvals for the drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Mooney, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners, said in a
research note that many drugs handled by the Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research don't require long reviews because they are
"me-too" versions of existing medications. Many of these drugs are
chemical formulations that are taken orally, such as anti-cholesterol
pills.</TE>
<TE>   Biotechnology drugs, Mooney said, tend to be novel and more
complex, such as Amgen Inc.'s product Epogen, which is a genetic copy
of the human protein that spurs the production of red blood cells. It
is manufactured in mammalian cells.</TE>
<TE>   "It always raises a red flag when the industry claims their new
product approvals are too slow," said Larry Sasich, a pharmacist with
the consumer group Public Citizen. "Are they slow because their
submissions are sloppy and the FDA is asking them to get the
applications together?"</TE>

<HD>Upbeat Jobs Data Help Lift Stocks</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The relief rally comes amid persistent worries
about the economy, corporate profits and Iraq. The bond market cools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks surged Friday, ending a choppy week on a positive note, after
upbeat jobs data soothed investor jitters about the weak economy.</LD>
<LD>   But Wall Street pros viewed the rally as mostly a sigh of relief
that things weren't looking worse amid persistent worries about the
economy and corporate profits, as well as geopolitical concerns.</LD>
<LD>   "Every time there's a little bit of positive economic news, the
market pops, and every time you get a little bit of negative news,
the market takes a hit," said Michael Vogelzang, president of Boston
Advisors Inc. "I guess that's what happens when there are no profits
to speak of."</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index climbed 44.30 points, or 3.5%, to
1,295.30, recouping almost all of the loss it took Thursday, when it
closed at its lowest level in a month. Chip maker Intel led the
advance, gaining $1.11 to $16.22 after trimming its quarterly revenue
forecast Thursday by less than many investors had feared.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 143.50 points, or 1.7%, to
8,427.20, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rallied 14.77 points,
or 1.7%, to 893.92.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by 8 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange and by
more than 2 to 1 on Nasdaq. Trading was light.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Friday's rally, the major indexes finished lower for the
holiday-shortened trading week, notching their second straight weekly
decline. For the week, the Dow was down 2.7%, the S&amp;P 500 2.4% and
Nasdaq 1.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Wall Street faces several challenges in the coming
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Worries are mounting about the possibility of a U.S. military
attack on Iraq, and the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks that
devastated Wall Street looms next week.</TE>
<TE>   Questions still swirl around the health of the economy and
corporate profits. Crude oil prices near $30 a barrel, although good
for producers and other energy companies, could raise costs for
consumers and corporate America and hinder the economy's comeback.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think the general tone of the market is to be cautious,"
said James Park, senior equity trader at Brean Murray &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   But for the moment, Wall Street basked in the glow of Friday's
jobs report. The government said the nation's unemployment rate eased
to a five-month low of 5.7% in August, while payrolls grew more than
expected, suggesting that the economy is crawling forward. The news
calmed fears that the fragile U.S. economy could slip back into
recession.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's numbers were a nice positive, and combine that with a
mid-quarter update from Intel that was not as bad as expected, and
you get a relief rally," said Joe Seminara, head of trading at
Dreyfus Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The news cooled the red-hot Treasury bond market, where yields
have plunged in recent weeks as hopes for a strong economic recovery
faded. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to
4.01%, from 3.93% on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In commodities trading in New York, oil rose 63 cents to $29.61 a
barrel and gold climbed $1.70 to $319.90 an ounce on growing fears of
a U.S. strike against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Friday:</TE>
<TE>   * Intel helped spark a rally in other chip and chip equipment
stocks. The SOX semiconductor index rose nearly 5%. Applied
Materials, the leading maker of chip production equipment, rose 87
cents to $12.94. Chip gear maker KLA-Tencor jumped $2.08 to $32.04.
Other technology giants followed the upward trend. Hewlett-Packard
rose 65 cents to $13.50, and Microsoft jumped $1.91 to $47.82.</TE>
<TE>   * Exxon Mobil gained 54 cents to $34.31 as rising oil prices
boosted energy stocks. Oil field service giant Schlumberger gained
$1.61 to $42.24, and the Amex oil index was up nearly 2%.</TE>
<TE>   * Retailers recovered from a beating Thursday. Circuit City Group,
the No. 2 consumer electronics chain, rose $1.44 to $15.69 after it
reported that quarterly sales rose 10% at stores open at least a
year. Rival and industry leader Best Buy surged $2 to $24.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug maker Pfizer fell $1.18 to $30.75 and topped the Big
Board's most-active list. The company said it would delay seeking
regulatory approval for its new epilepsy and anxiety drug while it
completes studies relating to its safety.</TE>

<HD>Loan Forgiven for Ex-Exec of Microsoft</HD>
<DH>Compensation: Firm reveals that its former president will
not have to repay $15 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DINA BASS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>REDMOND, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp., the world's largest software maker, forgave a loan
of $15 million plus interest to former President Rick Belluzzo after
he quit in May, according to a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft lent the money as an advance on the value of 3.5 million
stock options that Belluzzo received in 1999 and 2000, the filing
shows. Belluzzo hadn't repaid any of the loan, said Caroline Boren, a
Microsoft spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   Investors have criticized corporate loans to executives, partly
because the debts sometimes aren't repaid. President Bush, in his
July proposal to improve corporate accountability after the collapses
at Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc., said corporate compensation
committees must not let officers take loans from their companies.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom provided more than $400 million in loans to Bernard J.
Ebbers when he was CEO. The money will be repaid over five years
under an amended agreement reached after Ebbers' resignation in
April.</TE>
<TE>   Forgiven loans to executives "are always something you should dig
into," said David Brady, who manages the $900-million Stein Roe Young
Investor Fund, which holds 600,000 Microsoft shares.</TE>
<TE>   Belluzzo, now chief executive of computer data-storage device
maker Quantum Corp., couldn't be reached for comment. A Quantum
spokeswoman didn't return a call for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Microsoft rose $1.91 to $47.82 on Nasdaq. The stock has
declined 28% this year.</TE>
<TE>   In return for the loan forgiveness, Belluzzo agreed to the
cancellation of the 3.5 million shares in options grants made in 1999
and 2000. Those options are priced higher than the current market
price, and so aren't exercisable, after a 31% drop in Microsoft stock
since the end of 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Belluzzo stepped down May 1 after less than three years at
Microsoft and one year as president. He left in a reorganization
after he failed to turn around products including software for
televisions and wireless phones.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection July 21.
Subsequently, the government sued the company for alleged fraud after
it admitted misreporting $7.2 billion in expenses.</TE>

<HD>NextCard Reveals SEC Investigation</HD>
<DH>Probe: The failed Web-based credit card issuer, which is
being overseen by banking regulators, also says its chief executive
resigned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LIEDTKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Failed online credit card issuer NextCard Inc. disclosed Friday that
federal securities regulators are investigating the company's
downfall, which could cost a taxpayer-backed insurance fund as much
as $400 million.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company also said that its chief
executive, John Hashman, resigned earlier this week. Hashman oversaw
NextCard's rise and fall as the Internet's biggest credit card
issuer.</LD>
<LD>   After distributing more than 1 million credit cards, NextCard last
year sank in a morass of bad loans that prompted banking regulators
to seize control of the operations.</LD>
<TE>   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has estimated that the failure
of NextCard's credit card business will result in a loss of $300
million to $400 million.</TE>
<TE>   In a government filing Friday, NextCard didn't provide any
specifics about the Securities and Exchange Commission's probe. The
SEC's San Francisco office declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Federal banking regulators opened investigations into NextCard's
failure seven months ago. In May, the FDIC notified NextCard that it
might take legal action against several unnamed company executives
and directors.</TE>
<TE>   A shareholder suit filed in Delaware late last year alleges that
NextCard insiders illegally sold stock to lock in profit before the
company's credit card portfolio imploded.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other Internet companies, NextCard's stock once was a
hot commodity on Wall Street. The company's shares peaked at $53.12
in late 1999. The Nasdaq Stock Market delisted the shares six months
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Before the company's shares crashed, NextCard's five highest-paid
executives made $29.2 million by cashing in a combined 1.47 million
stock options in 1999 and 2000, according to SEC filings.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy J. Coltrell, formerly NextCard's chief operating officer,
sold 715,499 options for $14.5 million in 1999 and 2000. Hashman
pocketed $3.6 million by selling 305,000 stock options in 1999 and
2000.</TE>
<TE>   NextCard helped its executives pay for their tax and stock
brokerage expenses by giving them loans at an 8% interest rate,
according to SEC records. As of June 2002, the company said, all the
insider loans had been repaid except $120,000 owed by Hashman.</TE>
<TE>   The company's demise led to more than 800 NextCard workers losing
their jobs and about 800,000 NextCard customers losing their credit
cards after federal regulators could not find a buyer for the
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   NextCard continues to run a skeletal operation as its remaining
management team contemplates a bankruptcy filing.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. sued AIG Life Insurance Co. and Hartford Life
Insurance Co., blaming the insurers for the loss of deductions that
cost the retailer more than $150 million after Congress revised tax
laws.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest retailer said in a lawsuit filed in Delaware
Chancery Court that it relied on the insurers' recommendations and
assurances when it bought more than $1.3 billion in life insurance
policies between December 1993 and July 1995. The companies marketed
the policies as a "low-risk means of gathering annual positive cash
flow," the suit said.</LD>
<LD>   AIG spokesman Joe Norton declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Representatives for Hartford Life couldn't be reached for comment.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The founder and then-chief executive of HealthSouth sold about $25
million worth of stock--half his stake in the company--a few weeks
before the rehabilitation giant warned of lower earnings and
announced his resignation as chief executive, sending the shares
tumbling.</LD>
<LD>   HealthSouth is the nation's biggest chain of rehabilitation
hospitals, with $4.3 billion in revenue last year.</LD>
<LD>   Lawsuits filed against Richard Scrushy and HealthSouth executives
question the timing of the insider stock sale and allege that
information was kept from shareholders, who lost about $2.7 billion
in value in the initial price plunge. HealthSouth shares dipped 8
cents to $5.30 on the NYSE.</LD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In response to harsh criticism from business travelers, US Airways
Group Inc. said it is backtracking on plans to trim services it
offers to customers with nonrefundable tickets.</LD>
<LD>   Arlington, Va.-based US Airways, the sixth-largest U.S. airline,
said in August that it was cutting services such as frequent-flier
benefits and standby flights to budget travelers as part of a
cost-cutting plan.</LD>
<LD>   The rollback of these policies will let travelers with
nonrefundable tickets, which generally are cheaper and do not allow
for travel flexibility, to fly standby for a $100 fee. The change,
set to start Jan. 1, matches a policy set by rival American Airlines,
a unit of AMR Corp.</LD>
<TE>   The airline did not change its new policy of restricting
passengers who buy nonrefundable tickets for many routes in North
America and Europe from using the value of an unused ticket as a
credit toward the purchase of another one.</TE>

<LD>Leap Wireless International Inc., a seller of unlimited local

agreements when it chose not to pay interest on certain loans after

Wireless hired UBS Warburg to help the company find new funding and
restructure some of its debt, Leap said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. shareholders and workers seeking hundreds of
millions of dollars in damages over the fiber-optic network owner's
collapse will press their claims in federal court in New York, a
panel of judges ruled.</LD>
<LD>   Combining the 57 lawsuits filed by Global Crossing employees and
investors before U.S. District Gerard E. Lynch in Manhattan will aid
pretrial information exchanges, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation said. Hamilton, Bermuda-based Global Crossing filed for
bankruptcy protection in January.</LD>
<LD>   Shareholders who lost more than $500 million in Global Crossing's
collapse want to coordinate pretrial efforts with creditors in the
company's Chapter 11 case, investors' lawyers told the panel at a
July hearing. The Washington-based panel oversees consolidation of
cases when a company is sued in federal courts across the U.S. over
the same dispute.</LD>

<LD>Two California men were arrested by federal agents in connection with
a $25-million Ponzi scheme that the men claimed was licensed by the
International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   John C. Jeffers, 61, of Mentone and John Minderhout, 54, of
Yucaipa lured investors with an investment program that they said
used funds to finance humanitarian projects around the world, said
the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffers and Minderhout are named in 17 counts of wire fraud and 19
counts of mail fraud, each of which carries a maximum term of five
years in prison. Jeffers also is charged with 10 counts of money
laundering, which carry a 10-year penalty for each count.</LD>
<TE>   A Ponzi scheme uses funds from new investors to make interest
payments to older investors. Calls seeking comment from Jeffers and
Minderhout at their office at J.C. Jeffers &amp; Co. went through to a

<HD>Sheraton to Offer Credit for Bad Service</HD>
<DH>Hotels: Starwood says the program is aimed at keeping
guests, including frequent business travelers, from switching to
other chains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aiming to improve the consistency of service at its chain of Sheraton
hotels, Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc. will begin
compensating guests who report inconveniences including missing bath
soap and uncomfortable beds.</LD>
<LD>   The company's new program, called Sheraton Service Promise, gives
guests a $15 credit or points in Starwood's frequent guest program
for minor inconveniences such as slow check-ins, billing problems or
a shortage of towels or bath amenities.</LD>
<LD>   Problems such as a dirty room, temperature issues or noise
complaints will earn guests a $25 to $75 credit, based on the hotel's
average daily room rate. The average room rate for Sheraton hotels is
$131.</LD>
<TE>   Larger problems such as a missed wake-up call or poor food quality
will result in a free room night or meal.</TE>
<TE>   Guests also can choose to receive compensation in the form of spa
services or credit for future stays.</TE>
<TE>   The program is designed to boost the performance at the roughly
380 Sheraton properties, which saw room revenue fall 15% in the first
half of this year, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Starwood, the world's biggest hotel owner, is spending $1 billion
to renovate 66 Sheratons it owns, adding rooms designed by Ralph
Lauren and Williams-Sonoma Inc. with mahogany desks and Sealy
Posturepedic mattresses.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no doubt a big investment for [Starwood], but it may be
just the right signal to send to guests that good service is more
serious than ever at Sheraton hotels," said Jason Ader, an analyst
with Bear Stearns in New York.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Starwood shares closed at $26.63, up 70 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange trading.</TE>
<TE>   Geoff Ballotti, vice president of North American hotel operations
for Starwood, said the company hopes to make service more consistent
at all Sheraton hotels, which is the company's largest brand.</TE>
<TE>   Because service has varied from one property to another, many
guests--including valued frequent business travelers--have left
Sheraton for other chains, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, this program is going to force our general managers to
maintain the same top-quality service at all Sheraton properties,"
Ballotti said. "We're backing our product up with a promise, and if
something's wrong we'll make it up to them instantly, in a way where
they can feel it."</TE>
<TE>   The cost of the credits, which will be paid by individual hotel
franchisees, may cut hotel profit margins about 50 basis points in
the beginning, Ballotti said, noting that the program will operate on
a premise of "the customer is always right."</TE>
<TE>   However, the cost is expected to decline over time as hotels
improve their service, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheraton program applies to hotels in the continental U.S. and
Canada. The White Plains, N.Y.-based company said similar guarantees
at its other chains, which include St. Regis and W hotels, could
follow.</TE>

<LD>Consecrated wine--A California section story Wednesday about
Catholics worshipping at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels
incorrectly reported that consecrated bread and wine are kept in a
tabernacle following Mass. The consecrated bread, or host, is kept in
the tabernacle. But any consecrated wine, which Catholics believe is
the blood of Christ, that is not consumed during Mass is either
consumed by a priest or other liturgical minister or reverently
poured into the ground.</LD>

<HD>Baseball Lesson: Share the Wealth</HD>
<DH>If sports teams can share revenue, why can't schools?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH D. GANNON</AU>
<BD>Joseph D. Gannon, a former journalist, teaches English
at Thomas Jefferson High School in South-Central Los Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a high school English teacher in one of Los Angeles' overcrowded,
underfunded multitrack schools with among the worst Stanford 9 scores
in the city, all I can say is, "Thank God for baseball!" In averting
the players strike on the same day Stanford 9 scores were published,
our national pastime has shown us the way to educational equity.</LD>
<LD>   The scene in my journalism class that morning: I watched the body
language as my 11 students found our school's scores. Gasps of
surprise and slumping shoulders as they found the column showing that
70% of our students scored "below basic" or "far below basic" in
meeting state standards.</LD>
<LD>   The editor in chief wanted to cry. The others wanted to hide. I
had expected them to take the burden of such academic disappointment
squarely on their own shoulders. So unlike so many adults in the
system.</LD>
<TE>   They searched the long columns for other low-and high-performing
schools. Those that scored 60% or more below or far below basic
skills share our designation as Title 1 schools; the Title 1
designation is bestowed when the majority of the students' parents
are at or below the federal poverty line. Among the best scores in
the county were Pacific Palisades, Beverly Hills and Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take my students long to find this bullet in the news
story: The statewide achievement gap between poor and affluent
students in reading and math has widened in every grade over the last
five years, a pattern repeated all over L.A. (This despite Gov. Gray
Davis' assertion that all children are showing improvement regardless
of race, income or family background.)</TE>
<TE>   If there is no innate difference in intelligence based on family
income, how does the governor explain that the county's Stanford 9
scores can be sorted by ZIP code, those ZIP codes can be arranged by
family income, and the higher scores can be attached to higher-income
areas and lower scores to lower-income areas? My young journalists
demanded answers. I knew only this: Excellence in education is all
about resources--money, buildings, textbooks, teachers--and the
allocation of resources in a society is called politics. The
politicians who allow our school to remain overcrowded and
underfunded are precisely the same politicians who pass laws
mandating the same standardized tests for schools that are grossly
unequal in terms of resources.</TE>
<TE>   My students asked what could be done. I suggested taking our
student body on a field trip to Sacramento to chain ourselves to the
governor's doors until he did something. But then I heard that the
baseball strike had been averted. One term of the agreement was a
luxury tax: The wealthiest clubs help other clubs stay competitive by
sharing revenue.</TE>
<TE>   What a game! Once again, our national pastime has reached into our
soul and shown us the way. As Jackie Robinson helped integrate
baseball long before the country integrated, so baseball will build
equity among teams by sharing revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The analogy is not perfect. Schools that burst at the seams with
far too many students who go into decrepit classrooms and share beat
up textbooks, whose faculty is heaped with hard-working but often
uncredentialed and undertrained teachers, are far worse off than a
baseball team with a small market for advertising revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Still, revenue sharing will help those teams. Who denies that it
would markedly help schools? Who denies that in the U.S. you only get
what you pay for? And yes, as Yankee owner George Steinbrenner railed
against the idea, so will affluent communities complain.</TE>
<TE>   But it is an idea whose time has come.</TE>
<TE>   How long before the city and county follow baseball's lead and
share revenue to build competitiveness and equity in public schools?
I don't know how long. But when I return to my classroom, I'll write
just one word on the blackboard: strike.</TE>

<HD>The Indian Taught Her Every Litter Bit Hurts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRICIA SHORE</AU>
<BD>Tricia Shore lives in Van Nuys.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was just a napkin, thrown under the swing by the little girl
sitting beside my son at the park. He was in his first big-boy swing,
after graduating from the infant playground.</LD>
<LD>   At just 21 months old, he loves big kids and emulates their
behavior.</LD>
<LD>   The little girl, 5 or 6 years old at most, was eating a corn cob
on a stick--the cool playground food. Already someone had taught her
that it was OK to litter, OK to discard an empty wrapper on the
ground. She stared at me and I stared back, behind my sunglasses.</LD>
<TE>   I remember the Indian on the TV of my childhood. He cried at the
thought of people littering his beautiful America. I remember his sad
look. I never threw anything out the car window and I discouraged
others from littering. My home state had a slogan, "Keep North
Carolina Green and Clean."</TE>
<TE>   Was I a part of the little girl's village? Was I close enough to
her to say something?</TE>
<TE>   A man I presumed was her father sat on a bench, not watching her.
I hope that I will not become so jaded as a parent that I fail to
notice my child throwing litter on the ground. I wondered how many
slack parents and guardians are responsible for raising the
litterbugs who throw garbage onto L.A.'s freeways. I think of the
Indian every time I see a food wrapper, a soda cup.</TE>
<TE>   After a few minutes, the girl got out of the swing. Presuming we
are all part of the same global village, I finally said to her, "Are
you going to pick up your paper?" She ignored me or did not hear me.</TE>
<TE>   My son continued to swing. I cannot say why I care enough about
our world to buy household products that are environmentally
friendly. Perhaps I can attribute my love of recycling to the Indian.
It was his world that I fell in love with, his vision that I want to
be safe for my son and my unborn child. I want to keep this land
green and clean, but I often feel as though I am alone.</TE>
<TE>   As much as I like to think that my contributions to keeping our
environment healthy will help, I see the trash on the roads. I hear
about plans to dump a large amount of bleach into sewage that will go
into the ocean. I wonder how much my recycling helps. However futile
it may be, I do not allow myself or my family members to throw trash
on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   After the little girl left, an older boy, 10 or 11, took her place
on the swing. His friend almost immediately began pushing sand over
the wrapper with his foot, not stopping until he had covered it
completely and built a mound above it. Perhaps he was thinking what I
was. He removed the evidence from our sight, but we both knew it was
still there.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes I want to put on gloves and start cleaning the city from
one end to the other. But that seemingly infinite task does not
coincide well with being the pregnant mother of a 21-month-old. StilI
miss the Indian. I wish he were with us today, teaching a new
generation to take care of our land.</TE>

<HD>A Quandary in Advertising</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Commerce and patriotism became uncomfortable bedfellows when
airplanes slammed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a
field in Pennsylvania.</LD>
<LD>   For days afterward, advertising uncharacteristically was pushed
from the airwaves and front sections of newspapers as media companies
dedicated their time and space to piecing together the jagged and
painful puzzle of what had happened and why.</LD>
<LD>   When the advertising window reopened several days after the
attacks, marketers faced dilemmas: Go with the usual commercial fare
and risk offending consumers not ready for business as usual? Turn to
public service announcements that deliver a sober message and keep
the brand name barely in the public eye? Drape cheerier product
pitches in a patriotic blend of red, white and blue?</LD>
<TE>   Concern over how advertising will be perceived has resurfaced as
media companies and marketers prepare for a day of remembering on
Sept. 11. A recent poll by Lightspeed Online Research Inc. found that
two-thirds of respondents did not think that advertising would be
appropriate during daylong news programming planned for Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Networks are making commercial time available, but advertisers
aren't scrambling to fill it. Some big companies will underwrite
special programming rather than break in with commercials. Others
will stay away entirely. PepsiCo Inc. has pulled its commercials, as
has Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., which also will put telemarketing calls on
hold for the day.</TE>
<TE>   Advertising is supposed to reflect society's concerns--witness the
zany dot-com commercials that mirrored America's affair with tech in
the late 1990s. So when advertising tiptoed back after the terror
attacks, it was with public service messages that mirrored a national
desire to pay tribute to heroes and the dead.</TE>
<TE>   The right tone evaded some advertisers. A General Motors Corp.
campaign introducing 0% financing drew consumer ire for suggesting
that Americans had a patriotic duty to buy a new car. But advertising
agencies thankfully produced Super Bowl commercials that entertained
without offending.</TE>
<TE>   Television networks, which lost an estimated $300 million in
advertising revenue after the terrorist attacks, stand to lose $60
million more on Sept. 11. The revenue will be missed in an industry
stuck in a painful slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   But there is precedent for pulling commercials that would be out
of place; airlines, for instance, regularly suspend advertising after
fatal crashes. Newspapers including The Times are limiting what kinds
of ads may appear near anniversary stories on Sept. 11. Some plan
ad-free special sections. Americans suffer an incessant daily barrage
of advertising. It's good that the industry recognizes when it's time
for a halt.</TE>

<KH>THE CASE FOR UNITY</KH>
<HD>Sizing Up the City of Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession movements
claim that Los Angeles is so big, it's ungovernable. That's one of
their chief arguments for wanting to carve this admittedly sprawling
metropolis into two or three cities. But how big, exactly, is too
big?</LD>
<LD>   It may surprise--even disappoint--some residents to learn that Los
Angeles is not the biggest city in the country, much less the world.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, sure, we know that New York City tops us in population, 8
million to our 3.7 million. But how many commuting-crazed Angelenos
realize we're far from being the largest U.S. city in terms of size?</LD>
<TE>   That honor goes to Juneau, Alaska, at 3,108 square miles the
biggest city in area in North America. OK, so its city limits take in
more glaciers, ice fields, mountain ranges and ocean than people.</TE>
<TE>   Runners-up include:</TE>
<TE>   * Anchorage, 1,697 square miles;</TE>
<TE>   * Jacksonville, Fla., 758 square miles;</TE>
<TE>   * Oklahoma City, 607 square miles;</TE>
<TE>   * Houston, 579 square miles;</TE>
<TE>   * Phoenix, 475 square miles;</TE>
<TE>   * And finally, Los Angeles, 469 square miles.</TE>
<TE>   New York City, it should be noted, is not exactly minuscule,
checking in at 303 square miles.</TE>
<TE>   As for population, some of the world's great cities make Los
Angeles look like, well, not exactly a small town but not freakishly
large either. Los Angeles lags such cities as Sao Paulo, Brazil (10.4
million), Jakarta, Indonesia (8.8 million) and Tokyo (7.9 million).
London has 7.3 million people spread out over 1,055 square miles.
Berlin is nearly the same size as L.A., with 3.4 million people and
553 square miles.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone knows of large cities that are run well and small ones
that are run poorly, and vice versa. Aristotle's ideal city was small
enough so that all citizens knew each other and, as he wrote in
"Politics," could "elect officials and judge their fellows in a court
of law sensibly." To him, 10 citizens were too few and 100,000 too
many, which would make even a 1.4-million-resident Valley city less
than ideal. Of course, in Aristotle's ancient Greece, citizenship was
hereditary and limited to men; slaves, peasants, women and immigrants
didn't count. Ideal is relative.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has ever inched along in traffic from Van Nuys to
Dodger Stadium or Tujunga to Venice Beach knows Los Angeles is big.
How breaking it into three cities would shorten the drive is another
question entirely.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pity the man from Snowy River. They took his water, just as the city
of Los Angeles drained the Owens Valley in the eastern Sierra Nevada
nearly a century ago. But at least Australia's river is getting back
some of its natural flow.</LD>
<LD>   As the Associated Press reported from Canberra, Australia:
"Reduced for decades to a muddy trickle by a hydroelectric and
irrigation project, the Snowy River began flowing again [Aug. 28]
under an ambitious plan to revive the iconic waterway."</LD>
<LD>   In the huge project, built between 1949 and 1974, more than
100,000 workers bored giant tunnels through the Snowy Mountains to
carry the river's waters to farms on the arid west side of the range.
The region won fame through the Wild West-like epic poem "The Man
From Snowy River," by A.B. Paterson, and the popular movie of the
same name.</LD>
<TE>   Now Australian officials have closed a valve on an aqueduct and
part of the flow generated by the Snowy Mountains is returning to its
natural course.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers of the region aren't happy with the re-diversion, but New
South Wales Premier Bob Carr said the river faced destruction if the
flow of the pristine mountain waters was not restored.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, closer to home, the battle lines remain. Beginning
in 1913, Los Angeles began sending the flow of the Owens River more
than 200 miles south to feed growth and development. Later, the city
tapped the Sierra Nevada waters that fed Mono Lake and drilled wells
in the Owens Valley to increase supply. During the 1970s, in an
effort to force Los Angeles to give up much of the water,
environmental groups and Inyo County began a long string of legal
actions against the city for the damage done by the diversions. The
city lost many of these.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a 1991 agreement, revised in 1997, the city agreed to
return water to the drained lower Owens River beginning in 2003.
That's not likely now. Complications have arisen, and the Sierra Club
and others are suing the city.</TE>
<TE>   It's a familiar but sad old story. One fight is over the size of
the pump the city would use to recapture the water at the south end
of the river and return the flow to the Los Angeles Aqueduct. The
city wants a big pump. Environmentalists say that the agreement calls
for a smaller pump. The hidden issue is whether the city really wants
the bigger pump so it can take more ground water from the valley.
What's needed is an ironclad agreement by the city that this will not
be done--and a pump just big enough to return the lower river water
to the aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   As with the Snowy River, a revived Owens would have only a
fraction of its natural flow, but enough to restore and sustain the
fishery and riverbank environment. It would be a historic event and
add to the natural and recreational bounty of the Eastern Sierra.</TE>

<LD>The Times has hit the nail on the head by stating that Arab bigotry
and hatred toward Jews is a major obstacle to peace in the Middle
East (editorial, Sept. 4). The Arab world needs to realize that its
obsessive hatred of Jews ultimately hurts Arabs more than Jews. How
can the Arab world expect to compete in the modern world when it
fills its young people with hatred and lies instead of teaching them
universal values which would allow them to thrive?</LD>
<LD>   A long time ago, former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir stated
that peace would come to the Middle East when the Arabs learned to
love their children more than they hated the Jews. We should hope and
pray that one day Meir's statement will become a reality.</LD>

<HD>Argument for Kurdistan Ignores Turkey's History</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "A Remedy in Iraq: Kurdish Autonomy" (Commentary, Sept. 3), David
Perlmutter claims that "legally there should be an independent
Kurdistan" since "the Treaty of Sevres, which delineated the breakup
of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, recognized that the Kurds
deserved their own state."</LD>
<LD>   To substantiate his argument, he chooses to ignore the historical
fact that while the Istanbul government of the Ottoman Empire
officially accepted the Treaty of Sevres on Aug. 10, 1920--a
vindictive document that put the Turkish state under the financial
and military control of the occupying powers--the Turkish
nationalists in central Anatolia under the leadership of Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk, founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey,
rejected the document.</LD>
<LD>   Following the Turkish national War of Independence, with the
signing of the Treaty of Lausanne on July 24, 1923 (where no
reference was made to "Kurdistan"), Turkey gained full sovereignty
within its own boundaries and, thus, a new nation emerged from the
ashes of the Treaty of Sevres.</LD>

<LD>Strange as it is to see Jeremy Rifkin in favor of any new technology,
there really is something to be said for widespread use of hydrogen
(Commentary, Sept. 2).</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, there are some problems that Rifkin did not say
much about. He points out that hydrogen is plentiful. It is
indeed--but not in the useful free state. It's tied up tightly in
compounds such as water. He says, "All that needs to be done is to
extract hydrogen from various elements so that it is useful in fuel
cells." Similarly, all you need to get very rich is to extract the
gold in a few square miles of California soil or a few cubic miles of
sea water.</LD>
<LD>   It's possible to generate hydrogen from petroleum, but that
doesn't reduce the need for petroleum at all, and I doubt that it
would really help much, if any, with carbon dioxide emissions. The
other potential source is electrolysis of sea water. That requires a
lot of electric current, in addition to what we already use, and I
question whether Rifkin or environmentalists in general are willing
to accept more power plants. Lots more electrical power means either
burning lots more coal or petroleum, or more nuclear power.</LD>
<TE>   There is perhaps one alternative: solar cells. At 100% efficiency,
you could get about 600 watts per square yard at high noon on a clear
summer day. For average conditions, and attainable efficiency, this
means covering a lot of the Southwestern states with solar panels to
replace gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin holds out the prospect of your car generating electricity
(which you would be paid for) when it is parked in the garage.
Remember that you would need a hydrogen pipeline into your garage,
and you would have to pay for the hydrogen--probably significantly
more than you would get for the electricity that you would generate.</TE>
<TE>   Hydrogen just may be the wave of the future, but getting it will
not be cheap or easy.</TE>

<TE>   Rancho Palos Verdes</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin's article glosses over the amount of energy required to
extract hydrogen from various elements. He states that in the future
renewable sources of energy will "be used to electrolyze water and
separate out hydrogen that can be used to power fuel cells." Since
only about 10% of the power in this country comes from renewable
sources (only a few percent without hydropower), it is unrealistic to
discount the need for fossil fuels and/or nuclear energy in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, fuel cells will have an important place, but they are
not a panacea that allows us to ignore the balance of production and
use of power. A successful energy policy must be based on sound
scientific principles, not unsupportable assertions.</TE>

<TE>   Back around 1974, a hydrogen-powered car visited my high school.
It was a modified AMC Gremlin; it had a canister of hydrogen, and the
man adapted the car's engine to use it as a fuel. A bit of water even
dripped out the exhaust pipe. This was not any kind of fuel cell,
just an internal combustion engine running on a clean fuel. The main
problem, I imagine, would be trying to find a gas station that had
hydrogen. That and images of the Hindenburg to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Kirwan</TE>
<TE>   Venice</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin is definitely on to something here. A hydrogen-based
economy is on the horizon, or the auto industry would not be
investing so heavily in hydrogen technology. With respect to the
energy network Rifkin envisions, there is a glaring inconsistency. He
states that "since the average car is parked most of the time, it
could be plugged in ... providing premium electricity back to the
network." For the foreseeable future, a hydrogen-powered vehicle will
have a maximum driving range, without refueling, at less than half of
the current range. Few, if any, vehicle owners would want to deplete
their on-board fuel to provide energy.</TE>
<TE>   But a decentralized system of solar panels on rooftops could
provide considerable energy to the network: enough to do the
electrolyzing of H2O to provide the needed hydrogen. It is estimated
that 10,000 square miles of solar panels could provide the nation's
energy needs.</TE>

<LD>I am a mom of a Sept. 11, 2001, baby. My son will celebrate his first
year of life while the rest of America mourns for those whose lives
were lost on such a tragic day. He has brought so much love and
happiness to our family, but the shadow of the events surrounding his
birth are a daily part of our lives and are always in our thoughts
and will follow Grant for the rest of his life.</LD>
<LD>   I feel that amid so much tragedy, pain and loss I was blessed with
the gift of life, and I see my son for the true wonder that is the
mystery of birth. We cannot, however, separate the loss from the joy;
everywhere we turn there is a reminder of the Sept. 11 attack.
Strangers always react the same way when they hear when Grant was
born: "Oooh no, I'm so sorry!" His life will always be linked with
this historic tragedy.</LD>
<TE>   I will, in time, teach Grant about what occurred on the day he was
born; I am sure he will also learn about it in history books. I will
make sure that I explain to him that he was a miracle, a sparkle of
life amid so much pain and sorrow, and as such will always be loved
in a very special way. He was born with a special responsibility: to
fight for his right to life and freedom. With life there is hope, and
with hope mankind can build a better future and bring together all
nations for the supreme purpose of freedom, in all its glory. I
celebrate Grant's life but also acknowledge that we must always
remember the events surrounding his birth; to forget or to ignore
this would be a bigger tragedy in itself.</TE>

<TE>   A letter writer suggests that we fly our flags during the week of
Sept. 11 to honor those lost and the firefighters (Sept. 2). I will
certainly be flying my flag, as I do every day, but it will be to
honor those young men and women in the armed services who appear to
be forgotten. When I read of the astronomical sums those "victims"
are receiving or will receive, my blood boils. I know what the
families of the military receive in death benefits, and no one seems
to see or care about the inequity of this. I will think every morning
of those young people putting their lives on the line for an
ungrateful nation that accepts their sacrifices as its due.</TE>

<TE>   Reading Norah Vincent's Aug. 29 commentary, "The World's
Different, and So Are We," I laughed, because I truly believed she
was being facetious; then I remembered she is not a satirist. "Deep
down we all did it [made changes in our lives] because we knew that
it might have been us in those towers"? Please.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, many new and strange things have happened since Sept.
11. For example, I took up running. Why? Because my doctor told me
for the second year in a row that my cholesterol level was elevated.
My wife got a nice raise at work. Because her boss was shocked by
3,000 deaths in New York? No, because she's a fine employee. South
Korea made it to the semifinals of the World Cup, far surpassing
expectations. One would be challenged to draw a connection there.</TE>
<TE>   With due respect to the victims of the terrorist attacks, for a
great many people, the world has not fundamentally changed. Irony is
not dead. Famine in the Third World has not ended. And some aspects
of the American mentality--its overblown exceptionalism, its
reluctance to admit any culpability in the troubles of the
world--have only gotten worse.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Let Genius Soar Above Tragedy," Commentary, Aug. 28: "Banish
the bland: New York monument calls for greatness"--I wholeheartedly
agree. Why not build the world's largest multidenominational
religious facility: a United Nations of Faith, a structure of
monolithic significance housing worship facilities of every religion.
Include a large gathering hall where speeches and discourse may be
had on faith, belief, worship, religious law and philosophy. It could
house offices for differing religious groups. It would be a living
memorial with thousands of employees and dignitaries, a center of
learning and place of pilgrimage.</TE>
<TE>   The world's worst battles have been based around faith. The twin
towers were felled in religious fervor. It would be fundamentally
American to encourage international discourse on this subject on the
site of this most terrible religious atrocity. Let our American
memorial be a world-renowned facility for the peaceful exchange of
religious ideas and a giant step forward in healing the rifts of
faith that are tearing our world apart.</TE>

<HD>Cathedral Has Potential as a Great Crossroads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Roger Mahony now has the rare opportunity to make the new
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels the most important attraction in
all of Los Angeles. Now that the pageantry and the formalities are
over, along with the elitism that accompanied the opening ceremonies,
it is time to turn the cathedral over to the ordinary people to whom
it rightly belongs. One should look to those cathedrals that draw
thousands of worshipers and tourists almost daily to their sites, and
we can easily duplicate their commonality. The three that come to
mind are the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City, San Marco in
Venice and, of course, Notre Dame in Paris. All cater to common
people, and all have large plazas to accommodate large numbers of
people.</LD>
<LD>   I can envision busloads of the faithful arriving from all the
Western states, making pilgrimages to honor their favorite saint. I
can see supplicants crawling on their knees across the plaza to plead
for answers to their prayers. I hope we will be able to see people
casually sitting over a coffee, iced tea, a glace, etc. It can be a
great meeting place and a serious place for the convergence of both
the rich and poor of our great city, where the rich can see the poor
and then contribute to solving our mutual problems. A place to bring
people of all faiths together.</LD>
<TE>   It will bring people from far and wide for ceremonies and rituals
that only a cathedral can make meaningful. It can have a huge
spillover effect on the neighborhood of Broadway, with its shopping,
and Grand Avenue, with its cultural venues. It will invigorate Olvera
Street. It can do for the downtown what nothing to date has
done--bring it alive as a 24-hour-a-day event.</TE>
<TE>   James M. Honigman</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The new downtown cathedral is a stunning example of how
architecture is a concrete expression of the psyche of those who
build it and dwell in it. Nicolai Ouroussoff's flowery prose
("Cathedral Embodies Spiritual Journey," Sept. 2) cannot obscure what
any layman can clearly see: The fortress-like structure is more in
the style of a walled community for the wealthy Catholics of Los
Angeles. It is a castle built by a cardinal, and a church, under
siege. Architect Jose Rafael Moneo merely forgot the moat and the
drawbridge.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Schmitz</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Of all the critics of the cathedral, I am willing to wager that
none are in need of a wheelchair for mobility. St. Vibiana's stank
for accessibility--getting to it, getting into it and getting around
inside it. Now, my quadriplegic, legally blind wife can hop in her
power chair, go to the Metrolink station half a mile from us, ride to
Union Station, take the Red Line to Civic Center station and then
ride a block to Our Lady of the Angels. Then she can run around the
plaza, drive up to the altar and up and down the aisles.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if it took millions of dollars to make my wife able to be
free at worship in the cardinal's place of business (albeit God's
house), then that somehow sounds like fulfilling the command to be
caring toward the "least" of the brethren.</TE>

justified them to prevent future blackouts. Sunday, in Fallbrook, and
possibly other places, on a day when the thermometer reached 110
degrees, the power was cut off for three hours at the hottest time of

it. I'd rather have the alternative.</LD>

<LD>Wilfred L. Von der Ahe Jr. will always be "Father Bill" to me
("Town's 'Savior' Came Up Short," Aug. 31), and although my memories
and experience of him are from the perspective of a child in suburban
Long Beach, his influence has never left me. Growing up as a Catholic
involved ritual, a language (Latin) that I didn't understand and the
fear of stern priests and nuns. It is evident to me as an adult that
Father Bill was a troubled soul, but I believe that sometimes
troubled souls are also brilliant. He heard my first confessions,
awkward and tentative, and opened my heart to the true meaning of the
process, which for me was to take responsibility for hurting other
people (including myself) and to make active amends--living
amends--to that person. His homilies were inspired and very alive. In
a time when some young Catholics were struggling with dogma (the
'60s), we were packing in this little church for his "guitar Masses"
and sitting in the front row. He was a trailblazer at a time when the
church was struggling with the trail.</LD>
<TE>   Wherever Father Bill is now, he knows the impact he had on this
one human being. I am a deeper, more giving, more outspoken person
because of my early experiences with him. Given the apparent struggle
he had living in the world, I thought that it would only be fair that
his family and his loved ones know the effect he had on those of us
who are grateful for his gifts.</TE>

<HD>London Body Exhibit Blends Art and Science</HD>

<LD>Seeing the Body Worlds exhibit (Sept. 1) was one of the more
memorable events of our family trip to London last April. Surely it
was no accident that the exhibit was in London's East End, just a
block away from the Jack the Ripper Pub and notorious crime scene
walking tour. However shocking the concept is, the people viewing the
exhibit were reverent, respectful, awed and amazed. As were we. The
bodies, posed in the ways we function and move, made it even more
meaningful and relevant.</LD>
<LD>   Jarring and certainly educational, this show deserves the widest
possible audience. Our kids (8 and 15) will never smoke after seeing
all the blackened lungs. We left wanting to take better care of our
marvelous bodies. The power and beauty of Gunther von Hagens' display
are undeniable, and it gave us all a greater appreciation for the
creator and our magnificently designed bodies. It is science and art
at their best.</LD>

<HD>Navy's Research Finds New Sonar System Safe</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"White House Must Reject Navy's Assault on the Oceans" (Commentary,
Aug. 22) incorrectly suggests that no environmental analysis will be
performed for the Navy's Low-Frequency Active Sonar, a system
developed to detect ultra-quiet ship-killer submarines at long
distances.</LD>
<LD>   The Navy has delayed deployment of this submarine detection
technology for six years in order to conduct an environmental
analysis, which included a two-year, $10-million research project
conducted by scientists from Cornell University and the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, among others. Their findings helped
establish that the LFA system can be used with appropriate mitigation
measures and cause minimal impact to the environment.</LD>
<LD>   It is also important to clarify the article's mischaracterization
of the circumstances involved in a March 2000 Bahamas whale
stranding. An in-depth scientific analysis found that this stranding
was caused by a confluence of factors, including environmental
factors unique to that location as well as the concentrated use in
confined littoral waters of several hull-mounted mid-range sonars
that have been in use for decades.</LD>
<TE>   During this fiscal year, the Department of the Navy will spend
nearly $1.2 billion for environmental protection. In fact, the Navy
is responsible for some of the most significant studies of marine
mammals. We have worked closely with environmental professionals at
the National Marine Fisheries Service to deploy crucial technologies
like LFA under operating rules that will safeguard the environment
and enhance national security.</TE>

<LD>Re "Test Scores Rise; Goals Still Unmet," Aug. 30: Most
college-educated parents are speaking and reading to their tiny tots
in English every day from birth until kindergarten. Spanish-speaking
children are at a tremendous disadvantage when they enter school. Why
not provide and encourage free adult classes in English for parents
of infants and toddlers with a campaign that explains the importance
of building the preschool English vocabulary and grammar foundation?</LD>
<LD>   At these classes, introduce children's literature and give free
children's books in English to immigrant parents. Educate employers
about the importance of the program and give a certificate that the
parent can present to the employer at the completion of the course.</LD>
<LD>   Lynne Shapiro</LD>
<TE>   Marina del Rey</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Since Gov. Gray Davis seems to think that test scores determine if
a child has achieved lifetime learning, and since he takes credit
when scores are high, and since this is an election year, I would
like to offer the following suggestion: Assure that principals can be
accountable by letting them give each student the advantages enjoyed
by high-scoring students.</TE>
<TE>   First, give each student a home computer with Internet access;
next, purchase each child a musical instrument and arrange for weekly
lessons, since statistics show that people who study music have
higher test scores. Third, have each child attend math tutoring at
least once a week. Since parents are often home from work late,
provide each family with a college-educated, English-speaking nanny
who can greet the children after school with a healthy snack, drive
them to music and tutoring, assist with homework and music practice,
provide school/college counseling to teens and serve an early,
nutritious dinner.</TE>
<TE>   I guarantee that these measures will quickly raise test scores
much faster than daily test-taking drills, militaristic teacher-proof
curricula and threats of loss of jobs or bonuses. Finally, I would
like to have Davis, along with other successful businesspeople and
politicians, take the high school Stanford 9 exam and allow The Times
to publish their scores.</TE>
<TE>   Judith M. Seki</TE>
<TE>   San Gabriel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The only thing standardized tests prove is that rich kids score
higher than middle-class kids and that middle-class kids score higher
than poor kids. So pardon my ignorance if I ask, "What's the point?"</TE>

<LD>One reading "Centenarian at Wheel Still Rules the Road" (Sept. 1)
might think it is a cute or humorous story. However, there is a
downside to such a situation. My granddaughter was killed in a
traffic accident on an Oregon highway five years ago. An elderly
driver fell asleep in the early afternoon, hit the guard rail and
slammed into my daughter's car, killing my granddaughter, who was
fastened in her car seat. I witnessed firsthand the heartache of such
a tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   This gentleman should be forced to get behind the wheel at his
local DMV and prove his ability to drive. He should be required to
take a physical examination from his physician that would certify
that he is capable of the task. If he fails either of these tests, he
should be required by law to dispose of his automobile. The statement
by one of his friends that she would not drive with him out of fear
for his driving skills indicates a serious problem probably exists.</LD>
<LD>   This is a safety issue. It is a matter of life and death. I had to
deal with it when my own father reached this point. I had to take his
car away from him. Living close to Leisure Village, I was hit in
Camarillo by an elderly woman who also should not have been driving.
A centenarian at the wheel should not rule the road.</LD>

<TE>   How great to read about Charles Ford, the 102-year-old who still
drives a car. We should all aspire to live the active life he does
when we are his age. I hope his new car gives him years of pleasure.</TE>

<HD>M. Ross Bigelow, 77; Judge Presided at Trial of SLA Members
in '74 Shootout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>M. Ross Bigelow, a retired Los Angeles Superior Court judge who
presided over the high-profile trial of two Symbionese Liberation
Army members who were involved in a 1974 police shootout while being
arrested in the killing of an Oakland school superintendent, has
died. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Bigelow died Tuesday of complications from congestive heart
failure in a hospice in Temecula, said his daughter, Los Angeles
Superior Court Judge Tricia Ann Bigelow.</LD>
<LD>   Appointed to the Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1969 by Gov.
Ronald Reagan, Bigelow began his 15-year career as a Superior Court
judge in 1973.</LD>
<TE>   Known as a fair and scholarly judge and an expert in the law of
evidence, Bigelow lectured frequently on evidence before the National
Trial Judges College and the California Trial Judges College.</TE>
<TE>   His most highly publicized case was the trial of SLA members
Russell Little and Joseph Remiro on charges of attempted murder of a
policeman, assault and possession of explosives stemming from a
shootout in the San Francisco Bay Area community of Concord.</TE>
<TE>   The shootout occurred during the men's arrest in January 1974, in
the Nov. 6, 1973, slaying of Oakland School Supt. Marcus Foster.</TE>
<TE>   The Foster killing was the first known violent act of the SLA, a
self-styled band of revolutionaries who gained nationwide attention
when members kidnapped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.</TE>
<TE>   The trial of Little and Remiro was moved to Los Angeles because of
the publicity that surrounded their case and the June 1975 conviction
in the attack that killed Foster and seriously wounded his assistant
Robert Blackburn.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles trial was held in what was then the high-security
courtroom of the downtown Criminal Courts Building, and Bigelow was
accompanied by an armed guard on the daily drive to the courthouse
from his home in Lakewood.</TE>
<TE>   Tricia Ann Bigelow, who was in high school at the time, remembers
the heightened security at home.</TE>
<TE>   "The house had to be inspected to make sure it was safe enough
with all the locks on the windows and the doors," she said. "And
every night the Lakewood Sheriff's Department would come with not
only their helicopter to shine the big spotlight in the backyard, but
they also came at least every hour to walk through the backyard and
the frontyard."</TE>
<TE>   Her father and stepmother also had to check with law enforcement
officials before leaving the house, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, it was frightening," she said. "I had to be concerned
about my personal safety, and security officials talked to me about
how to avoid kidnapping."</TE>
<TE>   The shootout trial lasted three months, but after 19 days of
deliberations, the jury acquitted Little on all charges and was
unable to reach a verdict on any charges against Remiro.</TE>
<TE>   Bigelow declared a mistrial in Remiro's case and he was not
retried in the shootout.</TE>
<TE>   Little's conviction in the Foster killing was reversed in 1979
when the state Supreme Court found that the judge erred in giving
jury instructions, and Little was acquitted after a 1981 retrial on
the same charges. The court, however, upheld the conviction of
Remiro, who is serving a life sentence in connection with the Foster
killing.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a ranch foreman and a teacher, Bigelow was born in
Hemet in 1924 and grew up in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   He earned a bachelor's degree at USC in 1945 after serving in the
Navy in the Pacific during World War II. He earned his law degree at
USC in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to active service during the Korean War, he went
into private practice in Long Beach, where he was active in the
Republican Party. In 1956, he formed a partnership in general civil
practice, Bigelow &amp; Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from the Superior Court in 1988, Bigelow worked as
a judge in private mediation. After he and his wife, Mildred, moved
to their vacation home in Crestline, in the San Bernardino Mountains,
Bigelow continued to sit as an assigned judge for the San Bernardino
Superior Court, in addition to the local appellate court branch until
about four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   While on the bench, Bigelow wrote a number of published opinions
on criminal law, including holdings on probable cause, right to
speedy trail, and sufficiency and admissibility of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   He also wrote a set of books distributed to each judge in the
state, including "Evidence Objections Handbook," "Constitutional
Rights in Criminal Cases" and "Felony Trials and Procedures,
Orientation Notebook."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his daughter, Bigelow is survived by his wife of 35
years; his three other children, Becky Rice of Temecula, Jean
Shedlock of Tucson, and James Bigelow of Driggs, Idaho; three
stepchildren, Sharon Burson of Temecula, Julie Epson of Lakewood and
Susan Corrigan of San Pedro; 14 grandchildren and 14
great-grandchildren. His first wife, Janet, died in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. today at New Community
Lutheran Church, 30470 Pauba Road, Temecula.</TE>
<TE>   The family suggests memorial donations to the American Heart
Assn., 1710 Gilbreth Road, Burlingame, CA 94010.</TE>

<LD>Samuel Carter, 83, Jamaica's first native-born Roman Catholic
archbishop, whose outspoken advocacy for the poor won him praise
throughout the Caribbean, died Tuesday after a brief illness at a
hospital in Kingston.</LD>
<LD>   Carter was ordained head of the Archdiocese of Kingston in 1970, a
post he held for nearly 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   He dedicated much of his religious life to the ecumenical movement
and to helping the poor, writing many pastoral letters in defense of
social justice and in opposition to the death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Kingston on July 31, 1919, Carter taught Latin and worked
as a civil servant for five years before beginning his priesthood
studies in 1944.</TE>
<TE>   Carter traveled extensively during his tenure as archbishop, and
is widely credited with leading a push to establish indigenous clergy
throughout the Caribbean.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ole Lippmann, 86, one of Denmark's leading World War II resistance
fighters, died Tuesday in Copenhagen. The cause of death was not
reported.</LD>
<LD>   Lippmann helped in the deadliest wartime operation in Denmark, a
British bombing raid on Gestapo headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   After learning that the Germans planned to arrest the leadership
of the banned Freedom Council, which was founded to lead the
resistance groups, Lippmann called in the Royal Air Force strike on
March 21, 1945.</LD>
<TE>   The raid thwarted Gestapo plans, but a second wave of bombers hit
a school by mistake, killing 86 students and 13 adults.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Lippmann later said it was "terrible" to have to
call in the bombing raid because he knew civilian casualties were
likely. The school bombing "was extremely tragic," but ordering the
raid was the right decision, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Copenhagen, Lippmann was educated at the Niels Brocks
Commercial College. After graduating, he joined Simonsen and Weels, a
medical equipment firm.</TE>

<HD>Groups Seek Reconciliation After a Four-Decade Rift</HD>
<DH>Baptists: Leaders of two prominent black denominations urge
members to work together. They split after a delegate was killed in a
convention dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Religion News Service</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Forty-two years after this city was the site of the start of their
bitter split, leaders of two of the nation's most prominent black
Baptist denominations shared a podium this week in an emotional and
historic act of reconciliation.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Major L. Jemison, new president of the Progressive
National Baptist Convention, gave the keynote address at a banquet
during the annual session of the National Baptist Convention, USA.</LD>
<LD>   Jemison urged delegates to the denomination from which his was
formed to find ways to work with his group for the greater good of
African Americans and the nation as a whole.</LD>
<TE>   "More than any other time, we must plow this field together as
conventions and as Christian people whose aim it is to build up the
kingdom of God," said Jemison, an Oklahoma City pastor who rose to
the rank of his denomination's presidency in August.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly believe that God has not fixed us so that the best
has been.... It is clear to me that our unified effort is an idea
whose time has come."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the more than 1,400 attending the banquet credited the
Rev. William J. Shaw, president of the National Baptist Convention,
with having the vision to make the invitation to Jemison. But Shaw
said the credit belonged to a higher authority.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the presence of Dr. Jemison here tonight is a matter
of providence," said Shaw, a longtime pastor in Philadelphia, the
city where he said a major break occurred in the denomination in
1960.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that it is striking that ... 42 years later, the
president of the Progressive Convention will address the National
Baptist Convention, USA in the city where the seed of division was
not only planted but watered and birthed, as it were, or flowered
into another convention body."</TE>
<TE>   After the Philadelphia meeting, a dispute about the denomination's
leadership grew into a confrontation at a 1961 convention that left
one delegate dead.</TE>
<TE>   "After the convention in '61 in Kansas City, where an individual
came to an untimely death in that struggle ... some of us left the
convention brokenhearted and somewhat pessimistic about the future of
the denomination in terms of convention leadership," the Rev. Otis
Moss Jr. of Cleveland, a prominent Progressive National Baptist
Convention pastor, said in a phone interview before the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Within a couple of months, the newer denomination had been formed.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. William Keaton, a Little Rock, Ark., pastor and National
Baptist Convention member, contrasted the peacefulness of the 2002
meeting with the power struggles of the early 1960s, saying more
recent leadership has made a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like in a family, if you have a disagreeable husband or a
disagreeable wife, the children are going to reflect it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. E. Louise Sanders, an associate minister of a
Philadelphia church affiliated with the National Baptist Convention
whose father was a founder of the breakaway group, said the
podium-sharing fulfilled Shaw's "dream of uniting the two conventions
and forgetting the ill will from the past."</TE>
<TE>   Those dates in the early 1960s are one of the marks on the
timeline of black religious history that are reviewed in classes
taught by professors like A.G. Miller, acting head of the religion
department at Oberlin College in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   "Just to have representatives from one being invited by the other,
I think, is a major move within the black Baptist community," said
Miller in an interview before the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the memberships of the National Baptist Convention and the
smaller Progressive National Baptist Convention, Jemison said in his
address that more could be accomplished if they work together.</TE>
<TE>   "We have yet to realize the power of our strength as conventions,"
he said, drawing more applause.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to add up the numbers--8
million here, 2.5 million there. That's 10.5 million votes. We could
shape a nation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We could turn the world upside-down. We could do whatever we want
if we rally around the common causes," he added.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview after his speech, Jemison expanded on his hopes,
saying he thinks the two groups could work in partnership on
education issues and registration of African American voters.</TE>
<TE>   Jemison and Shaw said in interviews that they would like their
denominational leaders to hold a joint midwinter meeting in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Both credited longtime friendships across denominational
boundaries and previous overtures with helping them reach the point
where they, as presidents, could speak at the same annual meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Jemison cited the Rev. Gardner Taylor, renowned as the "dean of
African American preachers" and a past president of the Progressive
National Baptist Convention who unsuccessfully sought the National
Baptist Convention presidency in 1960 and 1961. Taylor spoke at last
year's annual session of Shaw's denomination.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview this week, Taylor said he was thoroughly
delighted about the improved relations between the groups.</TE>
<TE>   Though Jemison and Shaw did not mention the possibility of merger,
Taylor and others hope for it someday.</TE>
<TE>   "It may happen beyond my lifetime, but I do hope and pray that it
is in the offing," said Taylor, the 84-year-old pastor emeritus of a
Brooklyn, N.Y., church.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the conventions are beginning to show a certain
cordiality one toward each other, I think, is a very hopeful and
happy fact."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. C.T. Vivian, a civil rights leader who serves as an
associate pastor at a Progression National Baptist
Convention-affiliated church in Atlanta, is as hopeful as Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that eventually it will be inevitable that they actually
become one," he said in a telephone interview before the meeting.
"Any differences between them are slight and easily overcome if ...
both groups chose to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Although a struggle for leadership was the driving force that led
to the creation of the Progressive National Baptist Convention, the
undercurrent was differing views on the civil rights movement. While
leaders of the newer body were interested in a movement of direct
action led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., officials of the
National Baptist Convention were more inclined to seek equal rights
in other ways, such as through the courts.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that [Progressive National Baptist Convention]
did immediately ... was to offer Dr. King a platform," Moss said.</TE>
<TE>   Although not an officeholder, King was a featured speaker each
year the convention was held during his lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said the differences on civil rights tactics created
dissension within the Baptist body, as well as concern about how
blacks were perceived by whites.</TE>
<TE>   "There was open, vocal opposition to Dr. King's methods and this
was giving aid and comfort to people who were opposed to integration
by seeing that Dr. King's own people were not with him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Decades later, a number of longtime National Baptist Convention
leaders were on the three-tiered head table to witness the historic
address by the Progressive National Baptist Convention president.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Stewart C. Cureton, who took the place of the Rev. Henry
J. Lyons, the former president imprisoned for grand theft and
racketeering, said: "They are a part of us and we are a part of
them."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. T.J. Jemison, who preceded Lyons and said he was a
distant cousin of Major L. Jemison, added: "I see a closeness
coming."</TE>

<HD>Catholic Church Leader Favors Married Clergy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The arguments in favor of a married Roman Catholic clergy "are
extremely strong, perhaps overwhelming," an influential British
church leader has told the National Conference of Priests of England
and Wales.</LD>
<LD>   The official, Father Timothy Radcliffe, former master general of
the Dominicans, spoke at the group's annual meeting in London.</LD>
<LD>   Radcliffe said his main reservation about married priests is that
having a family would oblige priests to fit into the social system,
whereas in his view, one aspect of the priesthood expresses "the
scandalous outreach of God" to those on the edge of society.</LD>
<TE>   "This implies a certain social dislocation for the ordained
priest," Radcliffe said. "We do not have a clear place in the social
hierarchy. We are slippery figures who should be equally at home with
dukes or dustmen."</TE>
<TE>   Radcliffe's remarks came two days after the issue had been raised
by a Scottish bishop in the context of the growing shortage of
priests.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Maurice Taylor told the newspaper Scotland: "To me, we are
being faced with a question. What is more important: to allow people
a better chance of getting to Mass on Sunday, or to keep priests
celibate?"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Any preemptive war against Iraq would be immoral and "an act of state
terrorism," according to the Catholic Theological Assn. of Great
Britain.</LD>
<LD>   In a resolution adopted at its annual conference, the association
said that a preemptive war by the United States against Iraq would
not fulfill even the minimum requirements for a "just war" according
to traditional teaching.</LD>
<LD>   The theologians said in their resolution that "notwithstanding the
malignant character of the present Iraqi regime, the United Kingdom
and the United States do not possess the necessary international
authority to remove by violence the ruler of a sovereign state ....
Peaceful means of resolving disputes with Iraq have not been
exhausted."</LD>
<TE>   In the United States, meanwhile, a top official of the United
Methodist Church has joined critics of the Bush administration and
called on U.S. officials to seek a peaceful solution through the
United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration has declared its intent to launch a war
against Iraq, ignoring the advice of its allies, many members of
Congress, key experts and millions of U.S. citizens," said Jim
Winkler, chief staff executive of its Board of Church and Society.</TE>

<LD>An Episcopal priest who says the church has become too liberal on
issues such as the ordination of women and recognition of same-sex
unions has been defrocked by the bishop of Pennsylvania.</LD>
<LD>   Nationally, the Episcopal Church allows the ordination of women.
It officially opposes same-sex relations, but in practice, it brings
no sanctions against those who ordain actively homosexual clergy or
conduct same-sex unions.</LD>
<LD>   David Moyer, the former priest and pastor of the Church of the
Good Shepherd in Philadelphia, is a leader of Forward in Faith, a
movement that advocates more conservative positions. The group sought
to make him a bishop for more conservative congregations within the
church.</LD>
<TE>   Bishop Charles E. Bennison Jr., who ordered Moyer's dismissal,
said it was not Moyer's beliefs but his rejection of the bishop's
authority that prompted the move.</TE>

<LD>The atheist who made legal news when he asked an appeals court to
remove "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance is now trying to
have chaplains removed from Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Newdow, a Sacramento-based lawyer and emergency room
doctor, filed suit last month in federal district court in
Washington, D.C., claiming that it is unconstitutional for
taxpayer-funded chaplains to minister to lawmakers and pray in
Congress.</LD>
<LD>   "If congressmen want to go to church, [then they should] walk down
the block like other Americans do and go to church," Newdow told the
Washington Post in an interview. "Don't get my government engaged in
it."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Presbyterian pastors have a right to disagree with church policy but
not to openly defy it, the leader of the Presbyterian Church USA
warned in a letter to local church officials.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Clifton Kirkpatrick, stated clerk of the
2.5-million-member denomination, told leaders of regional
presbyteries they must handle seriously those pastors engaged in
"irregularity or delinquency. The process must be honored if the
integrity of the judicial system is to be maintained," he wrote.</LD>
<LD>   The letter came just weeks after a Cincinnati church and two
churches in New York said they intend to openly defy a church law
that prohibits the ordination of gay and lesbian pastors, according
to Presbyterian News Service.</LD>
<TE>   The Rev. Stephen Van Kuiken, pastor of Mt. Auburn Presbyterian
Church in Cincinnati, had said:</TE>
<TE>   "Following our precious legacy of religious liberty, with care and
concern for gay and lesbian members and their families, and out of
devotion to God that I experience in Jesus, I must simply echo the
words of [16th century Protestant reformer] Martin Luther: 'Here I
stand; I can do no other.' "</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. Carlton Pearson, Grammy-nominated singer and high-profile
pastor of Higher Dimensions Family Church in Tulsa, Okla., is under
fire from fellow evangelicals for teaching that most everyone will be
saved, even those who do not accept Jesus Christ.</LD>
<LD>   Several assistant pastors have left his church, attendance has
dropped, and Pearson said the controversy likely cost him a bid for
mayor earlier this year. His theology has been denounced by several
evangelical broadcasters.</LD>
<LD>   Pearson's alma mater, Oral Roberts University, forced the pastor
off its board and barred him from using its buildings or sending
buses so students can attend his services.</LD>
<TE>   Conventional evangelical belief says Christ's death and
resurrection make salvation available to all people, but each person
must accept that salvation. But Pearson says that "all will be saved,
with the exception of a few."</TE>
<TE>   Hell, he says, is for those few who "deny in their hearts that
there is a creator, who have a disrespect for the deity."</TE>

<HD>15th Century Church Adds Internet Prayers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of Britain's oldest churches has catapulted itself into
cyberspace by launching a worldwide prayer service on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Rosslyn Chapel, founded in 1446, has become one of the first
churches in Britain to take "e-prayer" requests. So far, it has been
asked for prayerful help with exam results, relationships, job
interviews and crises of faith.</LD>
<LD>   "With a physical prayer book," says Andrew Heavens, the Scottish
Episcopal Church's appropriately named spokesman, "people still might
worry that someone could see them in church and look at what they
have written."</LD>
<TE>   But the online prayer service, Heavens said, "is totally
anonymous, so people have really been pouring their hearts out."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Michael Fass, priest in charge, said: "We live
increasingly disconnected lives. If this is a way to connect people
to a church, then that must be a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone wishing for a prayer simply types a request on an online
form and the request arrives with no mention of either the sender's
name or address. It is then printed out and read in the chapel at
noon.</TE>
<TE>   The service is being offered through the Scottish Episcopal
Church's Web site, www.scottishepiscopal.com.</TE>

<HD>Agencies Prepare to Put Money Into 'Faith-Based Initiative'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congress has yet to approve President Bush's "faith-based
initiative," but the administration is preparing to rewrite federal
regulations and hand out millions of dollars to religious groups for
social services.</LD>
<LD>   At the Department of Health and Human Services, a new pot of money
is aimed at helping religious groups receive government grants.
Officials say there's no problem in using tax money for a program in
which prayer is central, a point that Congress has refused to
endorse.</LD>
<LD>   The administration takes a broad view of the constitutional
separation between church and state. If public money is used for
secular elements of the program--like a computer or a van--the rest
of the program can have a religious base, said Robert Polito,
director of the HHS Center for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.</LD>
<TE>   "We wouldn't be called the faith-based office if we weren't trying
to see how we can partner with the faith community," he said. "We
don't have to take the temperature of the religiosity of the
program."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the director of the White House faith-based
office, Jim Towey, said no decisions had been made about the
guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to comply with federal law," Towey said. He
acknowledged that there are gray areas in the law but added, "We are
certainly going to be very zealous to make sure people aren't
preaching on Uncle Sam's dollar."</TE>
<TE>   Congressional action on Bush's effort is stalled over these
questions: How much religion is too much when government money is
involved? Can government pay for secular elements of a program that
also includes religion? Should government-funded religious groups be
able to consider religion in hiring?</TE>
<TE>   The House has approved a bill with most of what Bush wanted. In
the Senate, however, supporters have failed to get a vote on even the
watered-down version of the bill they introduced.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Health and Human Services is writing rules on its
own, and other agencies are preparing to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be great to have legislation, but there's a ton of stuff
I can do without it," Polito said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics are upset.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration seems to say, 'We couldn't get the votes in
Congress, so we're going to hijack every dollar we can and move it
into faith-based ministries,' " said Barry Lynn, executive director
of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.</TE>
<TE>   At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, officials are
set to rewrite regulations governing eight grant programs that now
bar religious groups if they are unwilling to hire people of all
faiths.</TE>
<TE>   "That creates an impediment to faith-based organizations that's
unnecessary," said Steven Wagner, director of HUD's "faith-based"
office.</TE>
<TE>   Education Department officials say a new federal law on
after-school programs allows groups to use religion in their hiring
decisions. That prompted protests from Democrats who say they barred
such discrimination under a carefully negotiated compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, the department's draft guidance interpretation ...
effectively nullifies this compromise language," Sen. Edward Kennedy
of Massachusetts and Rep. George Miller of California, top Democrats
on the Senate and House education committees, wrote to Education
Secretary Rod Paige.</TE>
<TE>   Initiatives also are advancing at the Justice and Labor
departments. However, the effort is moving most dramatically at
Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Congress allocated $30 million for technical assistance
to help religious groups learn how to apply for government money.</TE>
<TE>   Health and Human Services added a twist when it invited
applications for the money. The groups that win large grants can pass
unlimited amounts of them to small religious groups, which may use
the money for start-up costs and "operations"--in essence, running
programs to address a wide range of social problems with no
congressional guidance on the issue of church versus state.</TE>
<TE>   Even the House bill, which included much of what Bush wanted,
would require that programs separate their religious elements, so
those who wish to participate in the secular part alone can do so.</TE>
<TE>   Health and Human Services is making no such requirement, said
Polito, who ran an urban ministry in New York before coming to the
agency. He said that without congressional permission, the agency
might not have the power to require a separation.</TE>
<TE>   Further, Polito said, programs need not open their work forces to
people of all faiths, and they need not set up separate corporations
to handle the government money, although the department recommends
it.</TE>
<TE>   He said his agency plans to award grants to 25 of its 562
applicants by the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   It all makes for a "giant faith-based slush fund," Lynn said. The
program was never supposed to be funding individual churches, he
said. "I think that's a real scandal."</TE>

<HD>Catholics Called Wrong Not to Evangelize Jews</HD>
<DH>Argument: Southern Baptist officials say Catholics'
agreement not to try to convert them denies Jews salvation. Jewish
groups are outraged at claim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Religion News Service</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a month after Catholics and Jews signed a joint statement that
underscored a new understanding on salvation, the document continues
to cause controversy, and has driven a wedge between Jews and
evangelicals in the nation's largest Protestant church.</LD>
<LD>   The Aug. 12 statement, signed by representatives of the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National Council of
Synagogues, said Catholics should no longer try to evangelize Jews
because they "already dwell in a saving covenant with God."</LD>
<LD>   Trying to convert Jews is "no longer theologically acceptable in
the Catholic Church" because of a recognition of a "divinely given
mission to Jews to witness to God's faithful love," the document
said.</LD>
<TE>   Such sentiments did not sit well with some Protestants.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the document was issued, the director of Jewish
outreach for the Southern Baptist Convention said "there can be no
more extreme form of anti-Semitism" than to deny Jews a chance to
hear the gospel of Jesus Christ.</TE>
<TE>   "Asking Christians to abandon evangelism, even for a single ethnic
group, is akin to asking Jews to eat ham and cheese sandwiches," Jim
Sibley told Baptist Press, the denomination's official news service.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Touching a Nerve</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, there is nothing new about the Jewish-Catholic
understanding on salvation or the Southern Baptist insistence on
evangelizing. But, with the one-year anniversary of Sept. 11 looming
with all its pleas for interfaith understanding, the controversy has
touched a nerve that underlies religious relations.</TE>
<TE>   It also exposes the complex relationship between Jews and
evangelicals; Jews are grateful for evangelicals' strong support of
Israel, but they cannot accept the Baptist belief that non-Christians
are destined for hell.</TE>
<TE>   Sibley's comments riled the Anti-Defamation League, which called
his remarks "the height of hypocrisy." The ADL has long been critical
of the Southern Baptists' outreach to Jewish groups.</TE>
<TE>   "To suggest that the Catholic Church ... is engaging in extreme
anti-Semitism is offensive and completely absurd," said Abraham
Foxman, the ADL's national director.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   War of Words on TV</TE>
<TE>   The public war of words also spilled over to the rambunctious
realm of talk television. R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., dueled with
pop culture guru Rabbi Shmuley Boteach on Phil Donahue's show on
MSNBC.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't compel any person to believe in Christ, but I do have the
responsibility, with gladness and joy, to share the good news of the
Gospel, knowing that all who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ shall
be saved, whether Jew or gentile," Mohler said.</TE>
<TE>   Boteach, visibly angered by Mohler's remarks, called him a
"spiritual Neanderthal with repulsive, revolting views" and a
"liability to Christianity."</TE>
<TE>   And the ever-controversial Jews for Jesus movement, which believes
that Jesus is the messiah that Jews have been waiting for, also
stepped in. David Brickner, the group's executive director, said the
bishops had "crossed the line" and betrayed their responsibility to
spread the Gospel.</TE>
<TE>   "Jews need to hear the Gospel. Period. Excluding my Jewish people
from Christian witness is theologically and biblically untenable, yet
this is exactly what American Catholic bishops" did, Brickner said.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore Cardinal William Keeler, the bishops' top ecumenical
liaison, applied the brakes. In a mid-August statement, he cautioned
that the document does not represent official policy of either the
bishops' conference or its ecumenical committee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reflection Encouraged</TE>
<TE>   Keeler said the only real power of the document is to "encourage
serious reflections on these matters" by Jews and Catholics. He left
the door open for individual Jews to make the choice to become
Christians.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi A. James Rudin, the former interreligious affairs advisor
for the American Jewish Committee, said the issue raises some
important questions for evangelicals when leaders of the country's
largest church--Catholics--no longer see evangelization of Jews as a
priority.</TE>
<TE>   "It puts the evangelicals in a bit of a theological corner," said
Rudin, a veteran of Christian-Jewish dialogue. "If the Catholic
Church is not seeking the conversion of Jews, then why are
[evangelicals] doing it?"</TE>

ago--remains fresh in the memory of the nation.</LD>
<LD>   The conjunction of the first anniversary of the attacks on New
York and Washington and the holy days, which begin with Rosh
Hashana--the Jewish New Year--and end Sept. 16 with Yom Kippur, has
presented rabbis with a challenge: How do they integrate the
holiday's imperatives of reconciliation and peacemaking with the
searing memories of terrorist attacks in the United States and
Israel?</LD>
<LD>   The ability to apply timeless values to contemporary events has
long been the mark of a good preacher. So, like all other good
preachers, rabbis said they do not see the instances of terrorism as
a distraction during the high holy days, but rather as a teachable
moment.</LD>
<TE>   "We have an extraordinary but challenging opportunity to reinforce
[high holy day] themes of forgiveness and repentance," said Rabbi
Mark S. Diamond, vice president of the Board of Rabbis of Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Eli Herscher of Stephen S. Wise Temple in West Los Angeles
also is one who does not see Sept. 11 as a distraction.</TE>
<TE>   "The core of Jewish tradition, as I see it, is to struggle to find
ways of living in the world as we find it," he said. "So when we
encounter destruction and despair and a strong measure of evil in it,
we are asked to respond."</TE>
<TE>   On the first anniversary of the attacks, Herscher thinks of the
high holy days in part as a time for mourning. "I see the high
holidays as a communal kaddish [prayer of mourning] for the innocents
whose lives were stolen away in an instant. In a sense, we are saying
kaddish for the dreadful year that has passed. The challenge of the
high holidays is to look at the world as it is and not to give in to
despair and not to succumb to fear and not to succumb to hatred and
anger."</TE>
<TE>   But some rabbis, such as Rabbi Harvey J. Fields of Wilshire
Boulevard Temple, say they first had to make the connection again for
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a lot of anger to work through," he said in an interview.
He said he was especially angry at what he saw as the failure of
moderate Muslims, including those in Los Angeles, to speak out
against the terror.</TE>
<TE>   Fields said he thought about his feelings, spoke with others and
spent time praying before remembering something he had learned long
ago from the wisdom of thousands of years of Jewish tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the answer now," he said in remarks prepared for delivery
Friday night. "History is not a flimsy course of disconnected
happenings. History bursts forth seeking repair for the absurdities
caused by brutality and suicidal tendencies. Not to pursue what our
sages called 'the climax of all blessings, peace' is to be unworthy
of our history and our destiny."</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Steven Carr Reuben of Kehillat Israel in Pacific Palisades
called the remembrance of Sept. 11 during the high holy days a
spiritual benefit. "The reality is, it was such a wake-up call for
all of us about the things that matter most in our lives--and that
really is the theme for me of what the high holiday season is all
about. It's about remembering who we are, who we can be, and the best
that's in us that we can be."</TE>
<TE>   In the small acts of kindness, a simple kiss, an embrace,
individual acts of heroism and giving, rabbis said, they saw hope for
the world.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond was among the rabbis who have recently visited Israel,
which has suffered 550 attacks over the past eight months that have
killed more than 600 Israelis, 30% of them women and children,
according to Fields.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in awe of Israeli families, families of friends of mine, who
sit down for breakfast in the morning and kiss their loved ones
goodbye and, given all that's happening, don't know if they'll be
reunited at dinnertime," Diamond said.</TE>
<TE>   Herscher was another who had visited Israel. "I encountered
people, despite everything that's going on, who are struggling to
make the lives of other people better and to help people live
decently. I sat in awe of them," Herscher said.</TE>
<TE>   The awe they felt is appropriate for the season, which is referred
to in Jewish tradition as the Days of Awe, the rabbis said.</TE>
<TE>   In Jewish tradition, on Rosh Hashana, God judges the world and
inscribes the names of those who will live and those who will die, as
well as those who will have good or bad lives. But, the tradition
holds, human repentance, prayer and good deeds can change the divine
decree before the book is sealed by God on Yom Kippur.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many forces over which we do not have control, but
we do have control of our lives," Diamond said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can help transform our own little world, if not the world at
large."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Reuben said, all people can be responsible for is
their own conduct. "For me, it's always a season to look within and
try to identify how I could be a better me in the year ahead, and to
think of people I have hurt and do my best to make amends to them.</TE>
<TE>   "It all starts personally before it can go globally, and
everything global is personal. Someone willing to get on a plane and
kill other human beings--whatever is going on with them, it's
personal."</TE>

<HD>Vlado Perlemuter, 98; Pianist Specialized in Ravel's Music</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vlado Perlemuter, a pianist who tried to capture the diverse colors
and tones of a symphony orchestra in his solo playing, has died, his
recording company said Friday. He was 98.</LD>
<LD>   Perlemuter, best known for his interpretations of Maurice Ravel
and Frederic Chopin, died Wednesday in a Paris hospital, said Adrian
Farmer, music director for the British record label Nimbus.</LD>
<LD>   Over a seven-decade career, Perlemuter performed throughout Europe
and in Asia, the United States and Canada. He was especially
well-loved in Britain, where he often played and taught. But he
neither sought nor attained the stardom of some contemporary
pianists.</LD>
<TE>   Perlemuter worked to give his interpretations an "orchestral"
sound, and would endlessly try out new fingerings in search of new
musical colors, Farmer said.</TE>
<TE>   Perlemuter was born in 1904 in Kaunas, Lithuania, to Polish
parents. After coming to Paris as a child, and taking French
nationality, he studied with the acclaimed teacher and performer
Alfred Cortot and won first prize at the Paris Conservatory at only
14.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1920s, Perlemuter, already a success, spent months
working with Ravel. Perlemuter's scores were covered with notes from
the master, and the pianist was generally considered the keeper of
Ravel's musical traditions for the piano.</TE>
<TE>   Once, for a Nimbus recording, Perlemuter sat down at the keyboard
and played more than two hours' worth of Ravel's music, nonstop. The
resulting recording was not edited or touched up, Farmer said.</TE>
<TE>   Perlemuter, a Jew, was forced to flee to Switzerland during World
War II. It was an experience he preferred not to talk about.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the great embitterment of his life," Farmer said,
especially because Cortot, with whom he was very close, did not leave
France with him.</TE>
<TE>   Perlemuter gave his last performance when he was approaching 90.
Farmer, who knew Perlemuter for the last two decades, said the
pianist would occasionally burst into tears after playing.</TE>
<TE>   "If you said, 'That was beautiful, what's wrong?' he would say,
'Yes, but I will never play it so well again.' "</TE>

<HD>Yuji Ichioka, 66; Led Way in Studying Lives of Asian
Americans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yuji Ichioka, a UCLA historian and community activist who coined the
term "Asian American" in the late 1960s to advance the rationale for
bringing diverse Asian groups together, has died. He was 66.</LD>
<LD>   Ichioka died Sunday of cancer in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   A founder of the UCLA Asian American Studies Center in 1969,
Ichioka was considered by many to be the nation's foremost authority
on Japanese American history.</LD>
<TE>   A man of many dimensions, the San Francisco-born scholar was known
not only for his pursuit of social justice and research to recover
the "buried past" of the early Japanese settlers, but also for his
zest for life: playing basketball, eating, drinking and traveling.</TE>
<TE>   Ichioka mastered Japanese to tackle the original sources of
immigrant life, such as diaries, letters and old newspapers. His
seminal work, "Issei: The World of the First Generation Japanese
Immigrants, 1885-1924," won the 1989 U.S. History Book Award of the
National Assn. for Asian American Studies.</TE>
<TE>   "Yuji was a complex man who had just a wonderful thirst for life,"
said Don T. Nakanishi, director of the UCLA Asian American Studies
Center, the nation's largest facility for Asian American studies
research. "On one hand, Yuji spent a lot of his time in quiet
contemplation of going through records [in Japanese] that nobody went
through, and on the other hand, he loved to interact with people."</TE>
<TE>   Nakanashi said Ichioka could be "cranky" at times, but at the same
time was "an incredibly supportive mentor" to many doctoral students,
professors and scholars.</TE>
<TE>   Scholars say Ichioka's contributions in compiling the Japanese
American Research Project Collection at UCLA has made it the nation's
largest and most significant historical archives on Japanese
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   They say his many articles and two of his books, "A Buried Past"
and "A Buried Past II," provided the foundation for Japanese American
studies.</TE>
<TE>   Ichioka was a man ahead of his times.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, when people of Asian ancestry totaled fewer than 1
million, compared to nearly 11.9 million in the 2000 census, the idea
of Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos and Koreans joining together for a
shared political purpose was unheard of. And the proposition that
Asians needed to forge an alliance with blacks, Latinos and Native
Americans to work on a common agenda was even more strange.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Ichioka created the first inter-ethnic pan-Asian American
political group. And he coined the term "Asian American" to frame a
new self-defining political lexicon. Before that, people of Asian
ancestry were generally called Oriental or Asiatic.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, when Black Panther leader Huey Newton was on trial in
Oakland, charged with killing a police officer, Ichioka marched with
the members of his newly created Asian American Political Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   He did not agree with Newton's politics, he told The Times in a
1997 interview, but he thought Newton, like all citizens, deserved to
be treated fairly by his government.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, UCLA established the Asian American Studies Center
and Ichioka taught the first course.</TE>
<TE>   His role in creating the academic discipline was a logical
outgrowth of his commitment to teach histories that weren't part of
the mainstream curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   More than 120 years after the first Japanese immigrants came,
Ichioka stands out as the researcher who documented and analyzed the
Japanese American experience from the immigrants' perspective.</TE>
<TE>   He gathered his materials over many years by talking families into
turning over from their garages and attics dusty trunks and boxes
left by their ancestors.</TE>
<TE>   "Yuji loved the people he wrote about," Nakanishi said. "He wanted
to capture what their life was really like."</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to the popular view, Asian immigrants weren't docile
people who only worked hard and kept to themselves, Ichioka once
said, but instead they fought the injustice of exploitive employers
with strikes and demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   Ichioka's firsthand experience with racism influenced his outlook
on social justice. His family was interned during World War II. He
also lived among blacks in Berkeley, and picked fruit alongside
Mexicans in the Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   After undergraduate studies at UCLA, he earned a master's degree
at UC Berkeley and did graduate work at Columbia, but decided not to
pursue a doctorate because he thought it was a "waste of time."</TE>
<TE>   For 33 years, Ichioka was senior researcher at the Asian American
Studies Center and an adjunct professor in the history department.</TE>
<TE>   "Yuji was not a scholar in the ivory tower," said San Francisco
civil rights attorney Don Tamaki.</TE>
<TE>   In a modern-day "Alien Land Law" dispute in which the San
Francisco YWCA claimed sole title to a historic building erected in
the 1920s in the city's Japantown, Ichioka uncovered a crucial
80-year-old diary proving that the property was actually held in
trust by the YWCA for the benefit of the Japanese American community.</TE>
<TE>   His research showed that the San Francisco YWCA merely held "paper
title" to circumvent laws barring Asian immigrants from owning real
estate, Tamaki said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even during difficult times [after the onset of cancer], Yuji
selflessly continued to work on the case, volunteering his expert
historical analysis," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Emma Gee, Ichioka's wife of more than 25 years, said Ichioka
remained himself no matter where he went.</TE>
<TE>   When he was a visiting professor at Tokyo University in 1999, he
kept a basketball in his office and dribbled in the room. It was an
unthinkable thing for a respected teacher in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Ichioka is survived by his mother, Sei,
and brothers Eddie and Victor, all of the San Francisco Bay Area; and
sisters Pat S. Traylor of La Jolla and Yowko Richardson of Portland,
Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Gee said a public memorial will be held in October. The family
requests that any donations be made to the Yuji Ichioka Endowed Chair
in Social Studies at UCLA, c/o UCLA Asian American Studies Center,
P.O. Box 951546, 3230 Campbell Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1546.</TE>

<HD>Karzai Discerns Al Qaeda in Shooting</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: President says his assailant had links to
terrorists, but he maintains that the impetus came from the slain
gunman alone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>President Hamid Karzai said Friday that an assassin who tried to kill
him the day before "had links to Al Qaeda," but he vowed that neither
the shooting nor a car bombing that killed at least 24 Afghans here
would divert his country from its road to recovery.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Karzai said the two attacks Thursday were the
acts of isolated individuals and "do not indicate serious problems"
in his nation.</LD>
<LD>   "Generally our security is good," he said.</LD>
<TE>   "But we should not forget that terrorists are active," Karzai
said. The bombing "proves that enemies of Afghanistan do not want us
to live in security."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Karzai's assertion that the attacks were carried out by
individuals, Afghan officials said that at least 14 people had been
detained in connection with the assassination attempt.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a recently hired bodyguard for an Afghan governor
fired on Karzai in the southern city of Kandahar, narrowly missing
the transitional president. U.S. Army Special Forces bodyguards, who
have been helping protect Karzai since July, killed the gunman. Two
other Afghans--a bystander and a bodyguard who was trying to subdue
the assailant--died in the shootout.</TE>
<TE>   The assassination attempt followed by several hours two bomb
blasts here in Kabul, the capital. The first bomb, hidden on or under
a bicycle, injured one or two people and drew a crowd of onlookers;
the second, three minutes later, exploded in a parked taxi and killed
at least 24 people.</TE>
<TE>   The city remained tense Friday, and signs of increased security
were evident at several locations.</TE>
<TE>   Officials released no details to suggest that the two events
Thursday were linked, but several said they believed that Al Qaeda
and the remnants of the deposed Taliban regime were involved.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Minister Taj Mohamad Wardak said in an interview that the
car bomb might have been aimed at him and another high-ranking
government official who had been staying in a hotel beside the bomb
site. The two men were not present when the blasts occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Wardak and his family had checked out of the Spinzar Hotel and
moved to a house in a residential district in Kabul just half an hour
before the blasts. Vice President Nematullah Shahrani also was a
regular guest at the hotel but had left Afghanistan for a visit to
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Wardak said officials had arrested one suspect in connection with
the bombing and were seeking another suspect, the owner of the taxi.
Identification left in the twisted wreckage had given investigators
hope of capturing him.</TE>
<TE>   Wardak suggested that the suspect being sought had ties to Osama
bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network. But the minister declined to
identify the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "Not every suspect has it written in his driver's license that
he's with Al Qaeda," he said when asked for details. "There are
different kinds of evidence."</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon on Friday, officials described the bombing as a
terrorist attack designed to maximize the killing of civilians. They
would not say whether they believed that it was related to the
attempt to assassinate Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   But Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said the attacks were
"clearly designed to undermine the efforts of the Afghan people and
the Afghan government to get the country back up on its feet."</TE>
<TE>   "We do know that there are Taliban remnants, as well as Al Qaeda,
who have been plotting these sorts of attacks," Clarke said. "And
these are exactly the sorts of tactics we associate with those
organizations."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military officials said the attack on Karzai had not altered
the recent decision to hand over responsibility for his security from
the U.S. Special Forces to the State Department's Diplomatic Security
Service at the end of the month. U.S. soldiers joined the bodyguard
detail after the slaying of Afghan Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir in
July.</TE>
<TE>   A top global security consultant, meanwhile, said there is little
more that the Green Berets protecting Karzai can do while still
allowing him to appear in public. He said the level of protection
rivals that of President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, they have treated Mr. Karzai as a significant
threat-prone protectee," said Jeff Schlanger, who heads the security
services group at Kroll Inc., an international security consulting
and private investigation firm. "There was never any question that he
is a prime target."</TE>
<TE>   Afghan officials have identified the slain gunman as Abdul Rahman,
22, of Helmand province, who had been hired three weeks earlier to
protect Kandahar Gov. Gul Agha Shirzai. A U.S. bodyguard and Shirzai
were injured in the attack, but not seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Discussing the assassination attempt, Karzai told reporters Friday
that he would try to be more careful about his own safety.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not be as reckless as I am," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan leader's father, then parliament speaker, was
assassinated in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai said of the bombers: "May God let us capture these people
and let us put them on trial so that people will see what the law
will do with them."</TE>
<TE>   The death toll in the bombing remained a matter of debate Friday.
Kabul's police chief put the figure at 24 dead, while Afghan radio
reported 26 people had been killed. Health Minister Suhaila Seddiqi
said the death toll had risen to 30, with 167 people injured,
Associated Press reported.</TE>
<TE>   At the Ali Abad Hospital, Gulam Sayed stood vigil Friday at the
bedside of his 12-year-old grandson, Haroom Mirbabajee, who suffered
head and shoulder cuts in the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "After the first, smaller bomb, I noticed my grandson playing on
the other side of the street rushing to where the blast came from,"
Sayed said. "I shouted to him that he should stay away, that
attracting a crowd with a small explosion was an old terrorist trick,
but he did not hear me."</TE>

<HD>Arabs Tell Iraq to Readmit Inspectors</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Some seeking arms monitors' return fear effects of
U.S. attack. Others want Hussein out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Arab leaders are quietly pressuring Iraq to allow U.N. weapons
inspectors back, with some warning that if Saddam Hussein doesn't do
so they will drop their vocal opposition to American military action,
according to sources in the region.</LD>
<LD>   The behind-the-scenes emphasis on the return of weapons inspectors
is coming from two factions within the Arab community. Some countries
fear that a U.S. attack on Iraq will destabilize the region, and
believe that the only chance to avoid that is to have weapons
inspectors on the ground. Other nations, which have made no secret of
their own desire to see the Iraqi president ousted from power, are
looking for an excuse to jump off the bandwagon of united Arab
support for his regime.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a kind of shuttling of positions," said Abdel Moneim
Said, director of the Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic
Studies, Egypt's most prestigious think tank. "Iraq is hearing, 'Let
inspectors in or we can't defend you' and 'You do it or we are out.'
"</LD>
<TE>   Hussein has so far succeeded in rallying Arabs behind his
beleaguered regime with the cry that "an attack on Iraq is an attack
on the whole Arab nation." His emissaries have traveled the Arab
world, standing side by side with leaders from Syria to Qatar and in
each case enjoying a public endorsement of support.</TE>
<TE>   But privately, the emissaries are getting a second message as
well, and that is about the need to let weapons inspectors back in,
according to Moneim Said and diplomatic sources in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq was forced to admit inspectors after the 1991 Persian Gulf
War, during which a U.S.-led coalition expelled Iraqi forces from
Kuwait. The United Nations has imposed severe trade sanctions until
inspectors confirm that the regime has destroyed all weapons of mass
destruction and its ability to produce more. Inspectors were
withdrawn in 1998 ahead of U.S. airstrikes and have been blocked from
returning by the Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   The success or failure of the Arab community in pushing Iraq to
readmit inspectors could have a significant impact on U.S. plans.
Though some officials in Washington have said the White House does
not believe that the return of weapons monitors will make much
difference to the U.S. plans, there is a broad feeling here that the
Bush administration at least would have to give inspections a chance.</TE>
<TE>   If Baghdad continues to block the return of inspectors, that could
give strategic Gulf countries a face-saving way to allow the U.S.
military use of their territory for launching an attack. Both Kuwait
and Qatar are permitting bases that would be vital to any such
action.</TE>
<TE>   King Abdullah II of Jordan, whose nation borders Iraq and could
find itself called upon to help the U.S. in the event of an invasion,
recently linked the potential for an invasion to Iraq's own behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to offer all we can for Iraq," he said in an
address to his nation. "But the decision in the end is that of the
Iraqi leadership. They bear the responsibility in front of their
people, nation and the world."</TE>
<TE>   But the pressure on Hussein has been tempered, at least in public,
by leaders who are mindful of public sentiment throughout the Arab
world. People in the streets are solidly behind Iraq--if not Hussein
personally--and against what is seen as the threat of American
aggression.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, sources said, Hussein's emissaries have
indicated that Baghdad is perhaps willing to let inspectors in but is
looking for a way to do so without appearing to cave in to American
demands. Iraq has insisted, and its Arab allies have publicly stated,
that the return of inspectors must be linked to a timetable for the
lifting of sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   "They are trying to put it in a way that will make him [Hussein]
look good," said Moneim Said. Iraqi officials have expressed various
opinions publicly about whether the regime is prepared to accept
monitors. Some officials, such as Information Minister Mohammed Said
Sahaf, have said that inspectors finished their work and will never
be allowed to return. Foreign Minister Naji Sabri has said Iraq is
open to the idea of inspectors returning but is concerned that the
U.S. will use them as spies.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab League ended a two-day meeting in Cairo this week with a
communique that rejected an attack on Iraq but called on Baghdad to
comply with all U.N. resolutions. The league spokesman said that
implicit in that was a call for the return of monitors.</TE>
<TE>   "The return of the inspectors is an important step ... and serious
discussions are underway between Iraq and the United Nations right
now," league Secretary-General Amr Moussa said at a news conference
Thursday.</TE>

<LD>   The attack Thursday night destroyed the main exhibition of the

drove concentration camp inmates deeper into Germany as the Soviet
army advanced at the end of World War II, with 700 to 800 prisoners
dying of exhaustion or hunger.</LD>

<LD>An American airstrike that killed dozens of Afghan civilians at a

from the ground, a U.S. military investigation concluded.</LD>
<LD>   A summary of the investigation report said those who were firing
at U.S. aircraft were to blame.</LD>
<LD>   "While the coalition regrets the loss of innocent lives, the ...
operators of those weapons elected to place them in civilian
communities," the report said.</LD>
<TE>   Afghan authorities say 48 civilians were killed in the attacks
July 1 in Oruzgan province. The U.S. put the number of dead at 34.</TE>

drew to an end, but analysis could take months, police said.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,200 of the island's 1,632 permanent residents between
15 and 70 years old had volunteered their fingerprints to authorities
looking for the killer of Janelle Patton, 29, of Sydney.</LD>
<LD>   Patton's body was found March 31, stabbed and partly wrapped in
plastic beside a waterfall. Police also want the prints of 680
Australian and New Zealand tourists visiting at the time of the
slaying.</LD>

<LD>   Experts leading a $20-million project to return Keiko to the wild

last week to leave the whale alone. Local officials said the ban was

<DH>Caucasus: A Russian official says Moscow's forces will
co-patrol Pankisi. Georgia says no.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAKU, Azerbaijan</DL>
<LD>Russia's interior minister said he reached an agreement with Georgian
officials Friday to conduct joint operations in the Pankisi Gorge
after months of tension over the crime-infested area bordering
Chechnya, but a Georgian official said no Russian forces would enter
the gorge.</LD>
<LD>   Georgia recently started its own operation in the gorge and has
repeatedly refused Russia's offers to help rid the area of Chechen
rebels, who Moscow says use Pankisi as a base and a supply line.
Russian officials have scorned the Georgian efforts as a sham.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking here in the Azerbaijani capital, Russian Interior
Minister Boris Gryzlov said he and his Georgian counterpart had
agreed to conduct a joint search for militants in the gorge,
according to the Interfax and Itar-Tass news agencies.</LD>
<TE>   "We are talking about a joint search. The Georgian side will carry
out the detentions independently. Once the members of the bandit
groups are identified, it won't be too hard to catch them," Interfax
quoted Gryzlov as saying.</TE>
<TE>   In the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, Interior Ministry spokesman
Paata Gomelauri said Russia could help Georgian authorities arrest
suspects in crimes committed on Russian territory--if Moscow was able
to provide specifics about them. But he said there would be no
Russian presence in the gorge.</TE>
<TE>   In Baku, Georgian Interior Minister Koba Narchemashvili said, "We
can bring order ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry criticized Georgia's
operation in Pankisi and reiterated Moscow's demand that Georgia
disarm the alleged rebels on its territory and hand them over to
Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Moscow has long accused Georgia of sheltering Chechen rebels,
while Georgia has countered that Russia pushed the militants into
Georgian territory in the first place when it launched its second war
in Chechnya in five years. The United States believes some of the
militants could be linked to Al Qaeda.</TE>

<HD>Indian Rights Law Is Upheld in Mexico</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Supreme Court rejects challenge to limits on
autonomy. Violence by rebels is feared.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court upheld Mexico's year-old Indian rights law Friday,
rejecting a challenge by Zapatista rebel supporters and 319
indigenous municipalities who claimed that they were not consulted
about amendments limiting Indian self-rule.</LD>
<LD>   Indigenous leaders said the ruling could trigger new violence in
southern Mexico, where Zapatista rebels staged an armed uprising in
1994. An 8-year-old cease-fire is shaky, the rebels still have their
weapons, and their movement for Indian autonomy has spread from
Chiapas to other Mexican states.</LD>
<LD>   The Law on Indian Rights and Culture, a constitutional reform that
took five years to pass, was the government's main offer in talks to
end the rebellion. Instead, it prompted the Zapatista Front, the
rebels' civilian arm, to break off contacts with the government and
back the effort to overturn the law in court.</LD>
<TE>   All 11 judges ruled that the law was both constitutional and
properly approved by Congress and a majority of Mexico's 31 state
legislatures. Eight judges said the court had no jurisdiction to hear
the challenge by Indian communities from nine southern states.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique Avela, a Zapatista spokesman in Mexico City, called the
ruling "a tragedy" for the impoverished Indian minority.</TE>
<TE>   "This sends a message that peaceful mobilization doesn't work,"
said Hector Sanchez Lopez, an Indian who heads the Indian Affairs
Commission in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The law was meant to reshape the relationship between the state
and the 62 Indian groups that account for about 10% of Mexico's 100
million people. It empowers indigenous communities to apply their own
traditional customs in resolving conflicts and electing leaders, to
preserve their own languages and to decide whether land will be held
communally or by individuals. Those principles were part of a 1996
cease-fire accord in Chiapas and the bill that President Vicente Fox
submitted to Congress shortly after taking office in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Subcommander Marcos, the Zapatista leader, made passage of the
bill a condition for peace negotiations. He led a 16-day caravan
through southern Mexico in February and March 2001 to lobby for the
legislation. Masked Zapatista rebels made a dramatic appearance in
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But lawmakers weakened the bill. They added a clause giving state
legislatures power to recognize Indian peoples, based on
ethno-linguistic criteria and physical location. Congress also
limited the right of Indian communities to collective use of natural
resources, saying they must respect private-property rights of
non-Indians who live in their midst.</TE>
<TE>   Indian leaders said the law, as amended, failed to meet
international standards for protecting indigenous rights. In the
Supreme Court, they argued that the law, by giving each state the
authority to define an indigenous group, works against large Indian
groups whose territories span several states.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers involved in the Indians' case said they might appeal to
international courts.</TE>
<TE>   Only the states of Oaxaca and Mexico have taken steps to implement
the Indian rights law. Tired of waiting, 25 indigenous communities in
Chiapas have declared self-rule without legal recognition, creating
land disputes with local authorities in some parts of the state. Two
Zapatista leaders were shot to death in one such conflict last week
in the jungle-ringed Chiapas city of Ocosingo.</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo Trejo, an Indian affairs specialist at Mexico City's
Center for Economic Research and Teaching, said indigenous
communities in three other southern states are on the verge of
declaring de facto self-rule. After the court ruling, he said, "we
can expect more civil disobedience, perhaps more violence."</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of the bill say the amendments were needed to prevent
conflict between federal and state authority in Indian areas.
Fernando Perez Noriega of Fox's National Action Party applauded the
court ruling, saying, "The Zapatista Front now has no excuse but to
sit down to peace talks."</TE>

<HD>Army Finds No Fault in Deaths of 12 Palestinians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>An internal army investigation on Friday cleared Israeli soldiers who
killed 12 Palestinians in three incidents last week, prompting angry
Palestinian complaints of a whitewash. None of those killed carried
firearms.</LD>
<LD>   The report said that in two cases--the deaths of four farmers in
the Gaza Strip and the deaths of four quarry laborers in the West
Bank--the Palestinians were moving in a suspicious manner in areas
that are off limits to civilians and that soldiers acted according to
regulations when they opened fire.</LD>
<LD>   In the third incident, in which two Palestinian children and two
teenagers were killed in a missile attack on suspected militants, one
of the missiles missed the target, apparently because of a technical
problem, the report said.</LD>
<TE>   Military officials said that the quarry workers had been masked
and armed with an ax and that there was "a possibility" they were en
route to an attack. The teens killed in the missile attack were
accomplices of the wanted militiamen, the officials said.
Palestinians have insisted all 12 were civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian Cabinet minister, said it was "shameful
for Israel not to bring to justice those who kill innocent children,
innocent mothers in cold blood."</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, Israel imposed curfews on most West Bank towns and
froze Palestinian travel to keep out militants on the Jewish New
Year, confining more than 630,000 Palestinians to their homes.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip, Israeli army vehicles surrounded the central
town of Deir al Balah and arrested a local militant leader, security
sources and witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   They said Maher Bashir, a local leader of the militant Islamic
Jihad group, was detained along with two of his brothers.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Jenin, Palestinian witnesses said Israeli
soldiers raided a militant hide-out and shot Kamal Silawi of the Al
Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and another militant, Samir Qandil.</TE>
<TE>   The army said that it had spotted the two armed men during an
Israeli-imposed curfew and that they were shot during a battle.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TAIPEI, Taiwan</DL>
<LD>A typhoon pounded Taiwan with strong winds and heavy rain today,
forcing more than 1,000 people to evacuate and leaving at least two
people missing. But there were no immediate reports of major damage.</LD>
<LD>   Taiwan has been on alert for Typhoon Sinlaku since Friday, with
financial markets, businesses and schools closed and domestic flights
canceled.</LD>
<LD>   The storm was heading toward China's southeastern coast with
maximum sustained winds of 90 mph and gusts of up to 112 mph.</LD>
<TE>   The Central Weather Bureau said Sinlaku could dump as many as 27
inches of rain on the island, with mudslides and floods possible.
Some mountainous areas already had 16 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Two people were missing in the storm, including a woman who was
swept away by high seas in eastern Hualien, the government's disaster
relief center said. There were no details on the second person.</TE>
<TE>   Seven hikers had lost contact with the authorities, but they were
not believed to be in danger, officials said. More than 1,000 people
were forced to evacuate because of the danger of floods and
mudslides.</TE>
<TE>   Sinlaku, named after the Micronesian goddess of breadfruit,
battered Japan's Okinawa island Thursday, leaving five Philippine
sailors missing and injuring at least 29 people.</TE>
<TE>   The storm comes less than a week after Typhoon Rusa hit Japan and
the Korean peninsula, killing at least 138 in South Korea.</TE>

<HD>Germany Arrests Couple in Alleged Anti-U.S. Plot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY FLEISHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>A Turkish man and his American fiancee, who worked in a supermarket
on the U.S. military base in Heidelberg, were arrested with
bomb-making materials and nearly 300 pounds of chemicals in an
alleged terrorist plot to strike American targets on the anniversary
of Sept. 11, German authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The 25-year-old Turkish man was described by German law
enforcement officials as a "fan" of Osama bin Laden. He kept a photo
of the Al Qaeda leader in his apartment, along with Islamic writings
and a book about constructing bombs.</LD>
<LD>   The Heidelberg base where his 23-year-old fiancee worked is the
U.S. Army's European headquarters and home to 16,000 soldiers and
civilians.</LD>
<TE>   "We suspect that they intended to mount a bomb attack against
military installations and the city of Heidelberg," said Thomas
Schaeuble, interior minister for Baden-Wuerttemberg state. He added
that the Turkish man, who worked at a chemical warehouse in southern
Germany, "seems to be a follower of Osama bin Laden who is deeply
religious and harbors a hatred for Americans and Jews."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't clear whether the man is a German citizen. Germany has a
large population of Turkish immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The couple were arrested Thursday when German police, acting on a
tip from U.S. authorities, searched their apartment in the town of
Walldorf, about five miles south of Heidelberg. Authorities said they
confiscated five shells used for manufacturing pipe bombs and 287
pounds of chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   The names of the suspects were withheld, and state authorities
released no information directly linking the couple to Al Qaeda or
other terrorist networks. The suspects have not been charged, and are
still under investigation by state officials.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities investigating Al Qaeda and other militant
groups have yet to file charges. A federal charge of terrorism under
German law would require at least three conspirators.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we must examine whether [the Turkish man] was acting alone or
whether there were structures behind this," Schaeuble said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the suspects are freelancers or linked to a broader
terrorist organization, their arrests became part of an unnerving
flurry of alleged terrorist activity leading up to Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   German and U.S. officials also announced Friday the August arrest
in New York of an Afghan-born German. The 39-year-old man, in custody
in Virginia, is from Hamburg, the city that spawned the terrorist
cell linked to Mohamed Atta and other Sept. 11 hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, federal prosecutors in Germany filed charges against
Mounir Motassadeq, a Moroccan citizen living in Hamburg, for his
alleged participation in the Sept. 11 attacks. Last week, a Swede of
Tunisian origin carrying a handgun in his toiletries bag was detained
in Sweden on preliminary charges of attempting to hijack a plane
bound for Britain. Authorities in the Netherlands were keeping seven
people in jail on suspicion of terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has been urged by the U.S. to track down Al Qaeda remnants
and sleeper cells. The investigations have accrued a political tint
as opponents of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder charge that Germany's
aggressive anti-terrorism effort comes as the chancellor is seeking
an uphill reelection.</TE>
<TE>   This week, German Interior Minister Otto Schily said law
enforcement agencies have investigated 500 leads of potential attacks
since Sept. 11. In each case, there was insufficient evidence to
prove a serious, well-orchestrated plot, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot rule out that sleeper agents live even here in Germany
or in Europe or elsewhere," said Ulrich Kersten, chief of Germany's
Federal Crime Agency. "What we know for sure is that in Europe and in
Germany there are people ready to commit violence in a jihad," or
holy struggle.</TE>
<TE>   German authorities said they are unsure whether there is a large
conspiracy behind the alleged plot to attack the Heidelberg base.
Both suspects have ideal jobs for potential terrorists: The Turkish
man works in a chemical warehouse, and his fiancee, who has both
German and American citizenship, has a U.S.-issued identification
card that would provide access to certain parts of the base.</TE>
<TE>   German officials said they are in the early stages of
interrogations.</TE>
<TE>   There is "no concrete evidence of ties to other persons," said
Stefan Keilbach, spokesman for the Baden-Wuerttemberg Interior
Ministry. "It's very difficult at this point to draw conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Army spokesman Sandy Goss told Associated Press that he had
no details of the base being targeted. "All I know is there were two
people arrested and we're monitoring the situation closely because we
take all these reports seriously."</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon, officials also said they could provide few
additional details on the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Army installation at Heidelberg has been attacked twice
by terrorists. In 1972, three soldiers were killed and five hurt when
two car bombs were detonated by the leftist Red Army Faction. In
1981, the chief of U.S. land forces in Europe, Gen. Frederick
Kroesen, and his wife survived a shooting attack on their car.</TE>

<HD>Bush Solicits Foreign Allies on Iraq Plan</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: President and the British premier, who will meet
today, face an uphill battle to win support from three other key U.N.
members.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush launched a diplomatic offensive Friday with calls to
the leaders of Russia, China and France in which he appealed for
collaboration in dealing with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and he
prepared for talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair today to
coordinate a strategy to take to the United Nations next week.</LD>
<LD>   The calls drew a warning from Russia's president against military
action and caution from France's leader that U.N. approval must
precede any attack.</LD>
<LD>   The summit at Camp David in Maryland will focus on whether to
introduce a U.N. resolution that would toughen the terms requiring
Iraq to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction, according to U.S.
officials. The United States and Britain are hoping to redefine the
existing U.N. framework for disarming Iraq by adding a time element
and the threat of force to back it up.</LD>
<TE>   Bush and Blair will discuss imposing a deadline on Baghdad for
eliminating nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, possibly within
six months to a year--a schedule that former U.N. weapons inspectors
believe is not feasible. Bush will also press for a zero-tolerance,
or "one strike and you're out" clause, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   An Iraqi violation then would justify the use of force against
Hussein's government.</TE>
<TE>   "The minute [Hussein] blinks and the Iraqis say that the
inspectors can't go to a palace or that they have to wait because
[Hussein] is there and he needs time to leave, that's it," said a
State Department official who requested anonymity. "The clock
stops--and Iraq will be in material breach of a U.N. resolution, with
all that implies.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to make clear this is the last chance," the official
said. "He can't fudge or 'cheat and retreat' again and get away with
it. And he will pay the heaviest price if he does."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and Britain, permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, also hope to work out a broad strategy for winning support
of the other three permanent members--Russia, China and France--as
well as the wider world, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush and Blair can agree on specifics, Britain would introduce
a draft resolution after the president speaks at the United Nations
on Thursday, according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   Both nations would also present a more detailed case against
Hussein. Britain is expected to make public as early as next week a
document outlining the danger Baghdad poses, while the U.S. has
compiled two dossiers to be hand-carried by special teams assigned to
brief dozens of governments over the next few weeks, according to
U.S. and British sources.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Blair on Friday began consultations with Russia, China,
France and other key governments to convince them that the time has
come to get tough on Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said the
contacts were intended "to begin this process of collaboration, to do
exactly what the world would expect and exactly what the world
deserves, which is a free exchange of information, a discussion about
the consequences and the risks."</TE>
<TE>   But based on initial reaction, Bush and Blair face an uphill
battle. Russian President Vladimir V. Putin rebuffed both leaders
with warnings that an attack on Iraq would be unjustified and
globally disruptive.</TE>
<TE>   "During the conversation, the Russian president expressed strong
doubts regarding the grounds for the possible use of force against
Iraq, from the point of view of international law and policy,"
presidential spokesman Alexei Gromov told Russian news agencies about
the Bush call.</TE>
<TE>   "Putin underscored the need to coordinate political and diplomatic
efforts to implement existing U.N. Security Council resolutions on
Iraq," Gromov said. He added that Putin urged Bush to find a common
strategy with other world leaders on ways to improve global security
and the war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Putin told Blair that he saw "real potential" for a peaceful
resolution of the standoff over Iraq's alleged buildup of weapons of
mass destruction and its refusal to allow the return of U.N. weapons
monitors. Putin warned both leaders that he could see no legal basis
for waging war against Iraq and that such aggression could lead to
"serious, negative consequences" for the global coalition against
terrorism and the troubled search for peace in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Blair also met Friday with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al
Faisal, who delivered a letter from Crown Prince Abdullah expressing
the kingdom's discomfort with the heated talk about an attack on
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The content of the letter reflects on the current state of
affairs at this critical juncture and on the need for a united stand
that could save the region from danger and lead to a stability based
on a just and comprehensive peace," the Saudi Embassy in London said
in a statement released after the meeting. The crown prince has in
effect ruled Saudi Arabia since 1996 because King Fahd is in poor
health.</TE>
<TE>   In Moscow, other senior Russian officials added their voices to
Putin's warnings that any strike against Iraq would have grave
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe a policy of diplomatic steps and decisions might allow
us to find a long-term settlement of the situation around Iraq, which
would meet the interests of regional stability," Foreign Minister
Igor S. Ivanov told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   In a veiled warning to Washington, Deputy Foreign Minister Yuri
Fedotov indicated that Russia would be unwilling to sign off on any
proposal presented to the U.N. Security Council that allowed armed
intervention to force the inspections. "The Russian delegation
expects that the issue of a military operation will not be raised in
the Security Council and that we will not have to make a decision on
it," the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.</TE>
<TE>   In France, President Jacques Chirac told Bush that the return of
inspectors is the best course of action--and that no military assault
should take place without the backing of the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   If Hussein's government refuses to accept the U.N. inspections,
"it is up to the Security Council to take the appropriate measures,"
and "those measures should be decided at that moment," the French
leader said, according to spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese officials provided few details about Bush's call to
President Jiang Zemin.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer, Bush's spokesman, countered that Russia, France and
China remain "open to the president's ideas and they want to listen."
He added: "They have some thoughts of their own, of course."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if any of the leaders Bush spoke with flatly opposed the
president's proposed course, Fleischer said: "No, the president did
not hear that message."</TE>
<TE>   The White House also came under pressure from congressional
leaders, who said they will press for more evidence on the dangers
represented by Hussein's government and arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of our questions were answered, but there are a lot more out
there that need to be addressed before we can make any conclusive
decision on what needs to be done," Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) said on NBC's "Today" show.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said Congress will need
to spend a significant amount of time in a "very deep and rigorous
examination of facts" before deciding whether to give formal approval
to the White House to take action against Hussein.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of the late rap star Notorious B.I.G. denied Friday that
he played a role in the murder of rival Tupac Shakur.</LD>
<LD>   The family issued the statement in response to a Los Angeles Times
story that reconstructed the killing of Shakur in Las Vegas in
September 1996. The article reported that Shakur was attacked by
members of a Compton gang called the Southside Crips, and that
Notorious B.I.G. provided the gun and agreed to pay the gang $1
million.</LD>
<LD>   Notorious B.I.G., whose real name was Christopher Wallace, was
shot dead six months later in Los Angeles. His killing remains
unsolved.</LD>
<TE>   In the statement, Wallace's family described the Times story as
"irresponsible journalism."</TE>
<TE>   "Christopher Wallace was at his home in New Jersey on the night of
Tupac Shakur's murder, with friends who will continue to testify for
his whereabouts since he is unable to defend himself," the statement
said. (The complete text is available at www.latimes.com /statement.)</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Wallace's estate, Londell McMillan, also
criticized the article. "The story is patently false," McMillan said.
"There have been numerous witnesses who have surfaced that clearly
put Christopher in New York and New Jersey on Sept. 7, 1996," the
night Shakur was shot.</TE>
<TE>   One of Wallace's friends, rapper Lil' Cease, asserted Friday that
he and Wallace were at Wallace's home in Teaneck, N.J., that night.</TE>
<TE>   The Times account was based on court documents and interviews with
police investigators and gang members, including witnesses to the
crime. It said Wallace was in Las Vegas on the weekend of the
shooting, registered at a hotel under a false name.</TE>
<TE>   Shakur, other rap-industry figures and Los Angeles gang members
also were in town, to attend a heavyweight boxing match.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace was closely tied to the Southside Crips, whose members
often provided security for him.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace and Shakur, once close friends, had become bitter rivals
who exchanged insults and threats on recordings, in concerts and at
music-industry awards shows.</TE>
<TE>   Before publishing its story, The Times sought comment from
Wallace's mother, Voletta. Through a lawyer, she declined to comment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS--Six years ago today, rap and film star Tupac Shakur was
fatally wounded in a drive-by shooting on a crowded street a block
from the Las Vegas Strip.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the public setting and the victim's notoriety, no one has
ever been arrested for the killing. Shakur's family, many of his
followers and some black entertainers cite the case as evidence of a
double standard in the justice system. Had a white celebrity been
gunned down in the open, they contend, police would have found those
responsible without delay.</LD>
<LD>   Las Vegas police say their investigation stalled not for lack of
effort, but because witnesses in Shakur's entourage refused to
cooperate.</LD>
<TE>   That, however, is only part of the explanation. A Times review
found that police committed a string of costly missteps:</TE>
<TE>   * They discounted an incident, hours before the shooting, in which
Shakur took part in the beating of a gang member in a Las Vegas hotel
lobby.</TE>
<TE>   * They failed to follow up with a member of Shakur's entourage who
witnessed the shooting and told police he might be able to identify
one or more of the assailants. The witness was killed several weeks
later in an unrelated shooting.</TE>
<TE>   * They did not pursue a lead about a sighting of a rented white
Cadillac similar to the car from which the fatal shots were fired at
Shakur and in which the assailants escaped.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas homicide Sgt. Kevin Manning, who oversaw the
investigation, defended his department's work. He said detectives
fielded thousands of phone tips, interviewed hundreds of witnesses
and chased numerous leads during a year when the homicide unit was
besieged with a record 168 murders.</TE>
<TE>   "Tupac got the same treatment as any other homicide here," said
Manning. "But you know what? We can't do it alone. We rely on
cooperative citizens to step forward and help us solve crimes. And in
Tupac's case, we got no cooperation whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported Friday that court documents as well as
interviews with investigators and gang members, including witnesses
to the crime, indicate that Shakur was attacked by the Southside
Crips, a Compton gang, to avenge the earlier beating of one of their
members. The Times also reported that the man who had been beaten
fired the fatal shots.</TE>
<TE>   The following account of how the Las Vegas police investigation
went aground is based on the same sources and on interviews with
Nevada police, six Los Angeles-area investigators involved in the
probe and three independent gang experts.</TE>
<TE>   Gang killings are extremely difficult to solve because there is
usually little evidence and few witnesses are willing to talk.
Shakur's associates were particularly unlikely to volunteer
information. Like the rapper himself, many had criminal records and a
deep-seated hostility toward police. To some extent, the feeling was
mutual: Shakur first gained notoriety with lyrics depicting violence
against police.</TE>
<TE>   There was a deeper problem: Las Vegas police were slow to grasp
that the roots of the killing lay in a feud between rival gangs in
Compton, and were slow to act once they did realize it. To identify
those responsible, police would have to take their investigation to
Compton and develop informants within the gangs.</TE>
<TE>   The Vegas cops were ill-suited to do that. They had little
experience with gang investigations or gang culture. The Compton
Police Department did have entree to the gang underworld. Its
investigators had known many gang members since they were babies.
They took their first mug shots. They testified at their trials. They
visited them in jail. In return, they often got valuable information.</TE>
<TE>   But Las Vegas police worried that the Compton investigators were
too close to the gangs and their rap-industry patrons and might leak
information. The Vegas detectives kept their distance from the gang
squad, and their investigation quickly hit a dead end.</TE>
<TE>   "How is a cop from Vegas supposed to go out to Compton and get a
powerful street gang to cooperate in a murder probe?" asked Jared
Lewis, a Modesto police detective who is director of Know Gangs, a
group that presents seminars on gang homicides for police agencies
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "Gang homicide investigations are very complex," he said. "This
was no easy case to solve, by any stretch of the imagination. I can
understand why it ended up the way it has."</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 7, 1996</TE>
<TE>   On the evening of Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur and his record company
chief, Marion "Suge" Knight, attended the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon
heavyweight boxing match at the MGM Grand Hotel. Also in Las Vegas
for the fight were scores of gang members from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   As he was leaving the hotel after the fight, Shakur attacked a man
in the MGM lobby. Shakur's bodyguards and Knight joined in the
beating. The victim was Orlando Anderson, 21, a member of the
Southside Crips. Shakur and Knight were affiliated with a rival
Compton gang, the Mob Piru Bloods. Shakur's bodyguards were members
of the Bloods.</TE>
<TE>   The Bloods had been spoiling for revenge against Anderson because
he had beaten one of their members at a Lakewood shopping mall
several weeks earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the attack on Anderson became the basis for another act of
retaliation--this time against Shakur. The rap star was shot 2 1/2
hours later as he and Knight waited at a red light on a street
teeming with tourists and other onlookers. The shots were fired from
a white Cadillac carrying four Crips. Shakur suffered massive chest
wounds and died a week later.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the shooting, the assailants returned to
Compton, where they bragged to their friends and girlfriends. The
Compton gang unit was soon deluged with tips implicating the Crips
and "Baby Lane," Anderson's gang nickname. Informants reported that
Anderson had been seen brandishing a Glock semiautomatic pistol, the
kind of weapon used to kill Shakur. Investigators passed this
information on to Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas police had heard about the beating in the MGM Grand
lobby and reviewed a security videotape of it. But they did not know
who Anderson was or why the incident mattered. Manning, the homicide
commander, issued a statement at the time saying, "Investigators have
no reason ... to believe that the altercation has any connection to
the shooting."</TE>
<TE>   A week after the shooting, Compton gang investigators reviewed the
videotape at the request of Las Vegas police. They identified the
beating victim as Anderson, explained his gang affiliation and said
the bodyguards seen flailing at him were Bloods.</TE>
<TE>   "We told Vegas right then we thought the Southside Crips were
responsible for the murder and that Orlando was the shooter," said
Bobby Ladd, then a homicide investigator with the Compton gang unit
and now a Garden Grove police officer.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas police stuck to their position that the beating was
irrelevant. Manning told an interviewer, "It appears to be just an
individual who was walking through the MGM and got into an argument
with Tupac.... He probably didn't even know it was Tupac Shakur."</TE>
<TE>   Having ruled Anderson out as a suspect, Las Vegas police did not
try to track him down for questioning or show his photograph to
members of Shakur's entourage, a dozen of whom remained in Las Vegas
for a week after the shooting while the rapper fought for his life in
a local hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Police also failed to retrieve additional security video that
might have captured Anderson's movements after he was beaten.
Security cameras are pervasive in Las Vegas, sweeping hotel lobbies,
hallways, parking areas and other public places around the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Crips gang members say Anderson and his accomplices passed in
front of video cameras as they gathered at the Treasure Island and
MGM Grand hotels to plot the killing and, later that night, when they
picked up the white Cadillac in the valet parking circle outside
Treasure Island.</TE>
<TE>   Because casinos routinely tape over surveillance footage every
seven days, the potential evidence was lost.</TE>
<TE>   "Overlooking the gang fight at the MGM was a mistake," said Wes
McBride, president of the California Gang Investigators Assn. A
retired gang intelligence sergeant for the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department's Operation Safe Streets division, McBride runs
a gang training program for police academies.</TE>
<TE>   "In gang culture, that fight was a killing offense," he said. "If
you embarrass a gang member in public, they will retaliate with a
vengeance."</TE>
<TE>   Lou Savelli, a New York gang-unit sergeant and vice president of
the East Coast Gang Investigators Assn., concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "If a drive-by shooting happened in New York and we found out that
there was a gang beating three hours earlier involving the murder
victim, I guarantee that would be my No. 1 lead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Manning now says Las Vegas police may have misjudged the
significance of the fight in the MGM lobby. In a recent interview, he
said police discounted Anderson as a suspect based on information
that he had been detained by hotel security long enough that he would
not have had time to arm himself and organize the Crips' ambush of
Shakur several hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Manning said that information had proved incorrect. He declined to
elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Working With Gang Members</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say it takes special effort to develop a rapport
with gang members. Because gang culture places a premium on respect,
gang detectives will treat thugs and their families with great
courtesy, even deference. In return, they sometimes provide
confidential information that helps solve crimes.</TE>
<TE>   That did not happen in the Shakur case.</TE>
<TE>   From their first moments on the scene, Las Vegas police
unintentionally alienated the witnesses most likely to be able to
identify the rapper's assailants. After summoning an ambulance for
Shakur, police ordered Knight, bleeding from a head wound, and other
members of Shakur's entourage out of their cars at gunpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "The police shoved guns in our faces and threatened us," said
rapper E.D.I. Mean, who was in the car directly behind Shakur's.
"They made us lie face down in the middle of the street. Even after
they realized we were telling the truth, they never apologized."</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas police say they had no way of knowing at first whether
Knight and the others were victims or suspects. After establishing
that they were the former, patrol officers had them sit along a curb
until homicide detectives arrived. That took nearly two hours.</TE>
<TE>   Then Manning and his men ushered the witnesses one by one into
squad cars and took their statements.</TE>
<TE>   They were, Manning said, "extremely uncooperative." Knight,
founder of Death Row Records in Los Angeles, summed up relations
between the witnesses and the police during an interview with
ABC-TV's "PrimeTime Live" two months later. Knight said that even if
he knew who killed Shakur, he would not tell Las Vegas authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not my job," he said. "I don't get paid to solve homicides.
I don't get paid to tell on people."</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas detectives were disgusted. "It's the typical gang
mentality," Manning said. "Their best friend got shot and nobody saw
nothing. The way I see it, if somebody tells me they don't want to
talk, what's the point of calling them back over and over again? In
this country, citizens have rights."</TE>
<TE>   There was, however, one witness willing to help: a 19-year-old
rapper named Yafeu "Kadafi" Fula. He had spent part of his childhood
in the same households as Shakur and was particularly close to him.
Fula, who was with Mean in the car behind Shakur's that night, told
police he might be able to identify one or more of the assailants.</TE>
<TE>   Fula was among the dozen or so members of Shakur's circle who
remained in Las Vegas after the shooting, keeping vigil at University
Medical Center, where Shakur was on life support. During that week,
detectives made no attempt to follow up with Fula.</TE>
<TE>   His only contact with police was confrontational. On Sept. 9, two
nights after the shooting, patrol officers stopped a motorist outside
the hospital. Fula and some other Shakur associates who knew the man
protested and got into a scuffle with police. Fula was handcuffed and
searched but not charged.</TE>
<TE>   After Shakur's death on Sept. 13, Fula left Las Vegas, traveling
to Atlanta and Los Angeles and then New Jersey, where his relatives
lived.</TE>
<TE>   Compton investigators, meanwhile, had assembled mug shots of a
handful of gang members, including Anderson. They hand-delivered the
photos to Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Manning said detectives called Fula's lawyer to set up a meeting
with the teenage rapper so they could show him the pictures. Manning
said the calls were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   Police did not try to locate Fula on their own. By Nov. 10, it was
too late. Fula was gunned down in a housing project in Irvington,
N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Potential Witnesses Dismissed</TE>
<TE>   Early on the morning of Oct. 2, 1996, Compton police, FBI agents
and members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department swept
through Compton, arresting nearly two dozen gang members and seizing
weapons and ammunition. Their aim was to stifle a gang war that had
erupted after the shooting of Shakur.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Anderson was among those sitting in the Compton police
lockup. He had been picked up on a warrant stemming from a gang
killing six months earlier. The other gang members were being held on
drug, weapon and other charges. Compton police believed that some of
them were involved in Shakur's slaying or knew something about it.</TE>
<TE>   Two Las Vegas detectives took part in the roundup at the
invitation of Compton police. One of them questioned Anderson for
about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The visiting detectives brushed aside a suggestion that they
question the other gang members. This stunned the Compton cops and
sheriff's deputies, who thought the obvious thing to do was to use
the threat of prosecution to try to extract information about
Shakur's killing.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a bunch of gang members in custody who knew exactly what
happened with Shakur--some who we believed were in the Cadillac,"
said Ladd, the former Compton investigator. "Las Vegas expressed no
interest whatsoever in talking to any of them. They barely even
interviewed Orlando."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson was released two days later; prosecutors had declined to
file charges against him for the gang killing. Las Vegas
investigators never spoke to him again. He was killed May 29, 1998,
in a drug-related shooting at a Compton carwash.</TE>
<TE>   Savelli, the New York gang investigator, said the arrests in
Compton were a missed opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "The success rate on these kinds of homicides hinges completely on
having informants inside of the gang," he said. "You lean on gang
members with rap sheets for information about the crime. If you don't
get the information the first time, you go back. You get in their
face. Two. Three. Four times. Eventually they talk. But relentless
follow-up is essential."</TE>
<TE>   Manning said his detectives, operating outside their home state,
lacked authority to interrogate the Compton gang members--that
morning or later. Los Angeles authorities took issue with that
assertion. They said that once local police invited the detectives to
question the suspects, there was no legal reason for them not to do
so.</TE>
<TE>   Manning also said his detectives asked Los Angeles County
sheriff's officers to question gang members on their behalf.
Sheriff's investigators said they were not asked to interrogate the
suspects about Shakur's killing. Rather, they said, the Las Vegas
detectives asked them to pass on anything they learned about the case
while questioning the gang members on the local charges.</TE>
<TE>   Manning said he had no regrets about how his officers handled the
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just go in and push everybody aside and say, 'OK, we're
taking over,' " he said. "Even if we did, do you think these guys are
going to talk to us simply because we walk up and ask them to? Do you
think we scared them so bad they would just puke their guts out and
admit to everything?"</TE>
<TE>   The White Cadillac</TE>
<TE>   Two days after the shooting of Shakur, two Crips were seen in
Compton driving a white 1996 Cadillac bearing a rental sticker. An
informant told the local gang unit that the Crips had visited a car
stereo shop whose owner also did bodywork. In Las Vegas, one of
Shakur's bodyguards had gotten off a shot at the white Cadillac as it
fled. The word on the street in Compton was that the Crips brought
the car to the stereo shop to have the damage repaired.</TE>
<TE>   Compton police relayed this information to Las Vegas
investigators, who added it to their file.</TE>
<TE>   The Compton gang investigators then canvassed every rental agency
in the area to determine whether any had rented a white Cadillac that
had been driven to Las Vegas around the time Shakur was shot. They
found that a Carson agency had rented such a car to a man with
possible ties to the gang underground. They took a photograph of the
car and detailed their findings in a report.</TE>
<TE>   Compton investigators say they gave this additional information to
Las Vegas police.</TE>
<TE>   Manning said his detectives never received it.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought there was a possibility that we had located the
Cadillac used in the crime," said retired Compton Sgt. Robert Baker.
"It was a solid lead that should have been pursued."</TE>
<TE>   Concerned About Corruption</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say it was understandable that Las Vegas police
would have concerns about cooperating closely with their Compton
counterparts. Compton had a history of political corruption, and some
Police Department figures had been alleged to have gang ties.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, after years of feuding with the police brass, Compton
Mayor Omar Bradley and City Council members disbanded the department
and contracted with Los Angeles County to provide police services.
But at the time of Shakur's shooting, the gang squad was regarded as
one of the finest in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   People familiar with the investigation say Las Vegas police were
concerned that city officials were too cozy with Suge Knight, who
grew up in Compton, contributed money to Bradley's political
campaigns and knew members of the police force. Knight's security
chief, Reginald Wright Jr., is a former Compton police officer whose
father ran the gang unit.</TE>
<TE>   Knight's name had figured in some of the speculation about
Shakur's death. One theory was that Knight arranged the rapper's
killing so he could exploit his martyrdom commercially. Las Vegas
detectives worried that Wright's father and other officers might
protect Knight or pass information to him. Knight's refusal to
cooperate with them sharpened the Nevada detectives' suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   To ease those concerns, Hourie Taylor, then Compton chief of
police, removed the elder Wright from the Shakur investigation and
replaced him with Baker. Nevertheless, Las Vegas investigators
continued to keep their distance.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigators with the best inside information about the
Southside Crips worked in the Compton gang unit," said McBride, the
former Sheriff's Department gang investigator.</TE>
<TE>   "They were good investigators. But even if Las Vegas didn't trust
them, what did it hurt to listen? It's not like Vegas had to give up
anything. In my mind, if you aren't even close to solving the case,
what do you have to lose?"</TE>
<TE>   Though the investigation into Shakur's slaying has been dormant
for years, some former Compton officers refuse to give up hope of
catching some of those involved.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe Tupac's murder could have been solved--and it still
could be," said Tim Brennan, a Compton gang investigator now with the
Sheriff's Department. "All the clues are right there. What the
investigation lacked was input from detectives who understood the
gangs involved and how they operate and who all the players are. I
believe justice could still be served."</TE>

<LD>The killing of Tupac Shakur in 1996 followed years of conflict
involving Shakur, rapper Notorious B.I.G., their record companies and
their gang followers.</LD>
<LD>   November 1994</LD>
<LD>   Shakur is shot five times and robbed in the lobby of a recording
studio near Times Square in New York. He blames the ambush on
Notorious B.I.G., whose real name is Christopher Wallace, and Sean
"Puffy" Combs, right, head of Bad Boy Entertainment.</LD>
<TE>   1995</TE>
<TE>   Notorious B.I.G. records a song called "Who Shot Ya?," interpreted
by Shakur as a taunting reminder of the 1994 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   June 1995</TE>
<TE>   On stage at the Source Awards in New York, Marion "Suge" Knight,
head of Shakur's label, Death Row Records of Los Angeles, insults
Combs and New York-based Bad Boy.</TE>
<TE>   July 1995</TE>
<TE>   Notorious B.I.G. and Bad Boy hire members of the Southside Crips
for protection against the Mob Piru Bloods, who work for Death Row.
The two Compton gangs have had a bloody 30-year rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   September 1995</TE>
<TE>   Death Row employee Jake Robles, a Mob Piru Blood, is shot dead
outside an Atlanta nightclub. A Bad Boy employee is suspected.</TE>
<TE>   October 1995</TE>
<TE>   Released from prison while he appeals a sexual abuse conviction,
Shakur begins recording material for a Death Row release. In one
song, "Hit 'Em Up," he mocks Combs and Bad Boy entertainers and brags
about having had sex with Notorious B.I.G.'s wife.</TE>
<TE>   March 1996</TE>
<TE>   A scuffle breaks out at the Soul Train Music Awards in Los Angeles
after Notorious B.I.G.'s bodyguard brandishes a weapon in front of an
armed member of Shakur's entourage backstage at the Shrine
Auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   August 1996</TE>
<TE>   A handful of Southside Crips beat and rob one of Shakur's Mob Piru
Bloods bodyguards at a mall in Lakewood. The assailants snatch a
diamond-studded Death Row medallion from the victim's neck.</TE>
<TE>   September 1996</TE>
<TE>   Shakur and his Bloods bodyguards, in Las Vegas for a heavyweight
boxing match, assault a Crip in retaliation for the Lakewood
incident. Two and half hours later, Shakur is fatally wounded in a
drive-by shooting a block from the Las Vegas Strip. No one has been
charged in the killing.</TE>
<TE>   March 1997</TE>
<TE>   Notorious B.I.G. is gunned down outside the Petersen Automotive

<HD>L.A. Film Permit Agency Is Target of Investigation</HD>
<DH>Movies: Lavish spending and political donations by
officials of the quasi-public body lead to raids.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI, JAMES BATES and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors are investigating whether the quasi-public agency that
issues film permits in Los Angeles County misused public funds by
lavishing exorbitant tips at restaurants, sending its executives on
Caribbean jaunts and donating money to politicians who sit on its
board, according to court records and interviews.</LD>
<LD>   The Entertainment Industry Development Corp., whose board includes
the entire Los Angeles City Council and county Board of Supervisors,
gets its $3-million budget from permit fees that would otherwise go
to public coffers. Its mission includes keeping movie production in
the county.</LD>
<LD>   An investigation by the district attorney's office, with the
assistance of county auditors, led to a Wednesday night search of the
agency's offices and the home of its president, Cody Cluff. Financial
documents and computer disks were seized.</LD>
<TE>   In court papers filed to support the search, prosecutors said
Cluff, 43, charged $500,000 worth of personal expenses, steered funds
to his children's school, and perjured himself on state documents he
signed denying that any of EIDC's directors profited from the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff's attorney, Tom Brown, said his client and the EIDC have
cooperated with investigators. Cluff has done nothing wrong, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "EIDC entertains and markets the film industry," Brown said. "We
believe that when we've had an opportunity to explain its business
and what we've done, both EIDC and Cody Cluff will be fully
vindicated."</TE>
<TE>   Records show that the agency contributed nearly $200,000 to
politicians, including more than a dozen who sat on its board.</TE>
<TE>   An hour before prosecutors raided EIDC headquarters in Hollywood,
the agency was sending invitations signed by Cluff to $500-a-plate
fund-raisers for Los Angeles City Councilman Nick Pacheco--an EIDC
board member--and Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City), who is
running for a Los Angeles City Council seat.</TE>
<TE>   No charges have been filed. County auditors said the search
warrant was sought after the agency refused to turn over financial
records this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been fighting giving us information," said Pat McMahon,
the county's assistant auditor-controller.</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC was formed in 1995, when the City Council and Board of
Supervisors agreed to consolidate their film-permitting functions
into a single agency. The merger was a pet project of former Mayor
Richard Riordan, and came amid complaints that production companies
faced too much red tape.</TE>
<TE>   Both government agencies entered into contracts with the EIDC,
which was charged with stemming the loss of movie work to lower-cost
states, as well as Canada, Australia and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The office charges $450 per permit, and arranges for the closure
of public streets, for example, negotiating with police and fire
agencies. It acts as a trouble-shooter when movie producers have
difficulty gaining access to public property or clash with neighbors.
The office also touts the advantages of filming in Los Angeles to
industry executives, often over expensive meals and at sporting
events.</TE>
<TE>   But there has been disagreement over the agency's role: Is it a
public institution beholden to taxpayers? Or a private enterprise
that operates in the same freewheeling fashion as the Hollywood
companies, which spend lavishly on banquets, parties and junkets?</TE>
<TE>   McMahon, of the auditor-controller's office, described the EIDC as
a quasi-government agency, subject to "a higher standard than a
private corporation." It operates under the state's open meetings
law, required of all public agencies, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   But advocates of the EIDC argue that the film office needs to
spend generously to woo the high-rolling movie industry, as well as
to contribute to the politicians who nurture show business.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is the entertainment capital," said Morrie Goldman,
vice president of public affairs for the agency. "The people who make
decisions on where to shoot live and work here. They operate in a
world where they've got a lot of demands on their time, and have a
lot available to them in forms of entertainment. We need to be able
to interact in their world."</TE>
<TE>   Auditors found that Cluff, a former deputy mayor under Riordan,
received more than $50,000 in direct payments from EIDC to his
personal American Express card. Prosecutors found more than $40,000
in charges for Laker basketball games and other sporting and concert
events, and $20,000 in cashier's checks from the EIDC to Cluff.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff charged the EIDC for his membership in the Grand Havana
Room, a Beverly Hills cigar club that lists a $3,000 initiation fee
and a $200 monthly charge. Auditors also noted "numerous payments for
meals and bar [alcohol] tabs at exclusive restaurants and clubs,
often incurred late at night or early in the morning," where Cluff
sometimes signed for tips equal to 100% of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Court papers also state that Cluff, who had once worked as an
auditor, used $40,000 in EIDC money to pay for trips to Georgia, as
well as Utah and France--where two of the world's biggest film
festivals, Sundance and Cannes, are held.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Cluff and another EIDC executive traveled to the
Caribbean at agency expense. Court papers said the EIDC gave money to
the school that Cluff's children attend, and list a $5,000
contribution to Covina High School. The office also paid $341,000 to
an Internet company run by one of its 45 board members.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, Cluff's attorney, would not address any specific
allegations, but he said the investigation stems from a
misunderstanding about the movie business.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the problem is that you've got county auditors who are
used to going into county agencies, and this is not your typical
county agency," he said. "When they see expense accounts where four
Lakers tickets are provided to the movie industry, they don't know
what to do with it.... They're just not sophisticated enough to deal
with private industry."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend that the EIDC is a publicly funded agency, and
they are trying to determine whether its campaign contributions are
an illegal gift of government funds.</TE>
<TE>   David Demerjian, head of the Public Integrity Division of the
district attorney's office, said no conclusion has been reached. The
EIDC's board includes not only elected officials, but also the
county's top budget officer and the city's legislative analyst, plus
entertainment executives.</TE>
<TE>   State records show that the EIDC has contributed $194,000 to
political committees since 1998. The recipients include more than a
dozen politicians who at the time were sitting on the group's board.
Jackie Goldberg, who represented Hollywood on the Los Angeles City
Council and now represents the region in the state Assembly, received
at least $15,500, the largest amount.</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC also contributed $10,000 to the anti-secession campaign
run by Mayor James K. Hahn, an EIDC board member. On Friday,
secessionists called for an investigation by the city ethics
commission into a possible conflict of interest by Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely appalling," said Gene La Pietra, head of the
Hollywood secession effort.</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, Hahn's consultant on the anti-secession campaign, said
Friday the mayor solicited the contribution but that there is no
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Hal Bernson said the board, of which he is a
member, is a "figurehead" organization with no control over campaign
contributions. "The only question I would have is whether the
organization should be making political contributions at all," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff determined who got the campaign money, said Goldman, the
EIDC vice president.</TE>
<TE>   David Gershwin, a spokesman for City Council President Alex
Padilla, who received two $500 contributions from EIDC in 2000, said
there is nothing wrong with the donations.</TE>
<TE>   "EIDC is a private corporation," Gershwin said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich agreed, noting that campaign donations
by the EIDC were not large. He received $1,000 in 1999. "Having them
support those who support eliminating the red tape is proper," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said Friday that whatever the outcome of
the investigation, county and city officials ought to better define
how the EIDC should operate.</TE>
<TE>   "They are giving license, in a sense, for people to work outside
the normal constraints of government," he said.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Case of W. Nile Suspected</HD>
<DH>Health: If confirmed, the infection would be the first
known to have been acquired in the West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II and CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County woman "very likely" developed meningitis caused
by a West Nile virus infection, suggesting that the disease has
completed its cross-country march a mere three years after it first
appeared in the United States, health officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The diagnosis of the young woman from the southwestern part of the
county would be the first reported case in humans to be acquired west
of the Rocky Mountains. It cannot be confirmed, however, until a
final set of test results comes back, probably next week, health
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "In discussions with the state and the [federal] Centers for
Disease Control, we think it was highly probable ... that this was
West Nile virus infection," said Jonathan Fielding, Los Angeles
County public health director, at a news conference in Los Angeles on
Friday. "We would not be talking to you if we did not think it was
very likely that this would be confirmed by the definitive test."</LD>
<TE>   He said health officials decided to alert the public based on
results of several tests of the woman's blood and cerebral spinal
fluid. A final diagnosis can be made only after a series of tests is
done to detect antibodies to West Nile and to rule out other types of
infection.</TE>
<TE>   West Nile remains rare and most often produces no symptoms among
those infected. In about one in five cases, people experience mild
symptoms including fever, headache and nausea. One in 150 require
hospitalization. Elderly people are most vulnerable to symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   The disease has attracted strong interest from public health
officials and the media because it is so new to the United States and
because of its mounting death toll--61 people since the summer of
1999, including 43 this year. Recent infections suggest the
possibility that the virus can be spread through transplantation of
organs.</TE>
<TE>   The California woman's case is mystifying because health experts
here have not detected any evidence of the virus in birds, which
harbor West Nile, or in mosquitoes, which transmit it to humans.</TE>
<TE>   State health authorities had not expected West Nile to arrive in
California until next year or 2004.</TE>
<TE>   But "we have been preparing for the arrival of West Nile virus,
and we are ready," said Diana M. Bonta, director of the state
Department of Health Services, who also spoke at the news conference.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the probable California case, county and state
officials say they are increasing their surveillance of mosquitoes
and birds. Vector-control agencies also plan to intensify spraying of
anti-mosquito chemicals in storm drains, pools of standing water and
unused swimming pools.</TE>
<TE>   The unidentified woman from Los Angeles County became ill on Aug.
10 with a mild case of viral meningitis, in which the membranes
covering the brain become irritated, health officials said. She was
hospitalized for five days and has fully recovered. She is expected
to suffer no long-lasting consequences.</TE>
<TE>   To protect her privacy, health officials would not release
additional details, such as her age or city of residence.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers don't know how the woman may have contracted the
virus. She had not traveled out of state and does not recall being
bitten by mosquitoes. A sophisticated state monitoring program has
picked up no evidence of the virus in animals, which often are the
first clue to the virus' arrival in a region.</TE>
<TE>   "Finding a human case before we have evidence in birds or chickens
or mosquitoes is rare, but it's not unprecedented," said Fielding.
When the virus was first detected in the United States, in New York
City in 1999, human cases were confirmed before any were found in
mosquitoes or animals. Seven people in the New York area died that
year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the probable Los Angeles County case, samples from
three other people with encephalitis or meningitis are being tested
for West Nile, but officials noted that there are other causes of
these diseases. At least one of the patients is a visitor from out of
state.</TE>
<TE>   Tests on two other people in Los Angeles County have come back
negative. Bonta said she is unaware of any other possible cases in
the state, but her agency has sent out alerts to doctors, hospitals,
health plans and health departments, asking them to watch for
infections that could be caused by West Nile.</TE>
<TE>   Bonta and Fielding also suggested preventive measures people can
take until the mosquito season is over in late October. These include
avoiding mosquito-infested areas at dawn and dusk; wearing
long-sleeved shirts and long pants outdoors; using insect-repellent
products with no more than 35% DEET for adults and 10% for children;
and ensuring that windows have intact screens.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also advised against allowing water to stagnate in old
tires, flowerpots, trash, swimming pools, birdbaths and pet bowls.
They recommended cleaning and chlorinating swimming pools and
draining water from pool covers.</TE>
<TE>   At least four other West Nile cases have been reported in the
West, but all the victims are thought to have contracted the virus
elsewhere in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The West Nile virus is common in Africa and the Middle East. Since
1999, it has been detected in every state east of the Rockies. This
year, there have been 954 infections among humans in 29 states and
the District of Columbia, according to the CDC. On Thursday, federal
health officials said that "tens of thousands" of Americans probably
have been infected.</TE>
<TE>   A vaccine is available to protect horses, but there is no vaccine
for humans. Dogs and cats can get the virus but do not become ill.</TE>
<TE>   Bonta urged Californians who see crows, jays, ravens, magpies,
sparrows or finches that have been dead for less than 24 hours to
report them to health authorities at (877) 968-2473. The department
will pick them up and test for the presence of the virus.</TE>
<TE>   Residents who would like general information about West Nile can
call (800) 975-4448.</TE>

<HD>Teen Brothers Guilty of Beating Father to Death</HD>
<DH>Crime: In a separate trial, a neighbor they blamed in the
murder is acquitted. In the unusual proceedings, prosecutor offered
two scenarios of who did what.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In highly unusual court proceedings, a jury in Pensacola, Fla.,
convicted two teenage brothers Friday in the baseball bat slaying of
their sleeping father, while it was announced that another jury
hearing the same murder case had acquitted a neighbor of the crime.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors found Derek King, 14, and his brother Alex, 13, guilty of
second-degree murder in the death of Terry King, 40, as he slept in a
recliner Nov. 26. They also were convicted of setting fire to the
house.</LD>
<LD>   The brothers, who were tried as adults, showed no emotion when the
verdict was read in court. But Ricky Chavis, the neighbor, wiped away
tears when the court announced that the other jury had exonerated
him.</LD>
<TE>   Circuit Judge Frank Bell had sealed the verdict against Chavis, a
convicted child molester who was tried last week. The judge decided
not to reveal the decision until a second jury made up its mind in
the case against the brothers, who face a sentence of 22 years to
life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had argued different theories of the same crime at the
trials.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant State Atty. David Rimmer, who prosecuted both cases, had
urged the brothers' jury to focus on the facts of the case and not on
their angelic appearances.</TE>
<TE>   "The boys testified under oath in front of a grand jury that
Chavis did it," Rimmer told reporters outside the courthouse after
both verdicts were announced. "It was up to a jury to decide whether
they believed him or not. The jury didn't believe them."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said that Chavis never confessed to the killing,
while the boys had, and that the case against Chavis reached the
courtroom because the defendant had demanded a speedy trial.</TE>
<TE>   Rimmer argued during Chavis' trial that the neighbor had beaten
King to death with an aluminum bat while the brothers hid in Chavis'
car. Both brothers also testified that Chavis had committed the
crime.</TE>
<TE>   But during the brothers' trial, the prosecutor pictured Chavis as
motivating the teenagers to commit the murder, and told jurors that
Derek swung the bat while Alex watched and encouraged his brother.</TE>
<TE>   Rimmer said Derek talked of the plot two days before the killing.
The prosecutor underscored the testimony of Nancy Lay, Derek's former
foster mother. She testified that she was shocked when Derek said he
and his brother were going to murder their father.</TE>
<TE>   "We already have a plan," Lay said the older brother told her.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing argument, the prosecutor also read a letter that
the younger brother had written to his father, accusing him of mental
abuse and referring to their home as a prison.</TE>
<TE>   Rimmer cited the confession of the brothers to investigators,
saying it contained details of the killing.</TE>
<TE>   He told the jury both brothers were telling the truth in their
initial confessions. Rimmer said that the statements contained
details of the crime that only people at the scene would have known.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers charged that Chavis was obsessed with Alex and had
convinced the brothers to accept the blame for the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers said that Chavis had repeatedly changed his story
during interviews with investigators and had admitted harboring the
teenagers and washing their clothes, which were bloodstained after
the killing.</TE>
<TE>   Chavis still faces charges of evidence tampering and obstructing
the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts expressed contradictory views of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Slobogin, a law professor at the University of
Florida, told Associated Press that, while it is rare to convene
separate trials for the same crime based on differing prosecutorial
theories, it does occur.</TE>
<TE>   "It happens when the prosecution has probable cause that both sets
of defendants are involved, but isn't positive which set of
defendants is responsible and leaves it up to the juries to decide,"
Slobogin said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Seidenfeld, associate dean at Florida State University Law
School, disagreed, saying prosecutors should have made up their minds
about who they believed was guilty and tried only that case.</TE>

<LD>   "Don't let your children see the images, especially on Sept. 11,

plane hitting the building or the buildings falling," Bush said in an

<HD>Providence Mayor Gets Prison Sentence for Corruption</HD>
<DH>Verdict: Vincent A. Cianci Jr., who helped transform the
city into a cultural center, is given a term of five years and four
months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Hours after cleaning out the City Hall office he has occupied for 21
years, Providence Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr. was sentenced Friday to
more than five years in prison for corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Cianci's stoic appearance before U.S. District Judge Ernest C.
Torres in Providence ended a boisterous political era both for the
61-year-old mayor and the city he transformed from a gritty
industrial backwater to a glittering center of culture and commerce.
Cianci, said Torres, was a "Jekyll and Hyde" who used City Hall to
his own advantage even as he remade Providence into a "Renaissance
City."</LD>
<LD>   "There appear to be two very different Buddy Ciancis that come
across here," said Torres, using the childhood nickname that the
mayor continues to employ. One is "a mayor with rare vision and
boundless energy," Torres said--and the other, an unscrupulous
official who peddled influence and shook down ordinary citizens
seeking help from the leader they elected.</LD>
<TE>   "My job is to sentence the second Buddy Cianci, because the first
wouldn't be here," Torres said. The prison sentence of five years and
four months fell squarely within federal guidelines. Prosecutors had
asked Torres to send Cianci away for twice that long. In seeking
leniency, defense lawyers filed a 21-page account of Cianci's
accomplishments, including a description of charitable efforts, such
as donating some profits from sales of "The Mayor's Own" marinara
sauce to a scholarship fund.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, the mayor's job is to do a good job," said the judge, who
also said charity should be expected from someone in Cianci's
position. Steadfastly maintaining his innocence, Cianci told Torres
that he loves Providence and never intended to do anything wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Along with his prison sentence, which is set to begin Dec. 6,
Cianci received a fine of $100,000 and was ordered to perform 150
hours of community service. The somber courtroom scene capped a
colorful career that began in 1974, when the onetime state prosecutor
from the anti-mob task force was elected mayor. A scandal marred
Cianci's first two terms, when 22 city and state workers were
convicted of corruption.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, Cianci was charged with ordering his bodyguard to use a
fireplace log and lighted cigarette to attack the boyfriend of his
estranged wife. Cianci, then a Republican, left office after pleading
no contest. He quickly established himself as the region's most
popular radio talk show host, returning to City Hall as an
independent in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Glib, nattily attired and famous for his assortment of toupees,
Cianci became a full-time cheerleader for Providence. He presided
over $300 million in transportation improvements and cut the opening
ribbon on a $426-million downtown shopping center anchored by the
region's only Nordstrom department store. Federal Hill, once awash in
generic red spaghetti sauce, became a center for three-star dining.</TE>
<TE>   Cianci took up residence in the presidential suite of the
Providence Biltmore Hotel and enjoyed so much power that people
called him "the mayor of Rhode Island." But a federal investigation
dubbed Operation Plunder Dome concluded that Cianci managed a "city
for sale." Bribes and kickbacks were routine, as jurors learned in a
seven-week trial where, on surveillance tapes, members of the mayor's
inner circle sometimes spoke in Italian.</TE>
<TE>   Tow truck operators told the court they set up a front operation
to pad Cianci's reelection fund in exchange for generous contracts.
Witnesses said the rate for a city job was a $5,000 payoff.
Prosecutors initially indicted Cianci on 30 counts of corruption. By
the time the trial wound down, the list was down to 12. Cianci was
convicted in June on a single count of racketeering conspiracy after
jurors agreed that he was the ringleader of a massive corruption
scheme.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime Cianci aide and a politically connected tow truck
operator also were convicted of corruption. Dubbing himself "the
asterisk, the trivia question," City Council President John Lombardi
was sworn in late Friday to fill out Cianci's term, which ends in
January.</TE>
<TE>   Cianci left court in a chauffeured limousine, with a throng of
supporters waiting outside the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   As late as midweek, the mayor was enjoying approval ratings above
60%. He vowed to appeal, and said he had faith in the judicial
system.</TE>
<TE>   But on his final day in office, Cianci could not resist holding
one last news conference. "Providence is a great city," he said.
"Some of you can even end your careers here. I know how to do that."</TE>

<HD>Congress Makes Solemn Trip to N.Y., Where It All Began</HD>
<DH>Tribute: A meeting in the nation's onetime capital marks
upcoming anniversary of attacks. 'We are with you,' Sen. Lott tells
residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In a pilgrimage to the scene of the nation's deadliest terrorist
assault, Congress paid homage Friday to this stricken metropolis and
returned to its own roots with an extraordinary meeting in Lower
Manhattan to mark the approaching anniversary of the Sept. 11
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The House and Senate held a solemn joint meeting in New York's
Federal Hall--360 days after terrorist hijackers smashed two jets
into the World Trade Center and 212 years after Congress last
convened here.</LD>
<LD>   More than 300 of the 535 lawmakers trekked here, many by chartered
train, for only the second meeting of Congress outside Washington in
two centuries.</LD>
<TE>   Congressional leaders and Vice President Dick Cheney, in his
duties as president of the Senate, used the occasion to mourn the
more than 2,800 people who died in the collapse of the twin towers
just a few blocks away, and to promote the war against terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "As a nation born in revolution, we know that freedom comes at a
very high price, and we have no intention of letting it slip away,"
Cheney told the lawmakers, reminding them that the war on terrorism
began the hour New York and the nation fell under attack.</TE>
<TE>   He and House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) presided from a
dais with gavels brought from Washington. Behind them hung a giant
American flag. Before them, senators, representatives and other
dignitaries were packed into a circular chamber decorated with
artifacts from the first presidential inaugural, including a
wrought-iron balustrade and stone platform from the balcony where
George Washington took his oath of office.</TE>
<TE>   The large turnout on a day lawmakers ordinarily would be scattered
across the country, campaigning or working in their home states,
underscored how New York's recovery and the war on terrorism have
become potent national causes.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said the Sept. 11
terrorists had failed. "They sought to destroy America by attacking
what they thought were our greatest strengths," Daschle said. "But
they did not understand. The true strength of America is not steel or
concrete. It is our belief in the ideals enshrined in our
Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   For New Yorkers, the leaders had a direct message.</TE>
<TE>   "We are with you," said Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.). "We will continue our efforts to help you rebuild,
physically and spiritually."</TE>
<TE>   Lott added: "From this city's one day of horror, out of all the
loss and sorrow, has come a strength, a resolve, a determination
which--from Manhattan to Mississippi--now binds us together for the
mighty work that lies ahead."</TE>
<TE>   With support from President Bush, Congress has appropriated more
than $20 billion in disaster aid since the Sept. 11 attacks, in which
hijackers struck New York and the Pentagon and crashed another
airplane in rural Pennsylvania. Most of the relief is bound for this
city, which suffered the worst damage. More is likely to flow from
Washington in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   During their one-hour meeting, lawmakers reaffirmed a
congressional resolution of solidarity with the city and heard
speeches, prayers and poetry.</TE>
<TE>   They then stood, held hands and loudly sang "God Bless America"
with a high school choir. It was an emotional repeat rendition of an
anthem that many House members had sung the evening of Sept. 11 from
the Capitol steps.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, lawmakers lunched at the nearby Regent Hotel in an
event hosted by the mayor who is counting on Washington's largess.
Michael R. Bloomberg noted that the Annenberg Foundation had paid $1
million to underwrite the ceremonial meeting. And Bloomberg did not
forget to thank the keepers of the federal purse.</TE>
<TE>   "We know you were there for us when we needed you," Bloomberg
said. "And we will be there for you if you ever need us."</TE>
<TE>   In a final event, the lawmakers journeyed to the south ledge of
the cavernous pit at ground zero. At the great void where the World
Trade Center once stood, congressional leaders gave New Yorkers a
white floral wreath and members bowed their heads in prayer. Many had
been there before, seeing the hulking, smoking ruins soon after the
attack and subsequently inspecting the excavation of rubble.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.) was awed. He had flown past the
skyscrapers in a commuter jet on the morning of Sept. 11, minutes
before the hijacked jets struck. He recalled staring at the north
tower through his window.</TE>
<TE>   "It was as brilliant and shining as the day," Foley said. Now, he
mused, "this is scarred land."</TE>
<TE>   A sizable group of Californians came to pay tribute. Two
Democrats, Reps. Sam Farr of Carmel and Adam B. Schiff of Burbank,
recalled a handful of victims of Sept. 11 with ties to their home
districts: a flight attendant, a physician's son, a married couple.
"We see how interconnected we all are," Schiff said.</TE>
<TE>   But while the day focused on a modern national calamity, for the
107th Congress, history echoed here from a more distant past.</TE>
<TE>   The 1st Congress met at Nassau and Wall streets, in an earlier
Federal Hall. There, it adopted the Bill of Rights and passed seminal
legislation to put the new federal government in motion, including
the creation of the departments of State, Treasury and War.</TE>
<TE>   That Congress, which left New York for good after adjourning on
Aug. 12, 1790, also chose the site of the new national capital along
the Potomac River. During the 1790s, while the District of Columbia
was under construction, the national seat of government was
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1800, Congress has met continuously in Washington, through
one foreign invasion, one civil war and two world wars. The only
exception, until now, was a meeting in 1987 in Philadelphia to mark
the bicentennial of the Constitutional Convention.</TE>
<TE>   "How remarkable," Farr said. "We're the first that's come back to
the original spot."</TE>
<TE>   Although the day was almost free of the partisan rancor that
typifies Washington, some Republicans took note of the absence of
Democratic leaders when Lott and Hastert rang the opening bell at the
New York Stock Exchange, across the street from Federal Hall. A GOP
aide suggested that Daschle and House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt (D-Mo.) had stayed away for political reasons because
Democrats are stressing corporate responsibility in the coming
midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic aides angrily dismissed the charge.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt, in his comments at Federal Hall, sought to rise above
politics. In the war on terrorism, he said, "There are no
Republicans; there are no Democrats. There are only Americans."</TE>

<HD>EPA Penalties Upheld for Truck Engine Firms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal court on Friday upheld steep penalties on truck engine
makers that fail to meet new pollution-cutting requirements beginning
next month, rejecting requests by two manufacturers that the mandates
be postponed.</LD>
<LD>   The Environmental Protection Agency last month said it would go
ahead with the penalties, beginning Oct. 1, despite complaints from
several manufacturers that they are unable to meet the requirements,
which were part of a 1998 agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Two manufacturers, Detroit Diesel Corp. and Caterpillar Inc.,
asked the court to change the agreement so they would have more time
to comply. They argued that "unanticipated cost increases" had made
compliance more onerous than expected.</LD>
<TE>   But U.S. District Judge Henry Kennedy disagreed and on Friday
denied the request.</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 agreement between the Justice Department and half a dozen
truck engine makers provides for penalties if manufacturers fail to
meet tougher air pollution standards for their new engines, Kennedy
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., and Detroit Diesel face
millions of dollars in penalties because they are unable to meet the
Oct. 1 deadline under the 4-year-old agreement. Other manufacturers,
including Cummins Inc. and Mack Trucks Inc., began developing new
technologies more than a year ago and have said they will comply with
the new standards.</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 consent agreement grew out of a Justice Department
investigation into charges that engine manufacturers and truckers
were circumventing clean air requirements by overriding vehicles'
emissions controls.</TE>
<TE>   The new requirements are part of a push to reduce tailpipe
emissions from diesel trucks and buses by as much as 90%.</TE>

<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Tropical storm Fay, its center ill-defined but churning powerfully,
stalled over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico on Friday but
still threatened to strike the Texas coast as a weak hurricane.</LD>
<LD>   Fay, the sixth tropical storm of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane
season, packed sustained winds of 60 mph with higher gusts and could
reach hurricane strength of 74 mph before making landfall today, said
forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. Some
areas could get as much as 15 inches of rain, they said.</LD>
<LD>   The weather service issued a hurricane watch for the Texas coast
from Port O'Connor, about 160 miles southwest of Houston on Matagorda
Bay, to High Island, which is the eastern tip of Galveston Bay's
mouth.</LD>
<TE>   Rain, minor street flooding, heavy surf and high winds were
already hitting Galveston Island, a 27-mile coastal barrier island
about 50 miles southeast of Houston. Classes in several school
districts were canceled and authorities suggested that residents in
low-lying areas voluntarily evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking at a lot of problems later this evening. We
haven't had too much rain, but the tides are rising fast," said
Galveston County Emergency Management spokesman John Simsen.</TE>
<TE>   In Freeport, about 55 miles southwest of Houston, storm surge
pushed tides 4 feet above normal.</TE>
<TE>   Although Galveston and Freeport were in Fay's cross hairs, a much
wider stretch of the coastline was also on guard.</TE>
<TE>   A tropical storm warning, which means residents can expect storm
conditions within 24 hours, was in effect for an even wider swath of
the coast, from Port Aransas near Corpus Christi to Intracoastal
City, La., which is at the midpoint of that state's coastline.</TE>
<TE>   At 4 p.m. CDT, the center of the storm was about 105 miles south
of Galveston, at latitude 27.8 degrees north and longitude 94.8 west.</TE>
<TE>   The storm's center actually had moved farther from the coast as
Friday progressed, but meteorologists cautioned that it was
ill-defined and therefore not an indicator of the storm's direction.
The poor definition also made it more difficult to predict the
tempest's path, but forecasters said the storm was expected to begin
lumbering slowly to the west-northwest or northwest in the next 24
hours.</TE>
<TE>   The National Hurricane Center warned residents along the Texas and
Louisiana coasts to expect a storm surge of 4 to 6 feet and 4 to 8
inches of rain in the storm's path.</TE>

<HD>Details Scarce in Push for In-Flight Security</HD>
<DH>Airlines: Pilots may be armed and cabin crews will have
martial arts training, but experts cite potential risks. Funding
questions also remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the airliner of the near future, armed pilots would sit in the
cockpit while flight attendants trained in martial arts provide cabin
service and passengers are subject to video surveillance.</LD>
<LD>   Legislation that won overwhelming Senate approval this week would
take on-board security to a new level, in which pilots with
semiautomatics are but one element. Traditionally, crews have focused
on flight safety and passenger comfort. Now, they would also be
poised to become the counterterrorism strike team of last resort.</LD>
<LD>   "In a nation that is as open as ours, I think it's common sense to
have a defense plan for the aircraft itself," said Capt. Duane
Woerth, president of the Air Line Pilots Assn. "It's just being
pragmatic."</LD>
<TE>   Some experts believe the government should do even more by
amending the standard preflight safety briefing to exhort passengers
that they too must help defend the cockpit should it ever come under
attack.</TE>
<TE>   But others caution that the new emphasis on airborne preparedness
risks unintended consequences: lost weapons, accidental shootings,
damaged aircraft and the potential for misunderstandings to escalate
to greater levels of danger.</TE>
<TE>   "We should approach this slowly, and test things as we do it,"
said Cathal Flynn, a former security chief for the Federal Aviation
Administration. "One significant problem with it is having the surety
that you are identifying pilots at the [airport] checkpoint. You have
to have high confidence that some armed guy with a uniform and an ID
of some kind isn't going to sail through."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of such details were swept aside as the Senate and House
debated arming pilots against the backdrop of a ground-based airport
security system that still has obvious holes. There was also a
recognition that armed federal air marshals can cover only a small
portion of the 35,000 flights a day. But lawmakers overruled the
advice of security experts at the Transportation Department against
introducing firearms into the cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   Now that some program appears likely to go forward, its success
will hinge on finding answers to many practical questions about how
it would work. The Bush administration would prefer a small test
program with a limited number of pilots, but Congress wants all
qualified volunteers to bear arms.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration believes that there are a number of security
concerns that need to be addressed as the Congress proceeds," said
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. "These issues involve the
proper way to train pilots who may not be proficient ... in the use
of weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Airlines are concerned that bullets could damage controls or
pierce the fuselage at cruising altitude, possibly bringing about a
dangerous decompression.</TE>
<TE>   Worries about damage to the fuselage probably could be addressed
by issuing pilots a special kind of ammunition used by air marshals,
which tears through human tissue but not aluminum. But the airlines
have other concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "You know there are going to be some misfires, you know there are
going to be some cockpits shot out, you know there are going to be
some people inadvertently wounded," said an industry official, who
asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   In large police departments, accidental weapon discharges average
one a year per thousand firearms, according to statistics presented
to Congress by United Airlines. It is estimated that perhaps 25,000
of the nation's 85,000 commercial pilots would volunteer to carry
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots would be allowed to shoot only if an intruder has breached
the locked cockpit enclosure. With bullet-resistant, reinforced doors
required to be installed by April, the chances of that happening will
be greatly reduced. Flynn, the former FAA official, said the
government should commission a mathematical risk/benefit analysis to
determine whether the odds of an accidental shooting outweigh the
possibility of stopping a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   "All those risks are probably real, but I always go against the
bigger risk of someone trying to hijack a plane," said Woerth, the
pilots union official. "Right now, if someone gets through the
cockpit door, we're dead. If we can figure out how to fly a Boeing
747 to Beijing in all kinds of weather, I think we can also figure
this out."</TE>
<TE>   Flight attendants originally opposed arming pilots, but they were
won over to the Senate bill because it also calls for greatly
expanding self-defense training for cabin crews.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would create an Aviation Crewmember Self-Defense
Division within the Transportation Security Administration and
require consideration of arming flight attendants with stun guns.</TE>
<TE>   Flight attendants would receive a minimum of 28 hours' training,
including 16 hours of "hands-on" instruction. The training would
incorporate psychological, verbal and physical techniques for dealing
with confrontation and teach flight attendants how to turn food
service carts and other accessories into improvised weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "A gun in the cockpit as the only defensive capability does
nothing for the people in the cabin," said Dawn Deeks, a spokeswoman
for the Assn. of Flight Attendants. "This training will basically
allow people to stay alive and buy time until the aircraft can be
landed."</TE>
<TE>   Airlines would also be required to provide flight attendants with
special wireless communication devices so that they could alert
pilots in an emergency. And the legislation calls for video monitors
that would allow pilots to see what is going on in the cabin.</TE>
<TE>   However, it remains unclear when this new level of security aloft
would become available. The Bush administration has estimated the
cost at more than $1 billion. And allocating the money is one of the
details that Congress has yet to address.</TE>

<HD>'Big' Al Qaeda Suspect Held</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Alleged top Bin Laden aide is said to be under
Saudi control. U.S. freezes his assets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>One of Osama bin Laden's trusted lieutenants, an alleged Al Qaeda
financier, has been located by Saudi Arabian authorities and U.S.
officials said Friday they have frozen his assets.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials would not disclose the whereabouts of Wa'el Hamza
Julaidan--a man who they say fought alongside Bin Laden long before
he established Al Qaeda and who has been a key lieutenant in the
terrorist network ever since.</LD>
<LD>   But they confirmed that Julaidan is either in custody in Saudi
Arabia, under house arrest there or being closely monitored and
prohibited from leaving the country while U.S. and Saudi authorities
continue to investigate him.</LD>
<TE>   "This individual is directly tied to Al Qaeda and Bin Laden," said
a senior Treasury Department official. "He is a big fish."</TE>
<TE>   The freezing of Julaidan's assets, U.S. officials assert, is
evidence that authorities have made much progress in the effort to
staunch the flow of terrorist financing despite growing concerns that
they have been unsuccessful in dismantling Al Qaeda's economic
support system.</TE>
<TE>   But if Julaidan is in custody, it would mark a major coup for U.S.
authorities in pursuing their global investigation into the Sept. 11
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and into the
worldwide activities of Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, only a handful of senior Al Qaeda leaders have
been captured, while most--including Bin Laden and top aide Ayman
Zawahiri--remain at large.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, many believe that Al Qaeda remains flush with enough
cash to launch more large-scale terrorist attacks, and that the
financial crackdown has been largely unsuccessful, according to a top
Swiss official.</TE>
<TE>   "When I talk to my contacts throughout Europe, they share the same
opinion," Swiss Atty. Gen. Valentin Roschacher said during a visit to
Washington this week. Al Qaeda operatives "are still here, they are
functioning and they have enough money to carry out other attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Tracking Al Qaeda's finances, Roschacher said, "is difficult
work," particularly because the organization has converted much of
its money into gold and diamonds. Those valuables are universally
accepted as currency on the black market and are virtually impossible
for authorities to trace, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you compare the number of millions [of dollars] blocked across
the world and compare that to the fortunes of Bin Laden and [Al
Qaeda], you come to the conclusion that there is a lot more money out
there that has not been found," Roschacher said.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations also says in a report to be released next week
that the global financial crackdown on terrorist financing has done
little to thwart Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite initial successes in locating and freezing some $112
million in assets belonging to Al Qaeda and its associates, Al Qaeda
continues to have access to considerable financial and other economic
resources," said the United Nations' special monitoring group in
charge of tracking worldwide efforts to dismantle the terrorist
network.</TE>
<TE>   "Government officials have indicated that it has proved
exceedingly difficult to identify ... Al Qaeda-related funds and
resources," a draft version of the report says.</TE>
<TE>   "The funds collected and disbursed by a number of Islamic-based
charities is proving particularly difficult for governments to
monitor and regulate."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Treasury officials dispute that, saying they have made much
progress in cracking down on Al Qaeda's financing.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the past year, we have seen a significant number of real
world cases where the financial war on terrorism has thwarted terror
and saved lives," according to a report the Treasury Department will
issue next week concerning the status of its yearlong investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Our war on terror is working--both here in the U.S. and
overseas.... We are seeing progress," according to a draft version of
the report obtained Friday by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury officials said Al Qaeda's shift to using gold and
diamonds is an indication that the crackdown has had an effect,
because such bulky currencies can't be wired from one end of the
globe to the other as they can in more traditional banking systems.
And they said that, although the frequency of the blocking actions
has slowed, that is only because so many already have been issued.</TE>
<TE>   To date, the U.S. government has designated 235 individuals,
entities and organizations as "supporters of terrorism," enabling
financial institutions here and abroad to freeze their assets.</TE>
<TE>   "This includes 112 individuals ranging from organizational leaders
such as Osama bin Laden and his key lieutenants to terrorist
operatives, financiers, and intermediaries around the globe," the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   A Treasury official on Friday said he could not discuss the
specifics of Julaidan's status: "The Saudis know exactly where he is.
And they know that he is as much a threat to them as he is to us."</TE>
<TE>   Julaidan is believed to have been living in Saudi Arabia for "at
least the last few months," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   He has for years been closely involved in a series of front
companies and charitable organizations that Al Qaeda uses as conduits
for raising money to launch terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Julaidan, authorities said, has acted as a chief of logistics for
Bin Laden and the two have spent a significant amount of time
together over the years. Julaidan fought with Bin Laden in
Afghanistan in the 1980s against the Soviet army, Treasury officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Julaidan also is close with Bin Laden lieutenants Zawahiri, Abu
Zubeida and Mohammed Atef, the former military commander of Al Qaeda
believed to have been killed last year in an airstrike. He also has
been associated with Makhtab al Khidamat, a precursor organization of
Al Qaeda, the Rabita Trust and Gamaa al Islamiya terrorist
organization.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, Julaidan also was a leader of the Islamic Center
in Tucson, according to financial documents filed by the
organization.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the leader of the Islamic Center said he was unfamiliar
with Julaidan. "I don't know him. He was here a long time ago," said
Omar Shahin, who has been the center's director and imam, or prayer
leader, for two years.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Treasury Department official said Zubeida, who was
captured in March in Pakistan, has confirmed to U.S. authorities that
Julaidan plays a major role in Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials described Julaidan as being very wealthy and said
that, although he may not have many assets in the United States, he
is believed to have sizable accounts in Saudi Arabia that also will
be frozen.</TE>
<TE>   And though U.S. authorities would not confirm exactly where
Julaidan is, they suggested that he is in custody.</TE>
<TE>   "They have degrees of detention" in Saudi Arabia, the senior
Treasury official said. Julaidan, he added, is in one of them.</TE>

<DL>GRANTS PASS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>The nation's largest wildfire this year has been contained at nearly
500,000 acres about two months after it was ignited by lightning, but
fire officials warn the fight isn't over.</LD>
<LD>   It could be weeks before the blaze in southwestern Oregon and
northern California is extinguished depending on how much rain falls,
said fire spokeswoman Betty Higgins. "Folks need to understand there
is still quite a bit of unburned vegetation in the middle of this,"
she said.</LD>
<LD>   Crews made the final connections of the 405-mile perimeter of
roads, bulldozer lines and hand lines Thursday night, Higgins said.</LD>
<TE>   The fire has cost $133.1 million to fight, the most expensive in
the nation this year. The average date for enough rain to douse the
flames is Oct. 11.</TE>

<LD>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has captured the best image ever of an
unusual galaxy known as Hoag's Object, discovered by astronomer Art
Hoag in 1950. A nearly perfect ring of hot, blue stars pinwheels
about the galaxy's yellow nucleus. The galaxy is about 120,000
light-years wide, slightly larger than our Milky Way Galaxy, and is
600 million light-years away in the constellation Serpens.</LD>
<LD>   The blue ring, which is dominated by clusters of young, massive
stars, contrasts sharply with the yellow nucleus of mostly older
stars. The apparent gap separating the ring from the nucleus may, in
fact, be filled with star clusters that are too faint to see.</LD>
<LD>   Astronomers speculate that the blue ring may be the shredded
remains of another galaxy that passed nearby about 2 to 3 billion
years ago.</LD>

<HD>Remains of Neanderthal Infant Are Rediscovered</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An anthropologist has found the nearly complete skeleton of a
Neanderthal infant in a French museum, where it was filed away in a
drawer and forgotten after its discovery 88 years ago. The skeleton
is of a child thought to be 4 months old or younger who died 40,300
years ago. The fossil is missing only the shoulder blades and pubic
bone, making it one of the most complete sets of Neanderthal remains.
The find, detailed in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, is
important because it will allow scientists to further trace how
Neanderthals developed as individuals, said Bruno Maureille of
France's Universite Bordeaux.</LD>
<LD>   The bones were found in 1914 in sediment under a rock overhang
along the Vezere river in an area of southwestern France rich in
prehistoric sites. A 1921 study detailed the find, but the bones
later vanished after they supposedly were sent to Paris. Only two of
the bones ended up in Paris. The rest, some still encased in
sediment, remained at the National Museum of Prehistory in the town
of Les-Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil, where they sat until Maureille
rediscovered them in 1996 while cataloging the museum's archives. He
later tracked down the arm and leg bone that had been separated from
the skeleton.</LD>

<HD>Japan to Test Unmanned Landing/Takeoff System</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Japan's space agency plans to test an unmanned landing and takeoff
system next month that it hopes will one day be used in a reusable
shuttle or other spacecraft, officials said. The five-part tests will
take place on Christmas Island in the Micronesian archipelago of
Kiribati and will be followed by a second set of tests next year.
Junichi Moriuma of the National Space Development Agency said the
tests will use an unmanned airplane equipped with the experimental
steep-angle takeoff and landing system.</LD>
<LD>   The system originally was envisioned for use in Japan's Hope-X
project, which was started in the 1980s to develop a reusable
unmanned space shuttle. Japan had planned to launch Hope-X in 2004,
but the project was put on hold two years ago after it fell four
years behind schedule. The 20-ton shuttle was to be launched by the
domestically developed H-2 rocket, but the program has been plagued
by technical glitches and financial problems.</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brazilian dinosaur ants and Mafia-style gangs have a lot in common,
according to British researchers. Both live in tight-knit groups with
dominant leaders who use strong-arm tactics to control their
opponents and give the "kiss of death" to rivals who challenge their
authority, according to entomologist Francis Ratnieks of the
University of Sheffield.</LD>
<LD>   Dinosaur ants, which can grow to 1.6 inches long, live in small
colonies with only one breeding ant, known as the "mother ant."
Unlike other ant species, the mother ant is not a queen but a mated
worker.</LD>
<LD>   "If the mother ant has her position threatened by another female,
she will wipe her sting against the pretender, leaving behind a
distinctive chemical mixture," Ratnieks said.</LD>
<TE>   Lower-ranking ants detect the chemical and punish the challenger,
sometimes killing her, he reported in Thursday's issue of Nature.</TE>

<HD>Heeding a Stroke of Inspiration</HD>
<DH>A Slovenian is about to become the first person to swim all
2,360 miles of the Mississippi River, if pollution, lightning or
gators don't get him first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GEISMAR, La.</DL>
<LD>This lonely stretch of the Mississippi River wakes to an inexplicable
oompah, the rhythmic thumping of a tuba accompanied by trumpet and
accordion. Five musicians stand on the muddy, overgrown bank--as if
dropped there from the heavens--playing a Slovenian melody amid
swarms of black flies.</LD>
<LD>   The ruckus startles a passing towboat captain who idles his
engine, peering through binoculars, distracted from an even stranger
sight upriver.</LD>
<LD>   Two arms thrash the water. A head occasionally pokes above the
surface. Martin Strel is paddling, kicking, gasping his way toward
the Gulf of Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   It takes an eccentric to attempt such a feat, to dream of swimming
the 2,360-mile length of the river some call the Big Muddy. His
journey began in Minnesota headwaters and has progressed stroke by
stroke, from dawn until dusk, every day for nine weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Blisters and cuts mark his body. Barges rumble past as oblivious
as elephants, swamping him in their wake. He has avoided snakes and
alligators and, he says, survived a lightning bolt that missed him by
a few feet.</TE>
<TE>   Just as bad are the old tires, bottles, cans and empty propane
tanks. He has suffered an assortment of stomach, ear and eye ailments
along the way.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I have it very, very bad," he says. "But always there
is tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   The 47-year-old Slovenian bolsters himself with a nightly dose of
red wine, cases of which were brought along for the expedition. He
takes strength from the band that has just arrived from his homeland,
performing folk songs at various points along the river as he slogs
toward the finish.</TE>
<TE>   So close now, Strel wakes early each morning, slathering himself
in lanolin and pinching back into his wetsuit, hobbling to the
water's edge.</TE>
<TE>   "Same," he says in an accent as tortured as the last mile of a
long swim. "Each day is the same."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If you are looking for deeper meaning in the tale of Martin Strel,
something about the human spirit or a Mark Twain-style saga about
traversing the watery backbone of the nation, the man isn't much
help. Essentially, he is swimming the Mississippi because that is who
he is. He is a swimmer. He puts his head down and goes.</TE>
<TE>   His son and a friend have traveled with him from Slovenia to drive
his equipment along the banks, cook meals and arrange for motel rooms
at night. A handful of Americans have volunteered too, including
three kayakers who escort him down the river.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time a swimmer has confronted the
Mississippi. A Depression-era salesman named Fred Newton swam from
Minneapolis to Baton Rouge in 1930 and a Los Angeles man, Nick Irons,
duplicated the trip five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But according to people who keep such records, Strel would be the
first to cover the river's entire length. He began at Lake Itasca,
Minn., on July 4, and is expected to reach the Gulf by Monday, far
eclipsing the mark he already holds in the Guinness World Records
book for swimming 1,866 miles down the River Danube.</TE>
<TE>   Strel hardly looks the type. His build is squat, not at all
square-shouldered in the manner of a world-class swimmer. He has, for
lack of a more delicate term, a good-sized gut.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe if you want to swim so many days, you have to be a little
bit fat," says his son, Borut, 20, who minds the van full of
wetsuits, towels and power bars. "Maybe other swimmers are thinner,
but they are not as strong."</TE>
<TE>   When the current runs swift, when Strel can endure wearing
flippers despite the skin peeling off his heels, he covers 40 miles
before sunset.</TE>
<TE>   "Not human," says Matthew Mohlke, one of the kayakers. "No man
should be able to do that day after day."</TE>
<TE>   Mohlke, a 28-year-old Minnesotan, initially wondered if he had
signed on for a pipe dream, but his suspicions were eased the first
day when, as he wrote in a diary, Strel "swam so fast out of the
headwaters that we could barely keep up with him. He hits rocks with
his hands, with his head and with his knees. Jagged sticks puncture
him, but he keeps going."</TE>
<TE>   Debris was only part of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Eddies threatened to suck the swimmer under. At locks along the
upper river, suspicious lockmasters--you're doing what?--made him get
out and walk to the other end. Near Grand Rapids, Minn., the water
was so rough that Strel became seasick and told a pelican skimming
past: "I want to switch places."</TE>
<TE>   His companions soon realized that he favored coming up for air on
his left, which meant the kayaker on that side took the brunt of
curses when he led Strel off course or into a hazard. Mohlke and the
others agreed to rotate through what they called the "hot seat."</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks, Strel's body was rubbed raw by his wetsuit, his head
sunburned and the bridge of his nose creased by goggles.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayflies are hatched and are thick on top of the water,"
Mohlke wrote. "I wonder how many Martin swallows each day when he
comes up for air."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about these hardships, Strel responds: "Why should I do
this? A simple question that is difficult to answer."</TE>
<TE>   His hometown is surrounded by rivers and he says its name,
Mokronog, comes from a folk tale that suggests the locals have "wet
feet." The waters run icy much of the year and, as Borut explains,
most people "just stand on the side, looking." Strel showed no such
hesitation.</TE>
<TE>   At 10, he outswam several soldiers on a bet, winning a case of
beer for his older friends. A decade or so later, a professional
marathon swimmer urged him to quit working as a guitarist and begin
training in earnest.</TE>
<TE>   After racing in marathons for cash prizes, Strel discovered there
was more satisfaction and profit in solo, ultra-marathon swims.
Slovenian companies sponsored him in exchange for putting their logos
on his gear. The money paid for food, lodging and other costs
associated with such projects, as well as months of training
beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   In his first big effort, in 1997, Strel crossed the Mediterranean
from Europe to Africa. Then came the Danube in 2000--from Germany to
the Black Sea--an accomplishment that brought him fame in his
homeland. He returned to that river last year and claims to have
covered more than 300 miles in 84 hours 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Mississippi was, relatively speaking, a logical next step.</TE>
<TE>   Other long rivers such as the Nile and Amazon are considered too
dangerous and unpredictable, but the more Strel researched the
Mississippi, visiting several stretches and interviewing people who
had canoed it, the more confident he became. This attitude, which
kept him going after a rough start, might have nearly killed him a
few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Near Cape Girardeau, Mo., a storm swept in but Strel insisted on
continuing. His crew members say lightning struck a buoy 10 feet
away, its concussive force flinging him into the air. They pulled him
from the water but found him unhurt.</TE>
<TE>   Strel says the greatest danger is invisible. South through
populous areas, the river is fouled by chemicals and raw discharge
from sewage-treatment plants. Sierra Club officials joke that
drinking water taken from the river around St. Louis has already
passed through four people.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets worse as you move down," says Jennifer Hensley, a
grass-roots coordinator for the club's Illinois chapter. "If [Strel]
ingests water, he can wind up with a pretty severe flu from bacterial
infections like E. coli."</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, he has battled stomach ailments and conjunctivitis, his
left eye swollen and red. His crew constantly watches for dangerous
flotsam, blowing whistles as a warning, especially when commercial
traffic forces Strel to swim near the banks.</TE>
<TE>   The river that Twain and Carl Sandburg romanticized is now glutted
with tires and steel drums, sinks and refrigerators, abandoned cars
and every other imaginable form of urban refuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's fantastic that [Strel] is doing this because it gets
people excited about the river," Hensley says. "But he's definitely
putting himself at risk."</TE>
<TE>   Strel says he is not doing it for the money. Even with his
Slovenian corporate sponsors, he will barely cover the costs for
himself and his crew. The glory isn't much either. Only a few local
reporters have wandered out to interview him and, for the most part,
his only spectators are people who happen to be standing on the banks
when he swims up.</TE>
<TE>   For those who demand an explanation, he has prepared a list. He is
swimming to promote clean water, to thank the U.S. for recognizing
Slovenia as an independent nation a decade ago and to honor victims
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. There is also the matter of
conquering the Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   "First man," he says. "Something else, huh?"</TE>
<TE>   But even this seems inadequate. Strel does not exhibit the fiery
nature of an overachiever, does not seem haunted by inner demons as
extreme sportsmen sometimes are. His manner is quiet and plodding.
His son says: "He is a fish."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By the time he reaches Baton Rouge, the start of an especially
polluted stretch known as "cancer alley," Strel is battered and 30
pounds lighter than when he began. These are not his biggest
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "The current," he says. "There is none."</TE>
<TE>   Toss a stick in the murky green and it sits idly and drifts
hesitantly away. With no helpful push, Strel falls behind schedule
and argues with his crew members when they urge him to quit before
dark each day.</TE>
<TE>   Near the town of Geismar, they coax him ashore at sunset, the
river and its wooded banks awash in the golden hour, the hum of
crickets and those black lovebugs dancing in the syrupy air. An old
man stands on the bank watching, asking: "He came from where?"</TE>
<TE>   The swimmer crawls ashore on hands and knees, his son hurrying to
help. Together, they trudge through the woods, mindful that rattlers
and water moccasins might lie coiled in knee-high brush. "I don't
like snakes," Strel grumbles.</TE>
<TE>   Up on the levee, he peels off his wetsuit and splashes a jug of
clean water over his head. The band is waiting back at the motel,
along with a modest dinner of meat, rice and bottles of wine.</TE>
<TE>   That night, the pain in Strel's shoulders will prevent him from
sleeping more than a few hours. He wonders aloud if he will finish
but, before anyone speaks up, he answers his own question.</TE>
<TE>   The answer is simple.</TE>
<TE>   "Water is for me," he says wearily. "I was born for this."</TE>

<TE>Martin Strel's journey along the Mississippi River from its source to
outflow will take him 2,360 miles in 68 days. Along the way he'll
take more than 2 million freestyle strokes, averaging almost 35 miles
a day.</TE>
<TE>Start: Strel begins in two-foot deep water in the Mississippi's
source at Lake Itasca. Support workers surround him in three kayaks,
blowing whistles to warn of dangers in the water.</TE>
<TE>Strel swims in four-foot waves for 11 hours through Lake Pepin.</TE>
<TE>Strel is able to swim through Lock and Dam No. 13 in Clinton, Iowa,
but is forced to leave the water and walk around the river's 28
other locks.</TE>
<TE>At Cape Girardeau, lightning strikes a buoy 10 feet from Strel,
knocking him three feet out of the water.</TE>
<TE>After New Madrid, kayakers notice seven barges in two miles. The
support boat, which usually carries supplies and assistants, sinks
overnight.</TE>
<TE>After Memphis, the current drops off, making swimming more difficult.</TE>
<TE>After Arkansas City, drops in the elevation create eddies and
whirlpools.</TE>
<TE>Strel breaks his own record from swimming the Danube, by passing Mile
1,867 between Lake Providence and Vicksburg.</TE>
<TE>Plows ahead through 80-mile stretch between Baton Rouge and New
Orleans known as ``Cancer Alley'' because of all the pollutants.</TE>

<LD>A man died in the second fatal street shooting in Pacoima in less
than 24 hours, but police said it was not known whether the killings
had been related.</LD>
<LD>   Silverio Luna, 22, was gunned down while walking in the 13400
block of Van Nuys Boulevard about 10:45 p.m. Thursday, said Sgt. Tim
Torsney of the Los Angeles Police Department. Witnesses said a gray
compact car pulled up next to Luna, a Pacoima resident, and someone
in the front passenger seat shouted, "Where are you from?"</LD>
<LD>   Before Luna could answer, he was shot in the head, police said. He
died shortly afterward. The shooting appears to be gang-related, LAPD
spokesman Jason Lee said. "The phrase 'Where are you from?' is
classic gang lingo," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier that day, two people were shot to death, and two others
were wounded when an unknown assailant opened fire while the four
were talking in front of their home in the 10900 block of Jamie
Avenue. No arrests have been made.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies have arrested a 16-year-old boy
for his alleged role in an armed bank robbery, the second arrest of a
teenager in the July 18 incident, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Officials of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office say
the boy, who was arrested Thursday, and two others allegedly robbed
the Sun Country Bank in Lancaster, forcing employees and a customer
into a vault and making off with $39,000 in cash.</LD>
<LD>   A 15-year-old was arrested last month in connection with the
crime. Both boys, whose names were not released, have been charged
with 10 counts of robbery and 10 counts of kidnapping.</LD>
<TE>   Deputies were still looking for a third suspect, Vernon Jackson,
19, who may be in Los Angeles. Anyone with information may call
detectives at (661) 948-8466.</TE>

<HD>Clinton Exhorts Capps' Backers</HD>
<DH>Santa Barbara: The former president helps the Democratic
congresswoman build up her campaign funds while scolding Bush for tax
cut and Iraq policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid cheers and applause, former President Bill Clinton delivered a
call to arms Friday to 750 party loyalists gathered at a Santa
Barbara estate to raise money and support for a Democratic
congresswoman seeking reelection in November.</LD>
<LD>   "I came because this is really important," Clinton said. "What is
at stake here is what kind of country we're going to have."</LD>
<LD>   Clinton's appearance at the hilltop home of Democratic supporter
Betty J. Stephens helped raise $200,000 for Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa
Barbara), who is being challenged by a wealthy Carpinteria
businesswoman who is backed by top Republicans.</LD>
<TE>   The afternoon stop was one of several fund-raising appearances the
former president has made on behalf of Democratic candidates during a
swing through Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he stumped for Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove)
at an event in Orange County. And earlier Friday, he appeared at a
breakfast for Democratic Gov. Gray Davis at the Beverly Hills home of
businessman Ron Burkle.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Barbara, Clinton held a rapt audience during a 35-minute
speech that touched on a range of issues.</TE>
<TE>   He heatedly faulted the Bush administration's fiscal policies for
depleting the nation's budget surplus and said that cuts now being
proposed fall most heavily on the middle class and the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Upper-income taxpayers, like himself, are the only group to escape
economic harm so far, Clinton charged.</TE>
<TE>   "They give me a tax cut and cut loans for kids trying to go to
college. There is something wrong with that," Clinton said to
cheering applause.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton also cautioned that war with Iraq should not come without
the support of international allies and attempts to send inspectors
back into the country to search for chemical and biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   To act offensively would give Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein good
reason to use whatever weapons he does have, Clinton said.</TE>
<TE>   "How do we know he won't use this stuff or give it to others who
will?" he asked. "That's what you would do if someone was coming to
get you."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton called Capps a friend he has supported since she won a
special election in 1998 to replace her late husband, Walter.</TE>
<TE>   Capps' daughter, Laura, also worked in the Clinton White House.</TE>
<TE>   Capps, 64, is seeking a third term representing a district that
was once a Republican stronghold. New boundaries drawn last year
appear to have made the seat safer for the congresswoman, with
registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans, 45% to 33%.</TE>
<TE>   The largely coastal district runs from San Luis Obispo in the
north to the agricultural fields of Oxnard. Coastal voters tend to
back Democrats, and Capps' Santa Barbara hometown is in the heart of
the district.</TE>
<TE>   But her campaign is taking no chances. Her opponent, sod farm
owner Beth Rogers, 56, has already raised $700,000 and commanded
enough attention in Washington to bring House Speaker J. Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.) out for a fund-raiser last month.</TE>
<TE>   Capps also knows that she needs to make herself known to about
200,000 voters in the Oxnard area who were added to her district.
That will take time and money, campaign officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Capps has raised $1.1 million so far, said campaign spokesman
Chris Henson. She plans to spend between $1.5 million and $2 million
before the Nov. 5 election, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers' campaign manager, Bob Tapella, said Clinton's appearance
shows that the race is closer than the Capps campaign will admit.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is, in fact, a safe seat why would they be sending Bill
Clinton out here? It shows she is concerned about the race and she
has reason to be concerned," Tapella said.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton's verbal skills and political wattage wowed many of those
drawn to the event.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shaking like I just met Paul McCartney," said Tricia Ahern,
51, after shaking Clinton's hand on the receiving line.</TE>
<TE>   Ahern and a friend, Karin Emrich, said they were drawn by the
chance to hear the former president in person. But what he had to say
wasn't always uplifting, said Ahern, a Ventura banker.</TE>
<TE>   "It was heart-wrenching," she said. "To hear him recount how much
things have changed in two years. I feel we are in big trouble in
this country right now."</TE>

<HD>Avian Surgery Depends on Much More Than a Wing and a Prayer</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Tarzana vets get a rare chance to operate on an
injured bald eagle belonging to the Santa Barbara Zoo. It's a big
step up from parrots, one says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tarzana veterinarian Atilla Molnar has done some unusual operations
in his day. He's performed uterus-saving surgery on a roseate
spoonbill, and he's castrated rattlesnakes. But the night before he
operated on Liberty, he was too excited to sleep.</LD>
<LD>   Liberty is a 5-year-old female bald eagle and this week Molnar had
to amputate the injured bird's right wing.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing to touch a bird like this. This
was like driving a Lamborghini, as compared to a Honda Civic," said
Molnar, 38, who sees many more pet parrots in his practice than birds
of prey.</LD>
<TE>   His partner at Capri Plaza Pet Clinic, 32-year-old Kerry Milliken,
is also the attending veterinarian at the Santa Barbara Zoo, where
Liberty lives with another bald eagle, named Betsy.</TE>
<TE>   One recent morning, when their keeper checked on the majestic
birds, she discovered that Liberty had broken her wing so badly that
the bone was poking through the skin.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't clear how the eagle had been hurt. But its wing had been
injured before, and the new compound fracture left it vulnerable to a
life-threatening infection.</TE>
<TE>   Milliken, who assisted in the operation, said she had wanted
Liberty to be treated by Molnar because he is skilled in avian
surgery and after-care.</TE>
<TE>   "Birds are so fragile, unlike dogs and cats," said Molnar, who has
operated on a red-tailed hawk, but never before on a bald eagle.</TE>
<TE>   Anesthetizing one of these imposing raptors is tricky. They are
more prone than other birds to developing heart arrhythmias during
surgery. "And they cool very fast," Molnar said.</TE>
<TE>   To compensate for that, the surgical table was warmed and the
operating room was heated to 86 degrees--uncomfortably warm for
humans wearing surgical masks and gowns.</TE>
<TE>   Eagles have high blood pressure, Molnar said: "If you hit a big
vessel, they can bleed out in minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Carefully controlling fluids during the two-hour operation is also
essential, they said. The bird needs enough to ensure that its air
sacs remain moist and efficient but not so much that excess fluid
spills into its lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty couldn't fly before the amputation. Part of her right wing
had been removed after an earlier injury.</TE>
<TE>   "Since it only had one functional wing to begin with, it's not a
major change for this bird. Now she can go back to her exhibit, and
we don't have to worry about her falling on a stump," Milliken said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the operation, Molnar consulted Patrick Redig, director of
the Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota--the equivalent of
the Mayo Clinic, for ailing eagles.</TE>
<TE>   Redig and his colleagues treat nearly 120 eagles annually, most of
them bald eagles, as well as 800 other raptors and some trumpeter
swans.</TE>
<TE>   What the vet must do, Redig explained, was meticulously suture the
muscles over the top of the shoulder to form a padded envelope.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what Molnar did. "This bird is going to fall down
in the future for certain," he said, "but at least it's going to land
on something soft."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, large birds are easier to operate on than small
ones, because the latter have tiny bones and blood vessels, Redig
said.</TE>
<TE>   But bald eagles are never easy to deal with.</TE>
<TE>   The bald eagle didn't become the symbol of a rebellious young
nation by being a pussy cat. They are incredibly strong.</TE>
<TE>   Only a pre-teen, Liberty stands 2 1/2-feet tall, weighs a muscular
3.8 kilograms (about eight pounds), and is equipped with formidable
talons and three inches of curved beak.</TE>
<TE>   Bald eagles are like "coiled springs," Redig said. "They're very
fractious. Without much provocation, they'll start flailing around
inside their cages."</TE>
<TE>   The Raptor Center pads the walls and ceilings of the rooms where
it keeps bald eagles, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after surgery, Liberty was well on her way to recovery.
Her sutures won't come out for 10 to 14 days, but she had already
polished off a rat and was working on a large trout. "She's a
gorgeous bird," said Molnar, his voice full of respect for his
magnificent convalescent.</TE>

<LD>A Camarillo woman will be formally charged later this month in
connection with the embezzlement of more than $2 million from an
Oxnard seed company, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Dejah Dawn Brown, 37, is scheduled to be charged Sept. 26 in
Ventura County Superior Court with 95 counts of grand theft, money
laundering and forgery and six counts of filing false income tax
returns.</LD>
<LD>   She could spend decades in prison if found guilty of all charges,
said Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Johnson.</LD>
<TE>   As payroll manager for Seminis Vegetable Seed, Brown allegedly
deposited $2.2 million from the company into her personal bank
account between 1998 and 2000, Johnson said. She is also accused of
failing to report the money on her state income tax returns for those
years. All income is taxable, including money from illegal
activities, said a spokesman for the state Franchise Tax Board.</TE>
<TE>   Brown was arrested in June 2001 after company officials noticed
payroll had increased by $500,000 in a single pay period.</TE>

<DH>Crime: The Oxnard man is accused in the fatal shooting of
his girlfriend in July.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard gang member wanted on suspicion of shooting and killing his
girlfriend in Ventura in July was taken into custody Friday at a
friend's house in Oxnard, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Harold Edward Marshall, 32, was being questioned in connection
with the July 26 slaying of Irene Imelda Mata, 22, of Port Hueneme.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Marshall had been sought on a $750,000 arrest
warrant and would be booked into Ventura County Jail with bail set at
the same amount.</LD>
<TE>   According to Ventura Police Lt. Doug Auldridge, Mata was shot once
in the head as she and Marshall sat in a 1991 Chevy Camaro in the
3000 block of Bunsen Avenue, near Buenaventura Golf Course.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said that after the shooting, the Camaro rear-ended an
abandoned van on Bunsen Avenue and a man ran from the car. A gun was
found near the scene.</TE>
<TE>   When police arrived, they found Mata, the mother of a 3-year-old
son and a 2-year-old daughter, dead in the passenger seat. Officers
searched extensively for Marshall but he eluded them.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall, who remained at large, was identified as a suspect after
officers located a friend from Ventura who had loaned him the Camaro.</TE>
<TE>   During the weeks before his arrest, officers sought help from the
public through the Crime Stoppers hotline and interviewed Marshall's
mother. Authorities believed Marshall had been hiding in the Oxnard
area.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, police acted on a tip that Marshall was at a friend's
house in the 4000 block of G Street in Oxnard. He spotted officers
and ran out the back door but was apprehended.</TE>
<TE>   The motive for the shooting remains unclear.</TE>

<DH>Health: Judge says two facilities cannot hold and treat
mentally ill against their will.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge upheld a rare disciplinary
action by county mental health officials against two psychiatric
hospitals that discharged patients to unlicensed boardinghouses.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, five patients living in one such house in the
San Gabriel Valley died. Three suffered drug overdoses.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the county Department of Mental Health removed the
psychiatric hospitals' authority to detain and treat mentally ill
patients against their will.</LD>
<TE>   Judge David Yaffe denied a request for a preliminary injunction to
overturn the sanctions against Hollywood Community Hospital of Van
Nuys and City of Angels Medical Center-Ingleside.</TE>
<TE>   The hospitals argued that the county had improperly punished them
for actions that were beyond their control. They maintained that
patients have the right to decide where to live, even if they choose
an unlicensed boardinghouse that violates the law by providing care
and supervision to disabled residents.</TE>
<TE>   The county, in court papers, maintained that the hospitals knew or
should have known about the deplorable conditions at three
boardinghouses, including filthy kitchens and bathrooms, overcrowding
and psychiatric medications stored in the open.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriffs investigators continue to investigate the now-closed
boardinghouse in the San Gabriel Valley, which housed the five
patients who died. To date, no criminal charges have been filed
against its owner or operator.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the residents died of morphine intoxication, along with
the use of several other medications. One resident died of bleeding
in the brain, and the fifth died of still-undetermined causes.</TE>
<TE>   In their lawsuits against the county, the hospitals maintained
that the sanctions against them would cost them the majority of their
business. In addition, they said some patients would have nowhere
else to go.</TE>
<TE>   Mental health officials replied that there are more than 40
facilities in the county that can hold patients against their will,
and that patients would be able to find care elsewhere.</TE>

<HD>Central American Nations Plan IDs for Immigrants</HD>
<DH>Documentation: Wide acceptance of Mexican program spurs
others. The cards help police, but critics say they weaken border
laws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Encouraged by widespread acceptance of Mexican consulate-issued
identification cards, several Central American nations are planning
to offer similar cards to their expatriates in the United States--a
move that is fueling hope among undocumented workers of easier lives
and fear among critics who see it as a further erosion of national
immigration laws.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the Guatemalan government began taking applications for
identification cards from its citizens who are living in the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   The governments of El Salvador and Honduras said they also plan to
issue their own official identification cards once they solve
questions about cost and fraud prevention.</LD>
<TE>   Mexican officials say 61 banks and 798 police departments and
cities in the United States now accept their matricula consular,
which resembles a California driver's license. Some of those
institutions say they will do so with the Central American
identification cards if they can be assured that tough security
standards will apply.</TE>
<TE>   "The card will help me cash my checks," said Guatemalan national
Hector Rene, 34, a mechanic who came to Los Angeles without work
documents. "Right now, a friend of mine does me a favor to cash the
check," Rene said as he waited in line at the Guatemalan consulate in
Los Angeles recently to apply for the card. "With this ID, I can do
it myself."</TE>
<TE>   The moves by other governments come as California Gov. Gray Davis
weighs whether to sign a bill that would permit illegal aliens to
apply for driver's licenses. Without such identification, many
California immigrants have been unable to buy cars in their name,
obtain insurance, have bank accounts, get telephone service or even
rent videos.</TE>
<TE>   Although a consular card does not substitute for a driver's
license, it can provide vital proof of identification for local
police.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-immigrant groups contend such cards are an attempt to provide
quasi-legal status for people in the United States illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Evelyn Miller, a volunteer with the Huntington Beach-based
California Coalition for Immigration Reform, criticized the
acceptance of the cards by banks and police agencies as "a
mini-amnesty."</TE>
<TE>   "It's one more step through the door," Miller said. "How do we
know who these people are? How does this jibe with our concerns about
national security?"</TE>
<TE>   Immigration experts say consular identification cards have no
effect on a person's immigration status, good or bad.</TE>
<TE>   What they do, however, is provide reliable documentation so that
cardholders can use banks, pay taxes and prove their identity to
local authorities. They actually are better than passports for U.S.
purposes because they list local addresses, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Police departments are welcoming this," said James W. Wilkie,
chairman of UCLA's program on Mexico and president of an
international consortium of researchers on that nation. "They know it
gives a person a non-falsifiable document. They can give them a
ticket instead of take them into custody. And when they give them a
ticket, they know they will appear [in court]."</TE>
<TE>   Without them, Wilkie said, local law enforcement agencies have
been thrust into the position of enforcing federal immigration law, a
role they aren't trained for and cannot legally perform.</TE>
<TE>   "Without proper identification, a petty crime will take you
directly to jail, clogging up the jails and the court system," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   About 500,000 consular cards have been issued to Mexican nationals
since the program began this year. Wilkie said that in California
alone, 40,000 cardholders have opened accounts with Wells Fargo Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Banks and other institutions are hoping for more business when the
Central American governments follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 2,500 Guatemalans have applied for the cards at the
consulate on Olympic Boulevard in downtown Los Angeles, Consul
Fernando Castillo said. He estimated that there are about 600,000
Guatemalans in California and about 1 million in the United States.
About 70% of them lack immigration documents.</TE>
<TE>   "We already have a line for them and we have not even publicized
that we are offering them," Castillo said of the cards, which will
cost $15.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican government charges $29. The fees pay for
administrative costs to issue them as well as the material to make
them.</TE>
<TE>   Hector Munoz, 62, a Guatemalan, said he will use the card for
convenience.</TE>
<TE>   "If nothing else, it serves as an official proof of my address,
and it's easier to carry than a passport," said Munoz, who heard
about the cards on Spanish-language television.</TE>
<TE>   The Honduran Embassy in Washington, D.C., said officials in their
homeland are finalizing plans before offering the identification
cards for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "We know some Hondurans in the United States who can't get a post
office box or check out a library book," embassy spokesman David
Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   "The identification card would certainly help people. We are just
waiting for the official word."</TE>
<TE>   Even though about 90% of Salvadorans in the United States have
work documents, Rene Leon, El Salvador's ambassador to the United
States, said a consular card can help any Salvadoran quickly prove
their identity to local authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Leon said a prototype exists and that his government is weighing
issues such as the cost to the public and security.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to avoid fraudulent use of a card, but we would like to
offer a way for Salvadorans in the U.S. to identify themselves," said
Leon, who plans to promote the card with banks and cities once it is
issued.</TE>
<TE>   California-based corporate spokesmen for Wells Fargo Bank and
Union Bank of California said they will consider accepting the
Guatemalan card and those from other countries.</TE>
<TE>   "We will need to develop our internal procedure to ensure the card
is the one issued by the government," said Joanne Curran, Union Bank
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Guatemalan Consul Castillo said he has talked with banks eager for
Guatemalan accounts, but has not finalized arrangements with them
because the card with a hologram has not yet been manufactured. Cards
are expected to be issued to applicants beginning in about two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo said he realizes officials initially might not recognize
the cards from Guatemala, a smaller country than Mexico with far
fewer immigrants in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we have to overcome by educating people and
lobbying," Castillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said he expects
such cards will be accepted as proof of identification.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as they are legally issued, I do not believe they will
pose any problem," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Los Angeles city officials are expected to review a
six-month test program of the Mexican consular cards, and at that
time, they could decide to include those from Guatemala and other
countries.</TE>
<TE>   David Gershwin, spokesman for Los Angeles City Council President
Alex Padilla, said the city's biggest concern is not immigration
issues, but rather "to keep good diplomatic relations with Guatemala
[while making] sure that the cards have security features."</TE>

<HD>Janitors Stage 1-Day Walkout at Chapman</HD>
<DH>Labor: Workers hoping to form a union allege unfair
practices by firm hired to clean university. 'We respect their
rights,' the company's CEO says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what was called the first strike by custodians in Orange County
history, janitors at Chapman University staged a one-day walkout to
protest what they allege are unfair labor practices by their
employer.</LD>
<LD>   Fourteen janitors who work at the college as employees of
Irvine-based Pacific Building Care Inc. walked off the job Thursday
night. On Friday, about 100 people--mostly janitors and their
families--marched on the university campus in Orange chanting, "No
justice, no peace."</LD>
<LD>   Hours later, the strikers returned to work.</LD>
<TE>   "What we want is respect on the job and a voice at work," said
Eloy Aguilar, 32, one of the strikers.</TE>
<TE>   The strike is the latest action in a months-long effort by the
Service Employees International Union to organize about 200 workers
at more than a dozen Orange County sites where Pacific Building Care
does business.</TE>
<TE>   "The workers felt it was the only way to send a message to Pacific
that they are serious about having their rights respected," said
organizing coordinator Aida Cardenas.</TE>
<TE>   It also is part of a long-term effort by SEIU Local 1877 to
unionize all of Orange County's janitors, Cardenas said.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, about 70% of the county's janitors won better
wages and benefits in their first contract with the county's biggest
custodial companies. The organizing effort came less than a year
after a three-week strike by janitors in Los Angeles attracted
national attention.</TE>
<TE>   The organizing effort at Pacific Building Care began in April and
has led to the filing of three complaints with the National Labor
Relations Board. They allege the company threatened to retaliate
against workers for trying to organize, unlawfully interrogated them
and offered wage increases and other benefits as an incentive to not
join the union.</TE>
<TE>   "The cases are still under investigation," said James Small,
assistant to the NLRB's regional director in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Corbett-Shramo, Pacific's chief executive, said the
company has done nothing to thwart its workers' organizing effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We respect their rights," she said. The decision whether to
unionize "is entirely in the hands of the people."</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very stable turnover base," she added. "In an industry
that has an average of 300% turnover [each year], we have less than
70%. That's remarkably low, and that's because we take such good care
of our people."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas said the company in May raised salaries for employees at
Chapman and other sites where the SEIU was trying to organize
workers. In addition, janitors at Chapman are to begin getting health
insurance Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides don't agree on much--including the level of
participation in the one-day strike at Chapman. Cardenas said 14 of
20 workers walked out. Corbett-Shramo did not dispute the number who
walked out but said her company employs more than 40 janitors at the
college.</TE>

<HD>Nurses Union OKs Tentative Pact With Kaiser-Permanente</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Nurses Assn. reached tentative agreement with
Kaiser-Permanente on a new contract Friday, heading off a potential
strike by 10,000 nurses at 17 hospitals and 37 other medical
facilities in Northern and Central California.</LD>
<LD>   The new contract would provide an across-the-board salary increase
of 26.5% over four years, raising the eventual salaries of some
nurses to about $125,000 a year, according to Deborah Burger, a
registered nurse who headed the union's negotiating team.</LD>
<LD>   These new wages, she said, would match or better those of any
other comparable nurses in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Burger said the new contract also provides an end to mandatory
overtime, beginning Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   It also will provide improved pension benefits and retiree health
benefits. "I think it's a great contract, a fair contract for both
sides," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ann Thode, who headed Kaiser-Permanente's negotiating team,
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel really good about it," Thode said.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser is the largest health maintenance organization in the
state, and the union is the nation's largest nurse-bargaining unit.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations lasted for three months, culminating in a marathon
session Thursday that eventually resolved the issue that Burger said
was the most contentious in the talks: mandatory overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Burger said ending the practice, except in cases of public
emergency, would attract new people to the profession and retain
those now working.</TE>
<TE>   "This will go a long way toward addressing the current nursing
shortage," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The state has one of the worst nursing shortages in decades.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals frequently have 15% to 20% of their nursing positions
vacant, despite signing bonuses and other incentives.</TE>
<TE>   Burger said that the new contract includes establishment of a pool
of nurses available to work in disciplines in which they have special
training.</TE>
<TE>   "This is expected to help address problems in which some
registered nurses have been forced to work in hospital areas for
which they do not have clinical expertise," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The new contract is expected to be ratified by union membership
later this month.</TE>

<LD>The father of 9-year-old Nicholas Farber, whose mother was jailed
after allegedly orchestrating the boy's kidnapping last week in Palm
Desert, will continue to have temporary custody of the boy.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Superior Court Judge Claudia Silbar ruled Thursday
that temporary sole legal and physical custody will remain with
Michael Farber pending a Nov. 7 hearing to determine permanent
custody.</LD>
<LD>   The judge said she wanted to give the attorney for Debra Rose,
Nicholas' mother, time to prepare her case and arrange for Rose to
attend the hearing.</LD>
<TE>   Rose, 38, of Colorado Springs, Colo., is in custody in Riverside
County on four felony charges, including two counts of child
abduction.</TE>

<LD>Fliers posted around USC announced a meeting of a law school group

for short. Remember, these are prospective lawyers.</LD>

<LD>   Odors (cont.): After Don Cook's shot of a White House unit
appeared here (see photo), several readers pointed out that the
symbol displayed was the Capitol dome. Bill Spencer of Dana Point and
J.D. Kuhn of Long Beach each asked if the White House intended to
clean up Congress. I certainly hope so, but that information must be
classified. I called the company to find out and still haven't heard
back from the White House Sanitation press secretary.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mopping up, locally: I'm guessing it was just a slip in a campaign
letter. But Kevin Buck of Upland noticed one candidate seemed to be
running for several seats on the City Council (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   International sanitation effort needed: Media Webmaster Ron
Fineman writes that "like many of you, I've received lots of those
bogus e-mails offering me a chance to collect millions of dollars in
some Swiss bank account controlled by someone in Nigeria or other
far-away country."</TE>
<TE>   (Geez, and I thought I was the only one. I've been mulling over
one offer for several months.)</TE>
<TE>   Fineman continues: "One time, when the e-mail involved some guy
supposedly writing to me on behalf of his wealthy father, I wrote
back telling him that his father had already contacted me, and told
me not to trust him."</TE>
<TE>   Good line. Any other readers have recommended responses for the
get-rich-quicksters? (Responses that can be printed in a family
newspaper.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nothing suspicious about this: A man walked into a Culver City
bank and told the teller he wanted to cash his payroll check, also
handing over his driver's license as his ID.</TE>
<TE>   "The teller could tell that both the check and the license were
forgeries and called the police," the Los Angeles Independent's
police log said. When the teller asked the man to wait, he said:</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I'll just cash it at my branch" and walked out--leaving
behind both the payroll check and driver's license.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So, anything interesting happen on your vacation? A tourist called
police from a motel lobby at 2:42 a.m. "after he lost his keys and
pants," the Laguna News-Post said. "He told police he thought they
might have been taken from him by an unknown suspect."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Special delivery item: Did you hear that San Fernando Valley
Congressman Brad Sherman has introduced a bill to name an Encino post
office after Chick Hearn? Maybe that'll inspire postal folks to
fast-break the mail.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: In this rush-rush-rush society of ours, it was
refreshing to receive a snapshot from John Welch of North Hollywood,

<HD>Candidate Says He Was Offered Bribe to Pull Out of Race</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Complaint is filed with the D.A., but opponent
for the community college board seat denies his rival's allegation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A candidate for the Ventura County Community College Board of
Trustees has accused an opponent of attempting to bribe him to drop
out of the race.</LD>
<LD>   Dan Peate said opponent Sandy Patrizio, along with Joel Angeles,
chief of staff for Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark), offered
to reimburse him for campaign expenses and support him in a future
bid for office if he stepped aside.</LD>
<LD>   Patrizio denies the allegation.</LD>
<TE>   Peate said the offer was made several times after Aug. 14, during
phone conversations and face-to-face meetings. His campaign
treasurer, Justin Saltzman, who attended one of the meetings, has
filed a complaint with the Ventura County district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Chief investigator Gary Auer declined to say if his office was
pursuing the matter, citing policy.</TE>
<TE>   Patrizio and Peate, both Republicans from Thousand Oaks, are vying
for the nonpartisan seat held by departing board President Norman
Nagel. He represents Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park and Oak Park on the
five-member board. Carroll Bowen, Cheryl Heitmann and Linda Van
Dolsen also are running for the seat in the Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't give him any form of bribery," Patrizio, 66, said in
response to Peate's allegations. "I don't know what his game is. This
is something new to me, and I don't know what I'm supposed to do with
it."</TE>
<TE>   Patrizio, who is endorsed by Strickland, said he and Peate met
about two weeks ago at Peate's request, but he refused to say what
they discussed.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's taking our meeting to this extent, and he wants to put it
in the newspaper--I don't know. He's just--I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Peate said Patrizio offered on three occasions to write him a
check for $1,400 to cover his campaign expenses. Patrizio and Angeles
also promised Peate an appointment to the Thousand Oaks Planning
Commission and to support him financially in a 2004 bid for a
Thousand Oaks City Council seat, Peate said.</TE>
<TE>   Angeles, a volunteer advisor to Patrizio's campaign, said that
during an Aug. 15 meeting, Peate was "willing to entertain the idea
of dropping out of the race but said he would need some help."</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Joel, what can you offer me?' " Angeles said. "I said,
verbatim, 'Dan, there are no quid pro quos. It doesn't matter to us
if you're in the race or not. Any support from Tony Strickland is
contingent upon begin honest and hard-working.'</TE>
<TE>   "What he chooses to hear and tell the press is something
different," Angeles said.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy is the latest to hit the community college board,
which is under fire for giving Chancellor Philip Westin a $30,000 pay
raise four months ago after Westin was accused of abusing his expense
account. Westin spent $119,000 over four years, mostly on meals, car
repairs and computer equipment. He has since been placed on paid
administrative leave while the board decides whether to fire him or
buy out his $203,000-a-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   "With the current controversy surrounding the community college
district, the last thing we need are questionable campaign tactics by
candidates for the board," said Peate, 24, who is running on a
campaign to reform the board.</TE>

<LD>Medical marijuana advocates, outraged by a raid at a local
prescription pot supplier, protested at federal offices in several
cities in Northern California and across the country Friday.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, federal agents raided a small pot farm located on a
quiet coastal road about 55 miles south of San Francisco. They pulled
up about 100 plants and arrested owners Valerie and Michael Corral.</LD>
<LD>   The couple, leading proponents of using medical marijuana to ease
patients' pain, were the latest high-profile pot advocates to be
arrested in a series of law enforcement sweeps in the last year in

<HD>Man Gets 9 Years in Markowitz Kidnapping</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Simi Valley man has been sentenced to nine years in state prison
after pleading guilty to kidnapping and robbing a 15-year-old West
Hills boy in August 2000.</LD>
<LD>   William Skidmore, 22, was the first of five defendants sentenced
in the abduction and fatal shooting of Nicholas Markowitz.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Barbara County Superior Court Judge William L. Gordon
imposed the sentence Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Skidmore was present when Markowitz was kidnapped on Aug. 6, 2000,
near his home, but did not participate in the killing two days later
in a secluded area of Santa Barbara County, said Senior Deputy Dist.
Atty. Ron Zonen.</TE>
<TE>   In November, a Santa Barbara jury said Ryan Hoyt, 23, of West
Hills should be sentenced to death for shooting Markowitz nine times
near a remote camping area called Lizard's Mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Hoyt is awaiting sentencing, as is Jesse Rugge, 22, of Santa
Barbara, who was convicted in May of kidnapping for ransom, but not
murder. He faces life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   A separate jury in July acquitted Graham Pressley, 19, of Goleta
of kidnapping, but deadlocked on whether he participated in the fatal
shooting. He is set to be retried on a murder charge this month.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the alleged ringleader, Jesse James Hollywood, 22, of
West Hills, has been charged with kidnapping and murder, but has so
far eluded arrest.</TE>

<HD>Teacher Sues, Saying He Blew Whistle, Was Fired</HD>
<DH>Education: Former Santa Margarita High instructor claims
act is retaliation. School says he ignored mandate to get degree or
credential.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Catholic high school teacher sued the Diocese of Orange on
Friday, alleging he was fired this summer in retaliation for blowing
the whistle on his principal's son, who brought a handgun to campus.</LD>
<LD>   After eight years of teaching science at Santa Margarita Catholic
High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, Michael R. Bodkin said he was
told in June his contract would not be renewed because he hadn't
earned his master's degree or required teaching credential.</LD>
<LD>   "Without a doubt, I've been singled out," said Bodkin, who said
the school employs other teachers who don't hold advanced degrees or
credentials.</LD>
<TE>   Maria Schinderle, diocesan director of human resources, said laws
prohibit her from saying why Bodkin was let go, "but we can state
that it had nothing to do with [Principal Merrett Hemenway] or his
son." She also said the majority of teachers at the diocese's three
high schools have teaching credentials or master's degrees, though
grace periods are given for some teachers to complete the work.</TE>
<TE>   Hemenway left Santa Margarita in June to become principal at
Bishop Amat High School in La Puente. He was named state Principal of
the Year in 1998 by the National Assn. of Secondary School
Principals. Hemenway did not return a call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Bodkin's dismissal came 17 months after Robert J. Hemenway, the
principal's son--then 18 and a recent Santa Margarita graduate--was
arrested in March 2001 for bringing a gun to the high school.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities acted after Bodkin encouraged his own son, who was a
Santa Margarita student, to tell them about the weapon, which Robert
Hemenway had displayed in a school parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   In March, a judge dismissed the two counts--a felony and a
misdemeanor--against Hemenway, saying he was "displaying youthful
exuberance."</TE>
<TE>   In the suit filed in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana,
Bodkin, 46, alleges that "harassment and retaliation commenced
immediately" after school officials were told the younger Hemenway
carried a gun to school.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a classic whistle-blower's case," said Russell J. Thomas,
Jr., Bodkin's attorney. "He saw something illegal, spoke up, and they
fired him for it."</TE>
<TE>   According to the suit, school administrators made "false and
misleading statements" about the gun report, which isolated Bodkin
from his colleagues. Bodkin says he also was denied extra coaching
jobs that he formerly was given, and a new provision was added to his
2001-2002 contract mandating that he earn his teaching credential.</TE>
<TE>   Bodkin said he had completed classes required for the credential
after earning a bachelor's degree from Cal State Dominguez Hills in
1989. But he said he skipped student teaching because, as a
then-single parent, he needed a job.</TE>
<TE>   Bodkin was hired by the Diocese of Orange in 1994 to teach at
Santa Margarita, though he had no credential. He received good annual
reviews, but as early as 1995, evaluators said he needed to complete
his requirements for a California teaching credential.</TE>
<TE>   But Bodkin said he listened to his teaching colleagues. "Everybody
on campus, their attitude was, 'It's no big deal. You don't need it,'
" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, administrators told him to step up efforts to get
his credential. Bodkin said he then tried to get the state to waive
his student-teaching requirement, but his request was denied.</TE>
<TE>   He twice took science proficiency tests, another way to get the
credential, but failed them. Bodkin said he'll get the credential,
but he wants his job back. "I want to walk on campus and show them
that you can't treat people like that," he said.</TE>

<HD>State Veterans Agency to Lose 3rd Secretary</HD>
<DH>Politics: Davis must name his fourth appointee in as many
years because VA chief Bruce Thiesen was not confirmed by Senate amid
ongoing problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Bruce Thiesen, the man Gov. Gray Davis appointed 10 months ago to
head the embattled Department of Veterans Affairs, must leave the
post in November on orders of the state Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, who calls himself California's "most veteran-friendly"
governor, now must find his fourth secretary of Veterans Affairs in
as many years.</LD>
<LD>   Thiesen is being forced to vacate the $131,412-a-year job because
he can serve for only one year without Senate confirmation.</LD>
<TE>   His departure was sealed Sunday when the Legislature adjourned its
2002 session without the Senate approving him or even scheduling a
confirmation hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who had been urged by Senate leader John L. Burton (D-San
Francisco) in December to withdraw Thiesen's nomination, praised
Thiesen this week on doing a "fine job" and lashed at the Senate for
denying him confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   "Secretary Thiesen deserves more respect and appreciation than the
state Senate has shown him," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   He credited Thiesen with restoring the accreditation of the
state-run veterans home in Barstow and opening a third residence for
aging and ailing vets, in Chula Vista.</TE>
<TE>   But in a brief interview, Burton said long-running problems at the
department either failed to improve or worsened under Thiesen. "The
administration is screwed up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thiesen, a farm labor contractor in the San Joaquin Valley before
he joined the Davis administration in 1999, did not respond to a
reporter's request for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to operating the veterans homes, the department
provides benefits to vets, including the low-cost farm and home loan
program, life and disability insurance programs, and services to
disabled veterans.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last few years, investigations by several government
agencies and the Senate have uncovered problems and bureaucratic
blunders.</TE>
<TE>   They included the death of an elderly vet in Barstow who choked to
death on his lunch and the failure to know how much the department is
owed by the federal government in reimbursements.</TE>
<TE>   The department was forced to make a surprise $3-million cutback in
services at the veterans home in Yountville because of its failure to
collect outstanding federal payments.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, infighting among top managers has disrupted
programs and undercut employee morale.</TE>
<TE>   Officials were accused of firing employees and replacing them with
their friends.</TE>
<TE>   Women complained of sexual harassment by a former director, but
charges were never filed.</TE>
<TE>   Thiesen, a former state and national commander of the American
Legion, had held the post of temporary secretary for 18 months after
the forced resignation of Tomas Alvarado in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' first secretary of veterans affairs was James R. Ramos, who
resigned after five months.</TE>
<TE>   Davis promoted Thiesen to permanent secretary in November.</TE>
<TE>   Scarcely a month after Thiesen's appointment, Burton urged Davis
to withdraw him and nominate someone else.</TE>
<TE>   Under Thiesen, Burton said, chronic problems had "persisted and
even worsened."</TE>
<TE>   Fellow Democrats and a Republican later sent a similar letter to
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Davis expressed confidence in Thiesen and refused to abandon his
nominee.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said this week, however, that the governor did not fight
hard for Senate approval.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, representatives of the American Legion and Veterans of
Foreign Wars declined to comment on whether they believed Thiesen was
fairly treated by the Senate. But they made clear their
dissatisfaction with his performance.</TE>
<TE>   VFW lobbyist John Canfield said Thiesen would have been
"embarrassed if a confirmation hearing had been held because the
department at that time had not done anything that was really
noteworthy."</TE>
<TE>   He said, "I really feel that Bruce was not the right man for the
job."</TE>

<HD>Camarillo Bugged by Tiny Visitors</HD>
<DH>Insects: Whiteflies have bombarded the city this summer,
but cooler weather is giving residents--and plants--a respite.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a few days of cooler temperatures, a collective calm has settled
over Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   No, it's not because kids have gone back to school. Rather, it's
the result of a welcome respite from tiny winged creatures known as
whiteflies.</LD>
<LD>   "All summer long, it's been disgusting," said Christy Bowen,
manager of the Bombay Outlet in Camarillo. "We usually do our
shipments outside in the back, but we get covered in the whiteflies,
so we have to come in.</LD>
<TE>   "I've seen people running to get away from them, but nothing
works," the Camarillo resident added. "It's gross."</TE>
<TE>   Barely larger than a speck of dust but highly visible because of
its color, the bug has bombarded the city for the past three months,
thriving on the warm temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   During the summer infestation, whitefly sagas have circulated
around the city. The tales range from lizards getting fat off the
flies to residents forced to use fly swatters to get in and out of
their front doors.</TE>
<TE>   While not new to California, whiteflies began appearing in the
Camarillo area three years ago--and have settled in.</TE>
<TE>   People in the plant industry can't explain why the fluttering
moths inhabit some cities but not others. Even in Ventura County they
are found mainly in Camarillo, with only a handful of sightings in
Ventura and Oxnard. One factor, however, may be the drier air, as
opposed to the dampness of the coastal cities.</TE>
<TE>   With a life span of less than 5 days, whiteflies spend their time
sucking juices from plants and laying eggs before dying. They
reproduce quickly, maturing from egg to adult in as few as 16 days.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to keep up with them because they multiply so fast,"
said Rob Bauer of the Plant Warehouse in Somis. "We know the season
for them only lasts so long, so we just control it as best we can."</TE>
<TE>   There are two ways whiteflies can harm plants: They suck liquids
from a plant, which can cause the leaves to yellow, shrivel and drop
prematurely. And adult whiteflies can transmit viruses from diseased
plants to healthy ones.</TE>
<TE>   While the National Weather Service in Oxnard is forecasting cool
and cloudy weather for several days, area temperatures are expected
to heat up afterward, meaning the resting whiteflies will again be
swarming.</TE>
<TE>   That news will not please city residents, who have tried
everything from treating their plants with insecticidal soaps and
horticultural oils, to blasting the whiteflies with water, to
vacuuming the adults before they have a chance to lay eggs.</TE>
<TE>   While many of those solutions will offer a temporary fix, Carl
Brodock of Baron Bros. Nursery in Camarillo says the key is
diligence.</TE>
<TE>   "Plain old water works, you just have to make sure that you spray
not only the tops of the leaves but underneath as well, because
that's where the eggs live," said Brodock, the nursery's assistant
manager. "I've had customers come in who are so frustrated. The city
is definitely infested, and it's gotten progressively worse, with
this year being the worst."</TE>
<TE>   Although it may appear the flies are gone when fall and winter
roll around, that isn't the case, Brodock said. Their eggs lay
dormant during colder months, but the pests will be back next spring
when temperatures rise again.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he said, his best recommendation is to pinch off the most
infested leaves and dispose of them in a securely tied trash bag,
then use either water, soap or oil to treat the remaining leaves of
the plant every five to seven days.</TE>
<TE>   "The best time to do it is early morning, because the cooler night
temperatures have left the whiteflies torpid," Brodock said.</TE>
<TE>   And if all else fails, take Misty Cain's advice.</TE>
<TE>   Said the Camarillo mother of two: "I try and avoid green areas and
just stay inside."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Schools, Union Reach Tentative Accord on Raises</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District and its teachers union came
to a tentative agreement on a one-year salary increase Friday night
after months of wrangling.</LD>
<LD>   Schools Supt. Roy Romer said he would take the plan before the
Board of Education next week for ratification.</LD>
<LD>   United Teachers-Los Angeles President John Perez said he would
present the plan to the union's board and then, if it passed muster,
put the contract agreement to a vote by union members.</LD>
<TE>   The two parties withheld details of the proposed agreement,
pending approval, but both said they were satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fair and reasonable agreement," Romer said. "Over time
we need to be sure our teachers' compensation is competitive and can
attract high-quality teachers to our district."</TE>
<TE>   Perez and other union leaders have argued that they should get
increases of 5% to stem the tide of teachers leaving L.A. Unified for
nearby districts.</TE>
<TE>   The wage increases would be the first in two years--taking effect
retroactively, beginning July 1 and lasting until next July, when the
contract would have to be renegotiated.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal came two days after the school board allocated $56
million to cover rising health insurance costs--an issue on which
union leaders said they were prepared to strike.</TE>
<TE>   The district found the money for the raises in a $228-million
windfall in unspent funds at the end of the last fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   An agreement would conclude a months-long war of words between the
district and the 48,000-member union and ensure that one of the
state's largest labor organizations will be on hand to push for a
critical $3.3-billion school construction bond.</TE>
<TE>   "This allows us to get off of this salary issue and work
together," Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   A union spokeswoman, Margaret Hojos, said the bond campaign for
money to build 120 schools and to renovate and expand 79 campuses is
the next issue for the union.</TE>

since late August, will proceed as planned.</LD>
<LD>   Pallotta TeamWorks, the event producer that also organized the

250 employees and closed its doors. The two organizations have been
in discussions ever since, said Susan Heaney, director of the Avon

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawmakers in Washington are considering legislation to rename a post
office for the late Los Angeles Lakers announcer Chick Hearn.</LD>
<LD>   The bill was introduced this week by 23 California members of the
House of Representatives to honor the legendary sportscaster, who
lived in Encino for more than 20 years until his death last month at
age 85. Under H.R. 5340, the facility at 5805 White Oak Ave. would
become the "Francis Dayle 'Chick' Hearn Post Office."</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles City Councilman Nick Pacheco, meanwhile, wants to
rename a street near the Staples Center in Hearn's honor.</LD>
<TE>   Until Sept. 15, Pacheco's Web site--www.lacity.org/council/cd14
--will give fans a chance to vote for a name for the stretch of 11th
Street between Figueroa and Cherry streets. Leading contenders
include "Hearn Court" and "Chick Hearn Dribble Drive."</TE>

<HD>Pastor Undergoes Prostate Surgery</HD>
<DH>Health: The Rev. Cecil L. 'Chip' Murray hopes to return to
his duties at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church by early
next month.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. Cecil L. "Chip" Murray, pastor of the nationally known First
African Methodist Episcopal Church, underwent surgery for prostate
cancer Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The three-hour operation on Murray, 73, was completed at 4:30 p.m.
at Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Medical Center, said Kerman
Maddox, a member of the church's board of trustees.</LD>
<LD>   He said the pastor is expected to take six weeks for a "complete
recovery." Murray hopes to return to his full duties in early
October, Maddox said.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Phillip Kurzner, the hospital's chief of urology, said Murray
emerged from surgery speaking and talking clearly.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in very good shape. He really went through the surgery
completely uneventfully," he said. "Rev. Murray is a very healthy man
and we expect him to recover uneventfully."</TE>
<TE>   Kurzner said a pathology report will not be available until next
week.</TE>
<TE>   Murray found out six weeks ago that he had cancer of the prostate,
Kurzner said. Murray considered his options and decided on surgery,
which Kurzner said doctors supported.</TE>
<TE>   The procedure was once considered highly risky. But medical
advances in recent years have removed most of the risk.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Los
Angeles, underwent the same operation in June 1998. Cancer of the
prostate usually is relatively slow growing. In Mahony's case,
surgery was put off until four months after the cancer was diagnosed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know Rev. Murray personally," Kurzner said. "But the
thing that I was struck by was his sense of peace, his calm demeanor.
What we were seeing is a man who knows who he is and a man at peace
with his decision."</TE>
<TE>   First A.M.E. Church is the oldest black congregation in Los
Angeles. The church, a center of political and social action in the
city, is frequently a "must" campaign stop during election years by
state and national candidates, including those running for president.</TE>
<TE>   Murray has videotaped a message for his congregation that will be
played at services at 8 and 10 a.m. and noon Sunday. Church officials
said the public is invited.</TE>

<HD>Clinton Appearance Adds Star Power to Race for House Seat</HD>
<DH>Politics: The former president helps Santa Barbara Rep.
Lois Capps raise $200,000 for her reelection campaign while scolding
Bush for tax cut and Iraq policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid cheers and applause, former President Bill Clinton delivered a
call to arms Friday to 750 party loyalists gathered at a Santa
Barbara estate to raise money and support for a Democratic
congresswoman seeking reelection in November.</LD>
<LD>   "I came because this is really important," Clinton said. "What is
at stake here is what kind of country we're going to have."</LD>
<LD>   Clinton's appearance at the hilltop home of Democratic supporter
Betty J. Stephens helped raise $200,000 for Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa
Barbara), who is being challenged by a wealthy Carpinteria
businesswoman who is backed by top Republicans.</LD>
<TE>   The afternoon stop was one of several fund-raising appearances the
former president has made on behalf of Democratic candidates during a
swing through Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he stumped for Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove)
at an event in Orange County. And earlier Friday, he appeared at a
breakfast for Democratic Gov. Gray Davis at the Beverly Hills home of
businessman Ron Burkle.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Barbara, Clinton held a rapt audience during a 35-minute
speech that touched on a range of issues.</TE>
<TE>   He heatedly faulted the Bush administration's fiscal policies for
depleting the nation's budget surplus and said that cuts now being
proposed fall most heavily on the middle class and the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Upper-income taxpayers, like himself, are the only group to escape
economic harm so far, Clinton charged.</TE>
<TE>   "They give me a tax cut and cut loans for kids trying to go to
college," Clinton said. "There is something wrong with that."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton also cautioned that war with Iraq should not come without
the support of international allies and attempts to send inspectors
back into the country to search for chemical and biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   To act offensively would give Saddam Hussein good reason to use
whatever weapons he does have, Clinton said.</TE>
<TE>   "How do we know he won't use this stuff or give it to others who
will?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton called Capps a friend he has supported since she won a
special election in 1998 to replace her late husband, Walter. Capps'
daughter, Laura, also worked in the Clinton White House.</TE>
<TE>   Capps, 64, is seeking a third term representing a district that
was once a Republican stronghold. New boundaries drawn last year
appear to have made the seat safer for the congresswoman, with
registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans 45% to 33%.</TE>
<TE>   Her largely coastal district tends to back Democrats, and Capps'
Santa Barbara hometown is in the heart of the district.</TE>
<TE>   But her campaign is taking no chances. Her opponent, sod farm
owner Beth Rogers, 56, has already raised $700,000 and brought House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) out for a fund-raiser last month.</TE>
<TE>   Capps has raised $1.1 million so far, said campaign spokesman
Chris Henson. She plans to spend between $1.5 million and $2 million
before the Nov. 5 election, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers' campaign manager, Bob Tapella, said Clinton's appearance
shows that the race is closer than the Capps campaign will admit.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is, in fact, a safe seat why would they be sending Bill
Clinton out here? It shows she is concerned about the race and she
has reason to be concerned," Tapella said.</TE>

<HD>Mideast Crash of Navy Copter Kills KCBS-TV Cameraman</HD>
<DH>Accident: Four sailors are hurt when a rotor on the
aircraft hits the mast of a Syrian freighter. Newsman leaves wife and
two children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A KCBS-TV cameraman who worked for Channel 2 for 24 years was killed
Friday in the Persian Gulf when the U.S. Navy helicopter in which he
was riding crashed into a Syrian freighter, the Pentagon said.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Greene, 50, of Agoura Hills died and four sailors on the
helicopter were injured when a rotor of the SH-60B Seahawk helicopter
accidentally hit the mast of the Syrian ship 80 miles off the Iranian
coast, said Air Force Brig. Gen. John Rosa, a military spokesman in
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   One of the sailors was flown to the U.S. aircraft carrier George
Washington for treatment, while the three others were taken to an
undisclosed location. Their injuries ranged from broken bones to cuts
and scrapes.</LD>
<TE>   The helicopter fell into the ocean. The military spokesman did not
say whether anyone on the ship was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Greene was working with reporter Randy Paige on special
assignment, covering U.S. servicemen serving in the Middle East, KCBS
officials said. He left Los Angeles on Sunday. Greene recently filmed
a Sept. 11 commemorative report in New York City for the station.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa said the Syrian ship has been detained four days, but
declined to elaborate. Paige was on the Mobile Bay, a guided missile
cruiser, 200 yards from the Syrian freighter when the accident
occurred, said Cmdr. Jack Papp, a Navy spokesman in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the accident is under investigation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues in the Southern California news world paid tribute to
Greene as a versatile cameraman who exhibited great bravery on such
far-flung assignments as the El Salvador and Armenian earthquakes and
in Saudi Arabia after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, they said, he was a delight to work with because of
his imagination and humor.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire KCBS family mourns the tragic passing of our beloved
friend and colleague Larry Greene.... [He had] established himself as
one of the best and most honored photojournalists in the business,"
said Don Corsini, KCBS president and general manager.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition to being a consummate pro who loved taking on the
tough assignments, Larry had a special gift for enlightening and
frequently entertaining his colleagues. Our thoughts are with Larry's
wife (Diana) and their two sons, (Clayton, 13, and Connor, 9), as
well as the many people at Channel 2 and throughout the Southland who
considered Larry a dear friend."</TE>
<TE>   A family spokesman said they were too distraught to comment. A
memorial service date will be announced later, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Greene was part of the KCBS team that won a 2002
Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award for its special report on
lead paint in Southland schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry was a remarkable photojournalist. He had that special gift
to tell a unique story with pictures and sound," said KCBS anchor
Laura Diaz. "I was struck by his relentless pursuit of a news story.
Larry brought his love of life, his love of family, his love of
journalism to his work. He had a sparkling wit. And there is an
enormous void in this newsroom today. We are deeply saddened."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Cobb, executive producer in charge of the investigative
unit at the station, called Greene "the heart and soul of the special
assignment team."</TE>
<TE>   "We truly loved and will miss him," she said. "We're just in a
state of shock right now." Greene and Paige had been in the Persian
Gulf immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks "and they wanted to go
back to see how our men and women were doing over there now," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Station spokesman Mike Nelson said KCBS will set up a scholarship
fund for Greene's children.</TE>

<HD>Doctor Faulted in Boy's Starving to Death</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Board alleges gross negligence for physician's
failure to notice malnutrition and abuse of baby in his care.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles physician was accused of gross negligence Friday by the
state Medical Board for the starvation death of an 11-month-old
foster child under his care.</LD>
<LD>   The agency said Jack Vossoughazad, who practices under the name
Jack Azad, failed to recognize that Danzel Bailey was severely
underweight, failed to try to find the source of his poor growth and
failed to treat him for malnutrition, which the medical examiner
ruled eventually killed him. The board is seeking to revoke his
medical license.</LD>
<LD>   "The standard of practice requires that a pediatrician detect
signs of malnutrition and failure to thrive in children, especially
in infants," Ron Joseph, executive director of the Medical Board of
California, said in the formal accusation. "[Azad] was grossly
negligent in his care, management and treatment" of Danzel for
failing to do so.</LD>
<TE>   State investigators also referred Azad's case to the Los Angeles
County district attorney's office for criminal prosecution. A
spokeswoman said no criminal charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   Because Joseph did not ask for an interim suspension while the
case proceeds administratively, Azad continues to practice at Doyne
Medical Clinic on Avalon Boulevard in South-Central Los Angeles. He
declined to comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   An in-depth review of case records and interviews by The Times
last year revealed that Danzel slowly starved even though a number of
other people could have noticed his deterioration.</TE>
<TE>   Several social workers visited him or the home and noted no
problems. Azad saw the child twice and did not treat the boy's poor
growth. Relatives and neighbors visited with the boy and some of them
are haunted by their failure to intervene.</TE>
<TE>   In the days before his death, his regular social worker finally
noticed that Danzel seemed sickly and asked a county nurse for help.
The nurse noted that his development was severely delayed but was
still trying to get him an appointment with a specialist when the boy
was pronounced dead.</TE>
<TE>   Azad, who has denied that he did anything wrong, is the third
person to face some kind of sanction in connection with Danzel's
death.</TE>
<TE>   His grandmother, Sarah Jones, 54, is serving an eight-year prison
sentence for child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   His regular social worker, Sheila Armstrong, was fired by the
Department of Children and Family Services. She appealed her case to
the civil service board, which has yet to render a decision,
according to the department.</TE>
<TE>   Danzel was taken from his mother at the hospital shortly after his
birth in April 2000. Child welfare workers alleged that Felicia
Bailey was a drug addict and an unfit parent.</TE>
<TE>   After three months in foster care in Inglewood, Danzel was sent to
live with his grandmother, who was already raising his toddler
brother and the woman's own 15-year-old disabled daughter in a
one-bedroom triplex in South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the pediatrician used by his foster mother noted
Danzel was right on target, weighing 13 1/2 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   But three months later, when Danzel was first taken to Azad for a
checkup in November 2000, he was severely underweight at about 10 3/4
pounds, far below the average 6-month-old's weight of 17 pounds,
according to county records and the Medical Board.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph, of the Medical Board, said Azad should have examined
Danzel to find the cause of his poor growth and immediately
hospitalized him. He alleges that Azad never even asked for health
records, which would have shown the boy had lost about a quarter of
his weight in the prior three months.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times last year, Azad said he thought
Danzel's low weight was a product of poverty, which he said he
commonly sees in his clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Danzel was still severely underweight when his grandmother brought
him for a follow-up visit on March 20, 2001. He was 11 months old and
weighed 14 1/2 pounds, according to records and the Medical Board.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, 97% of babies weigh 18 or more pounds at that age.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph alleges that a blood test that day showed the boy was
anemic, but Azad again failed to treat the anemia or poor growth.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph claims Azad did not even examine the boy during the March
visit. Had he, Joseph alleges, Azad would have noticed a number of
injuries that were scattered about the child's body--signs of abuse
that were found by emergency room physicians and medical examiners
after he died a month later. Thus, the Medical Board accuses him of
failing to report child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting with the Medical Board in June, Azad produced records
showing he had examined the boy. Because they contradicted records he
had given the Los Angeles Police Department last year, the agency has
charged him with falsifying records.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations in Danzel's case were added to others filed
against Azad earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Medical Board in March accused Azad of negligence, lack of
skill, unprofessional conduct and "excessive prescribing" in two
unrelated cases in which he allegedly failed to properly treat adults
for back pain and sexual dysfunction.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph is asking the Medical Board's Division of Medical Quality
to revoke or suspend Azad's license and reimburse the state for the
cost of investigating and prosecuting him.</TE>

<HD>Consulates to Issue ID Cards Following Mexican Success</HD>
<DH>Embassies: Guatemala is taking applications while El
Salvador and Honduras make plans. The documents help police but raise
the ire of anti-immigrant groups.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Encouraged by widespread acceptance of Mexican consulate-issued
identification cards, several Central American nations are planning
to offer similar cards to their expatriates in the United States--a
move that is fueling hope among undocumented workers of easier lives
and fear among critics who see it as a further erosion of national
immigration laws.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the Guatemalan government began taking applications for
identification cards from its citizens who are living in the United
States. The governments of El Salvador and Honduras said they also
plan to issue their own official identification cards once they solve
questions about cost and fraud prevention.</LD>
<LD>   Mexican officials say 61 banks and 798 police departments and
cities in the United States now accept their matricula consular,
which resembles a California driver's license. Some of those
institutions say they will do so with the Central American
identification cards if they can be assured that tough security
standards will apply.</LD>
<TE>   "The card will help me cash my checks," said Guatemalan national
Hector Rene, 34, a mechanic who came to Los Angeles without work
documents. "Right now, a friend of mine does me a favor to cash the
check," Rene said as he waited in line at the Guatemalan Consulate in
Los Angeles recently to apply for the card. "With this ID, I can do
it myself."</TE>
<TE>   Anti-immigrant groups contend such cards are an attempt to provide
quasi-legal status for people in the United States illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Evelyn Miller, a volunteer with the Huntington Beach-based
California Coalition for Immigration Reform, criticized the
acceptance of the cards by banks and police agencies as "a
mini-amnesty."</TE>
<TE>   "It's one more step through the door," Miller said. "How do we
know who these people are? How does this jibe with our concerns about
national security?"</TE>
<TE>   Immigration experts say consular identification cards have no
effect on a person's immigration status, good or bad.</TE>
<TE>   What they do, however, is provide reliable documentation so that
cardholders can use banks, pay taxes and prove their identity to
local authorities. They actually are better than passports for U.S.
purposes because they list local addresses, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Police departments are welcoming this," said James W. Wilkie,
chairman of UCLA's program on Mexico and president of an
international consortium of researchers on that nation. "They know it
gives a person a non-falsifiable document. They can give them a
ticket instead of take them into custody."</TE>
<TE>   Without them, Wilkie said, local law enforcement agencies have
been thrust into the position of enforcing federal immigration law, a
role they aren't trained for and cannot legally perform.</TE>
<TE>   About 500,000 consular cards have been issued to Mexican nationals
since the program began this year. Wilkie said that in California
alone, 40,000 cardholders have opened accounts with Wells Fargo Bank.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 2,500 Guatemalans have applied for the cards at the
consulate on Olympic Boulevard in downtown Los Angeles, Consul
Fernando Castillo said. He estimated that there are about 600,000
Guatemalans in California and about 1 million in the United States.
About 70% of those lack immigration documents.</TE>
<TE>   "We already have a line for them and we have not even publicized
that we are offering them," Castillo said.</TE>

<HD>School District to Turn Off Extra Lights</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District has pulled the plug on
supplemental outdoor security lighting at 164 schools and other
facilities to save $1.2 million a year, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The district asked the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
to take down lights installed on poles adjacent to campuses and
buildings on July 1, the start of the current fiscal year, said
Stephanie Brady, a district spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   "The decision to shut down was based upon budget cuts" and
officials' belief that there is no "critical need," she said.</LD>
<TE>   She said the officials believe facilities already had adequate
lighting.</TE>
<TE>   There are 800 schools in the district.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the 164 campuses and buildings in the DWP program could be
dark at night, but those schools have yet to be identified, Brady
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working with the LAUSD Police Department to see if there
are any specific safety concerns," she said. "We don't feel that
anything we are doing jeopardizes safety or security."</TE>
<TE>   Six sites deemed cost-effective will remain in the DWP lighting
program, Brady said. Those sites are the Belmont Learning Center,
Bridge Street Elementary School, Newcastle Annex, Sun Valley Middle
School, Orion Street facility and the 17th Street storage facility.</TE>

<HD>Vigil for Victims of Hate Crimes</HD>
<DH>Violence: Labor Day attacks on three men spark rally in
West Hollywood, to be followed by another tonight. One victim remains
unconscious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along a row of swank bars and restaurants in West Hollywood on Friday
evening, more than 1,000 men and women put aside social engagements
for a vigil to protest the Labor Day beatings of three men.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives are investigating the attacks as hate crimes against
gays.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after 10 p.m., Santa Monica Boulevard between La Cienega
and Robertson boulevards filled with marchers holding candles and
shouting "Stop the hate!" Restaurant, bar and shop patrons cheered
them on from the crowded sidewalk as participants made their way up
and down the West Hollywood strip.</LD>
<TE>   "The shock is wearing off and the anger is setting in," Mayor Pro
Tem Steve Martin said earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Fear has crept into West Hollywood, long considered a comfortable
place to be gay.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just so hideous," said Dave Walsh, a friend of the first
victim, Trev Broudy. "But it has really rallied the city in terms of
saying, 'Enough is enough.' We will not be held hostage in our own
city."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, there is a climate of apprehension.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Ayanian, host of the Kachina Grill, said he now walks home
after work with his cell phone set to call 911 at the push of a
button.</TE>
<TE>   "Until they're caught, I could be the next victim," said Ayanian,
39.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Fullerton, 28, who lives in Venice, said the attacks
leave him wondering about any public displays of affection."If you
can't hug someone in West Hollywood, where are you gonna do it?" he
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Travis, a West Hollywood resident, said he wasn't afraid of
the attackers, he was enraged by them.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they should be strung up," said Travis, 34.</TE>
<TE>   Before Friday's vigil, Broudy's friends walked along Santa Monica
Boulevard passing out fliers and urging people to attend.
Coordinators expected hundreds at another vigil tonight.The Labor Day
violence began just after midnight. Authorities gave this version of
events:</TE>
<TE>   Broudy and his friend, Edward Lett, were the first victims. They
had just embraced and were standing on Cynthia Street, a few blocks
off Santa Monica Boulevard, when a car pulled up.</TE>
<TE>   Two men jumped out and set upon Broudy and Lett with a baseball
bat and a metal pipe.</TE>
<TE>   Lett, 22, managed to jump in his car and speed away, relatively
unharmed. Broudy, 33, was still unconscious at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   An hour after the first attack, another gay man, a 35-year-old
West Hollywood resident whose name has not been released, was walking
near Cynthia Street and Hilldale Avenue when two men attacked him,
possibly with a baseball bat or metal pipe. He was able to escape
with large bruises on the back of his head.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say they believe the same assailants were responsible
for both attacks.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday and Friday, officials released sketches of the two
men. One is an African American man in his 20s, between 5-foot-6 and
6-foot-2, who was wearing a dark beanie or skullcap.</TE>
<TE>   The other is also black, in his early 20s, 6 feet tall, of average
build, with short black hair, possibly in braids.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies said the two were driving a 1987 or 1988
four-door Nissan Sentra, possibly light brown or faded red with dark
tinted rear windows and California license plates with the partial
number of 3SDO or 3SOU.</TE>
<TE>   A $50,000 reward is being offered by Broudy's family, owners of
the Abbey restaurant/bar, and West Hollywood novelist Christopher
Rice, son of Anne Rice.</TE>
<TE>   Friends worried about the recovery of Broudy, who they say is
devoted to his friends and his dog, Rigs.</TE>
<TE>   Broudy, who does voice-over work, is known for calling his friends
and doing impersonations.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a man of a thousand voices," Walsh said. "He'll call me as
an old woman. Then he calls me as an Indian doctor."</TE>
<TE>   But Walsh said he always knew it was Broudy, and he always knows
the calls mean his friend cares about him.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want him to wake up and be with us," Walsh said.</TE>

<HD>Schools Tell Soda Drinkers to Make Another Selection</HD>
<DH>Health: Two Orange County districts remove the soft drinks
and unhealthful snacks from vending machines. Student reaction is
mixed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The blue glow of the cola logo beckoned sophomore Chad Winter, who
began to feed a dollar bill into the vending machine. Suddenly, he
recoiled and gave the machine a kick.</LD>
<LD>   "Where's the soda?" said Chad, 15, who groaned when his friends
told him that all the machines at Capistrano Valley High had been
restocked with water, iced tea and juice. "I can't believe this
pathetic school thinks this is the way to get me healthy," he said.</LD>
<LD>   It was a harsh welcome this first week of classes for students at
the Mission Viejo campus and others in the Capistrano Unified School
District.</LD>
<TE>   Capistrano Unified and neighboring Newport-Mesa Unified are
beginning the school year by eliminating soda pop and unhealthy
snacks from school grounds, about two years before Los Angeles
Unified is set to implement a soda ban approved in late August with
great fanfare.</TE>
<TE>   Both Orange County districts are combining the ban with nutrition
education and a greater emphasis on physical activity.</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano has offered nutrition classes for years, and
Newport-Mesa is continuing nutrition seminars it began in January for
parents and students from kindergarten through 12th grade.</TE>
<TE>   "We're teaching kids about making better choices, not just taking
the unhealthy ones away," said Dick Greene, Newport-Mesa's manager of
nutrition services, who said the district began phasing out soda from
vending machines this summer, with elimination expected by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   During snack break and lunch at Capistrano Valley this week, Chad
and many others said they would never buy the new drinks.</TE>
<TE>   Others shrugged and bought what was there.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really like iced tea that much, but I'm thirsty," said
sophomore Joey Sorrentino, 16.</TE>
<TE>   That district's students are in for another jolt next month when a
new set of vending machines is installed. The beverages will probably
continue to be water, juices and iced teas, but the snack
machines--now offering cupcakes, chips and blueberry-filled
cookies--will be restocked with healthier food such as popcorn,
raisins and beef jerky.</TE>
<TE>   Some, like 15-year-old junior Alex Villabrille, said they didn't
mind the switch. Alex said that the peach-papaya drink he bought was
better tasting than soda anyway. "It's more refreshing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   None of the students questioned this week were concerned about the
ban cutting into the funds the sales contribute to their sports teams
and student groups.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did officials at either district think the new policies would
substantially reduce sales.</TE>
<TE>   In Newport-Mesa schools, water had already been outselling soda 2
to 1, Greene said.</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano Unified purchasing director Colleen Emery said she and
vendors and officials from other districts considering similar
policies are eager to see how sales fare.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's my naivete, but I still think if it's a warm afternoon
or you're bored to tears in fourth period, any kind of nice, cold
drink will do," she said.</TE>

<HD>Beach Ball's a Tough Game in Laguna</HD>
<DH>Pickup basketball at shore-side courts attracts strong
competitors, even pros, though the crowds of its heyday are gone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe the glory days of these beachside courts were the 1980s, when
the competition was tougher, the crowds bigger, the games more civil
and the rims more forgiving. But for the hoops junkie who doesn't
mind the occasional spat or stray elbow, there are still plenty of
reasons to bring your jump shot down to Laguna Beach and the courts
at Main Beach.</LD>
<LD>   "You've got the weather, the women, the basketball and a little
South of France look going on," said local legend Gerard "Sweets"
Suite as he gazed out at the blue sea, white sand and luxurious
yachts sitting off the Laguna coast.</LD>
<LD>   Suite, a stocky 41-year-old point guard who has kept himself in
tremendous shape, has been pounding his dribble and floating his
knuckleball jumper through the wind here for 15 years. He remembers
the days when weekend three-on-three tournaments would feature NBA
stars and top college players home for the summer.</LD>
<TE>   "You couldn't even get a seat," said Suite, who played high school
ball in New York at Power Memorial High, better known in basketball
circles as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's alma mater. "It was a pure game,
wide open and fun to watch."</TE>
<TE>   Main Beach veterans say those tournaments and the NBA veterans who
played in them, such as Byron Scott, Kurt Rambis, Michael Cooper,
Norm Nixon and Billy Paultz, put their courts on the basketball map.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Lutz, Laguna Beach's recreation supervisor for the last 24
years, helped create the buzz by organizing the weekend tournaments,
which attracted more than 125 teams to the two half-courts nestled
between South Coast Highway and the pounding surf. Lutz put the
pairings together Friday nights and then watched the talent flock to
the courts early Saturday mornings.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Clipper backup center Sean Rooks would drive two hours
from Fontana during his high school and college years just to play
half-court basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "It was worth it," said Rooks, a 10-year NBA veteran who starred
at Fontana High and the University of Arizona and is a former Laker.
"This was the place to be. The stands surrounding the court were
packed. It was quite a scene."</TE>
<TE>   As word spread throughout the hoop subculture, and the courts were
celebrated in various pickup basketball guidebooks and sports
magazines, the games began to deteriorate.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a foul on every play," Lutz said. "A simple game to 15
points by ones was taking almost an hour to play."</TE>
<TE>   Lutz tried hiring referees to tone down the physical play. But in
1994, he gave up and shut down the tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   The grandstands are long gone now and so is Lutz, preferring to
spend his weekends with his wife rather than breaking up fights over
traveling violations. But the Laguna Beach games are still better
than most, which is why Rooks still travels from Claremont to play
pickup ball at the beach during the NBA's off-season.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Sunday afternoon, Rooks and three buddies ruled the
court while his wife caught up on her reading and his kids played
with their beach toys in a courtside sand pit. Rooks did his share of
scoring and rebounding, but he was hardly a dominant force.</TE>
<TE>   "Today is one of those play-and-be-careful days," said Rooks, who
would rather stay healthy for the upcoming NBA season than trade
elbows under the backboards with the weekend bruisers. "You always
have to assess the crowd here. The older you get, the more careful
you get."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the better players who frequent the courts these days are
a lot like Greg Alley, a 6-foot-5 rugby player who played basketball
at Azusa Pacific University in the mid-1990s. On a recent Saturday,
he waited patiently for two hours before finally taking the court and
picking up two members of the losing team from the previous game. One
of those losers happened to be Suite.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little rough, but that's why I enjoy it," said Alley, who
recently finished a stint with the U.S. national rugby team. "It
usually stays pretty clean."</TE>
<TE>   Alley could have played much sooner on the B court, where the
skill level is much lower and the players are older. Sometimes, the
players on A and B courts sort themselves out by their dress.</TE>
<TE>   The A players usually wear long shorts, numbered jerseys--often
from their city league team--and the latest and most expensive
high-tops. The B court players are sometimes seen in low-top shoes,
short shorts and high tube socks.</TE>
<TE>   Four-on-four games are played to 11 points, with each basket
counting as one point. They can drag on, as they are often plagued by
fouls and erratic shooting.</TE>
<TE>   On weekdays, middle-aged guys with potbellies usually dominate the
courts until late afternoon. The players with serious game don't
start arriving until about 5 p.m. On the weekends, the talent show
and the bickering start about 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting with or against an ocean breeze can be difficult for even
the surest of perimeter shooters, and new highly tempered steel rims
have added to the frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of players never learn to adjust to the wind," Lutz said.
"You need a flatter-trajectory shot here because of the wind. You
want to shoot on the right side, or top of the key with the winds at
your back. You don't want to shoot on land side into the wind."</TE>
<TE>   Alley and Suite didn't have much luck negotiating the wind on this
day. They lost to a team of Laguna Beach veterans. But they will both
be back to try their luck again. "It's a good, high level of ball,"
Alley said. "There aren't a lot of places where you can consistently
get that."</TE>
<TE>   And there aren't many better settings.</TE>

<HD>Boy Faces Prison in Rape of 13-Year-Old</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 17-year-old boy is facing up to eight years behind bars for
allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl while the two were patients at a
West Hills psychiatric hospital, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The boy, whose name was not released because of his age, allegedly
attacked the victim Aug. 13 at Pine Grove Hospital, Los Angeles
County Deputy Dist. Atty. Frances Young said.</LD>
<LD>   According to the victim's mother and medical records, the suspect
entered the girl's room in one of the hospital's coed adolescent
units, pinning her down and threatening to punch her if she screamed.</LD>
<TE>   The boy pleaded guilty to one count of a lewd act with a child on
Aug. 16, Young said. He faces up to eight years in prison or a
juvenile detention facility, Young said. Because he is a resident of
Oxnard, he will be sentenced in Ventura County. A hearing date has
not been set.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Friday, the victim's mother criticized the
hospital for what she said was insufficient patient oversight. She
said her daughter had checked into the hospital for treatment of a
bipolar disorder and depression. Since the rape, the girl has
attempted suicide and is unable to return to school, the mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "She felt like I did," the mother said. "I felt betrayal."</TE>
<TE>   The incident is the second involving a sex crime against a minor
in the last two years at the private, 80-bed psychiatric facility, at
7011 Shoup Ave.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, a jury found a former Pine Grove employee, Quincy
Crawford, guilty of two counts of lewd acts upon a child for crimes
he committed against another 13-year-old patient in 2000, district
attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said. Crawford was sentenced to
three years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Pine Grove Administrator Larry McFarland declined to comment on
either incident, but said Pine Grove's practices and procedures are
regularly reviewed by state health officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I do know we take very seriously the care of the patients,
especially the adolescents, charged in our care," he said. "We do our
utmost best."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital is required by law to report such incidents to the
California Department of Health Services, said Lea Brooks, a
department spokeswoman. The state then launches an investigation to
determine if hospital procedures are adequate or need to be improved,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks said the department is investigating the most recent sexual
assault.</TE>

<HD>Tall Ship Flotilla Drops Anchor at L.A. Port</HD>
<DH>Festival: Thousands greet the elegant vessels as they
navigate choppy seas to enter harbor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN and STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They stared through binoculars and squinted through the glare by the
thousands Friday, transfixed by a spectacle of swelling sails and
90-foot-tall masts, polished wood and miles of rigging as 14 tall
ships swooshed into the Port of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Dubbed the "Festival of Sails," this was one parade that truly
floated, as awestruck spectators lined the bluff-edged streets of San
Pedro, crowded along the ocean-view rails of Point Fermin Park and
even perched on roofs to witness a moment of seafaring majesty.</LD>
<LD>   "If this were a picture on a wall, I would buy it," said Paul
Bokor, 71, of El Segundo as he stood at the highest plateau of Point
Fermin. He gazed in silence as the tiny armada assembled one mile
offshore, with fog-shrouded Catalina Island and cloud-streaked skies
as the backdrop.</LD>
<TE>   From this distance, the parade--organized by the Los Angeles
Maritime Museum; its educational affiliate, the Los Angeles Maritime
Institute; and the Port of Los Angeles--moved slowly and smoothly
with a peaceful elegance.</TE>
<TE>   For Bokor and so many other spectators, the vista provided a pure
historical fantasy, conjuring images of the Age of Discovery,
pirates, cannons and seafarers with salt in their veins.</TE>
<TE>   "We all see ourselves on Treasure Island," Bokor said. "I'm
sitting on the deck of a ship on the open sea, now that's true
freedom."</TE>
<TE>   An inspired Pelham Henry, 69, asked, "What's that saying? 'The
ships were made of wood and the men were made of steel'?"</TE>
<TE>   But on the water, chaotic moments gripped the crew of the Swift of
Ipswich, a 90-foot-long replica of an American topsail schooner of
the Colonial Era.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Peter Bulkley, a retired naval officer who has sailed across
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, found erratic winds and 3-to 4-foot
swells a test of his considerable skill.</TE>
<TE>   "Slack the headsails!" he shouted from the helm to his crew of 12
men and women as he began the delicate maneuver of turning the vessel
into Angel's Gate, the perennially windy entrance to the nation's
busiest harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of his crew were veteran sailors, and they needed nothing
short of precision in their movements: pulling the rigging to change
direction of the sails.</TE>
<TE>   While the parade was well choreographed a year in advance, no one
anticipated the onslaught of L.A.-style pleasure-boaters. Dressed in
their shorts and Hawaiian shirts, they waved from little motorboats
that dangerously loitered in the path of these giant "Cathedrals of
Sail."</TE>
<TE>   "Get those people outta there!" yelled a crew member as the Swift
scudded within a few yards of three boats.</TE>
<TE>   "Spectators don't realize we are dependant on wind and not very
maneuverable," said Bulkley. Seconds later, the Swift sliced through
choppy seas at close to its top speed of 8 knots.</TE>
<TE>   With the ship leaning 20 degrees to starboard in strong winds,
water sloshed over the sides as crew members made a mad grab for
ropes to keep from falling down.</TE>
<TE>   "Ride 'em cowboy! Yee-haw!" screamed sails man Cappy Cross, 49,
with wild delight.</TE>
<TE>   The erratic winds made it impossible for the parade to maintain a
constant speed, stretching the line of their procession longer than
planned--not that any spectator noticed.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, exposure to tall ships can typically be
limited to the Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Johnathan Stadler, 4, first learned about ships, his
mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "Cool," the boy said. "I just like how they are SO BIG."</TE>
<TE>   The marshal of this parade was no Hollywood star.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Burgman was selected by the Marine Institute for his years of
piloting tall ships. From a Coast Guard cutter he called out
minute-by-minute navigation instructions to ensure that the ships
stayed in line, in order and out of harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   Onshore, spectators were wondering about the story behind each
vessel, its name, its builder. Is it really wood? What are the sails
made of? What is the 2002 mission of a 19th century replica wind
machine?</TE>
<TE>   Leading the parade was the Swift, followed by the brigantine
Irving Johnson of Los Angeles on its maiden voyage.</TE>
<TE>   Behind her followed the topsail schooner Bill of Rights out of Los
Angeles and then the Spirit of Dana Point, a gaff topsail schooner.</TE>
<TE>   Then came seven more ships from as far away as Ukraine and New
Zealand. The last was the grandest. The Europa, a 185-foot-long
square rigger from the Netherlands, with its three giant masts that
earned the gasps of spectators.</TE>
<TE>   While such a floating parade is new to the Port of Los Angeles,
which temporarily halted commercial freighter traffic for the event,
tall ship extravaganzas are common on the East and Northwest coasts,
where port cities proudly embrace their maritime heritage.</TE>
<TE>   As the ships sailed past the breakwater, Angelenos chased the
parade by their preferred mode of transportation: their cars. The
streets of otherwise sleepy San Pedro were jammed as vehicles wended
their way downhill to the port.</TE>
<TE>   "What's going on here? What's everyone looking at?" asked one
flustered mail carrier trying to traverse congested streets.</TE>
<TE>   The third-grade class from nearby Point Fermin Elementary School
crowded the corner of Carolina and 37th streets for a live history
lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly the tall ships slid past, looking for all the world like
the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "This is how it looked when Columbus landed," said teacher
Stephanie Chow. But the biggest applause arose from the kids when a
city fireboat let off a massive fountain of spray to welcome the
ships to harbor.</TE>
<TE>   These days, many of the world's tall ships are floating classrooms
that often take land-locked, at-risk adolescents on
character-enhancing voyages.</TE>
<TE>   "They provide adventures, and adventures aren't worth a darn if
you are not learning something," said Capt. Jim Gladson, president of
the Maritime Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The estimated $100,000 cost of the Festival of Sails was covered
by private donations, grants, the Port of Los Angeles and cash
returns from the sale of souvenirs.</TE>
<TE>   The ships will remain docked in Ports o' Call Village through
Monday for viewing and boarding. For $50, visitors can sail beyond
the breakwater to participate in mock battles with real cannons but
simulated cannon fire.</TE>
<TE>   Under billowing Dacron polyester sails--not the flax and cotton of
old--the ships completed their procession by sailing past
150-foot-tall hammerhead cranes, goliath freighters and finally
beneath the 6,060-foot-long Vincent Thomas Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Bridge traffic slowed to 20 mph as drivers craned their necks to
see this oddity of elegance against grit.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of good people came out today and became happy watching
their dreams float by in tall ships," said Nancy Richardson, vice
president of the Maritime Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Jill Dale's thoughts drifted as she watched from the Maritime
Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything these days is so modern and sleek," said Dale, 43, of
Newport Beach. "But just look at those sails, look at the lines, the
wood. Imagine being on the high seas.... "</TE>

<HD>Activists Challenge U.S. Plan for Desert</HD>
<DH>Habitat: Groups say Bush administration proposal would
damage Sonoran ecosystem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of environmental groups Friday petitioned the Bush
administration to provide more shelter and protection for wildlife in
its new management plan for the Sonoran desert, a blueprint they say
favors commerce and recreation at the expense of conservation.</LD>
<LD>   The 10 groups contend that the desert management proposal violates
a slew of federal laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the
Wilderness Act, by, among other things, eliminating once-protected
terrain for the imperiled desert tortoise, and by allowing motorized
recreation in fragile desert washes. The new plan also rejects the
federal government's own prescription for saving the endangered
tortoise, the groups charged.</LD>
<LD>   The challenge is not a lawsuit, but is considered a precursor to a
legal showdown. By filing a formal petition, the environmental
organizations hope to move the debate over a giant chunk of desert to
Washington, landing it squarely on the desks of U.S. Interior
Secretary Gale A. Norton and President Bush.</LD>
<TE>   If the environmental activists' petition is discarded, they said,
they intend to bring a lawsuit in federal court.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is one of a series of Western desert management plans the
federal government has been working on for years. It is a draft
proposal that the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, a division of
Norton's department, recently released to oversee a portion of the
giant Sonoran Desert.</TE>
<TE>   The contested region, often referred to as the Colorado Desert in
California, covers 5.5 million acres that extend north from the
Mexican border and includes large pieces of Imperial, Riverside and
San Bernardino counties, as well as landmarks such as the Chocolate
Mountains and part of Joshua Tree National Park.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Unique Ecosystem</TE>
<TE>   Described as North America's hottest desert, the region's unique
rain patterns and other ecological factors foster dozens of rare
plants and animals. Some species' populations have fallen
dramatically in recent years, sometimes because of natural causes,
including disease, but often because highways, development,
agriculture and recreational uses, such as off-road vehicles, have
penned them in or destroyed their habitat.</TE>
<TE>   "After almost a decade of attempting to work with the Interior
Department to come up with a plan that's going to restore wildlife in
the Sonoran Desert of California, what we see now is a plan that does
worse than the status quo," said Daniel Patterson, a desert ecologist
with the Center for Biological Diversity.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit organization, based in Idyllwild and Tucson, is a
frequent critic of the Bush administration's environmental policies
and is one of the groups leading the challenge to the desert
management plan.</TE>
<TE>   "This plan takes steps back in conservation," Patterson said.
"That's why there has been such a strong and broad challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Bureau of Land Management officials in Washington and
representatives of Norton did not return phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   In California, several BLM officials said they have worked for
years in the desert to strike a balance among public access,
commercial interests and conservation.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Bedrosian, a BLM congressional and legislative affairs
specialist in Sacramento, said the agency's job is similar to that of
a baseball umpire: "If we do our job well, we probably shouldn't make
either side very happy.</TE>
<TE>   "Collaboration with a wide spectrum of users is the way we do
business," she said. "This is a prime example of that. We try to
guide ourselves up the middle."</TE>
<TE>   BLM officials readily acknowledged that most of the environmental
organizations' charges are true--the government does plan to reduce
so-called "critical" habitat for the endangered desert tortoise, for
example, and does plan to allow off-road vehicles in the generally
dry desert stream beds, known as washes.</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Crowe, a BLM planner and lead author of the agency's
proposal, said dozens of groups have had input in the plan, despite
charges that environmentalists have been virtually ignored in recent
months. Those groups include ranchers, hunters and off-road vehicle
enthusiasts--but also conservationists, such as the California Native
Plant Society, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The end product, he said, is "common ground."</TE>
<TE>   "Just because all the decisions don't go your particular way, that
doesn't necessarily mean you are not being heard," he said. "I'm not
trying to be flip. But sometimes if you don't get the answer you
want, [you think] there is something wrong with the answer. There are
a lot of organizations that are incorporated into this plan."</TE>
<TE>   Among the environmentalists' specific concerns is the fact that
the management plan calls for a reduction of more than 150,000 acres
of habitat that had been set aside for the desert tortoise.</TE>
<TE>   "The tortoise is fast disappearing from the California deserts,"
said Michael Connor, executive director of the Desert Tortoise
Preserve Committee. "Where is the sense in this?"</TE>
<TE>   The BLM's Crowe said the desert management plan still calls for
874,000 acres of protected habitat, more than the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service recommended in its 1995 blueprint for tortoise
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Another objection is that the plan would allow off-road vehicles
to drive in desert washes, among the most densely vegetated areas of
the desert and places where many rare species congregate and mate.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some areas you could use without overall harm,"
Patterson said. "But you would have to protect other ones. BLM
completely ignored their responsibility. It's like they went home
from work at noon and never looked at that part of the plan again."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Turcke, a Boise, Idaho, attorney who has become a leading
voice for off-road vehicle enthusiasts, said it's possible to allow
vehicular use in those areas without harming the environment.</TE>
<TE>   "We think good science supports that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Artificial Oases</TE>
<TE>   Further upsetting environmentalists is the fact that the plan
would lead to the construction of more than 20 "guzzlers"--tanks that
provide water to animals in the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Hunters who shoot mule deer and, to a lesser degree, bighorn
sheep, lobbied for that change, all sides agree.</TE>
<TE>   That portion of the proposal would upset the balance of the food
chain and the populations of animals and plants in the desert,
Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not anti-hunting. I am a hunter," Patterson said. "What we
are opposed to is the artificial manipulation of game populations.
This is an industrial, old-school wildlife management approach."</TE>
<TE>   Crowe acknowledged that the installation of the tanks would please
hunters. But he said environmental organizations are conveniently
sidestepping another important, conservation-minded reason for the
water tanks.</TE>
<TE>   A sizable population of bighorn sheep is effectively trapped in a
piece of desert that is bordered by Interstate 10 and the Colorado
River. Because their instincts allow them to stray only a short
distance from water in search of food, the water tanks would help
sustain their numbers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an artificial problem that requires an artificial
solution," Crowe said. "The goal is to keep them from dying out."</TE>

<HD>Teacher Sues, Says Blowing Whistle Led to Dismissal</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Catholic high school teacher sued the Diocese of Orange on
Friday, alleging he was fired this summer in retaliation for blowing
the whistle on his principal's son, who brought a handgun to campus.</LD>
<LD>   After eight years of teaching science at Santa Margarita Catholic
High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, Michael R. Bodkin said he was
told in June his contract would not be renewed because he hadn't
earned his master's degree or required teaching credential.</LD>
<LD>   Bodkin said the school employs other teachers who don't hold
advanced degrees or credentials.</LD>
<TE>   Maria Schinderle, diocesan director of human resources, said laws
prohibit saying why Bodkin was let go, "but we can state that it had
nothing to do with [Principal Merrett Hemenway] or his son."</TE>
<TE>   Schinderle also said the majority of teachers at the diocese's
three high schools have teaching credentials or master's degrees,
though grace periods are given for some teachers to complete the
work.</TE>
<TE>   Hemenway left Santa Margarita in June to become principal at
Bishop Amat High School in La Puente. He did not return a call Friday
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Bodkin's dismissal came 17 months after Robert J. Hemenway, the
principal's son--then 18 and a recent Santa Margarita graduate--was
arrested in March 2001 for bringing a gun to the high school.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities acted after Bodkin encouraged his own son, who was a
Santa Margarita student, to tell them about the weapon, which Robert
Hemenway had displayed in a school parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   In March, a judge dismissed the two counts--a felony and a
misdemeanor--against Hemenway, saying he meant no harm and was
"displaying youthful exuberance."</TE>

<HD>Officers Exonerated in Wrongful-Death Suit</HD>
<DH>Long Beach: Jury finds they didn't act recklessly or
negligently in chasing, shooting a man in 1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Long Beach police officers who shot a man as he ran away three
years ago did not use unreasonable force, nor did they act
negligently, the jury in a wrongful-death suit found Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The jurors' 10-2 verdict was good news for the city, its Police
Department and the five officers who fired their guns during the
chase that ended in the death of John Francis Jordan, 26, on the
evening of Sept. 3, 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan's family, who brought the $10-million suit on behalf of his
two small children, had claimed the officers bungled the pursuit and
recklessly and unjustifiably killed a man who was unarmed and who did
not resemble the man they were really seeking.</LD>
<TE>   Police said they believed at the time that Jordan was an armed
robbery suspect named Troy Cunningham, and that he had a weapon. No
weapon was found after the nearly four-block chase through a
working-class residential neighborhood in North Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach officials investigated the shooting and found it to be
justified, as did the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
after reviewing the city's report.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who had a criminal record but, according to family
members, had begun to turn his life around, was hanging out with
several others at a small bungalow on that Friday evening when
officers arrived to check on what they said was a report of drug use
there.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing the officers, Jordan leaped out a back window, ran, hid for
while, then, as a police helicopter's beam flushed him out, took off
running again. About 20 officers, including some with dogs, joined
the hunt.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan was shot as he tried to scale a fence. Officers said he had
reached for his waistband, leading them to believe he was about to
attack them. His family said he had been trying to surrender when an
officer fired, causing him to resume his flight and setting up the
events that resulted in his death from several bullet wounds.</TE>
<TE>   The coroner found substantial amounts of methamphetamines in
Jordan's system.</TE>
<TE>   William J. Clough, one of the attorneys who brought suit on behalf
of Jordan's family, said after the verdict he was disappointed but
not terribly surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "Unbelievable!" Jordan's father, Gregory, said outside the
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "Jurors find it very difficult to hold police officers liable,
especially when they all present a unified front" in their reports,
Clough said.</TE>
<TE>   Clough said he will appeal Judge Gary Hahn's ruling, early in the
eight-week trial in Los Angeles Superior Court in Compton, that
Jordan's civil rights were not violated.</TE>
<TE>   William A. Reidder, the senior deputy city attorney who defended
the Police Department, said the verdict vindicated the officers and
the department, which has been under fire from civil rights activists
recently for two other shooting deaths</TE>
<TE>   Both involved African American women who had knives.</TE>
<TE>   Glenda Lee Rymer, 49, died after being hit with a "less lethal"
beanbag shot as police tried to disarm her after a domestic dispute
in June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In January, police shot mentally ill Marcella Byrd, 57, after she
left a market without paying for groceries and raised a knife at
officers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a cluster of cases," Reidder said. "These are all
completely separate with their own sets of circumstances, and we'll
deal with those the same way we dealt with this one, by laying out
the facts."</TE>
<TE>   Reidder and the five officers in the Jordan case--Anthony Anast,
David Frazier, Joseph Marsh, Suradech Sriwanthana and Oscar
Valenzuela--talked for a while with several jurors after the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   A few of the jurors also agreed to speak with The Times on
condition that their names not be used.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors said they based much of their decision on a careful
listening to recordings of police communications during the incident,
which persuaded them officers believed Jordan to be armed at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs had argued that the first officer to shoot did not
alert other officers that he had fired his weapon, leading other
officers to believe the gunfire came from Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors, however, said they believed police, who maintained the
first officer did attempt to alert his colleagues that he had fired.</TE>

<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>If you didn't see this coming, you just weren't paying attention.</LD>
<LD>   In the question of when the United States would lose its first
basketball game with NBA players, sooner definitely had the edge on
later.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps you hadn't noticed the USA's two-point squeaker over
Lithuania in the Sydney Olympics because it was so far away, at such
a strange time that you might have wondered whether the 2000 Games
even happened at all.</LD>
<TE>   But you had to know that the NBA's rookie of the year was from
Spain, and you had to see all of those difficult-to-pronounce foreign
names selected in the first round of the NBA draft in June.</TE>
<TE>   So the consecutive losses to Argentina and Yugoslavia suffered by
the U.S. at the World Championship this week were the next step.
Almost inevitable. The days of the automatic wins are over.</TE>
<TE>   That means there's only one thing left in the world that's
guaranteed: Whenever "MTV Cribs" visits the home of a rapper, he will
have a copy of "Scarface" in his DVD collection.</TE>
<TE>   What makes other countries able to compete with the U.S.? The same
thing that has made foreign players so appealing to NBA general
managers: commitment to fundamentals and teamwork.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina and Yugoslavia didn't beat the United States because
they threw up crazy shots that happened to go in. They won with
better execution, better passing and cutting and, in Yugoslavia's
case, better free-throw shooting in the clutch.</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention better coaching. Maybe USA Basketball hadn't been
paying attention, either, when it chose George Karl to head this
group. Karl's name seems to be closely associated with the phrase
"spectacular disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   His Seattle SuperSonic teams might have been the best in the
league during Michael Jordan's sabbatical in the mid-'90s, but they
were bounced in the first round of the playoffs both times.</TE>
<TE>   He was the highest-paid coach this season, his Milwaukee Bucks
picked to win the Eastern Conference title. Yet he wound up hating
his players, they hated him back and the Bucks didn't even make the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   After the United States had lost to Argentina on Wednesday, Karl
predictably went into panic mode and changed three starters. Then he
couldn't come up with good plays when the game Thursday was a
one-possession affair at the end.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, Karl didn't have the best-equipped roster. The NBA's
elite players declined to come, leaving this squad with no low-post
threats and not enough deadeye shooters.</TE>
<TE>   There has been mounting pressure on the top players--notably
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant--to step up for the cause. I think
there ought to be a draft, and every player should be required to
play in at least one Olympics and one World Championship, if asked.</TE>
<TE>   You get the sense that the players from other countries wanted to
be here, which gave them an edge.</TE>
<TE>   Peja Stojakovic of the Sacramento Kings suffered a badly sprained
ankle during the playoffs, but that didn't keep him from showing up
for Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   "For me it is important [to be with] the rest of the guys,"
Stojakovic said after Yugoslavia had beaten the United States. "We
all had the tough seasons and long seasons. I think the national team
brings us joy.</TE>
<TE>   "We all have fun playing together, and today we showed it. We
showed we are a real team. We really care about the people in our
country. If you can imagine how many people were in the bars at 3 in
the morning [watching in Europe], it's great. It was worth it."</TE>
<TE>   These guys grow up playing together. They play on national teams
as teenagers--another reason they're more advanced than U.S. high
school kids and college players--and they play under the FIBA rules
used for international competition, such as the wider lane and
different goaltending regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not fair for those [U.S.] players who are there,"
Yugoslavia's Vlade Divac said. "It's an international game. It's a
lot different from the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to get used to the rules. You need so much time to get
used to the rules, and it's frustrating for them. International guys
take advantage of that. I feel sorry for them."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it's come to that: foreign players feeling sorry for the U.S.
Not fear, not awe. Pity.</TE>
<TE>   How about this unintentional slight from Divac after beating the
United States to advance to the semifinals:</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great win for us and it's a great opportunity for us. But
it's just one game. We've got to finish up."</TE>
<TE>   They beat U.S. pros and it's just one game?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it isn't cause for national holidays anymore. The defeat
certainly hasn't provoked national distress here in the States. With
college football underway, the NFL kicking off and baseball title
races cooking, most people weren't aware of the event until the
Americans lost.</TE>
<TE>   It sure wasn't a big deal in the host city, the capital of the
supposedly hoops-crazy state of Indiana. High ticket prices and lack
of interest kept crowds in the hundreds for some games. There were
more and noisier fans for Yugoslavia than the United States on
Thursday night. And only about 1,000 showed up Friday night to watch
the U.S. beat Puerto Rico, 84-74, in a classification-round game. The
Americans play Spain tonight--for fifth place.</TE>
<TE>   Losing superiority isn't the worst thing. Healthy competition is
good, and Thursday's game had plenty of drama. Every time the United
States made a big shot, Yugoslavia came back with one of its own--and
then some.</TE>
<TE>   Put it this way: Didn't you enjoy the Lakers' conference finals
struggle with Sacramento more than their NBA Finals blowout of New
Jersey?</TE>
<TE>   We'll only look back at this week as a bad turning point if the
trends from this year's World Cup and World Championship continue ...
and the United States becomes a soccer country.</TE>

<HD>Mariners Get Off to Good Start on Trip</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bret Boone knows this could be a make-or-break trip for the Seattle
Mariners if they want to remain in playoff contention.</LD>
<LD>   Boone drove in three runs, and Edgar Martinez homered and scored
three times as the Mariners beat the Kansas City Royals, 14-7, Friday
night at Kansas City, Mo.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first game of a 10-game trip for the Mariners, with the
first seven against the Royals and Texas Rangers--teams already out
of the playoff hunt.</LD>
<TE>   "These games are crucial," Boone said. "This road trip is crucial.
We've got to beat the teams that we should beat. We need to have a
great road trip."</TE>
<TE>   Freddy Garcia got his 15th win for the Mariners, who remained four
games behind the Angels in the American League wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle moved to within six games of first-place Oakland in the AL
West. Martinez and John Olerud each had three hits.</TE>
<TE>   "It is good for us to pick up a game finally," Mariners manager
Lou Piniella said. "It's been three weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Beltran homered from both sides of the plate, only the
fifth time that's happened in Royal history. Beltran was the last to
do it on June 29, 2000, against Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third time in 22 games the Mariners scored in double
figures. They had scored three runs or less in 12 of their previous
18 games.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 7, Toronto 2--Benny Agbayani drove in three runs in his
Boston debut as the Red Sox won at Boston. Agbayani, recalled from
triple-A Pawtucket on Tuesday after being claimed off waivers Aug. 26
from Colorado, went two for four and threw out a runner at the plate
in the third. Tim Wakefield, a bright spot in Boston's recent
struggles, pitched seven strong innings for the win.</TE>
<TE>   New York 8, Detroit 1--David Wells pitched a five-hitter and Jason
Giambi hit his 35th home run, leading the Yankees at New York. Giambi
had three hits and scored three runs as the AL East leaders won their
fourth in a row. Wells (16-7) won for the ninth time in his last 11
starts, and only allowed a Tiger past second base once. Jorge Posada
set a Yankee record for catchers with his 36th double.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 9, Tampa Bay 3--Todd Hollandsworth hit a two-run homer in
the ninth to extend Texas' home-run streak and the Rangers won at St.
Petersburg, Fla. The Rangers have homered in 24 consecutive games,
one short of the major league record shared by the New York Yankees
(1941), Detroit (1994) and Atlanta (1998). Herbert Perry singled to
lead off the Texas ninth and Hollandsworth homered on the next pitch
from Esteban Yan. Hollandsworth also doubled and singled, driving in
three runs and scoring three times.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 9, Chicago 7--Lee Stevens homered twice and tied a
career high with six RBIs as the Indians beat Mark Buehrle and won at
Chicago. Dave Burba, making his first start for Cleveland this
season, gave up four runs and seven hits in six innings to help the
Indians win their third consecutive game.</TE>

<HD>Angels, Lackey Stay on Course With Win</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>If the pennant race extends to the final weekend, the Angels'
tentative rotation shows Jarrod Washburn, Kevin Appier and Ramon
Ortiz starting the last three games of the season.</LD>
<LD>   The playoff bids might all be claimed before that last weekend,
and if the Angels win they would have the luxury of reserving one of
their top three starters for the playoff opener.</LD>
<LD>   Without that luxury, their starting pitcher could be a 23-year-old
rookie who was a first baseman four years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels would not mind, and John Lackey would not back down.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey won again Friday, and so did the relentless Angels. They're
two games out of first place in the American League West, after they
extended their latest winning streak to eight games with a 6-3
victory over the Baltimore Orioles.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels also held their wild-card competitors at bay while
crossing another day off the schedule. With 22 games left, they lead
the Seattle Mariners by four games and the Boston Red Sox by 7 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey was not the only hero. Garret Anderson and Adam Kennedy
each homered, and Troy Percival struck out the side in the ninth
inning for his 34th save. David Eckstein, the Angels' leadoff hitter,
singled twice and walked twice; he has reached base in 10 of his past
12 plate appearances. And, for the first time since June 15,
designated hitter Brad Fullmer drove in three runs.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer, a .300 hitter in his career with runners in scoring
position, is hitting .240 in that situation this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been terrible with men in scoring position," he said. "We've
got some big games coming up, and hopefully I can get some big hits."</TE>
<TE>   Lackey bulled his way through six innings, yet again displaying
composure that belies his age.</TE>
<TE>   He stumbled in the first inning. The first two batters singled,
another doubled, he threw a wild pitch and the Orioles led, 2-0, five
batters into the inning.</TE>
<TE>   But he righted himself, retiring the next 12 batters. He gave up
one hit after the first inning, and he handed a 4-3 lead to the
bullpen after six.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey (8-3) won for the sixth time in seven starts. If he wins
two of his four remaining starts, he will join Washburn, Appier and
Ortiz with at least 10 wins. No Angel team has had four 10-game
winners since 1991, when Jim Abbott, Chuck Finley, Mark Langston and
Kirk McCaskill each posted double-digit win totals.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for a kid who spotted the rest of the starters half a
season, while he racked up victories in the minor leagues. On the
last day of June, the Angels put him in the rotation for good, and he
has been very good.</TE>
<TE>   By combining solid stuff with exceptional control and exceptional
poise, he emerged as a more polished pitcher than any veteran for
which the Angels could have traded. His earned-run average of 3.32 is
the best in the rotation. He has walked no more than two in seven
consecutive starts.</TE>
<TE>   "He's ready for the challenge of being a major component of a team
in a pennant race," Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's game drew 24,045. Lackey used to play before crowds of
similar size as a high school quarterback in football-crazed West
Texas. If there's a good reason why he should feel more pressure in
the majors, he hasn't figured it out.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been able to perform when the lights came on," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He is carefree. He also is the son of a coach, and he doesn't need
to be told what to do twice, or even once. He put himself on a
conditioning program last winter, expecting to be called up in
September and knowing that, after a long minor league season, he
might have merely that month to impress the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   The veterans respect him, so they tease him. Scott Schoeneweis,
whose inconsistency as a starter prompted the Angels to replace him
with Lackey, smiled as he put the kid in his place.</TE>
<TE>   Said Schoeneweis: "You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me."</TE>

<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>As the Angels make a run at history this season, they paused to
remember their supporting role in the history of Baltimore baseball.
Seven years ago Friday, the Angels provided the opposition as Cal
Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's record by playing in his 2,131st
consecutive game, an evening marked by Ripken's impromptu victory lap
when the game became official after five innings.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels' lineup that night included Garret Anderson in left
field, Tim Salmon in right field and current television analyst Rex
Hudler at second base.</LD>
<LD>   Hudler, a former Oriole teammate of Ripken, often teased him about
the 1978 draft, in which Hudler was selected in the first round,
Ripken in the second round. But Ripken brought Hudler to tears by
giving him an autographed bat on the very night Ripken broke Gehrig's
record. The bat is framed and displayed in Hudler's home.</LD>
<TE>   The Orioles used commemorative baseballs that night, with orange
stitching and a special logo, and Hudler caught one--a pop fly, hit
by Ripken and pocketed by Hudler.</TE>
<TE>   "I shook the ball when I caught it," he said. "It was the souvenir
of a lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon also has a cherished keepsake, a snapshot of him chatting
with Ripken at second base after hitting a double that night. Ripken
later autographed the picture. Salmon framed it and saved it, along
with a ticket stub and commemorative ball from the game. "That will
always be a special memory," he said. "I'll tell the kids and
grandkids about that one."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon homered that night. So did Ripken, and the Orioles won,
4-2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plan to invite all of their coaches to return next
season, General Manager Bill Stoneman said Friday. The Toronto Blue
Jays, 26 1/2 games out of first place, extended the contracts of
their coaches this week, but the Angels have yet to offer any
extensions.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll get to that in due course. Right now, our focus is on
winning," Stoneman said.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman and Manager Mike Scioscia assembled the coaching staff in
1999, following the hiring of Scioscia, and the Angels have not had
any turnover on the staff since then. The staff includes pitching
coach Bud Black, hitting coach Mickey Hatcher, first base coach
Alfredo Griffin, third base coach Ron Roenicke, bench coach Joe
Maddon and bullpen coach Bobby Ramos.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels last year extended Scioscia's contract through 2005.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Oakland's AL-record win streak ends at 20 games
with 6-0 loss to Twins, and Angels trail by only two in West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>For the Oakland A's, it's time to stop chasing the 1916 Giants and
1935 Cubs and start worrying about the 2002 Angels.</LD>
<LD>   The A's lost to the Minnesota Twins, 6-0, at the Metrodome Friday
night, ending their American League-record winning streak at 20
games. The A's fell six short of the major league record set by the
New York Giants, and one shy of the second-place Chicago Cubs.</LD>
<LD>   And now they're only two games ahead of the Angels, who beat the
Baltimore Orioles Friday to close the gap in the American League West
race.</LD>
<TE>   "Our streak really overshadowed the ball they've been playing,"
Oakland first baseman Scott Hatteberg said. "I think it's been part
of what's driven us, knowing we were going to play them a lot this
month--and Seattle. It's amazing we win 20 games in a row and we
still haven't really pulled away, so they're playing great."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously the A's were playing stellar ball themselves to pull off
such a run. They averaged seven runs a game and batted .299 with 30
home runs during the streak. The pitching staff had a 2.65 earned-run
average and allowed two runs or fewer eight times.</TE>
<TE>   That all ended with a loud thump--which also happened to be the
sound the Twins' five doubles made as they hit the outfield fence.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins rocked Oakland starter Cory Lidle for eight hits and
five runs. Meanwhile, Minnesota's Brad Radke went the distance,
allowing six hits and one walk to pick up his seventh win and first
shutout of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The A's built most of the streak at the expense of the Toronto
Blue Jays, Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers and
Kansas City Royals. None of those teams has a winning record. The A's
did win three against the Twins last weekend--in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knew that coming into Minnesota, playing at their place,
was going to be the test for us," Lidle said. "They got us."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins are in command of the AL Central with an 82-59 record.
And while the A's earned a spot in the history book, they might be a
little jealous of the Twins' magic number--eight--to clinch the
division.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's Jacque Jones led off with a double in the bottom of
the first inning and scored one out later when Corey Koskie doubled
to right center. Luis Rivas led off the third with a triple and
Koskie brought him home with a single. Koskie handled things himself
with a solo home run in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   A.J. Pierzynski hit a one-out double in the seventh. After Rivas
grounded to third, Jones hit a ground ball toward the hole. Miguel
Tejada tried to gun it to first, but his throw skipped and Hatte-
berg couldn't handle it in time. Pierzynski rounded third and slid
home in time to beat catcher Ramon Hernandez's tag.</TE>
<TE>   The next batter, Cristian Guzman, hit a rocket to the left-field
alley that hit the bottom of the wall. Jones raced home as the relay
throw came to the plate. Again the ball got there in time, but
Hernandez didn't get his glove low enough and Jones slid under it to
score.</TE>
<TE>   Another double, this one by Torii Hunter, led to Minnesota's final
run in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland had the bases loaded with two out in the first, but David
Justice popped up. With two men on in the third inning, Eric Chavez
hit a blast down the right-field line that curved foul at the last
moment. Then he struck out.</TE>
<TE>   The A's had won their previous three games in their final at-bat,
but with Radke in control the 27,409 fans at the Metrodome felt
confident enough to chant "streak is o-ver" in the top of the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously it wasn't going to go on forever," Lidle said. "It had
to end tonight. It was a well-pitched game by Radke. They deserved
it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Oakland Manager Art Howe: "If you're going to lose the
streak, that's the kind of game you want to have, something you can't
second-guess yourself."</TE>
<TE>   The A's have taken pride in their relaxed attitude win or lose
this season, and there weren't any signs of depression in the locker
room afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Designated hitter Ray Durham even said he was "relieved."</TE>
<TE>   "We can go out and play baseball without everybody eyeballing us,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The A's are keeping an eye on the Angels, who host them in a
three-game series starting Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "They're an impressive ballclub," Lidle said. "They're not going
away. We're not expecting them to go away. It's going to come down
to, probably, the last week of the season."</TE>

Streak Busters
How baseball's other winning streaks of 20 or more games came to an
end:
July 10, 1880: Cleveland Blues 2, Chicago White Stockings 0
A two-run home run by Cleveland rookie Fred Dunlap in the bottom of
the ninth and the pitching of Jim McCormick allowed Cleveland to end
Chicago's 21-game streak
Sept. 9, 1884: Buffalo Bisons 2, Providence Grays 0
In a duel of future Hall of Famers, Buffalo's Pud Galvin, a 46-game
winner in 1884, bested Charles "Hoss" Radbourn to end the Grays'
20-game streak. Radbourn, who finished the season with 59 victories,
won 18 of the 20 games in the streak
Sept. 30, 1916: Boston Braves 8, New York Giants 3
After winning the first game of a doubleheader on Rube Benton's
one-hitter, the Giants were shut down by Lefty Tyler in the second
game as their 26-game streak came to an end. Despite the streak, the
Giants finished fourth in the National League
Sept. 28, 1935: St. Louis Cardinals 7, Chicago Cubs 5
One day after clinching the National League pennant, the Cubs lost,
ending their 21-game streak when the Cardinals' Joe Medwick hit a
two-run home run in the bottom of the 11th</TE>

<HD>Rivera Begins to Throw Again</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Yankee closer Mariano Rivera, sidelined because of a right
shoulder strain, started a throwing program on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Rivera said he felt "fine" after playing catch with Yankees'
roving pitching coordinator Rick Tomlin. It was the first time the
reliever has thrown in three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   On Aug. 19, the All-Star was put on the disabled list for the
third time this season. Before this season, Rivera had been on the
disabled list only once.</LD>
<TE>   After being sidelined from June 10-25 because of a strained right
groin, his shoulder began hurting. Rivera went back on the disabled
list on July 26.</TE>
<TE>   He is 1-4 with 27 saves and a 2.85 earned run average this season.</TE>

<TE>   With a new labor agreement in place, Texas Rangers star Alex
Rodriguez said baseball should have some new marketing ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time for the owners and players to come together like the
NBA does and start promoting their players," Rodriguez said before
the Rangers played at Tampa Bay on Friday. "Nobody ever said anything
about Michael [Jordan] making $40 million. All you talk about is [NBA
commissioner] David Stern marketing the game."</TE>
<TE>   The NBA is not alone, either. The PGA Tour promotes Tiger Woods
extensively.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said the strained relationship between owners and
players has had a negative effect on the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been enemies so long that we're losing all wars," Rodriguez
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Major League Baseball's labor peace didn't win News Corp.'s Fox
network more viewers the day after the sport and its players' union
reached an agreement on a new contract.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's broadcast last Saturday drew 1.9% of the 105.5 million U.S.
homes with TVs, down 39% from 3.1% who tuned in to its comparable
broadcast last season.</TE>
<TE>   The decline--which Fox spokesman Lou D'Ermilio blamed on a weak
schedule of games--came as the network is posting a 3.4% average
ratings increase for its 14 broadcasts of Saturday baseball this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Judge James J. McBride heard arguments Friday about who owns the
ball that Barry Bonds hit for his 73rd home run last season.</TE>
<TE>   McBride didn't rule who owns the ball: Alex Popov, the man who
gloved it but lost it in a scrum, or Patrick Hayashi, the man who
emerged from the tussling tangle with the big grin.</TE>

<HD>Don't Expect Quick Reversal From Trinidad</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Felix Trinidad breaks into that baby-faced grin of his and says
softly but insistently that he is definitely, positively, without
reservation, retired.</LD>
<LD>   Few believe him.</LD>
<LD>   Although Trinidad seems to have found genuine peace in retirement,
those who could add to their already considerable wealth by his
return to the ring can't seem to accept it.</LD>
<TE>   Promoter Bob Arum claims Don King is the impediment to a Trinidad
comeback, that Trinidad would return if he could get a better
financial deal than King, his promoter, is willing to offer.</TE>
<TE>   King, while saying he honors Trinidad's decision to hang up the
gloves at age 29, is begging him to fight once more "for the people,"
whatever that means.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar De La Hoya, assuming he beats Fernando Vargas Saturday in
their 154-pound championship match at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Events
Center, is holding open his next fight date, in February or March, in
hopes Trinidad will agree to share the ring with him.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Hopkins, who dominated Trinidad last September, handing
the Puerto Rican fighter his first defeat, would love to do it again
for another big paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   The common theory is that retirement is simply a ploy to generate
even more money for Trinidad, a strategy orchestrated by Felix
Trinidad Sr., the man who has masterminded his son's career, as both
manager and trainer, from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that is so.</TE>
<TE>   But when Trinidad Jr. appeared in New York earlier this week to
donate the fire truck he, his father and King promised after last
September's terrorist attack, he showed no evidence he is chafing
over his voluntary inactivity. Instead, he told reporters he is
enjoying the opportunity to devote himself fully to his family for
the first time since he started boxing at age 8.</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad is taking retirement so seriously that he is no longer
training seriously. He revealed he weighs 185 pounds, 25 more than he
did for his last fight only four months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Arum and De La Hoya have nothing to complain about. The chance for
a rematch was there right after Trinidad beat De La Hoya by majority
decision in 1999. But neither Arum nor De La Hoya was willing to let
Trinidad and King dictate the terms of a second fight.</TE>
<TE>   King shouldn't complain either. Trinidad has made him more money
than any other non-heavyweight he has had.</TE>
<TE>   End of story?</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, in boxing, a career can only be considered
unquestionably over when a fighter is so old he would have to be
carried into the ring.</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad has at least six potentially productive years left as a
fighter. That's a long time for King and Arum and who knows how many
other promoters to wave huge checks under his nose.</TE>
<TE>   But for today at least, take him at his word.</TE>
<TE>   One Man's Opinion</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad, who plans on attending the De La Hoya-Vargas match, is
highly qualified to pick a winner since he fought each of them,
having beaten Vargas on a 12th-round technical knockout in December
of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad says De La Hoya will emerge victorious, but predicts it
will be one of his toughest fights.</TE>
<TE>   One Woman's Opinion</TE>
<TE>   At least one member of the De La Hoya camp doesn't want to see
Trinidad-De La Hoya II.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya's wife, Millie Corretjer, a well-known Puerto Rican
singer, was fiercely loyal to Trinidad before she met De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   "If they fought," she said, "I would have to go to Poland or New
Zealand or somewhere. They would kill me in Puerto Rico if I rooted
for Oscar. My heart would be in two places. I am very loyal to my
roots, but I am, of course, loyal to my husband. I hope Tito stays
retired."</TE>
<TE>   Opinions That Count</TE>
<TE>   The referee for De La Hoya-Vargas will be Joe Cortez; the three
judges, Paul Smith, Doug Tucker and Patricia Jarman-Manning.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight</TE>
<TE>   Undisputed light-heavyweight champion Roy Jones (46-1, 37
knockouts) will face the World Boxing Council's No. 1 contender,
Clinton Woods (32-1, 19), tonight at Portland, Ore., (HBO, 7 p.m.).
Also on the card, International Boxing Federation 154-pound champion
Winky Wright (43-3, 25) faces No. 1 contender Bronco McKart (45-3,
29).</TE>
<TE>   Wright is hoping a victory gets him a match with the winner of De
La Hoya-Vargas. Jones is hoping to keep fighting opponents most fans
have never heard of.</TE>
<TE>   King is trying to put together a match between Jones and World
Boxing Assn. heavyweight champion John Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   Uh-huh. Ruiz will have to get in line behind Buster Douglas and
Evander Holyfield, two other heavyweights who never made it past the
talking stage on Jones' list of fantasy opponents.</TE>

<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Telander of the Chicago Sun-Times, commenting on the U.S. losing
twice in the World Basketball Championship:</LD>
<LD>   "The flash, the trash, the dribble-between-my-legs-20
-times-before-I-clown-your-silly-butt, one-on-one ...
it's-all-about-me-and-my-bling-style of play had to fail.</LD>
<LD>   "Nobody kills the hero; the hero gorges himself at the trough of
greed and indulgence and collapses face first in the slop.... the
arrogance, the selfishness, the deviance of modern American
basketball guaranteed such a downfall."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: When did UCLA make its first appearance in a football
bowl game?</TE>
<TE>   Role reversal: Jeff Gordon in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: "South
Carolina football Coach Lou Holtz does a masterful job dismissing his
own team while talking up his foes, to present his program as a
perpetual underdog. (He also did the poor mouth routine at Notre
Dame.)</TE>
<TE>   "But even he was horrified when the Sagarin ranking system put the
Gamecocks at No. 50, one spot behind Division I-AA power Montana. 'I
don't think we're as bad as that Seagram system, or whatever it's
called, says we are,' Holtz said. 'I don't know if that system is
named for the alcohol or what.' "</TE>
<TE>   No qualifications necessary: Michael Ventre of MSNBC.com
commenting on Penn State Coach Joe Paterno, 75, saying he would like
to continue coaching until he's 80:</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't say what he would do after that, but the rumor mill
suggests that by then he would be sufficiently out of touch that he
could get a job with the NCAA."</TE>
<TE>   Misinformed: "I'm not afraid to speak the truth or how I feel,"
Redskin owner Daniel Snyder told Newsweek. "The media wants an owner
who doesn't say anything."</TE>
<TE>   Said Norman Chad on America Online: "Oh, sure. Sportswriters are
sitting around everyday, hoping the biggest newsmaker in town is mum
for months. Is this joker serious? My goodness--if Daniel Snyder
sneezes, the Washington Post reports whether he used a handkerchief
or a Kleenex."</TE>
<TE>   Not so soft: Boston College defensive end Antonio Garay after
Connecticut, a 35-point underdog, lost by only eight points to BC
last week:</TE>
<TE>   "One of the comments before the game was that UConn, they were
cupcakes. Well, they showed us ... that the bakery is closed."</TE>
<TE>   Cooking on the court: Checking out the early rounds of the U.S.
Open, Steve Rushin of Sports Illustrated spotted ambidextrous Evgenia
Koulikovskaya hitting "only forehands (left-handed from the ad court,
right-handed from the deuce court), repeatedly tossing her racket
from hand to hand as if it were a potato just pulled from the oven."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1985, UCLA defeated Brigham Young,
27-24, in a season-opening game. The Bruins went on to record a 9-2-1
record and defeated Iowa, 45-28, in the Rose Bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Jan. 1, 1943, when the Bruins lost to Georgia, 9-0,
in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dan Le Batard in the Miami Herald: "Randy Moss admits
he takes plays off, and the criticism is loud and furious from a
predictably outraged sports America.</TE>
<TE>   " 'I take plays off too, where I'm not going full tilt, 100%,'
Dolphin linebacker Zach Thomas said with a shrug. 'We all do.' "</TE>

<HD>Little Things Add Up to Dodger Victory</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They scrape together winning run in eighth to
beat Astros, 3-2. Gagne gets 48th save.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger Manager Jim Tracy couldn't resist peeking at the scoreboard
Friday to check on the Arizona Diamondbacks' game against the San
Francisco Giants.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone is a scoreboard watcher at this time of year," Tracy
said. "But I didn't see anything that interested me. All I saw was a
lot of zeros."</LD>
<LD>   No matter. He saw plenty of interesting action by watching his own
team, which rallied for a 3-2 victory over the Houston Astros before
a crowd of 47,138 at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Eric Karros' sacrifice fly scored Shawn Green with the winning run
in the eighth inning, and closer Eric Gagne earned his 48th save to
the accompaniment of a standing ovation. The Dodgers' victory,
coupled with the Giants' 1-0 victory over the Diamondbacks, lifted
them within 4 1/2 games of the Western Division-leading Diamondbacks
and kept them three games ahead of the Giants in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way it's going to be from here on out," said left
fielder Brian Jordan, who singled home the tying run in the sixth
inning following a controversial play. "Each team is going to do what
it takes. You've got to be able to do the little things."</TE>
<TE>   And get a little help, too. With the Dodgers trailing, 2-1, Dave
Roberts led off the sixth with a bunt up the first base side.
Roberts, trying to dodge Jeff Bagwell's tag, ran outside the lane and
appeared to miss the bag but was called safe. That sparked an
argument by Astro Manager Jimy Williams, who was ejected.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts stole second with Paul Lo Duca at bat, and Lo Duca reached
base by being hit on the arm by a pitch by Astro rookie Kirk
Saarloos, a Long Beach native and standout at Cal State Fullerton.
Adrian Beltre hit a fly ball to the warning track in right-center,
allowing Roberts to tag and move to third and Lo Duca to advance to
second.</TE>
<TE>   After the Astros walked Green intentionally, they brought in
right-handed reliever Ricky Stone to face Jordan, who was 0 for 2.
Jordan punched an 0-and-2 pitch off the front of the mound and into
center field, scoring Roberts. A spectacular throw by center fielder
Brian Hunter got Lo Duca at the plate, trying to score from second.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great to find a way to win," Roberts said. "I was just
trying to make something happen."</TE>
<TE>   Those things, however, might not have included touching the bag.</TE>
<TE>   "It was close," Roberts said, winking. "I was going there to avoid
the tag and trying to get as close as I could."</TE>
<TE>   Saarloos, who had about 100 friends and relatives at the game,
said he didn't have a good view of the play, but teammates told him
Roberts missed the bag.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I threw good, but obviously Roberts' play changes the
complexion of the inning and the game," said Saarloos, who gave up
two runs and four hits over 5 1/3 solid innings.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Saarloos nor Dodger starter Hideo Nomo figured in the
decision. Nomo pitched seven innings, walking six but striking out
eight. He hasn't lost since July 16, a span of 10 starts, and is 4-0
with a 3.68 earned-run average in that span.</TE>
<TE>   "My statistics today are not very good, but we won, so I am
happy," Nomo said through a translator.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Quantrill (4-4) earned the victory by pitching a perfect
eighth inning. Octavio Dotel (5-4), the fourth Astro pitcher, was the
loser.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers manufactured the decisive run after Green worked out a
full-count walk against Dotel and sped to third on Jordan's single to
center. Karros fought off a handful off pitches before driving a
slider to deep left, allowing Green to score without a throw home.</TE>
<TE>   "The key was the eighth-inning base hit by Brian Jordan and the
baserunning of Shawn Green," Tracy said. "That's another facet of
Green's game. That set up the sacrifice fly by Karros.... [Karros']
was a professional at-bat by a professional player. He fought off
some very tough pitches, some strike-three pitches."</TE>
<TE>   The Astros, clawing to stay in the National League wild-card race,
scored their first run before most fans had found their seats.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter led off the game with a double to left-center. Craig Biggio
sacrificed, and Karros fielded his bunt. Karros' throw to second
baseman Mark Grudzielanek, who was scurrying to cover first, hit
Biggio on the back of the head; it was initially ruled an error but
later changed to a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter reached third and Biggio was safe at first. Hunter scored
when Lance Berkman singled sharply to right.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo gave up a towering home run to Berkman in the third, a drive
that landed a few rows from the top of the right-field pavilion
seats. The home run was the 22nd off Nomo, tops on the Dodger staff,
and the team-leading 38th by Berkman.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Tracy Refuses to Rush Brown Into Rotation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Brown will remain in the Dodger bullpen for now, Manager Jim
Tracy said Friday, although Tracy acknowledged he and his staff have
considered returning Brown to the starting rotation.</LD>
<LD>   "The situation is going to have to be right in order for us to do
that," Tracy said.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy defined right as, "where he's at, how he feels, how he's
throwing the ball." "Just because it's Kevin, if it's not right for
him, and we don't feel it's right for him, it's frivolous to go down
that road," Tracy added. "To do what, prove a point? We're not going
to do that."</LD>
<TE>   When Brown returned from back surgery in mid-August, the Dodgers'
plan was for him to work his way back into shape by pitching in
relief. He has appeared in a variety of situations, including
occasional mop-up work; Tracy praised his performance Tuesday as
"brilliant." In that situation, Brown struck out Greg Colbrunn--the
only batter he faced--with the bases loaded in the sixth inning of a
3-2 victory over Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Brown is 1-0 with a 6.08 earned-run average in six relief
appearances, and overall is 3-3 with a 4.53 ERA in 15 appearances.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been up and down," Tracy said, "just like you'd expect from
someone who's had two major surgeries in a year's time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Jordan started despite having aggravated his
tender lower back Wednesday while trying to rob Matt Williams of a
home run in the first inning at Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who missed three weeks in August because of a protrusion
in his lower back, jarred his back when he landed after leaping to
catch Williams' drive. Before Friday's game, he was two for 13 since
being activated off the disabled list Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm feeling all right," he said. "I wouldn't be playing if it was
hurting.... I don't see it being a problem down the road. I hurt it
in '97 and it wasn't a problem until this year."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, intent on avoiding surgery, maintains a regimen of
stretching and exercises to strengthen his back and abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek, who missed Wednesday's game because of a tender
right hamstring, started Friday.... The Jewish holiday of Rosh
Hashanah began Friday night. Dodger outfielder Shawn Green was in the
lineup--and unlike last year, when he sat out on Yom Kippur, the
holiest day on the Jewish calendar, he and the Dodgers caught a break
this year. Yom Kippur begins at sundown next Sunday, presumably after
the Dodgers finish their scheduled day game at Colorado. They don't
play again until the next night, at home against the Giants, after
the holiday ends.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Not Looking for Split on the Road</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To probe the collective mind of the Galaxy is to examine a case study
in split personality.</LD>
<LD>   At 10-1-2, the Galaxy has one of the best home records in Major
League Soccer. But its 3-8-1 road mark is among the league's worst.</LD>
<LD>   That doesn't bode well for the Galaxy, tied for first place in the
Western Conference, since two of its final three games are on the
road, beginning tonight at Chicago.</LD>
<TE>   The Galaxy has lost eight of its last nine MLS road matches.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult situation," defender Alexi Lalas said of the
team's closing run. "The least of which is that you're playing
against [a team that] I still feel is one of the elite teams in MLS
in Chicago. And then you also have to go to Naperville, which I'm
sure is a wonderful community. It's just a horrible environment."</TE>
<TE>   With its home stadium, Soldier Field, undergoing renovations, the
Fire set up shop this season in not-so-nearby Naperville at North
Central College's Cardinal Stadium, which has an unforgiving
artificial surface.</TE>
<TE>   "The actual aesthetics of it is great," Lalas said, "But for a
soccer player playing on it, it's difficult. It's a lot better than
the AstroTurf we all grew up with. But it's still AstroTurf and it's
still not the same as grass."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy survived a rain-soaked afternoon on the turf and beat
the Fire, 1-0, on May 11.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago is in the Eastern Conference, but a quirk in the
unbalanced MLS schedule has the Galaxy playing the Fire four times
this year. The Galaxy, which plays every other Eastern team twice,
has feasted on the Fire, going 3-0 and outscoring Chicago, 4-1.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't even talked about the fact that we're 3-0 against them
this year," said Lalas, who beat the Fire with the game's lone goal
on June 8....</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun playing Chicago but if you have your choice of teams to
play four times a year, playing outside of your conference, you
wouldn't pick Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "But Chicago, because of World Cup and injuries, has been
decimated."</TE>
<TE>   The Fire, which lost a league-high three starters to U.S. national
team duty, is without midfielder Chris Armas, midfielder Sergo Daniv,
forward Mike Nugent, defender Evan Whitfield and forward Josh Wolff.
Daniv has a turf-toe injury, the others knee injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The teams have gone in opposite directions since Lalas' header
beat the Fire on June 8. The Fire, which held a seven-point lead in
the East before that game, lost its next three and has gone 5-8-2
since, having dropped into second place behind Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy has gone 8-5-1 to catch San Jose, which it meets in a
home-and-home series to close out the season.</TE>

<HD>No Classic Prep for Came Home</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Came Home, winner of Del Mar's Pacific Classic and No. 1 horse in the
country according to this week's national thoroughbred poll, is not
likely to run again before he faces older horses for the second time
in the $4-million Breeders' Cup Classic at on Oct. 26 at Arlington
Park.</LD>
<LD>   Currently stabled at Hollywood Park, Came Home will finish up the
California part of his Breeders' Cup training at Santa Anita, but the
3-year-old colt's trainer, Paco Gonzalez, has indicated that he will
skip Santa Anita's Goodwood Handicap on Oct. 6. Gonzalez is not
enamored of the idea of Came Home running less than three weeks
before he'd be asked to negotiate 1 1/4 miles in suburban Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Came Home has won nine of 11 starts and earned $1.8 million. The
only flaws on his record are the sixth-place finish in the Kentucky
Derby and a seventh last year in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at
Belmont Park.</LD>
<TE>   In the immediate aftermath of the Pacific Classic, Gonzalez was
the focal point of a strange trackside tableau. As Came Home was
being led into the winner's circle, somebody handed the trainer a
flute of champagne. But Gonzalez's other horse in the race, Bosque
Redondo, had broken down after finishing fifth, and was being vanned
off. Finding no place to park his glass, Gonzalez hurriedly left the
winner's circle and raced down the track, in the direction of the
clubhouse turn, which was the shortest route to the barn where Bosque
Redondo was being treated.</TE>
<TE>   The taste of champagne was bittersweet that night for the veteran
trainer, because Bosque Redondo's racing career is over. Winner of
the San Bernardino Handicap at Santa Anita in April, Bosque Redondo
underwent leg surgery a few days after the Pacific Classic and is
recuperating at the Equine Medical Center in Cypress. He will be
moved to the farm of his co-owner, John Toffan, next week.</TE>
<TE>   Before favored Street Cry was injured and retired this week, Came
Home had been the 12-1 fourth choice, along with War Emblem and Macho
Uno, in the future-book betting for the Breeders' Cup Classic at the
Paris racebook in Las Vegas. Medaglia d'Oro was listed at 6-1 and
Hawk Wing, the overseas contender, was 10-1.</TE>
<TE>   At 20-1 is Lido Palace, who is ineligible for the Breeders' Cup
and would have to be supplemented, at a whopping cost of $800,000, to
run into the Classic. While winless this year, Lido Palace has run
some encouraging races in New York, finishing second in the Suburban
Handicap and third in the Whitney Handicap, and will face five
opponents today in the $500,000 Woodward at Belmont Park. The others
entered are Express Tour, Cat's At Home, Sherpa Guide, Gander and
Baseball Champion. Lido Palace's last victory, five races back, was
last year's Woodward.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some tracks, including Belmont Park and the Meadowlands in the New
York City area, are going to be closed, but on Del Mar's closing day,
the seaside track will join with the National Thoroughbred Racing
Assn. next Wednesday to observe the first anniversary of the
terrorists' air attacks last Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Telecaster Dick Enberg will host a brief ceremony before the first
post that will include a flag-raising, the playing of "The
Star-Spangled Banner," a moment of silence and a video tribute.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Brew, the Santa Anita Handicap winner who finished third
in the Pacific Classic, is headed for the Jockey Club Gold Cup at
Belmont Park on Sept. 28, but he will not be joined by his
stablemate, Medaglia d'Oro, who will prepare for the Breeders' Cup
Classic off workouts.... Trainer Elliott Walden, whose Indygo Shiner
finished second to Romanceishope in last year's Del Mar Derby, has
shipped in Mr. Mellon as tries to win today's renewal.... Eddie
Delahoussaye, who had ridden 19 winners at Del Mar, is body-sore from
a spill on the turf course on Aug. 30 and will sit out the rest of
the meet.... Winless Zippy Chippy, who lost his 94th consecutive race
when he finished seventh in an eight-horse field at the Northampton
Fair a week ago, is entered to run Sunday in a $3,100 non-claiming
maiden race at the Massachusetts track.... At Del Mar Friday night,
the wire came just in time for Joey Franco, winner of the El Cajon
Stakes over longshots Taste Of Paradise and Paxtecum. Ridden by Kent
Desormeaux, Joey Franco paid $5.40 as he won his fourth in a row
after a third-place finish in his debut at Santa Anita in December. A
head and a nose separated the first three horses.</TE>

<HD>Quietly Becoming One of City's Best</HD>
<DH>Prep football: Woodland Hills Taft's Broadus may be shy off
field, but he doesn't shy away from big hits on it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His football coach at Woodland Hills Taft calls him an impact player
who can carry a defense.</LD>
<LD>   A coach at a rival school says he's an outstanding athlete on a
team loaded with them.</LD>
<LD>   His teammate, an All-City Section quarterback, marvels at his
ability to wreak havoc on an opponent's offense.</LD>
<TE>   Yet what might make linebacker Lance Broadus unique is the
difference between his demeanor on and off the field.</TE>
<TE>   On it, the 6-foot-3, 220-pounder is extremely aggressive, covering
ground quickly and delivering bell-ringing hits. Off it, he is rather
quiet and shy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like he's two different people," Taft quarterback Cary Dove
said. "Because he's so big and intimidating, he almost scares people.
But he's really a fun guy to talk to. He's like a big, strong teddy
bear."</TE>
<TE>   Broadus, the No. 4-ranked senior linebacker in the West by Student
Sports magazine, is aware of the transformation when he puts on his
uniform. But he finds it difficult to explain.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really like to talk that much," he said. "But something
happens on the field. I'm not sure if it's adrenaline or being
competitive, but it's almost like a light goes on and it's my time to
shine."</TE>
<TE>   Broadus was at his best during last year's playoffs, when he
averaged 18 tackles to help Taft advance to the City title game after
the Toreadors finished second to Lake Balboa Birmingham in the West
Valley League.</TE>
<TE>   "Something just got into me," Broadus said. "We hadn't made it
very far in the playoffs the previous year, so I just wanted us to go
as far as we could go."</TE>
<TE>   His coach, Troy Starr, said Broadus put the entire defense on his
back during the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Against Carson, Crenshaw and Dorsey, he was absolutely dominant,"
Starr said. "He had as dominant a game against Dorsey as you're going
to see a high school linebacker have."</TE>
<TE>   The City championship game against Dorsey at the Coliseum is a
source of pride and pain for Broadus.</TE>
<TE>   He's proud that Taft held the Dons' offense to zero points and 60
yards in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   But it pains him that Dorsey won, 19-14, after blocking a punt and
recovering it in the end zone as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   "We let up a little bit and they got by us and blocked the punt,"
Broadus said with resignation. "We learned that we can't let up at
all. That we have to play hard until the game is over."</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham has beaten Taft, 41-14 and 40-21, the last two seasons,
but Patriot Coach Ed Croson has the utmost respect for Broadus.</TE>
<TE>   "He's big, he's physical and he's rangy," Croson said. "He's not a
guy who's going to talk a lot, but he's going to make plays. He has a
lineman's size and moves like a defensive back."</TE>
<TE>   Dove, entering his second season as Taft's starting quarterback,
concurs.</TE>
<TE>   "He just seems like he's everywhere he shouldn't be," Dove said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's hard to pass it over because of his height and he's hard to
throw around because of his frame. He's quick and has a big arm span.
He's amazing."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Trainer Neil Drysdale has an opportunity to win graded races at Del
Mar and Belmont Park today.</LD>
<LD>   Winning in New York wouldn't be too much of a surprise. Winning in
California would be an upset.</LD>
<LD>   Bella Bellucci will try again for her first Grade I victory in the
$250,000 Gazelle Handicap at Belmont Park.</LD>
<TE>   Hours later, Golden Arrow will be looking for his first stakes
victory in the $300,000 Del Mar Derby, a Grade II at 1 1/8 miles on
turf.</TE>
<TE>   Considered the best 3-year-old filly in the country even though
she has finished only third in the two most important races in which
she has competed--the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and Acorn--Bella
Bellucci will have a new rider when she makes her first appearance
since July 19.</TE>
<TE>   Known for demolishing less-than-stellar fields, the French Deputy
filly will be handled by John Velasquez, becoming the fourth rider
she has had in what will be her eighth career race.</TE>
<TE>   Scratched from last month's Alabama at Saratoga because of wet
weather, she will break from the inside in the 1 1/8-mile Gazelle and
her main foe is Take Charge Lady, a multiple-stakes winner making her
first start since she won the Dogwood at Churchill Downs on May 25.</TE>
<TE>   A winner of two in a row at Hollywood Park and Del Mar, Golden
Arrow will be facing the maiden Hecandigit, Johar, Mr. Mellon (who is
shipping from New Jersey for trainer Elliott Walden), Inesperado (the
likely favorite on the strength of two consecutive victories since
coming to the U.S.), Mountain Rage, Rock Opera (winner of the tougher
division of the Oceanside Stakes on July 24), True Phenomenon and
Dell Place.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: With Anticipation will seek his third Grade I
victory in a row and defend his title in the $500,000 Man O'War
Stakes at Belmont Park. The 1 3/8-mile turf race attracted seven
others.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Armando Lage. The trainer won with six of his first 17
starters at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Bay Meadows. The home of short fields has 58 horses
entered in today's nine-race card.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Inesperado, Dell Place and
Golden Arrow in the eighth, singling Subpoena in the ninth and using
Miss Hennessy, Tahitian Rain, Lolo Creek and Devilish Quest in the
10th.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/78. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $448. Total money: $682.</TE>

<LD>Bill Plaschke [Sept. 4] makes a good point. I call on The Times to
publish no coverage of events that occur at Augusta National Golf
Club until it gets rid of Hootie Johnson and admits some female
members.</LD>
<LD>   Geoff Pike</LD>
<LD>   Santa Monica</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I know it's going to take several pages, but could you please
publish a list of all of the golf courses in the U.S. that women have
developed and where men are begging to play.</TE>
<TE>   Herb Wallerstein</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Plaschke's silly plea to ignore the Masters is his selective
approach to applying the Constitution. Extending his logic means
opening private women's clubs (of all types) to men, opening sorority
doors to football jocks, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the good ol' boys (and ladies) in our country have an
equal opportunity to make fools of themselves--just as Bill does when
he tries to reinvent our rights/freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   Dawn Troy</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Master Hootie, women and golf. Some people might figure this for a
joke of some sort ... far from it. Ms. Burk of the NCWO is pushing a
bad thing at Augusta National and here is why:</TE>
<TE>   1. I'd like to meet the women who have the financial portfolios
and strong desires to play golf and desire to spend the money it
would take to belong to Augusta. They are out there, just how many?</TE>
<TE>   2. If Ms. Burk did a little more investigating on "these guys,"
she would realize that the waiting list for membership at Augusta
probably reaches into the next millennium and this does not fit her
agenda.</TE>
<TE>   3. Ms. Burk is attacking the game of golf itself that has so
eloquently brought women into the 21st century with great financial
rewards and exposure.</TE>
<TE>   What is she thinking? This benefits very few women. It's sad when
a woman of higher education picks her battles so poorly. There are
fights worth fighting that require this level of hype, not this one.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Arranaga</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Plaschke's article is another classic example of political
correctness gone awry. Since when does a society's concern for
diversity extend to every facet of our lives?</TE>
<TE>   If you are really firm in your contentions, then I suggest you and
your sympathizers do the noble thing and choose not to watch the
tournament next April. If there are that many of you, then the
networks will see the impact and make a decision about televising the
event in future years. If ratings do not fall off dramatically, then
your contention that people care about your issues would seem to hold
no water.</TE>
<TE>   Americans feel differently about male-female issues. Why did only
400 people (an attendance figure mysteriously omitted from The Times
coverage) show up at the Sparks' WNBA victory party when thousands
upon thousands attended the same event for the Lakers' win?</TE>
<TE>   Peter S. Griffith</TE>
<TE>   Arcadia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Plaschke, you ask, "So when are we going to exercise our
rights as a civilized society?"</TE>
<TE>   We already do. We are free to patronize or not patronize
businesses that don't meet our personal seals of approval. It's part
of being the free and civilized society you mention. The question
should be, why do some feel that within that society it is
appropriate to dictate what others may not do with their private
clubs?</TE>
<TE>   If you are anti-Augusta, by all means boycott the Masters and any
sponsor you feel necessary--and don't watch the telecast. But do not
imply that anyone who doesn't boycott, or does watch the telecast, is
somehow out of touch and bigoted. At that point, you come off as not
too dissimilar from the questionable manner that Mr. Johnson
originally addressed Ms. Burk.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Berrisford</TE>
<TE>   Cheviot Hills</TE>

commercial-free Masters.</TE>

<LD>Looking at this year's NFL predictions by Sam Farmer, we see Sammy
has learned nothing from last year when he predicted Pittsburgh to go
all the way. He's back again, the guy who called the mediocre Kordell
Stewart the MVP last year, ignoring one of the greatest performances
ever by Kurt Warner.</LD>
<LD>   Now Sammy has the Steelers and the Eagles playing in the Super
Bowl. Although both have great defenses, they don't have Warner.
Quarterbacks make All-Pro wide receivers. Not vice versa.</LD>
<LD>   But take a longshot, Sammy. Maybe one time you'll be right.</LD>

<TE>   It's kind of sad that as Emmitt Smith approaches the all-time
rushing title, he's still dogged by questions of whether he
"deserves" the achievement ["Lone Star," Sept. 2].</TE>
<TE>   I've never understood the antipathy expressed by Barry Sanders
advocates against Smith. Part of what goes into having a great career
is longevity. Smith continues to play on, and Sanders quit. It's not
Smith's fault that Sanders chose to leave the game early. Smith has
played through injuries and hung on through the Cowboys' slide into
mediocrity.</TE>

<LD>Obviously, Steve Springer did not spend much time interviewing
residents of Big Bear Lake when he wrote his piece [Sept. 3] on
boxers training in Big Bear.</LD>
<LD>   As for bringing money into local businesses, sorry, the only money
they bring goes into the bars and drinking establishments.</LD>
<LD>   Our community prides itself on its volunteerism and community
support. In all of the years of the boxers being here, they have
never volunteered one hour of service. They are not an asset.</LD>

<LD>Before any players or coaches pull more hamstrings patting themselves
on the back after a nice victory over Auburn, allow me to remind them
of a few things.</LD>
<LD>   First, how good Auburn is has yet to be determined. We beat Penn
State in the season opener two years ago, and if you want to know how
that season turned out, just ask the offensive coordinator with the
Jets, Paul what's-his-name.</LD>
<LD>   Second, we have a running game that, at times, resembles someone
rolling a barrel uphill.</LD>
<TE>   Third, we have a star wide receiver who coughed up the ball in the
fourth quarter on a potentially winning drive. And we still have a
quarterback who likes to keep the other team in the game.</TE>
<TE>   That being said, I will admit there were glimmers of hope to be
found (a kicker!). But let's call this what it was: a good step on
the long road back to respectability. A road, it seems, we've been on
for more than a decade.</TE>

<LD>Alan Abrahamson writes ["Forward Progress", Aug. 31] that someday it
won't be a social milestone when a major college football program
hires "a worthy coach who happens to be black."</LD>
<LD>   That someday would be today if the media would just focus on an
individual's ability to coach and not what color skin they have. In
Abrahamson's example of the hiring of Tyrone Willingham as Notre
Dame's football coach, is it more important that he's the school's
first black coach or that he could be the first coach to win the
Irish a national championship since the 1980s?</LD>

<LD>Let's see if I understand this. The majority of the major league
owners voluntarily pay most of their players more than they are worth
and then raise the price of tickets and food in their stadiums to
cover their mistakes. Then they hire Bud Selig to be the
commissioner, a boorish and arrogant man at best, who will be
remembered for declaring a tie in the 2002 All-Star game.</LD>
<LD>   After reviewing these facts, most fans blame the players as the
cause for all of baseball's problems. Is that about right?</LD>

<TE>   I enjoyed the 19-1 pasting the Dodgers gave the Diamondbacks. I
also noticed the club saved their pitchers late in the game by
letting Mark Grace, a first baseman, take the mound. With nothing on
the line, a perfect solution. So why didn't they use the strategy in
the All-Star game?</TE>

won a World Series title [in San Francisco] and probably never will,
and because any team can beat another on any given day, it's good
that you know your team's limits.</LD>
<LD>   * To Angel fans: You would have been better off if baseball had
gone on strike. It's only a matter of time before the Angels find a
way to blow this one. Can you spell D-a-v-e H-e-n-d-e-r-s-o-n?</LD>
<TE>   * And to Raider fans: No flying saucer crashed in Roswell, Oswald
acted alone, the moon landing was real and there is no conspiracy by
the NFL against your team. The New England game was just something
that happened. Get over it.</TE>

<LD>I was delighted to see Nikki Teasley on the front page of The Times
in her joyous run around the court after her awesome three-pointer
for the Sparks. I have been a Sparks' fan from the start and this is
the first time I have seen coverage like this.</LD>
<LD>   However, as I went to the Sports section to read the articles, I
was dismayed at the tone with which Bill Plaschke ended his column.
Although I believe he meant to give women's basketball a boost, it
sounded condescending. The message I got was, "Let them have their
little game, what harm is there?"</LD>
<LD>   I have come to accept that women's basketball will, for the most
part, be considered the NBA's "little sister." But let's give the
players and the fans their due. The games were exciting, sometimes
they won ugly, but so do the men's teams. It's getting the job done
that counts. And I saw plenty of men in the stands every bit as
enthusiastic as they might be at a Laker game.</LD>

<TE>   I opened the paper Sunday, fully expecting to see a major headline
about the Sparks' second consecutive title. What I saw was a big
headline about the UCLA football coach. The Sparks' story was
relegated to the bottom of the page. Shame on The Times' sports
editors. When will the Sparks get their due? Not in my lifetime, I
imagine. If all you "guys" out there are not watching the games,
you're missing out.</TE>

<TE>   POSTSCRIPT</TE>
<TE>   As he watched the Twin Towers and Pentagon burn on television last
Sept. 11, Wayne Collett felt the same rage and sadness most Americans
felt, the same pain and horror.</TE>
<TE>   He felt personally violated and was infused with a strong sense of
patriotism--reactions that might surprise those familiar with
Collett's behavior during the medal ceremony after winning the silver
in the 400 meters at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to think in nationalistic terms, but this was an attack
on the U.S.," Collett said of the Sept. 11 attacks. "It was like
nothing I had experienced before. I took it personally."</TE>
<TE>   Collett, 52, had become infamous for not standing at attention
during the playing of the national anthem during his Olympic medal
ceremony. He and 400 gold-medal winner Vince Matthews stood with
hands on hips and talked during the anthem in a protest of U.S. civil
rights policies back home.</TE>
<TE>   The protest drew the wrath of the International Olympic Committee,
which banned Collett and Matthews from the rest of the Munich games
and cost the sprinters a shot at gold as members of the favored 1,600
relay team. Collett said the protest had nothing to do with
anti-American feelings and has long been misunderstood as an act of
unpatriotic behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "I love America," he said. "I just don't think it's lived up to
its promise. I'm not anti-American at all. To suggest otherwise is to
not understand the struggle of blacks in America at the time."</TE>
<TE>   After the 1972 Olympics, Collett earned a law degree and practiced
from 1977-1992. He has since quit law and now works in the real
estate and mortgage industry in the Los Angeles area. A grandfather
of two, Collett was inducted into the UCLA athletic hall of fame in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   Collett says that race relations have improved since his day on
the medal stand, though he said those issues still have much room for
improvement. Because of that, even with the pall of the Sept. 11
attacks still draped over the country, he doesn't know if he would
honor the anthem if put in the same situation today.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are very different today," he said. "But I've never been
one to sing the anthem. It's not my style."</TE>

<LD>Shaquille O'Neal was found Friday to be rid of the virus that gripped
him for most of the past month, and so was cleared to undergo surgery
on his arthritic big toe Wednesday at UCLA Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors told O'Neal's agent, Perry Rogers, that blood tests
administered this week were normal. O'Neal had twice been admitted
into an Orlando-area hospital to be treated for high body
temperatures and other complications, including a swollen liver.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Robert Mohr will perform the cheilectomy, a procedure he
expects will relieve O'Neal's pain and restore his mobility. The
recovery is expected to take at least six weeks, and so there is a
chance O'Neal would miss part of the regular season. The Lakers open
Oct. 29 against San Antonio.</LD>

<KH>ON THE NFL</KH>
<HD>Hahn Hasn't Written Off Downtown Stadium Project</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another NFL season is underway, and Los Angeles is no closer to
having a team of its own.</LD>
<LD>   Or is it?</LD>
<LD>   L.A. Mayor James K. Hahn, who said in February he envisioned pro
football back in the city within five years, says he isn't so sure
plans for a downtown stadium have flat-lined.</LD>
<TE>   Sure, Philip Anschutz's interest in writing a nine-figure check
for a football stadium has plummeted faster than Qwest stock. Yes,
options to buy that land next to Staples Center are expiring by the
minute, and the specter of a county lawsuit lingers.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn still holds out hope for that project.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's over yet," he said Friday. "The last
conversation I had with Mr. Anschutz and Mr. [Tim] Leiweke, the
feeling was, not at this time. But if the time is right again, they
may be back in the game. I don't think they were closing the door and
locking it. I think they were withdrawing for the time being and
saying, 'Hey, if somebody else can do better than us, more power to
them.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he would be willing to get behind an effort by the
Coliseum, but he doesn't think the NFL has any interest in that site.
The other option is the Rose Bowl, which last month hired John Moag,
the Maryland consultant who helped move the Cleveland Browns to
Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL asked Moag to get involved with the Rose Bowl, and the
league is almost never proactive when it comes to L.A. That means the
league wants to stir the pot here, either because a team actually
wants to move here, or because one wants to use L.A. as a leverage
point to get a new stadium in its own city. Teams that could possibly
move--provided they are braced for legal warfare--include San Diego,
New Orleans, Indianapolis, Buffalo, Minnesota, Arizona, San Francisco
and even Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   But that assumes the team has a place to play when it gets to
L.A., and both the Coliseum and Rose Bowl would require $400-million
makeovers to become long-term solutions. And no one knows where that
money is coming from, considering the community's aversion to
spending public money on privately owned sports teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't understand the attitude that California uniquely has in
almost taking pride in not having a public-sector factor in these
sports facilities," said Max Muhleman, chief executive of Muhleman
Marketing, a Charlotte company specializing in major league sports
consulting.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, when L.A. and Houston were competing for an expansion
franchise, the NFL commissioned Muhleman to study the L.A. market. He
determined that an NFL franchise would succeed in Los Angeles, but it
would require a near-perfect combination of facility quality,
ownership commitment and promotion.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, one NFL owner summed up the prevailing opinion among his
peers: "L.A. is all about self-destructive politics."</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago this month, at the request of then-mayor Richard
Riordan, Peter O'Malley backed off his proposal to build an NFL venue
at Dodger Stadium so the city could cast its lot with the Coliseum. A
lot of people, Hahn among them, still speak wistfully of the O'Malley
plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Peter could have done it," he said. "I think it's
unfortunate that the rug was kind of pulled out from under him before
he even got started. That was a chapter of Los Angeles really not
having its act together and losing out to a city that did."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger President Bob Graziano, who keeps close tabs on NFL in L.A.
issues, said he is not optimistic about football's returning any time
soon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been six years since we stopped our efforts, and I haven't
seen a lot of progress made over that time," he said. "I've seen
things heat up and die out very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Elway and Dan Marino played against each other only once in
their primes.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders and Steelers, whose rivalry is part of NFL lore, never
met in Pittsburgh from 1981 through '99.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo has never hosted Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best things about the realigned NFL is these kinds of
quirks will never happen again. The reshuffled league, broken into
eight four-team divisions, features a far more predictable schedule,
one that guarantees fans will see every team face each other on a
regular, rotating basis.</TE>
<TE>   In eight seasons, every team will play every other team at least
twice--at home and on the road--and teams are guaranteed to play all
nondivision opponents in their conference at least once every three
years. A decision will be made after the 2009 season on whether to
keep the format or tinker with it.</TE>
<TE>   Among the teams most affected are the 49ers and Cardinals, now NFC
West rivals, both of whom will log far fewer air miles in the coming
years. Arizona had no business being in the NFC East, just as
Carolina, Atlanta and New Orleans were out of place in the NFC West.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle is the only team that switches conferences, moving from
the AFC to NFC, although a lot of people forget the Seahawks were an
NFC team in their first season, and Tampa Bay was in the AFC.</TE>
<TE>   One of the drawbacks to realignment is that a team's record the
previous season will have less bearing on its current schedule. It
used to be that bad teams had the comfort of knowing they would get a
last-place schedule the next season (as well as a high draft pick).
That's not so true anymore. Now, only two--rather than
four--opponents are based on the previous year's standings.</TE>
<TE>   With the new system, some introductions could be necessary. The
Packers and Redskins did not play from 1989 through 2000, for
instance, and have not played in Washington since 1979. Atlanta and
the New York Giants did not play from 1989 through '97. And the
Steelers and Chiefs have played six consecutive times in Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston quarterback Tony Banks might cross paths with Cowboy owner
Jerry Jones this weekend when the Texans make their debut. If so,
Banks doesn't plan to say a word. The Cowboys cut him in training
camp a year ago, not long after signing him to be their starter. They
decided to go with Quincy Carter.</TE>
<TE>   "[Jones] is not one of my favorite people," Banks said. "But this
is a business, and you're not always going to like who you work for
or who fired you. That's just the nature of the business."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Listed at 380 pounds--and that's a conservative estimate--Cowboy
tackle Aaron Gibson is the NFL player who most closely resembles a
small planet. He's not alone on that Dallas line, though, which
averages 329 pounds and is the league's heaviest. The rotund
runners-up are Philadelphia, 324.3; Arizona, 323; Buffalo, 321.8, and
Minnesota, 321.6.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, we must be putting some good steroids in that fast food,"
said longtime NFL lineman Conrad Dobler, who retired in 1981 after
playing in an era when 300-pounders were almost unheard of.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver's Brian Griese and Shannon Sharpe have been hanging out a
lot lately, and Sharpe, the Pro Bowl tight end, has a simple
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "We both have something the other person wants," Sharpe told the
Denver Post. "And I think the thing he wants that I have is respect
from my teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows that I command respect from my teammates. I don't have
to say it. I don't have to belittle anybody. But with the way you
carry yourself, there's a certain way you do things."</TE>
<TE>   OK, Shannon, but what does Griese have that you want?</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen million."</TE>

<HD>Giants Win on Sanders' Single</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reggie Sanders singled home the winning run in the bottom of the
ninth inning to give the San Francisco Giants a 1-0 victory over the
Arizona Diamondbacks, Friday night at Pac Bell Park.</LD>
<LD>   After starters Kirk Rueter and Miguel Batista dueled through
scoreless innings most of the night, the Giants finally broke through
against Mike Fetters (3-1).</LD>
<LD>   Rich Aurilia led off the ninth with a double to left--the only
extra-base hit of the game. After Jeff Kent grounded to third and
Barry Bonds drew his major league record 54th intentional walk this
season, Sanders lined a single to right to beat his former teammates.</LD>
<TE>   San Francisco remained three games behind the Dodgers in the
National League wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Giant Manager Dusty Baker won his 824th game with the team,
passing Bill Terry for second place on the franchise list.</TE>
<TE>   Felix Rodriguez (6-6) got one out in the ninth for the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Though San Francisco's offense couldn't get him a victory, Rueter
confounded the Diamondbacks for the fourth time this season. He threw
eight strong innings to extend his scoreless streak against Arizona
to 23 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Rueter gave up a leadoff single to Quinton McCracken before
retiring the next 12 hitters. He pitched out of jams in the seventh
and eighth innings, and left to a standing ovation after giving up
three hits and two walks. Rueter struck out four.</TE>
<TE>   But Rueter was matched for seven innings by Batista. Batista
retired 12 of his first 14 hitters, yielding just four hits and two
walks without allowing a runner past second base.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, Montreal 0--Kevin Millwood pitched a three-hitter and
hit a two-run double to win his seventh consecutive decision as the
Braves reduced their magic number to four with a victory at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves, seeking their 11th consecutive division title, have a
19 1/2-game lead over Philadelphia in the NL East. With 21 games
remaining, their 89 wins surpass their total from last season.</TE>
<TE>   Millwood (16-6) is 14-1 in 21 starts since May 24, and the Braves
won five of those six no-decisions. The right-hander gave up only
three singles and never allowed a runner past second base.</TE>
<TE>   New York 7, Philadelphia 2--Jeromy Burnitz hit a three-run homer,
Timo Perez had three RBIs and Al Leiter pitched seven solid innings
to lead the Mets at Philadelphia. The Mets have won four straight
since losing five in a row and 17 of 20.</TE>
<TE>   Burnitz, who has struggled the entire season, gave New York a 4-2
lead during a five-run sixth inning with his second homer in two
games.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 7, San Diego 3--Juan Uribe hit a three-run homer, rookie
Aaron Cook pitched seven strong innings and the Rockies won at Denver
in front of 26,243 at Coors Field, a franchise low. Uribe's homer
capped a four-run fourth inning, giving the Rockies a 5-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 11, Florida 0--Jack Wilson hit a three-run homer and
had a career-high four RBIs as the Pirates won at Pittsburgh. Kevin
Young hit a two-run homer and Kris Benson (7-6) combined with four
relievers on a nine-hitter, Pittsburgh's seventh shutout of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 5, Milwaukee 3--Barry Larkin singled in the go-ahead
run in the 12th inning and the Reds stayed unbeaten at Miller Park
this season with a victory at Milwaukee.</TE>

<HD>St. Louis Has Better Brother</HD>
<DH>Baseball: On this night, Cardinal pitcher Andy Benes is
better than younger sibling Alan and Cubs, 11-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>This sibling rivalry was no contest.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Benes came within one out of a shutout and contributed to
younger brother Alan's early exit with two hits and a run batted in
during an 11-run third inning as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the
Chicago Cubs, 11-2, Friday night at St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   "We were hoping for a 1-0 game," Andy Benes said. "I'll tell you
what, the third inning just killed me watching it and I had to kind
of regroup."</LD>
<TE>   "He's my younger brother and I'm his second-biggest fan behind his
wife and it's gut-wrenching."</TE>
<TE>   The Benes vs. Benes matchup was believed to be only the seventh
time in major league history that brothers have faced each other. It
was the first time since Ramon Martinez beat younger brother Pedro
Martinez on Aug. 29, 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Benes watched his sons from a box seat midway between the
two dugouts, alternately wearing a Cubs and Cardinals cap.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season, the Benes brothers opposed each other in a
minor league game while both were on the comeback trail.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd probably rather come to the game and not talk about facing my
brother," Alan Benes (1-1) said. "I've never been one to love the
media attention."</TE>
<TE>   The National League Central-leading Cardinals won their third
consecutive.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Pujols had four RBIs in the Cardinals' big inning with a
two-run single and a two-run double. But he was taken out with a
spasm in his upper left shoulder after he limped to second on his
double. Pujols said he felt the spasm down to his thighs and didn't
know whether he'd be able to play today.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal outfielder J.D. Drew also left early was removed in the
top of the second with tightness in his left quadriceps. Drew was due
for a day off today with the Cardinals facing a left-hander.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Benes (5-4) continued his strong second-half comeback by
pitching an eight-hitter. Alex Gonzalez hit a two-run homer with two
outs in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   In the third, Andy even had a little fun at his brother's expense.
After gloving Alan's soft liner to the mound, Andy let the ball
dribble out of his mitt so his brother would have to run it out
before finishing him off with an underhand toss to first.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>All this time U.S. tennis fans have been looking for the next Pete
Sampras and Andre Agassi, but they've been right here, moving
relentlessly ahead, into the final of another Grand Slam tournament,
aiming for a second consecutive prime-time Saturday night slugfest at
Arthur Ashe Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Meet Serena and Venus Williams, the Agassi and Sampras of the 21st
century.</LD>
<LD>   Serena, who beat a game Lindsay Davenport, 6-3, 7-5, Friday in the
semifinals, has owned this U.S. Open as the charismatic Agassi used
to own the New York event in the 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   These last two weeks have been about Serena's outfits--the
tight-fitting black catsuit, the strawberry ice jackets, the very
baring pink shirt and short black skirt--and her dramatically blond
hair, sparkling tiara and her posing with hunky model Tyson Beckford.</TE>
<TE>   Remember how it used to be with Agassi? We were aghast when he
came out with stonewashed denim shorts and flowing blond hair. We
were stunned when he tried neon-colored shirts and shorts, when he
decided to shave his chest and then change his shirt quite
dramatically. Some of us still have the official transcript of Brooke
Shields interviews given in the official U.S. Open press room, and
then there was the Barbra Streisand Open, when more people trained
binoculars on the players' box than on the court.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi enjoyed the attention, relished claiming his space on both
the sports page and the gossip page, enjoyed raising eyebrows and
causing some tsk-tsking among the more tradition-bound patrons of
Flushing Meadow.</TE>
<TE>   Serena has been happy to flash her muscles and her smile, to go
out on the town and to own the stadium court on her own terms.</TE>
<TE>   And Venus is Pete, graceful and stately, pleasant to talk to but
unwilling to share much of herself. Venus chooses a tasteful tennis
dress of white and subdued blue, well-tailored but not dramatically
revealing. Her hair color is her own and her face remains in an
unbending stare throughout her matches, even the tight three-setters
she has pulled out in the fourth round and semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Serena goes out to dinner, shows up on Page 6 of the New York
Post.</TE>
<TE>   Venus has dinner delivered and goes to bed.</TE>
<TE>   It is part of what has made the Sampras-Agassi rivalry so
compelling, the contrast in personality. What also has made the
Sampras-Agassi rivalry is contrast in their games, the mystery of
whether Sampras' attacking serve-and-volley style will break down
Agassi's pummeling baseline power.</TE>
<TE>   And that is the problem, more than anything, with hoping for a
match of great competitive tennis between the Williamses.</TE>
<TE>   With Venus and Serena there are contrasting personalities but not
contrasting styles. It's clear that Venus, 22, and Serena, 20, are
willing to play each other on their own terms now. Each is able to
put her personal goals ahead of the feelings of the other.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to win more than anything," Serena said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want another Open," Venus said.</TE>
<TE>   But it is hard for players with similar games, with big, pounding
serves, with power groundstrokes, to produce a classic match.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very tough to get a very good match with two power hitters,"
Davenport said. "Power hitters sometimes like the balls a little
softer. And it's hard to get a rally going when they both have such
huge serves."</TE>
<TE>   If Venus and Serena play a pedestrian match tonight, it will not
be because one sister is unable to compete hard enough or that their
father, Richard, decreed one sister should win or lose or any other
conspiracy theory that seems almost silly now, with the way the games
and personalities have matured.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're capable of having that Sampras-Agassi rivalry,"
Serena said. "I think we're kind of building toward that rivalry.
This is the fourth in the last five Grand Slams we've met. So I think
we're really trying to get it built."</TE>
<TE>   If tonight's match is not a nail-biting, three-set masterpiece, it
will be because the two hardest-hitting, biggest-serving players on
the tour are trying to outhit each other. That will make for some
spectacular points and some spectacular misses.</TE>
<TE>   In watching Venus beat Amelie Mauresmo, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4, and Serena
beat Davenport, what was most impressive was the way each sister was
able to reach a crucial moment, when the match might have turned, and
summon nerveless serves.</TE>
<TE>   Venus found herself down, 0-40, on her serve in the final game of
the match. Mauresmo had found her rhythm in the second set and was
putting pressure on Venus.</TE>
<TE>   But, in order, Venus cranked out a 116-mph service winner; another
116-mph serve to start a point that ended with a missed Mauresmo lob;
a 114-mph ace; a 122-mph service winner and a neatly angled second
serve that forced Mauresmo into a wide forehand.</TE>
<TE>   When Davenport had three set points on Serena's serve in the
second set, Serena blasted three service winners, placing the ball in
different spots at different speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight will be the second annual Williams-Williams prime-time
U.S. Open final. That makes a rivalry too, a compelling rivalry, one
of familial angst and history-making interest. Someday soon it may be
as good as what Pete and Andre have offered. Just different.</TE>

<LD>Six-time world champion surfer Kelly Slater fell off his board a
couple of times, then made the most of an opportunity to advance in
the Boost Mobile Pro at Lower Trestles in San Clemente on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Slater, 30, who is back on the Assn. of Surfing Professionals
World Championship Tour after a three-year hiatus, trailed Australian
Lee Winkler most of the second-round elimination heat, and it
appeared the clock might end any hopes Slater had to catch Winkler.</LD>
<LD>   But Slater, from Cocoa Beach, Fla., grabbed a wave and scored an
8.0 out of a possible 10 with 40 seconds left in the heat to overtake
the Australian and advance.</LD>
<TE>   "He [Winkler] had priority, so I had to sneak one when he passed
it up and surf it really hard," Slater said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to remember the old times, when I used to do
that a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Slater is ranked No. 22 on the tour.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a real indicator for me," he said. "If I lost that heat,
it was going to be a real bummer of a contest. It would have shot me
down a bit, but I'm stoked.</TE>
<TE>   "It gave me a lot of confidence. I was actually thinking this
morning how at the last second I could get a wave and make it out of
this round and then win a contest."</TE>
<TE>   Slater will face Kieren Perrow of Australia on Sunday in the third
round.</TE>
<TE>   Another key match on Sunday will be the event's defending champion
and current tour leader Andy Irons against San Clemente's Shane
Beschen, who was allowed to surf the event as a wild-card entrant.</TE>
<TE>   Beschen won his first-round heat Thursday, when he defeated Mark
Occhilupo and Dean Morrison.</TE>
<TE>   There will be no competition today. Surfing will continue on
Sunday at 8 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The quarterfinals, semifinals and finals will be Monday and
Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Hewitt Won't Slip Under Radar Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Not that he is complaining, but defending champion Lleyton Hewitt of
Australia has almost been the forgotten man of the U.S. Open since
beating James Blake in the third round.</LD>
<LD>   That won't be the problem today in the men's semifinals. The
marquee matchup between the top-seeded Hewitt and No. 6 Andre Agassi
will follow the opener between sentimental favorite Pete Sampras, 31,
and final four newcomer Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands. Sampras is
4-0 vs. Schalken, who turns 26 Sunday, but they have not played since
1998. Hewitt, 21, and Agassi, 32, have played twice in 2002, with
Hewitt winning both times.</LD>
<LD>   Their final at San Jose in February was considered one of the best
men's finals of the season, accompanied by an interesting twist.
Agassi's new coach was Darren Cahill, who had helped guide Hewitt to
the U.S. Open title last year and the No. 1 spot. Hewitt leads their
series, 4-2, and first played Agassi when the Australian was 16, in
Adelaide. Hewitt hasn't forgotten it.</LD>
<TE>   "It was nerve-wracking just being in the locker room," he said. "I
had a couple of my mates in there with me. They were trying to keep
me as relaxed as possible, but you keep looking over and Andre's
sitting there."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi is wary of this kind of talk. "When somebody tells me,
'I've been watching you my whole life,' I'm like, 'Please, stop right
there.' I don't need to hear anymore, how long I've been playing."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi's longtime rival Sampras is the one who has stolen most of
the attention from the likes of Hewitt, and for good reason. Sampras'
recent rejuvenation has been the talk of the Open, and he will be
trying to reach his third consecutive final here.</TE>
<TE>   "The first few matches he was a lot more tentative but had the
firepower and the matchups to get through the first couple of
matches," Agassi said. "I noticed him really start to execute his
shot and not be scared to go for it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Little did Bob Bryan know that he was going to hurt himself down
the line when he discovered a new mixed doubles partner for his twin
brother, Mike.</TE>
<TE>   Bob hooked up with Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia and arranged for
his brother to play with Lisa Raymond. Friday, the four found
themselves all on the same court--in the mixed doubles final. Raymond
and Mike Bryan defeated Srebotnik and Bob Bryan, 7-6 (9), 7-6 (1).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The season-ending WTA Championships at Staples Center in November
has established the Corina Morariu Courage Award. The official
announcement will be made today. Morariu, 24, will be the first
recipient. She was diagnosed with leukemia in May 2001, leaving the
tour for chemotherapy treatment. In August, she returned to the tour,
playing doubles at Carlsbad.</TE>

<HD>Guess Who's Back in U.S. Open Final</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Serena and Venus Williams withstand tests to set up
rematch of last year's championship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Conventional wisdom held for months that Jennifer Capriati was the
only one who could realistically slow the runaway success of sisters
Venus and Serena Williams.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of getting ready to stop the sisters, Capriati, eliminated
in the U.S. Open quarterfinals, was dancing at a club, Serafina, at a
weekly Candyland party, landing in the tabloids, having stripped down
to her bra, cigarette in hand.</LD>
<LD>   Those with more conventional weapons in hand--a racket--fared
slightly better at the Open on Friday, but, by nightfall, a certain
sameness settled in over the National Tennis Center. Tonight will be
another all-Williams final, the fourth in the last five Grand Slams,
and a repeat of last year's glitzy meeting in prime time.</LD>
<TE>   Two-time defending champion and No. 2-seeded Venus had more
difficulty, defeating No. 10 Amelie Mauresmo of France, 6-3, 5-7,
6-4, in 1 hour 58 minutes. She had three aces and double-faulted 10
times.</TE>
<TE>   Her younger sister, No. 1 Serena, stalled in the second set,
fighting off three set points, but finished strongly against No. 4
Lindsay Davenport, winning, 6-3, 7-5, in 1 hour 22 minutes. Serena,
who served 13 aces, will be attempting to win her third consecutive
Grand Slam title, which would equal Steffi Graf's accomplishment in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   "Most amazing thing in sports almost," Davenport said. "Could you
imagine Tiger Woods challenging a sibling to go head to head for all
the majors? And in an individual sport, no less. They don't have
teammates to help them along."</TE>
<TE>   The sisters have been able to establish a sense of separateness.
For all that, it was fascinating to watch how each of them dealt with
adversity on the court in relatively similar fashion in the
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Example No. 1: Venus, suffering from a blister on her right hand,
found herself in a tight third set against an inspired Mauresmo.
Serving for the match at 5-4, Williams fell behind, 0-40. She
equalized by hitting a service winner of 116 mph and an ace of 114
mph, on two of the three points. For an exclamation mark, Williams
reached match point by firing a service winner of 122 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Example No. 2: Davenport slowly started to find her range, took a
5-2 lead in the second set and served for it at 5-3. Serena broke her
at 15, and fought off three set points in the 10th game, trailing,
4-5. She saved one with an ace, another with a service winner and the
third with a forehand winner.</TE>
<TE>   "That was incredible playing at a tight time," Davenport said. "I
wish I had been able to serve a little better of a game. She just
came up with some big serves at the right time the whole match, and a
really big game to just hang in there in the second set."</TE>
<TE>   Venus simply looked weary and slightly annoyed when asked whether
the sisters' domination was good for the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I don't see why the question could be relevant why
it would be bad for tennis," she said. "It's never been asked before.
So I don't understand the question.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just hard these days. When you win, there's a problem. When
you lose, there's a problem. So what do you want me to do?"</TE>
<TE>   She emphasized her point by smacking her hand on the podium. Venus
was not the only puzzled member of the family. The crowd support was
surprisingly in favor of Mauresmo. It would be like a crowd at Roland
Garros cheering Mauresmo's double faults in a match against an
American.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt the crowd was getting behind me and maybe appreciated the
way I was handling things," Mauresmo said. "I could feel that. It was
great, actually, to play an American and feel the crowd is behind
you. That's a pretty good effort."</TE>
<TE>   Said Oracene Williams, the mother and coach of Venus and Serena:
"You know what's wrong, you can surmise that for yourself. There were
some people pulling for Venus. I give them a little benefit of the
doubt. That's part of the game. It was worse in California [Indian
Wells]."</TE>
<TE>   At Indian Wells last year, the Williamses charged racism when the
fans booed the family during Serena's final against Kim Clijsters.
The fans were upset after Venus withdrew about five minutes before
her semifinal with Serena because of an injury.</TE>
<TE>   Oracene was asked whether Friday's reaction was a racial issue or
one of gender.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been thinking about that, I think that's it ... Is it
because these are women, and women can't have power?" Oracene asked.
"No matter what the race is, it's a problem in American society."</TE>
<TE>   The sisters simply answer by winning matches at an astounding
rate. They have combined to win seven of the last 11 Grand Slam
titles. Venus won the U.S Open last year in straight sets against
Serena, and Serena beat her in the French Open and Wimbledon finals
this year, also in straight sets.</TE>
<TE>   "I was overconfident going into that match," Serena said of the
2001 Open. "I was like, 'Oh, I'm playing well, beat Martina Hingis
and Lindsay Davenport.' You know, I was overconfident, not focused
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "This year's totally different. Venus is playing great. She's been
playing great all this summer. So I know she might maybe have a
little bit of an edge going into this match, so I'm not overconfident
at all."</TE>

<TE>   Sibling Rivalry</TE>
<TE>   Not once in the 20th century did siblings meet to decide a Grand
Slam title. It's about to happen at a third consecutive major, and
for the fourth time in five majors as Venus Williams plays Serena:</TE>

<HD>More Than 3,000 Are Expected for the L.A. Triathlon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Caress wanted to make the L.A. Triathlon the best
Olympic-distance triathlon in the nation when he helped stage the
inaugural event two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   But the 48-year-old race director wouldn't mind if the event,
which consists of a 1.5-kilometer swim, 40-kilometer bike ride and
10-kilometer run, develops into the largest triathlon in the nation
along the way.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. Triathlon was regarded as the third-largest in the
world--in terms of entrants--after attracting 2,750 competitors last
year. But it figures to move into the No. 2 spot on Sunday morning
when more than 3,000 people are expected to take part in the race
that begins at Venice Beach and ends at El Pueblo near Olvera Street.</LD>
<TE>   About 7,400 competitors took part in the Mrs. T's Triathlon in
Chicago two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The first competitors will plunge into the Pacific Ocean at 6:30
a.m. Sunday, with the elite men's and women's races scheduled to
start at 9 and 9:05, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't really that surprised with the turnout [1,650
competitors] we had for the first race," Caress said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the fact that the race grew by more than 60% last year did
surprise us."</TE>
<TE>   Caress credits the telecasts of the inaugural men's and women's
Olympic triathlons in Sydney in 2000 for increasing the participation
in the L.A. Triathlon last year. But he also says that Los Angeles is
a logical place to hold a triathlon. "If you think of all the people
here who run, swim or ride bikes, holding a triathlon makes perfect
sense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For world-class competitors, the L.A. Triathlon has two big things
going for it.</TE>
<TE>   First, it awards a large amount of prize money, by triathlon
standards.</TE>
<TE>   The winners of the men's and women's races will each get $14,000.
The second-place finishers will receive $7,000, with $3,500 going to
third, $2,000 to fourth, $1,500 to fifth, $1,000 to sixth, $600 to
seventh and $400 to eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Second, competitors are prohibited from drafting during the
cycling portion of the race.</TE>
<TE>   "It does have a healthy prize purse," said Simon Lessing, who won
five world titles during the 1990s and is competing in his first L.A.
Triathlon. "But the non-drafting rule is very appealing. It means
you're not allowed to ride in a pack, which makes for a fairer
competition. It means that the winner is usually the best triathlete,
not just the person who did the best job of conserving energy by
riding in the pack."</TE>

<LD>Avoiding mistakes that derailed UCLA last season was the mantra
during fall camp.</LD>
<LD>   Duplicating the absence of mistakes in last season's opener is the
message today.</LD>
<LD>   In a remarkable display of maturity and preparation, the Bruins
last year had zero turnovers and zero penalties in a 20-17 victory at
Alabama, triggering a six-game winning streak.</LD>
<TE>   Those Bruins had 23 seniors, however.</TE>
<TE>   These have only 12 seniors expected to play against No. 19
Colorado State.</TE>
<TE>   Those Bruins had only one freshman and two redshirt freshmen play
against Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   These have nine freshmen and eight redshirt freshmen expected to
make their debuts.</TE>
<TE>   A zero-tolerance mistake policy is as unrealistic as keeping
third-graders in a straight line before recess on the first day of
school.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them to go out on the field and have fun and don't worry
about making mistakes right now," Coach Bob Toledo said. "I don't
want them to be tentative."</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Toledo's messages are usually on the mark. UCLA has won
its last four openers, three against top-25 opponents.</TE>
<TE>   There have been more distractions than normal, however, because
several off-the-field fights involving players came to light this
fall, reviving criticism that Toledo can't control the team.</TE>
<TE>   He has answered by stiffening penalties for transgressions. And on
the field, he has seized command of the offense.</TE>
<TE>   Distracted by the NCAA violations and criminal court proceedings
of wayward Bruins late last season, Toledo had little time for Xs and
O's and decided to turn over play-calling responsibilities to
offensive coordinator Kelly Skipper.</TE>
<TE>   But this year the coach reconsidered--despite the continuing wave
of problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be calling the plays," Toledo said. "The staff felt more
comfortable with that."</TE>
<TE>   Skipper will be in the Rose Bowl press box talking into the
coach's headset, pointing out coverages and blitzes and reminding
Toledo of down and distance. He'll even suggest plays.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo, though, wants offense to keep his mind off criminal
offenses.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not thinking about any of that stuff anymore," he said. "It's
over as far as I'm concerned. It's over as far as the team is
concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Beating Colorado State (2-0) will require UCLA's undivided
attention. The Rams are coming off a 19-14 upset of No. 7 Colorado,
the third time in four years they have defeated their state rival.</TE>
<TE>   They also defeated Virginia, 35-29, Aug. 22 in the earliest game
in Division I history.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the Bruins will be the last Division I team to kick
off. UCLA's alarm clock is just going off while Colorado State has
already milked the cows, slopped the hogs and eaten a stack of
flapjacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting up to game speed, getting used to the tempo of a
ballgame, that's the biggest concern," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention simply lining up in the correct formations.
Defensive coordinator Phil Snow is taking a first-things-first
approach to containing Ram quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt, an elusive
scrambler, and tailback Cecil Sapp, a powerful runner.</TE>
<TE>   "The key to stopping him is getting lined up in the proper
defense," Snow said. "It's that simple."</TE>
<TE>   Once the ball is snapped, the next worry is equally basic.</TE>
<TE>   "Tackling in the first ballgame is always a concern," Snow said.
"When young guys have to learn a defense and haven't had much live
scrimmaging, it's easy to miss tackles."</TE>
<TE>   Sapp is a 6-foot-1, 225-pound senior who sat out last season after
having a benign tumor removed from his right heel. He is making up
for lost time, averaging 130 yards in two games.</TE>
<TE>   "Sapp reminds me of [Cincinnati Bengal running back] Corey
Dillon," Toledo said. "He has the ability to shake tacklers."</TE>
<TE>   Van Pelt reminds observers of single-wing backs from the 1940s. A
junior transfer from Michigan State and son of former NFL linebacker
Brad Van Pelt, he rushed for 546 yards last season.</TE>
<TE>   "He runs counters, draws and sweeps, most of it designed for him
to take off," Snow said. "He's a threat."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA counters with senior quarterback Cory Paus and an experienced
supporting cast of linemen and receivers. Tailback Akil Harris rushed
for 138 yards in the season-ending victory over Arizona State and
will share time with Manuel White and three redshirt freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   White is also the starting fullback. Expect him to be the target
of short passes from Paus, who will probably put the ball in the air
at least 25 times.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll throw twice as often as we did last year," Paus
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Mike Seidman was the most impressive receiver during
camp, consistently beating safeties on deep patterns and presenting a
6-5 target on underneath routes.</TE>
<TE>   But his effectiveness might be muted by Colorado State's frequent
blitzes, which could keep him blocking. Expect Paus to call slant
routes to receivers Tab Perry, Craig Bragg and Ryan Smith when he
recognizes stunts.</TE>
<TE>   Although Colorado State has proved it is not an opponent to take
lightly, Toledo is committed to inserting freshman quarterback Drew
Olson in the second quarter for at least one series.</TE>
<TE>   Paus has had two broken collarbones, a separated shoulder and a
thumb injury in his career, and his backups all are freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   "How many times has Cory Paus been hurt?" Toledo said. "That
weighs heavily on my mind. That's why Drew has to get some
experience."</TE>
<TE>   The same is true of the 16 or so other Bruins who also will play
in their first college game. Mistakes are inevitable. Toledo just
hopes they are outweighed by big plays.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of talented guys," he said. "We have guys we think
can make an impact. Some have already proven it. We'll see if it
happens [tonight]."</TE>

<LD>Joey Cuppari is like many Colorado State players. The senior from
Westlake Village Westlake High grew up a USC fan and wanted to play
for the Trojans. Or UCLA. Even Arizona State would have been fine.</LD>
<LD>   But no Pacific 10 Conference team deemed him talented enough. So
off he went to Fort Collins, Colo., to forge a lower-profile Division
I career.</LD>
<LD>   Someday, Cuppari and his fellow Rams believed, the opportunity to
prove they belonged with the big boys would come along.</LD>
<TE>   How right they were. How about twice in two weeks?</TE>
<TE>   Colorado State knocked off No. 7 Colorado last week and tonight
sets its sights on the Bruins. For 36 Rams who hail from California,
it's redemption time.</TE>
<TE>   "UCLA had me go to games and meet [Coach Bob] Toledo, but when
offers were made, I didn't hear from them," Cuppari said. "They would
have been tops on my list. But you get over it."</TE>
<TE>   Cuppari had only six receptions last season, after making 31 in
2000. This season, it appears he is back in a go-to role just in time
for his date at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up hoping I'd play in the Rose Bowl against them in a USC
uniform," he said. "This will be the same atmosphere I hoped for."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Motivated by his elders, Colorado State Coach Sonny Lubick will
receive a five-year contract extension that will keep him coaching
through his 70th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "You see Joe Paterno [75] and Bobby Bowden [72] still going at it
at their ages," he said. "They still have the drive and ego to coach
football."</TE>
<TE>   Lubick, who has led the Rams to eight consecutive winning seasons,
was frightened during the off-season when abnormalities were
discovered in his prostate gland. A biopsy was negative, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm praying more now than I ever used to as a young man," he
said. "That's the way it works, I guess. The older you get, the more
you pray."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although no UCLA starter is injured, four second-team players will
miss the game: Fullback Pat Norton (ankle), linebacker Patrick
Pierre-Louis (shoulder), tight end Keith Carter (ankle) and guard
Shane Lehmann (suspension).... Attendance is expected to be about
55,000. Average attendance for home games last season was 66,613.</TE>

<TE>   TV--Fox Sports Net, HD Net</TE>
<TE>   Radio--Fox Sports Radio (1150 AM)</TE>
<TE>   WHEN UCLA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The experienced Bruin line has a size advantage over the Rams, who
will blitz frequently. UCLA will try to exploit the unproven Ram
safeties and stay away from cornerback Dexter Wynn. Tailback Akil
Harris could be a 20-carry workhorse or give way to redshirt freshmen
Wendell Mathis, Jason Harrison and Tyler Ebell. Manuel White will get
carries on short-yardage and goal-line plays, lining up at either
fullback or tailback. Expect Paus to throw to flanker Tab Perry and
tight end Mike Seidman early, although Seidman will have to block
when a blitz is expected. Backup quarterback Drew Olson is scheduled
to play at least one series in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   WHEN COLORADO STATE HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Tailback Cecil Sapp is a bruising runner who averages 130 yards a
game. Quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt is a greater danger as a runner
than as a passer, and Colorado State has several plays designed for
him to carry the ball. The Ram offensive line is beat up after two
games and could be vulnerable to an experienced Bruin front four.
UCLA middle linebacker Marcus Reese has recovered from a concussion
but will be watched closely by trainers.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO UCLA VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Recognizing and picking up frequent Colorado State blitzes.</TE>
<TE>   2. Containing Van Pelt, the Rams' elusive quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   3. Avoiding typical first-game mistakes against an opponent that
has already played twice.</TE>

<HD>With Healthy Ross, USC Looking Good</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a simple twist of fate. Actually it was a twist of April Ross'
right ankle.</LD>
<LD>   That injury forced the USC star volleyball player to leave in Game
2 of the NCAA women's regional final last December. Arizona then
rallied to defeat the Trojans in five games and advance to its first
Final Four.</LD>
<LD>   While that match hasn't kept second-year Coach Mick Haley up
nights, it did leave him thinking about what might have been.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't feel bad about last year," Haley said. "We practiced for
every situation. The only thing we couldn't do was finish."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans figure to make another run for an NCAA
title--something that's eluded them since 1981. Ross returns and is
healthy, leading a deep and talented squad that includes second-team
All-American Katie Olsovsky and All-Pacific 10 Conference players
Keao Burdine and Alicia Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   USC won the Radisson Hotel Roberts/Nike Classic last week with
victories over Ball State, Pittsburgh and Nebraska. The Trojans
handed Ball State its first home loss in 42 matches, got Haley his
800th collegiate victory and dealt second-ranked Nebraska its worst
defeat in five years.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans figure to be even deeper when 6-foot-5 freshman middle
blocker Bibiana Candelas arrives next week after playing for Mexico
in the World Championships.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State lost its only match last season in the NCAA title
game to Stanford. Duplicating a 33-1 record may be impossible without
graduated seniors Cheryl Weaver, Tayyiba Haneef and Keri Nishimoto.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers were also dealt a blow when senior Lindsay Phillips, a
former Southern Section player of the year at Huntington Beach Marina
High, was declared academically ineligible. But senior setter
Brittany Hochevar has led an inexperienced lineup to a 5-0 start.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine entered the season with high expectations based on a
returning cast led by West Coast Conference player of the year Katie
Wilkins.</TE>
<TE>   But the Waves, a preseason top 10 team, were stunned by losses to
Minnesota and Northern Iowa. They rebounded to win their four-team
tournament last week.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine has one of the nation's toughest schedules, playing two
Final Four teams, Nebraska and Arizona, this weekend in Tucson and
having nonconference matchups against Stanford, USC and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is to get into the final eight and go from there,"
Pepperdine Coach Nina Matthies said. "We actually have the horses to
get there. But our players have to buy into that and perform when the
pressure is on."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA appears to be in a rebuilding mode without Kristee Porter,
Ashley Bowles and career Pac-10 assist leader Erika Selsor. But the
Bruins defeated Colorado and 10th-ranked Ohio State before falling in
four games to Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Outside hitters Lauren Fendrick and Brittany Ringel and middle
blockers Angela Eckmier and Cira Wright figure to give UCLA a more
balanced look.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest difference is the use of two setters: sophomore
Krystal McFarland and true freshman Haley Jorgensborg. This should
allow sophomore Chrissie Zartman to shine on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Stork, a former Pepperdine All-American and three-time
Olympian, is in his first season as coach at Cal State Northridge
after spending the last four years at Pepperdine as Marv Dunphy's top
assistant with the men's team.</TE>
<TE>   Stork's name figures to attract more talent to Northridge,
allowing the Matadors to become a Big West Conference power alongside
Long Beach and Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reason why we shouldn't be," Stork said. "We're in a
large population base and there's a lot of talented volleyball
players in the valley."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Division III and NAIA college football teams in
Southern California begin their seasons today.</TE>
<TE>   Pomona-Pitzer visits La Verne, Azusa Pacific plays host to San
Diego, Redlands plays host to Willamette (Ore.) and
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps plays a nonconference game at Grinnell (Iowa)
College.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 14, Chapman is at Whittier in the teams' season opener,
while Cal Lutheran begins its year at Muhlenberg College in
Allentown, Penn.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental, the defending Southern California Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference champion, doesn't open until Sept. 21 against
Lewis &amp; Clark (Ore.) College.</TE>

<HD>Carroll Makes His Caution Clear</HD>

<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC does not play again until next Saturday at Colorado, so Coach
Pete Carroll gave his players today and Sunday off.</LD>
<LD>   The two-day respite qualifies as an extended break for a team that
won its season opener against Auburn last Monday and conducted three
light practices during this bye week.</LD>
<LD>   Carroll said he tried to emphasize one theme at the conclusion of
Friday's practice: "Stay out of trouble."</LD>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer said Carroll cited incidents at another
local program to get his message across.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach keeps using UCLA and all the stuff that's going on over
there as an example," Palmer said. "He wants guys to realize we have
something good going right now. Just be smart about it and don't mess
things up."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said he would spend part of today at his parents' house
watching Miami vs. Florida and other games on TV. The Colorado-San
Diego State game is a viewing possibility for Palmer, but it does not
qualify as must-see TV.</TE>
<TE>   "I like watching the games I don't get to see," Palmer said. "I
get to watch that Colorado game over and over again next week in film
so I'll see enough of that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Billy Hart, who languished behind backups Matt Leinart
and Matt Cassel throughout training camp, worked with the first-team
offense for several series Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Leinart was the No. 2 quarterback for the opener against Auburn,
but he did not play. Cassel missed an opportunity to unseat Leinart
by struggling in practice this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Billy sometimes is left out of the competition--I don't see it
that way," Carroll said. "I think Billy deserves as much chance as
anybody else. I saw him a lot last year with the service team. I want
him to have the chance to make some noise out here too."</TE>
<TE>   Hart said he would welcome more chances to move up the depth
chart.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not in any position to complain," Hart said.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can do is make the best of my opportunity when I get in
there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Winston Justice worked again with the first-team offense
and appears on track to start at right tackle against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the week, Justice alternated with redshirt junior Eric
Torres, who started the Auburn game. But Justice took every
repetition with the first team Friday while Torres worked at left
guard with the second unit.</TE>
<TE>   Justice said his blocking technique and his speed on the snap are
improving.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my run blocking is better than my pass blocking right
now," Justice said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Most assistant coaches left practice early to scout at junior
college and high school scrimmages.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he would attend a scrimmage at Long Beach City
College.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior flanker Keary Colbert did not participate in most drills
for the second day because of a sore knee.</TE>

<LD>If Jennifer Capriati is to regain the No. 1 ranking in women's
tennis, she will have to find a way to control her anxieties.</LD>
<LD>   They constitute the main reason she will be watching today's U.S.
Open final after falling apart in a quarterfinal loss to Amelie
Mauresmo earlier this week at Ashe Stadium in New York.</LD>
<LD>   The 10th-seeded Mauresmo took full advantage of No. 3 Capriati's
flightiness with a slow-down game and won in three sets, 4-6, 7-6
(7-5), 6-3.</LD>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, I just got really nervous and just really
tight," said Capriati, who has won the last two Australian Opens but
is still seeking her first U.S. Open title.</TE>
<TE>   Mauresmo, who lost to Venus Williams in the semifinals Friday,
used every trick in the book to frustrate Capriati. Mauresmo took her
sweet time throughout the 2-hour 18-minute quarterfinal match, often
reaching the 30-second time limit between serves with a series of
delaying tactics.</TE>
<TE>   If she was not wiping her forehead with a wristband, she was
moving hair away from her face or looking at the density of the fuzz
on the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Her play was in direct contrast to Capriati's.</TE>
<TE>   "She plays like she is double-parked, winning or losing, and I
don't think that is a good idea," Richard Gallien, USC women's tennis
coach, said of Capriati.</TE>
<TE>   Gamesmanship in tennis is nothing new. Bjorn Borg was famous for
counting the strings on his racket when he wanted to control the pace
of a match. The key for players on the waiting end is to keep their
focus.</TE>
<TE>   Having already lost twice to Mauresmo this summer, Capriati at
first seemed up to a reversal. In winning the first set, she had
plenty of pep in her step. She was in rhythm and playing with
confidence. Mauresmo looked like the tighter player.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati dominated play by winning one long rally after another,
those rallies usually ending with unforced errors by Mauresmo, who
won only two points over the final three games of the opening set.</TE>
<TE>   Things began to turn in the second. That's when Mauresmo became
more methodical between serves, and, at times, even raised her hand
to ask for a few seconds before Capriati served.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time Jennifer was ready to serve, the other one was doing
like that," Capriati's father, Stefano, told the Associated Press
while moving his hand to imitate Mauresmo. "It was disturbing
Jennifer."</TE>
<TE>   The more Mauresmo delayed, the more impatient Capriati became on
the hottest day of the tournament. Before long, Mauresmo's serves
were aces and Capriati's returns had turned into mis-hits.</TE>
<TE>   It was obvious that Capriati's nerves were on end when she
complained about Mauresmo's deliberate style before the start of the
third game and twice asked the chair umpire if the rock music playing
on the speakers between games could be turned down.</TE>
<TE>   "That to me is more a sign that Mauresmo is in her head in
general," Gallien said. "Now she's looking for things. When you start
looking for things and when you have rabbit ears, you're in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "She has to shut it out. If she lets it bother her, then it is her
fault. She has to keep her composure and maybe be a little more
patient.... Certainly not complain about it."</TE>
<TE>   Capriati still was in position to win the match when she broke
Mauresmo's serve and took a 6-5 lead in the second. But that's when
Mauresmo played her best tennis, winning the next two games to force
a set tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati then became her own worst enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the tiebreaker, she banged a forehand deep, then hit a
short ball into the net and was trailing 6-4, double-set point.
Capriati saved the first, but at 6-5, Mauresmo ran Capriati ragged
before putting away a backhand volley winner.</TE>
<TE>   In the third set, it was almost comical to watch Capriati try to
speed up play. Instead of calming down and realizing that Mauresmo
was beating her mentally, Capriati continued to bounce around the
court as if she had to go to the restroom.</TE>
<TE>   Which was fine with Mauresmo, who began to stay back more and look
for longer points while Capriati started to make the unforced errors
that Mauresmo had made in the first set.</TE>
<TE>   "Capriati was more than willing [to make unforced errors],"
Gallien said. "That's a sign of somebody mentally saying, 'I can't
take it anymore. I have had enough. I am not willing to accept the
pain that it is going to take point in and point out.' "</TE>
<TE>   Capriati, trailing, 5-3 in the third set and serving, saved four
match points. It was reminiscent of this year's Australian Open, in
which she had recovered from a Grand Slam final-record four match
points en route to escaping a 4-6, 0-4 hole against Martina Hingis.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, Capriati didn't have it in her for another miracle
comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Her sixth double fault set up match point No. 5, and an errant
forehand sent Mauresmo into the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "I know she doesn't like to play against me," said Mauresmo, who
improved to 4-3 lifetime against Capriati.</TE>
<TE>   After the match, Capriati said that she had choked. She can only
hope that she learned something from the experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts. Definitely hurts," she said. "Just a lot of
expectation, a lot of pressure put on myself. There's a fine line,
there's a balance. That's not good either, to just want it so bad."</TE>
