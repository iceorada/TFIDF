<HD>Hands-free is not necessarily risk-free</HD>
<DH>A road test of cell phone devices yields mixed results on
convenience. Whether they boost safety still is being debated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathleen Doheny</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the number of cell phones in the United States grows and grows --
138 million subscribers and climbing, according to the Cellular
Telecommunications &amp; Internet Assn. -- so too have sales of
hands-free devices.</LD>
<LD>   But though the nice pictures on the packaging often imply that
consumers might use them while jogging or shopping, let's get
serious: Most cell phone users who buy these mobile headsets plan to
multi-task as they drive.</LD>
<LD>   Safety experts worry that drivers who use hands-free devices will
see them as a panacea for the inattention and other driving troubles
that plague cell phone users -- and caution that they definitely are
not.</LD>
<TE>   A University of Utah study released last year found that driving
deficits were equal whether drivers used hands-free devices or stuck
their cell phones right up against their ears.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers who engaged in cell phone conversations missed twice as
many simulated traffic signals as when they weren't talking, and took
longer to react to the signals they did detect. Researchers conclude
that it's not how the phone is used but the mental distraction of
doing two things at once -- conversing and driving -- that causes the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   But those who work in the wireless industry say the array of
hands-free devices will continue to multiply and their popularity
will grow.</TE>
<TE>   "Sales figures are hard to come by, because there are so many
variations," says Ray Jodoin, group manager and principal analyst for
wireless communication for In-Stat/MDR in Scottsdale, Ariz., a market
research arm of Reed Business Information.</TE>
<TE>   But he's confident for several reasons that the growth of
hands-free cellular helpers will continue.</TE>
<TE>   First, he said, "it will be legislated into growth." That could be
slow growth he's talking about, though New York is the only state
that prohibits hand-held cell phone use by drivers while allowing
hands-free devices, according to Matt Sundeen, research analyst with
the National Conference of State Legislatures.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey is considering making hands-free devices mandatory, and
other states have imposed restrictions such as requiring school bus
drivers or younger drivers to use only hands-free devices.</TE>
<TE>   In California, legislation addressing cell phone restrictions has
failed several times to make it out of the Assembly Transportation
Committee over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Jodoin said, hands-free devices are "increasingly
being integrated into cars," mainly luxury models.</TE>
<TE>   And some phone manufacturers are packaging inexpensive hands-free
earpieces with their phones.</TE>
<TE>   So faced with the inevitable, we picked several of these devices
from the multitude of options out there and road tested them. They
ranged widely in price and sophistication. The results:</TE>
<TE>   * Body Glove Earglove Mini (About $20; [800] 945-4545;
www.fellowes.com) is for fashionista motorists.</TE>
<TE>   A one-touch button in the earpiece lets you answer, end and mute
calls. A trio of interchangeable earpiece clips -- in silver, blue
and burnt orange -- is included.</TE>
<TE>   Road test: Sound quality is acceptable, but the earpiece is pure
torture.</TE>
<TE>   * Body Glove Earglove (About $25; [800] 945-4545; www
.fellowes.com) is a larger and more comfortable version of the mini.
Three interchangeable neoprene earpiece covers are included.</TE>
<TE>   Road test: Sound transmission and pickup are OK, and the padded
ear hook makes wearing it while driving a lot more comfortable than
the mini version.</TE>
<TE>   * Jabra EarBud Lanyard (About $20; [800] EAR-2230; www.jabra.com)
is a combination earpiece and phone holder that allows the phone to
hang from your neck. Before inserting the ear bud, you pick from an
assortment of ear gel pieces (small, medium or large, for use in
either ear), depending on the size of your ear canal.</TE>
<TE>   Road test: Microphone pickup is good and the earpiece, if sized
correctly, is truly comfortable. The lanyard seems a little flimsy,
but the phone stays in place.</TE>
<TE>   * Jabra EarBoom Winder (About $35; [800] EAR-2230; www.jabra .com)
is billed as a tangle-free system. The retractable cord is stored in
a black device about half the size of a pager, which clips to your
belt, purse or pocket. At the end of the cord are the mini-boom
microphone and the ear bud. An assortment of ear gels is included.
The cord retracts with the touch of a button.</TE>
<TE>   Road test: Lives up to its tangle-free promise. The microphone
picks up even if it's not positioned perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   * Plantronics' Cellular Headset M206-N2 (About $45; [800]
544-4660; www.plantronics.com) claims to have an "ultra-light,
compact ear bud," but it isn't nearly as comfortable as the Jabra
models' ear gel pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Road test: The earpiece feels as if it is falling out of the ear
much of the time. There's a one-touch answer/end call button on the
cord, plus a volume control, and sound quality is good, but overall
the unit isn't worth the price.</TE>
<TE>   * The Sharper Image Car Cell Phone System (About $60; [800]
344-5555; www.sharperimage .com) is a cradle that plugs into your car
lighter or accessory jack. Once the device is in place, you can
record a memo or part of a phone conversation and then play it back.
That's handy for taking down a phone number or directions. The
microphone is on an adjustable stalk on the left side of the cradle.</TE>
<TE>   Road test: Sharper Image was unable to provide a test unit that
worked properly, so we can't comment on sound quality. But note that
with this unit or its competitors, the location of the lighter or
accessory socket is quite important. In many cases, the unit gets in
the way of the gear shift. And unless you have voice-activated
dialing for your cell phone, hooking into a stationary device makes
it even more distracting to use than a hand-held cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   So should drivers use hands-free devices? We polled
representatives of the major safety groups and found that few have
taken an official stand. Most say the topic is being researched.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no official
position on hands-free cell phone use while driving, spokesman Tim
Hurd says. NHTSA research into distractions from cell phones and the
effect on driving is ongoing, he said. Hurd's advice? "Take care of
any distractions before driving. Obey the law of your state."</TE>
<TE>   The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety's position is that
"hands-free is not risk-free," spokeswoman Stephanie Faul says. "Do
not think the risk goes away because you are using hands-free
[devices]. Plenty of research suggests it's the conversation" that
distracts.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, she says, a hands-free device should be voice-activated,
so the driver doesn't have to look away from the road to punch in
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Even with hands-free devices, she adds, drivers with cell phones
should always be prepared to hang up and focus on driving.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Kantowitz, director of the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute and a veteran researcher of driver
distraction issues, says that he's found it's "not really much better
to use hands-free."</TE>
<TE>   Any kind of cell phone is dangerous and should not be used by the
driver of a moving vehicle, Kantowitz says. "Eyes on the road is not
sufficient unless your mind is also on the road."</TE>

<HD>Changes in design are reducing whiplash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New car seat and head restraint designs such as those used by Saab
and some General Motors brands are dramatically reducing the
frequency and severity of neck injuries caused by rear-end crashes,
insurance industry researchers say.</LD>
<LD>   A study of accident data by the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety shows that occupants of cars equipped with the most effective
of the new head restraint and seat designs are injured about half as
often as occupants of the same models of cars with older-style head
restraints.</LD>
<LD>   The industry-funded institute says its study is the first to
compare performance of old- and new-style head restraints using
actual crash report data.</LD>
<TE>   The key to reducing whiplash injury in rear-end crashes is to keep
the vehicle occupants' heads and bodies moving in the same direction.</TE>
<TE>   New seats and head restraints are being engineered to reduce
so-called differential motion when the force of a rear crash snaps
the head one way, while the torso moves the opposite way.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the new designs reviewed by the institute use a fixed
system that places the head restraint higher and closer to the backs
of occupants' heads for better cushioning in the event a car is hit
from the rear.</TE>
<TE>   Another system, by Saab, has active head restraints in which a
mechanism pushes the restraint up and toward the back of the head as
the occupant's torso sinks into the seat during a rear-end crash.</TE>
<TE>   Some General Motors and Nissan models use the same system, the
institute says.</TE>
<TE>   A third type of system studied is used by Volvo and Toyota. The
companies' engineers designed seat backs that yield in rear-end
crashes to reduce forward acceleration of occupants' torsos.</TE>
<TE>   The institute lauded Volvo for including well-designed and
well-located head restraints with its seats, but said one of the
three Toyota models studied did not have a well-placed headrest.</TE>
<TE>   A trio of major insurance companies -- Nationwide, Progressive and
State Farm -- supplied the data, which cover 2,641 claims. The study
looked at injury data in same-model cars with and without the new
systems: Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable models were the test models
for fixed restraints; Volvo S70s and various Toyota and Lexus models
for seat-back systems; and Saab, GM and Nissan models for active
restraints.</TE>
<TE>   "There's evidence that many of the new designs are working. In
some cases, the reductions in insurance claims for neck injuries are
dramatic," said Adrian Lund, chief operating officer for the
Insurance Institute and an author of the research report.</TE>
<TE>   The study found a 43% reduction in neck injury claim rates for the
Saab, General Motors and Nissan models with active head restraints,
compared with rates for accidents involving similar cars built before
the restraints were introduced.</TE>
<TE>   Volvos and Fords with new systems also yielded claim reductions,
but there weren't enough models in the study to make the findings
meaningful, Lund said.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota results also suffered from lack of data, Lund said.</TE>
<TE>   The study actually found a slight increase in injury claims for
Toyota and Lexus models with the company's new system, but Lund said
that the institute is working with Toyota "to get a better
understanding of the results" and to see if newer designs will result
in fewer claims.</TE>

<LD>Rare is the Southern California motorist who hasn't been frustrated

phone-using driver in the next lane.</LD>
<LD>   We usually vent our spleen in verbiage too colorful for these
pages.</LD>
<LD>   But a fellow automotive scribe -- Tom Murphy, senior editor of
Ward's AutoWorld magazine and an accomplished guitarist and
songwriter for a Detroit-area band, the Exhaust Tones -- has written
a mostly printable anthem for those of us who wish cell phone use
while driving would be punishable by banishment to the Iraqi desert,
at least. Here are some of the lyrics.</LD>

<HD>Clear need for response to fatal fog</HD>
<DH>Sensor systems could ease the toll of horrific crashes amid
road-obscuring weather conditions on highways in California and
elsewhere</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Vartabedian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rushing through zero-visibility fog at 70 miles per hour is about as
risky as closing your eyes on the freeway for kicks.</LD>
<LD>   It amounts to a death wish, but it is what thousands of motorists
do every year when they encounter fog. The result: horrific crashes
that are by far the most deadly events that occur on the highway.</LD>
<LD>   The problem was illustrated this month when 30 cars ended up in a
pile of twisted and burnt wreckage in a dense fog along Interstate 43
in Wisconsin. Rescue workers pulled 10 bodies from the wrecks and
three dozen people were injured in the worst crash in the state's
history.</LD>
<TE>   After a day of digging through the wreckage, state troopers,
already stunned by the horror of the scene, found an additional six
cars they hadn't known about.</TE>
<TE>   Road-obscuring fog occurs throughout the country, but it is
particularly deadly in California's Central Valley. Earlier this
year, 77 vehicles rammed into one another on California 58 about 90
miles north of Los Angeles. Luckily, only one person was killed.</TE>
<TE>   And a dust storm north of Coalinga in November 1991 caused a
104-vehicle pileup that left 17 dead and 151 injured. Because
visibility conditions are similar in fog and dust storms, the
California Highway Patrol created a special fog committee after the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California is not immune. Last year, 14 accidents that
involved 43 cars and trucks occurred in dense fog along Interstate
215 in Perris. Nearly a dozen people were hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear why people badly misjudge the dangers of driving
in fog. Despite the human toll, it has received little study at the
national level. The two federal agencies that deal with auto and
highway safety say they have not studied the problem and do not
consider it within their areas of interest.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in fact,
referred questions to the Federal Highway Administration, while
officials at that agency said it was the responsibility of NHTSA.</TE>
<TE>   The only government agencies that seem to be doing any thinking
about the problem are state highway patrols.</TE>
<TE>   Is fog on the highways a big problem? You bet.</TE>
<TE>   An examination of the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, the
database of all fatal accidents in this country, shows that foggy
conditions were cited by police in 1,387 highway deaths in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The deaths occurred in 548 crashes, meaning that more than two
people died, on average, in every crash. That tells you these are
violent, high-speed impacts.</TE>
<TE>   The question is, can anything be done to prevent such crashes?</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol, which frequently deals with
fog-related accidents, says drivers misjudge speed and stopping
distances in fog, according to Sgt. Ted Eichman, chairman of the
CHP's Central Valley Fog Committee. "It isn't the fog that causes the
accidents. It's the speed," Eichman said.</TE>
<TE>   In mild fog, for example, visibility can be reduced to 100 feet,
but people often drive at 55 mph, which is too fast to respond to
something blocking the road ahead.</TE>
<TE>   At 55 mph, the typical motorist needs 121 feet -- a distance
covered in slightly more than a second -- to perceive a threat and
hit the brake pedal, and 144 feet more to come to a stop. The total
of 265 feet is more than twice the 100 feet of visibility, meaning
that the car would crash into an obstacle at a fairly high speed of
perhaps more than 30 mph.</TE>
<TE>   But what breakdown in judgment occurs in fog?</TE>
<TE>   Very seldom does alcohol play a role in these crashes. Wisconsin
troopers told The Times they did not believe that any of the
motorists involved in the crash this month were alcohol-impaired.</TE>
<TE>   Research from the University of Wales indicates that drivers tend
to underestimate their true speed and go faster the foggier it gets.
When asked in laboratory experiments to drive at 112 kilometers per
hour, subjects actually drove at 150 kph in fog, 140 kph in misty
conditions and 130 in clear conditions.</TE>
<TE>   One theory is that people have difficulty judging movement when
there is low contrast, typical of fog.</TE>
<TE>   But nobody is going to re-engineer the human vision system.
Solutions must be found elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1991 California crash, the CHP began a program to lead
convoys of vehicles through fog.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the CHP shuts down affected interstates altogether,
though the drawback is that traffic is routed onto equally foggy
country roads that can be even more deadly.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee began looking into more active accident prevention
systems after a 1990 chain-reaction collision involving 99 vehicles.
It put a fog detection and warning system along Interstate 75. A
central computer is fed data from fog detectors and vehicle speed
detectors. It can alert state traffic managers when fog and vehicle
speeds are reaching lethal levels, allowing the activation of
roadside warning signs and the use of highway patrols to slow
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   But I wonder why the intelligence can't be put on-board the
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   A visibility sensor on the front end of a car could tie into the
main control module for the engine, which already knows the car's
speed. A simple program could determine if a car is going too fast
for a given visibility condition. If that's the case, a warning could
be sounded. It might be an annoyance, but it would be making
calculations that few drivers are capable of doing by the seat of
their pants. It might even be worth considering allowing such a
system to automatically slow the engine.</TE>
<TE>   Visibility sensor systems already are used to activate headlights,
reducing the number of vehicles traveling at dusk with their lights
off. The systems do not allow drivers to turn off the headlights in
the dark.</TE>
<TE>   If federal officials cared about this problem a bit more, maybe
all the weight of prevention would not be falling on the highway
patrols across the country.</TE>

<HD>The temptation is back</HD>
<DH>Washington apples are sweet, juicy and crisp again. And
they're not Red Delicious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Green</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wenatchee, Wash.</LD>
<LD>   Walk into the gift shop of the Washington State Apple Commission,
and you see red. Just about everything carries a Red Delicious motif.
There are Red Delicious postcards, Red Delicious doormats, Red
Delicious T-shirts, even images of Red Delicious apples erupting out
of American flags.</LD>
<LD>   Yet leave the commission, tour the surrounding countryside, and
farmers are firing up their buzz saws, felling and burning Red
Delicious orchards as fast as they can raise the money to replant
them. During the last four years, some 60,000 acres of Red Delicious
have been replaced with new varieties that don't just look nice, they
taste good. Sweetness, spice, juiciness and a rowdy autumn crunch
have all returned to Washington apples.</LD>
<TE>   We weren't wrong to think that these qualities were lost. For the
better part of 20 years, from the early 1970s to the late '80s,
apples fell from paradise. Good apples became so rare that some of us
wondered if we'd imagined the spicy and bright fruit of our
childhoods. We hadn't. New Yorkers really had developed a passion for
the almost painfully tart Winesaps, Missourians loved the sweet
Jonathans, Northern Californians the heady, old world aromatics of
Gravensteins.</TE>
<TE>   Those who knew the original Delicious apple before it became
unrecognizably red and the emblem of every packing house in
Washington, even missed that. Originally called the Hawkeye, this
real Delicious came out of Iowa, where a farmer failed to kill it
after accidentally mowing it down several times. It was subsequently
picked up by a prominent nursery, declared to be Delicious, and
heavily promoted in the newly developing western apple regions as the
Next Big Thing.</TE>
<TE>   And it was a very respectable apple, says Washington State
University flavor chemist John Fellman. He and Preston Andrews, a WSU
horticulturist, lead a tour of the university's research orchard,
where more than 100 historic varieties of apples grow. Locals pay to
pick their own here. It may be the only pick-your-own orchard selling
Yellow Newtowns, the type that Ben Franklin had shipped to himself in
London. Fellman plucks a striped apple with a faintly yellow
background and tosses it to me.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a Red Delicious," he says. It sure doesn't look like one.
Red Delicious apples, explains Fellman, were not always so deeply,
uniformly red. I bite it. It's sweet, with firm almost-cream-colored
flesh with good perfume.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the commodity fruit known as Red Delicious are
"sports," says Fellman, mutations promoted in an unending quest for
redness. Packing houses grade by color, and began offering premiums
for the reddest specimens. Sharp-eyed farmers spotted branches
bearing particularly red fruit and propogated them. Eventually more
than 100 sports were developed into the red, redder and reddest
commercial varieties that we know today.</TE>
<TE>   As the Red Delicious started looking less like itself and more
like something out of "Snow White," Fellman began studying the
pigments and found the darker they got, the more bitter the skin. He
warned apple producers, but they didn't listen. The line from packers
was: They'd never had a box of apples returned because they didn't
taste good.</TE>
<TE>   The New Zealand invasion</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1980s, the industry had just about every
horticulturalist in Washington worried sick. The state's leading farm
advisor, Kathleen Willemsen, alerted them to a wave of new varieties
from New Zealand appearing in supermarkets. These imports were even
selling in Washington. Even out of cold store, their scent and snap
awoke dormant memories of good eating apples.</TE>
<TE>   Willemsen was impressed by the new breeds, and went to New Zealand
to study them. The Braeburns were tart, a sharp reminder of apples
past for Winesap lovers, while the Gala was an aromatic cross between
the perfectly luscious yellow American apple, the Golden Delicious,
and the most revered aromatic apple of England, the English Cox
Orange Pippin. She pointed to the island nation raiding their
markets. The Red Delicious growers ignored her.</TE>
<TE>   By 1998, after 10 years of the New Zealand incursion, WSU
horticulturalist Bruce Barritt was beside himself with frustration at
the growers. He railed that if they didn't start breeding for taste,
for the eating pleasure of consumers, they would be out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Almost instantly, he was proven right. At the time, 60% of the
state's apple crop was devoted to Red Delicious. A third of
Washington production went to the Far East. The Asian market
collapsed and more than 20% of Washington apple growers were swept
away.</TE>
<TE>   A chastened, bruised industry came to Barritt. The state clearly
needed new apples, tasty ones, but the most extensive breeding
program was 3,000 miles away, at Cornell University in Geneva, N.Y.
This research station had already given the world a succession of new
apples, including the Empire and the highly regarded Jonagold.
Barritt's dream for Washington growers was the Northwest equivalent
of a Jonagold, a calling card fruit for the apple state.</TE>
<TE>   In the last four years, Barritt has planted more than 15,000
seedlings outside the USDA offices in Wenatchee in a sort of star
search for fruit. The morning he meets me, he's in a hurry. He's got
a tour coming shortly. That, and "We're 25 years behind!" he cries.</TE>
<TE>   Charging down a row of a test orchard, Barritt picks red apples,
yellow apples, gold apples, crimson apples, orange apples, taking a
bite from each. He doesn't like any of them. "Ah, tough! It's a
spitter!" he cries at the worst.</TE>
<TE>   Inside his lab, tables are covered with trays of apples, dozens of
them, each with tags next to them, and most with bites missing. Two
technicians are busy biting, spitting and scoring each apple. On
their clipboard check sheets there are grades for appearance, from
"ugly" to "beautiful," eating quality from "yuck" to "outstanding,"
and overall score from "reject" to "advance to stage 2". Barritt
gives me several to taste. There are apples that taste like bananas,
like pears, like anise. The last one is as acidic as a lime. He knows
it. It's a trick. He erupts in laughter.</TE>
<TE>   What they're looking for is an apple that has it all: perfume,
crispness, juiciness, color and disease resistance.</TE>
<TE>   From 15,000 seedlings, he says, "We might get 150 that are
reasonable. From those, there might be one that will someday go into
production." Even fast-tracked, a new apple won't come out of
Washington for 10 to 15 years. You realize that apple breeding is the
fruit equivalent of having tens of thousands of children until you
produce a Mozart.</TE>
<TE>   New varieties take root</TE>
<TE>   As Washington plays catch-up with rival breeders, its farmers are
already searching for flavor. Ray Fuller has been looking to Canada,
to the sweet Ambrosias bred there, and to Minnesota, to their
Honeycrisps, to see if these sweet apples with a Fuji-like snap might
do well for him. Fuller is a second-generation apple farmer with 100
acres in the north of the state, above Lake Chelan. He was brought up
in the Red Delicious school. But when he began to manage the family
farm in 1979, he decided the best way to preserve it was to
modernize. In 1983, three years before the Alar scare and 15 years
before the organic vogue, Fuller converted the farm to organic.</TE>
<TE>   Next he started ripping out Red Delicious and putting in apples
that would ripen in sweet succession: Gingergold in August, Gala in
early September, then Ambrosia, and Honeycrisp through mid-October.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller dispensed with old planting systems, in which 109 trees
were planted per acre, spaced widely, allowed to grow tall. These
looked pretty, but took forever to bear fruit and were difficult to
pick. He moved to intensive espalier systems on dwarf rootstocks,
where the trees look more like hops than apples.</TE>
<TE>   The cost? "Horrendous," says Fuller. University guides put them at
$12,000 to $17,000 an acre. This year, as his trees finally start
yielding, after three years of losses, he hopes to make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller is also proud of his packing house, Stemilt, one of the few
in the state to run a dedicated line for organic apples. At dawn the
next day, Stemilt sales manager Roger Pepperl offers a tour of the
main plant, a virtual city consisting of water washes, conveyor
belts, grading tables. Here apples are washed, pre-graded, washed
again, rinsed, dried, polished. Apples rolling along conveyor belts
are graded for variety, then size, then color.</TE>
<TE>   There is even a new gizmo that shoots halogen into apples to
determine their sweetness and freshness. This machine isn't just the
talk of greater Wenatchee: Cornell apple breeder Susan Brown says if
this machine is adopted as an industry standard, it could make the
mealy apple a thing of the past.</TE>
<TE>   The science of the bite</TE>
<TE>   One hundred miles south, in Yakima, Allan Bros. is typical of
future firms: packer-farmers. The company is run by George and David
Allan, then a posse of Allan sons and cousins. Between the small army
of Allans, they have 700 trees. Ten years ago, they were nearly all
Red Delicous. Now, all but 20% have been replaced with Gala,
Braeburn, Granny Smith, Golden Delicious. They're on the verge of
paying license fees to grow brand new varieties coming out of New
Zealand called Pacific Rose and Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   On the packing line, David Allan shows how the packhouse stickers
will soon identify the farmer, harvest date, pack date, sugar level.
"If an apple's bad, even though we're thousands of miles away,
consumers will be able to find us," says Todd Allan. "There'll be
nowhere to hide."</TE>
<TE>   In a laboratory off the main plant, quality control technician
Alicia Sambrano demonstrates another tool used to test every batch of
apples. This measures the puncture force of apples, or firmness, and
predicts how long the apples will do well in cold storage. The
machine even comes with a tooth-shaped attachment to calculate the
bite force required to crack a fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Around in the main office, the cold stores are run by computer. A
click of a mouse and the warehouse manager can check the temperature
and oxygen levels in each warehouse, as oxygen is withdrawn to slow
ripening and temperature lowered to just above freezing. This ability
to "put apples to sleep" dates back to 1920s England, but the
technology to control the conditions exactly is new. As a result,
apples aren't just better, they're fabulous now and remarkably good
in December, January and right through to strawberry season.</TE>
<TE>   Technology cannot eliminate ripening, warns Fellman. Just postpone
it. For the best apple eating, get the Galas now, while their perfume
is fresh. Other apples, including Pink Ladies and Fujis, regain
fragrance when they emerge from cold store.</TE>
<TE>   The trick to having good apples at home is more cold storage. From
Cornell, Susan Brown puts it this way: "Apples look pretty in a bowl
on the table, but they taste better from the fridge."</TE>
<TE>   After half a century of cardboard apples, the flavor is the thing.</TE>

<TE>   Dumplings with medjool dates and maple sauce</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 2 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8</TE>
<TE>   Note: From "Tom Douglas' Seattle Kitchen (William Morrow, 2000).</TE>
<TE>   Date butter</TE>
<TE>   9large medjool or other dates (about 6 ounces), pitted and chopped</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   1. Combine the dates, butter, brown sugar and cinnamon in a food
processor or mixer. Process until smooth. Remove the date butter to a
small bowl and refrigerate until somewhat firm.</TE>
<TE>   Pastry dough</TE>
<TE>   3 3/4 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, cold, cut into bits</TE>
<TE>   9-12 tablespoons ice water</TE>
<TE>   1. Place the flour, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food
processor. Pulse to mix. Add the cold butter all at once and pulse a
few times until the butter and flour form crumbs. Start adding ice
water, a tablespoon at a time, pulsing each time. Use as much water
as needed for the dough to hold together when a clump is gently
pressed between your fingers. The dough will be quite loose in the
processor. Dump the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap.
Gather the dough together using the plastic wrap and force it into a
flattened round. Chill the dough an hour or longer before rolling
out.</TE>
<TE>   Apple dumplings</TE>
<TE>   Pastry dough</TE>
<TE>   Flour, for rolling</TE>
<TE>   4 Granny Smith apples (about 7 ounces each) peeled, and halved
lengthwise</TE>
<TE>   Apple butter</TE>
<TE>   1 egg yolk</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Set out a small bowl of water and
a pastry brush. Divide the pastry dough in half. On a lightly floured
surface, roll out half the dough about 1/8-inch thick into a rough
square shape. Trim the dough to make a 12-inch square; set the
trimmings aside. Cut the square into 4 (6-inch) squares. Take each
square and make a cut from each corner halfway to the center of the
square. Repeat with the second half of the dough. You will have 8
(6-inch) squares.</TE>
<TE>   2. Use a melon baller to remove the core of each apple half. Fill
the cavity of each apple half with a mound of the date butter. Place
each apple half, core side down, on the center of a dough square.
Brush the corners of the dough lightly with water. Fold each corner
into the center and press together to seal. Place the dumplings on a
parchment-lined baking sheet.</TE>
<TE>   3. Reroll the pastry trimmings, if you'd like, and cut out 8
leaves using a small knife or cutter. Place one on each dumpling,
fixing it on with a brush dipped in a little water.</TE>
<TE>   4. Beat the egg yolk lightly with the cream. Brush each dumpling
with egg wash. In another small bowl, mix the sugar and cinnamon and
sprinkle 1 or 2 teaspoons on each dumpling. Bake the dumplings until
the pastry is golden and the apples feel tender when pierced with a
knife, about 25 minutes; rotate the baking sheet halfway through.
Place the dumplings on plates and spoon warm maple sauce over and
around them.</TE>
<TE>   Maple sauce</TE>
<TE>   1 cup water</TE>
<TE>   1 cinnamon stick</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup pure maple syrup</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cold</TE>
<TE>   1. Bring the water and cinnamon stick to a boil in a small
saucepan over high heat.</TE>
<TE>   2. Combine the brown sugar and the cornstarch in a small bowl and
add to the boiling water. Lower the heat and simmer, whisking
occasionally until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from
the heat and add the syrup and butter, stirring until the butter
melts. Remove the cinnamon stick before serving. Serve warm.</TE>

<TE>   Total time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   Note: This is also from "Tom Douglas' Seattle Kitchen." Any number
of apples, from crab apples to Braeburns, will work. Pairing apples
with parsnips brings out the earthy sugars of the root vegetable.
Serve with roast duck, or grilled pork chops and hot-sweet mustard.</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup diced bacon (about 2 ounces)</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   1 small onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice (about 1 cup)</TE>
<TE>   3 parsnips, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 2 2/3 cups)</TE>
<TE>   1 apple, peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 1 1/4
cups)</TE>
<TE>   1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch dice (about 1 cup)</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   Coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1. Brown the bacon until crisp in a large frying pan over
medium-high heat, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon and set aside,
leaving the bacon fat in the pan.</TE>
<TE>   2. Add the butter and onion and cook, stirring, until translucent,
about 2 minutes. Add the parsnips, cover and cook, stirring
frequently, until soft, about 10 minutes. Uncover and continue to
cook until golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Add the apple, bell pepper and thyme and continue to cook,
stirring, until they caramelize a bit, about 5 minutes. Stir in the
reserved bacon, season to taste with salt and pepper and serve hot.</TE>

<TE>   Apple tarts</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 6</TE>
<TE>   Note: This recipe is from chef Simon Hopkinson at Bibendum
restaurant in London. Serve it straight from the oven with vanilla
ice cream. If using professional-style puff pastry, you'll need 1
sheet. You'll need 2 sheets of grocery-store puff pastry.</TE>
<TE>   1-2 sheets puff pastry</TE>
<TE>   2Granny Smith apples</TE>
<TE>   Juice from 1/2-1 lemon</TE>
<TE>   Dash salt</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1. If using professional-style frozen puff pastry, thaw a few
minutes, then roll out to about 1/8-inch thick. If using commercial
frozen puff pastry, allow to thaw up to 1 hour before rolling. Cut
the pastry into 6 (5-inch) rounds and place onto a baking sheet lined
with parchment paper.</TE>
<TE>   2. Cut the stem end and bottom off each apple. (Do not peel.)
Stand the apples up and cut them in half vertically; you'll need 3
halves. Core the halves, then very thinly slice each into
half-circles about 1/16-inch thick. A mandoline works well. Cut the
half-circles in half to form triangles.</TE>
<TE>   3. Combine the lemon juice and salt and brush on the apples to
prevent discoloring. Arrange the slices on top of the pastry in a
petal formation, starting 1/2 inch from the edge and working toward
the center. Using a sharp knife, score the edge of the pastry
1/2-inch in from the edge about 1/16-inch deep. Brush the tarts
liberally with the melted butter. Sprinkle the sugar over the top.
Refrigerate the tarts 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   4. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 400 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   5. Bake the tarts on the upper rack, about 6 inches from the
heating element, until the pastry is golden and puffed and the apples
are slightly browned around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes. Keep an eye
on them toward the end so that they don't burn. Serve immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Each serving: 107 calories; 51 mg. sodium; 16 mg. cholesterol; 5
grams fat; 4 grams saturated fat; 15 grams carbohydrates; 0 protein;
1 gram fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Variation: To make one large tart, roll the puff pastry into a 10-
to 11-inch round about 1/8-inch thick. You'll need 2 apples; prepare
them as for the small tarts, only do not cut the half-circles in
half. Arrange the half-circles in a petal formation on the pastry and
score the edges in the same manner. Top with the melted butter and
sugar as directed, and bake until the pastry is golden and puffed, 15
to 20 minutes. Use a large, sharp knife to cut into slices.</TE>

<LD>There's more to Washington apples than all those pedigree fruit
names. There's color, acidity and style. Here are some pointers for
selecting from the leading varieties being grown in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Braeburn: chance seedling of a Lady Hamilton apple from
New Zealand, red stripes over a yellow-green background, excellent
balance of sugar and acid.</LD>
<LD>   Golden Delicious: West Virginian, at its best gold, not green,
big, round, sweet and honeyed.</LD>
<TE>   Granny Smith: small, hard, green Australian apple. Best for
cooking.</TE>
<TE>   Fuji: Japanese apple bred from American Ralls Janet and Red
Delicious. Red on green gives a brownish tint, ultra sweet, crisp,
pronounced by Washington apple pioneer Grady Auvil "an apple that
even grocers can't ruin."</TE>
<TE>   Jonagold: Released by Cornell University in 1968, a cross of
Golden Delicious and Jonathan. Orange and red over gold. Sweet,
honeyed, crisp with a spicy aroma. Revered in Europe and Asia as a
sublime dessert apple. When the breeder went to Japan, he was given a
parade.</TE>
<TE>   Pink Lady: pleasantly tart, crisp, large Australian apple,
pink over a gold background, cross of Granny Smith and Lady Williams. A
good baking apple.</TE>
<TE>   Red Delicious: Iowan apple, at its best from farmers markets and
good stores, striped red on yellow background, sweet, aromatic
cream-colored flesh. At its worst, dark red, bitter-skinned, woody.</TE>

<KH>RESTAURANTS /  COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: AFRICA</KH>
<HD>The view from Mt. Kenya</HD>
<DH>Ngomo brings together a range of African dishes with a
touch of refinement. Its menu is as carefully conceived as its
stylish dining room.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Burum</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BETWEEN the rose and turquoise swirls of the El Rey Theatre sign up
the street and the neon pulsing drums over the Conga Room next door,
it's easy to miss Ngoma. But this modest little place, probably the
only Pan-African restaurant in L.A. at the moment, has been drawing
African expats to the revitalized Miracle Mile for more than a year.</LD>
<LD>   The soundtrack is Zairian Soukous, South African Kwaito and other
Afro/hip-hop blends, played softly during meals. After 10 p.m. on
Saturdays, a disc jockey cranks up the volume for dancing, but for
the rest of the time, Ngoma is merely an expensive, though vibrant,
place for serious dining.</LD>
<LD>   Early one evening, as servers were inserting carefully folded
napkins into rings carved to look like hippos and zebras, I had time
to study the place. With African folk art placed strategically on
sponged ochre walls, it has the luxurious look of a Kenyan wildlife
lodge, rather than the funky travel poster feel of many ethnic
restaurants.</LD>
<TE>   Like the decor, the food turned out to be stylishly and caringly
conceived. Before our meal, a waitress came by to wash our hands. In
a soothing ritual, she poured water in a stream from a huge gourd --
an essential task, since fingers are the utensils of choice for many
African diners (although the tables are set with cutlery).</TE>
<TE>   Mostly the restaurant serves traditional dishes refined for
international tastes, along the lines of the recipes in Time-Life's
"African Cooking." Safari salad, with jungle dressing, however,
matches its fantasy name. It's a bowl of baby lettuces and cut fruit
in a sparkling grated coconut-garlic dressing. I wouldn't look for it
at an outdoor market in Zaire, but it makes a refreshing preface to
Ngoma's main dishes.</TE>
<TE>   In the African manner, carbohydrates are really the center of the
meal. Almost anything you order will be accompanied by substantial
quantities of a starch such as matoke (mashed green banana), ugali
(white cornmeal mush) or fufu (mashed cassava root), which will
arrive molded into a dome that calls to mind the Griffith
Observatory. You're supposed to roll some into a walnut-sized ball
and use it to scoop food up.</TE>
<TE>   Some West African dishes are seasoned with dried fish, which gives
them a flavor that may need acquiring a taste for. I'm thinking in
particular of egusi soup, a mole-like puree of melon seeds, and
ogbono, a somewhat glutinous soup studded with meat chunks.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, mafe (chicken or lamb in a peanut sauce) and
poulet yassa (lemon-marinated chicken) have universal appeal. The
chicken dishes can pose a slight problem if you're eating with your
hands -- it's not easy to break chunks of meat from a thigh in polite
company. Fortunately, there's the cutlery alternative.</TE>
<TE>   From East Africa come chicken and beef stews served with
pastry-rich flatbread (chapati) or irio, a dish of mashed potatoes
and corn dotted with fresh peas. With most entrees you choose a side
dish such as spinach or collard greens -- cut thin and sauteed with
tiny flecks of tomato.</TE>
<TE>   There's an intriguing list of vegetarian choices. In black-eyed
peas in coconut sauce with collard greens or the jambalaya-like
jollof rice, you can see the roots of soul food on your plate.</TE>
<TE>   From the extensive drink list come two acceptable South African
wines and a handful of African and European beers. I'm partial to the
homemade ginger root juice, though. It's a powerful infusion of fresh
ginger.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the dishes make an appearance on the Power Lunch Buffet.
This is a great way to taste a range of dishes (for only $6.95),
though they'll lack the beautiful presentation that makes Ngoma stand
out.</TE>
<TE>   For dessert you'll want coupe Mount Kenya. It's three dainty
scoops of barely sweet mango sherbet, luxuriating under chunks of
pineapple that's had a long soaking in good rum. You may have come to
explore Africa's food, but end your meal as it began, with an
armchair traveler's fantasy of African flavor.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>IT used to be hard to find restaurants that served decent wine by the
glass. Now a growing number are practically turning into tasting
rooms.</LD>
<LD>   A diverse list of dining spots -- from Mako and Zax to Jer-ne at
the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey and Asia de Cuba in the Mondrian
-- are offering "flights" of wine on their dining room and bar menus.</LD>
<LD>   At these restaurants, a flight is small pours of three to five
interesting wines or sakes. It's an ideal way to taste and compare
the wines in the way that's most telling -- with food.</LD>
<TE>   For example, at Axe, an intimate spot on Abbot Kinney Boulevard in
Venice, the flight menu changes every few days and costs about $10
for a tasting of four or five wines.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps you'll sample a French white Burgundy and a Blaufrankisch
from Napa Valley and pair them with a little plate of artisanal
cheeses.</TE>
<TE>   Across town in West Hollywood, the bustling Koi serves sake
flights through the night. A flight of three 4-ounce pours begins at
$14.</TE>
<TE>   At dimly lighted Asia de Cuba, the wines (four to a flight) are
served in 2-ounce glasses.</TE>
<TE>   There are five choices: whites from around the world, California
reds, Pinot Noirs, Chardonnays or dessert wines (which are 1-ounce
pours).</TE>
<TE>   All are $16.</TE>
<TE>   For serious mixing and matching, pair with a few of the
mini-appetizers called shooters, such as diver scallop ceviche.</TE>
<TE>   *Feeding the growing appetite for a raw diet</TE>
<TE>   Before there was Roxanne, there was Juliano.</TE>
<TE>   And now the 30-year-old pioneer of the vegetarian raw food
movement is set to open a restaurant, Raw in Santa Monica, and is
launching a supermarket line of packaged raw foods.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of the raw diet believe that food heated beyond 118
degrees loses nutrients, and so they produce dishes such as pizza or
pad Thai using dehydration and pulverizing techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Juliano Broitman, who is known simply as Juliano, has been
following a raw diet for eight years, holding raw food "raves" and
catering raw food parties, as well as having written "Raw: the Uncook
Book" (Regan Books, 1999).</TE>
<TE>   Now his Juliano Raw line of prepared foods including eggless egg
salad and mock salmon pate will be introduced at Trader Joe's, Whole
Foods Market and Costco in mid-December.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant is scheduled to open in December at 609 Broadway.
The menu will feature "raw comfort food," he says, including
cheeseburgers and pancakes with cream and syrup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Small bites</TE>
<TE>   Brooke Williamson, the 24-year-old wunderkind of L.A. dining, is
leaving Zax, the new American spot in Brentwood where she headed the
kitchen for two years. Williamson, who will depart in mid-December,
has not announced what's next.</TE>
<TE>   Sona, the long-awaited restaurant from David and Michelle Myers,
opens Tuesday. David Myers headed the kitchen at Jaan in Raffles'
L'Ermitage Hotel; Michelle Myers is former executive pastry chef at
Patina.</TE>
<TE>   Sona, 401 N. La Cienega Blvd., West Hollywood, (310) 659-7708.</TE>

<LD>Kudos to David Shaw for casting light on wine price markups in
restaurants ("What is this, a wine list or a stickup?" Oct. 16).</LD>
<LD>   Dining at a better steakhouse, my wife and I were dismayed to find
almost no reds in the $35 to $45 range, but a couple of dozen in the
$85 to $125 range. It seems only a few years ago we read that
restaurateurs were making concerted efforts to price wines more
affordably and there seemed to be evidence of that until recently.</LD>
<LD>   With a grape glut and tougher foreign and out-of-state
competition, California winemakers ought to get vocal on this issue.</LD>

<TE>   Icouldn't agree more with you on the subject of restaurant wine
gouging. We have a glass of wine at home and one by the glass at the
restaurant rather than buying a bottle of overpriced wine at the
restaurant.</TE>

<TE>   Ican't remember the last time I bought a bottle from California.
If California wineries want to limit their customer base to people in
top tax brackets, fine with me.</TE>
<TE>   I buy Italian, French, Chilean, Spanish, Australian and New
Zealand wines. I don't think I've spent more than $25 on a bottle in
years.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time I'm drinking $10 and $15 bottles, and very
happily.</TE>

<TE>   Restaurant pricing is bordering on ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   I find myself either skipping wine altogether or just ordering a
couple of glasses.</TE>
<TE>   I just can't pay $75 for something I can get for $25, or $150 for
a $60 bottle.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You got most of it right when you tied the ridiculously high wine
prices in restaurants to the old tradition that holds that the
restaurant needs to make the same percentage of profit on wine as it
does on booze.</TE>
<TE>   What is even more ridiculous in restaurants is paying 10 or 11
bucks for a martini, which is about an ounce and a half of vodka or
gin and thus amounts to paying over the course of a few visits to
that bar about $160 for a $15 bottle of gin/vodka.</TE>
<TE>   And people think wine prices are ludicrous.</TE>

<HD>Appearing live, on your plate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Russ Parsons</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You order sweet shrimp at Haneda Sushi &amp; Seafood restaurant in
Koreatown and the chef nods his acknowledgement. On the television
above the bar, ESPN is blasting baseball highlights. After a moment,
the chef hands you your dish: two shrimp tails wrapped around two
heads. You take the plate and the antennae start to wiggle. It's as
if they're waving hello, or, more appropriately, goodbye.</LD>
<LD>   Live seafood, available in better sushi bars for some time, is
increasing in popularity. It's not uncommon to find places selling
shrimp, abalone and lobster and sometimes even whole fish such as
halibut and sculpin that have been killed just before the chef slices
them raw onto the plate. Like those antennae, sometimes parts are
still moving when it reaches the table.</LD>
<LD>   And it's not something that's restricted to small restaurants in
insular ethnic communities. It's at Westside sushi places like
Matsuhisa and Nishimura as well. At the entrance to the popular Santa
Monica sushi bar called the Hump, there's a sign that reads,
"Warning! This sushi bar does prepare live sea food in full view, at
the counter."</LD>
<TE>   This live seafood is somewhat different than what you may be used
to. It's chewier and perhaps not quite as flavorful, and cut a little
thicker. But it represents the cutting edge of the sushi fanatics'
quest for the very best -- fish so fresh it might even slap back.
Connoisseurs appreciate the very best live abalone because of the way
the slices curl against your palate as you eat them.</TE>
<TE>   And while eating live food is nothing new -- consider the oyster
-- there is a difference when that aliveness is obvious rather than
theoretical.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, what's available in Southern California might seem mild
compared with some bars in Asia, which are built around massive pools
that hold swimming fish for customers to choose for their dinner, or
to the Korean delicacy of serving a bowl of tiny fish swimming in a
clear broth.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the trend does not sit well with everyone. In an editorial
for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals newsletter, Paula
Moore condemned customers at these restaurants as "bored
restaurantgoers who want something truly new and exciting.
Apparently, it's not enough that we eat all manner of dead animals
... now we have to eat live ones, too."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, aside from the most obvious cases, the presentation of
this live fish isn't really that different from that of more
run-of-the-mill sushi and sashimi. In fact, thrill-seekers may go
away from most places disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Usually everything is handled discreetly, obscured from view by
the frosted glass cases that circle the bar. The whole live food will
be presented to you for inspection, then reappear moments later
looking like a regular plate of sliced sushi. The point of the
exercise, it seems, is freshness, not frisson.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the case at the Hump, where diners have a full view of
the sushi chefs' artistry. They're not kidding about that sign. At
lunch one day, a chef reaches into a refrigerator behind the bar to
retrieve four Santa Barbara spot prawns. He quickly slices off the
heads, and begins to work peeling and de-veining the bodies. But
wait. Is that an antenna moving? It is. Then a couple of them are.
Then it's the front legs.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the bodies are presented on their tray, firm and sweet
and gleaming like carved alabaster, the severed heads are bouncing
about the cutting board like so many Mexican jumping beans. (Later,
these will be served as well, two of them stuffed and deep-fried, two
of them in a small bowl of beautifully sea-scented miso broth.)</TE>
<TE>   The whole thing may be a bit disquieting, but you have to admit it
is hard to find fish any fresher than this.</TE>
<TE>   "It's mainly the texture," says chef Shunji Nakao. "It's firm.
It's not exactly chewy and it's not crunchy, but it's something like
that."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the sign at the door, Nakao says the Hump hasn't had a
problem with any customers so far. "But you know, some people don't
like to look at it," he says. "Most people, though, when they come
in, they ask us what is good and when we tell them 'live shrimp,' or
'live lobster,' they always order that."</TE>
<TE>   Live seafood seems particularly popular in Koreatown sushi bars.
In fact, it seems to be a point of pride in that neighborhood, with
live tanks positioned prominently by the front door.</TE>
<TE>   For Koreans, live fish is "something people remember from home, so
when they see it here, it's special," says Chol Pak, president of
Pacific Fresh Fish Co., a 20-year-old company that supplies many
sushi bars with live fish. "We like the texture and taste of it," he
says. "We prefer live fish to dead fish."</TE>
<TE>   Against one wall of Pak's warehouse in the downtown seafood
district is a massive set of tanks, looking like huge aquariums. They
are packed with spot prawns, abalone and lobsters.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a tank of California halibut. The flat fish are
stacked on the tank's floor like so many gray river rocks. As in the
ocean, only the occasional flap of a fin reveals they're alive.</TE>
<TE>   These fish are much smaller than their gigantic Alaskan cousins,
weighing roughly 5 to 10 pounds each. They are caught on specially
equipped boats that go out specifically for the live trade. The
halibut are caught on hooks, but are gently netted before they're
removed from the ocean. Then they go straight into chilled holding
tanks on board. Unlike many fishing boats, which go to sea for a week
or longer at a time, live fish can be taken only by day boats, which
go out every morning and come back in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Once they're back to dock, the fish are unloaded onto small trucks
fitted with tanks and taken downtown to Pacific Fresh Fish. From
there they're delivered to the sushi bars -- usually within a day of
being caught, certainly within three to five days.</TE>
<TE>   Pak estimates that his company sells roughly 50,000 pounds of live
halibut a year and probably 40,000 pounds of live shrimp. Live
seafood requires a lot of special handling, but the premium price
makes it worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   Prices at the restaurants vary. At the Hump, regular shrimp are $8
per order, an order of two live shrimp (including having the heads
fried, turned into soup or served raw) is $10 to $12, depending on
the market price. At Kyoto, a bustling sushi bar in Koreatown at the
Chapman Market, the regular shrimp are $3 an order and the live are
$7 to $8. Halibut on ice is $3.50 and the live ranges from $10 to $15
a per person.</TE>
<TE>   While there is a difference between freshly killed fish and that
which has been on ice for even a day, it may not be what you'd
expect. Animals are not vegetables and freshest is not always best.
Like all animals, fish go through rigor mortis after they're killed
-- a tightening and then relaxing of the muscles. This process can
take anywhere from one to three days to finish.</TE>
<TE>   Until it does, the texture of the fish is tougher -- definitely
not the satiny, buttery quality normally associated with perfect
seafood. Live halibut sampled side by side with regular is chewier
and the flavor doesn't seem to be as nuanced. Because of the
difference in texture, sashimi from live fish is cut thicker and may
be somewhat irregular in shape rather than the thin, perfectly
rectangular slices you usually find.</TE>
<TE>   But for fans of live seafood, this means little compared with the
sparkling freshness of the fish -- taken straight from the water and
as close to nature as you can get short of wading into the surf and
catching it yourself.</TE>

<KH>MATTERS OF TASTE / David Shaw</KH>
<HD>Where the chef will make your bed too</HD>
<DH>Thomas Keller, the owner of French Laundry, wants dining to
be just one part of his guests' overall experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Shaw</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>THOMAS Keller's pursuit of perfection is legendary in the restaurant
community. It is "the ultimate component of his personality," writes
Michael Ruhlman in "The Soul of a Chef," and indeed, when the two men
collaborated on "The French Laundry Cookbook," Keller told Ruhlman
exactly how he wanted to be portrayed in the book -- not so much a
master chef as "a Buddhist monk in search of perfection."</LD>
<LD>   But seeking perfection in a venture as ultimately collaborative as
a restaurant -- where even a lowly busboy can compromise the best
chef's best efforts on a given night -- requires a great deal of
control.</LD>
<LD>   At the French Laundry, in the tiny Napa Valley town of Yountville,
Keller has that control, in the kitchen and the dining room.</LD>
<TE>   Now he wants even more control.</TE>
<TE>   He's building a bakery next door to Bouchon, the bistro he also
owns, down the street from the French Laundry, "so we can bake our
own breads and make our own ice creams and chocolates for both
restaurants." He's also creating a new line of Limoges porcelain
plates and bowls, designed specifically to accommodate his food. More
importantly -- and more ambitiously -- he wants to build a 20-room
inn on a three-acre site across the street from the French Laundry.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to control the entire experience," he says, "not just from
the minute you walk into the restaurant but from the minute you get
to Yountville. I want dinner to be just part of the overall
experience. I don't just want to satisfy your hunger. I want to
influence your experience here, from beginning to end."</TE>
<TE>   Keller knows that many people come to the French Laundry with the
sense of reverence and expectation one customarily associates with a
pilgrimage to Lourdes, and he realizes that his desire for complete
control may make him seem both despotic and messianic.</TE>
<TE>   Tyranny in the kitchen</TE>
<TE>   Many chefs are tyrants, and Keller -- even with his once-notorious
temper now largely (like everything else) under control -- might be
dismissed as an eccentric were it not for his prodigious culinary
talent and the obvious delight he takes in the pleasure he provides
others.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't force our guests to do anything," he says. "I just think
that I can maximize their pleasure by enveloping them in a cocoon
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Although the inn isn't likely to open for three years, Keller is
already working on preliminary plans with an architect for the inn.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't have a restaurant in the inn," Keller says, "but we will
bring you food two or three times a day, and it will be based on
where you're eating tonight and where you ate last night.</TE>
<TE>   "Say you're out all day, and you have a 7 o'clock dinner
reservation at the French Laundry. What could you eat when you come
back to the inn at 4 o'clock in the afternoon that would start to get
you ready for that experience? I'm not sure what the answer is yet,
but I know it will be different than what we'll send to your room if
you have a dinner reservation at some other restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "And how about the next morning? What should you eat for breakfast
after one of those dinners? Again, I don't know the specifics yet.
But I know it will differ, depending on where you ate dinner."</TE>
<TE>   At most hotels, Keller says, "a restaurant is an amenity for
guests of the hotel. Our inn will be an amenity for customers in the
restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   In this, as in so much of his kitchen technique, Keller is
following the French tradition. Many of the best restaurants in the
French countryside have small inns to accommodate their clients,
especially in out-of-the-way locations like, say, Michel Guerard's
Les Pres d'Eugenie in Eugenie-les-Bains (pop. 467) in southwest
France or Marc Meneau's L'Esperance in St.-Pere-sous-Vezelay (pop.
348) in Burgundy.</TE>
<TE>   In either restaurant -- and at many others, similarly remote --
the prospect of a long, post-prandial drive or a late-night search
for a nearby hotel room might discourage people from coming to
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The French touch</TE>
<TE>   Like Keller, both Guerard and Meneau pride themselves on taking
care of their clients outside the dining room as well as inside.
Guerard became famous for cuisine minceur -- diet food that's more
Escoffier than Pritikin -- and his complex in Eugenie-les-Bains is a
health spa, as well as a Michelin three-star restaurant. Meneau puts
so much effort into his lavish breakfasts that he calls the meal "la
sourire de la maison" -- "the smile of the house."</TE>
<TE>   But I've spent eight nights at Guerard and 10 at Meneau over the
years, and I never had the sense that either man was as determined as
Keller to control my entire experience.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, they do have the French tradition of fine
dining in the hinterlands to rely on, while Keller cooks in the
United States -- long the land of Chef Boyardee, frozen TV dinners
and, even now, of Big Macs in the boondocks.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if he really wants to control the customer's entire
experience, from the minute you get to Yountville until the minute
you leave, I wonder if -- once he gets his inn and his bakery up and
running -- he'll try opening a gas station, maybe two gas stations
... one at each end of town.</TE>
<TE>   Hmmm. Now that I think of it, I bought one of the best sandwiches
of my life at a gas station just off the autostrada between Rome and
the Amalfi coast, so maybe that's not as crazy as it sounds.</TE>

<LD>Frozen puff pastry that's</LD>
<LD>   good enough for the pros</LD>
<LD>   Not all puff pastry is equal, as we learned in making apple tarts.
Most of us buy frozen Pepperidge Farm puff pastry -- which is about
all you'll see in supermarkets. While good, it doesn't have that
terrific, buttery flavor of pastry so often found in restaurant
desserts. That's because it contains no butter, just shortening and
oils.</LD>
<TE>   With a bit of searching, you can find professional-quality puff
pastry made from butter. It produces a fabulous flaky crust and
imparts a delicious butter flavor. The trick is working with it.</TE>
<TE>   While supermarket puff pastry must be thawed at least 30 minutes
before rolling, the professional pastry we used needs to stand just
three to four minutes. Any longer and the butter begins to soften and
the dough becomes difficult to handle. Work quickly, handling the
dough as little as possible. The pastry sheets, which are larger than
the supermarket style, are easier to work with if you cut them in
half. The Orange Bakery brand of pastry we used was a generous
16-by-24 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Bakery puff pastry is sold at Gourmet Imports, 921 Meridian
Ave., South Pasadena, (626) 441-9600; 16-by-24-inch sheets are $4.50
each; 8-by-12-inch sheets are $2.25. Surfas in Culver City sells
11-by-14-inch sheets of Dufour puff pastry for $10.64 each; Surfas,
8825 National Blvd., Culver City, (310) 559-4770.</TE>

<KH>THE REVIEW</KH>
<HD>A little bohemian, a lot Californian</HD>
<DH>The menu at Firefly Bistro is high-spirited and fun, just
like its tent party atmosphere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HOW California is this? At Firefly Bistro in South Pasadena, the
entire dining room is a breezy tent like the ones extended families
rent for boisterous weddings and anniversary celebrations. The
entrance is a pergola of grapevines hung with whimsical glass
ornaments. On warm days the canvas sides are pulled back to reveal
vines clambering over brick walls and urns spilling over with ivy and
flowering plants. On chillier evenings, portable heaters are enlisted
to warm up the room.</LD>
<LD>   The tent's roof high overhead is the support for theatrical lights
and cheery orange paper lanterns. And a voluminous mossy green
chiffon curtain lifted from Philippe Starck's book of tricks softens
the contours of the back walls. The kitchen is actually in a small
free-standing building to one side.</LD>
<LD>   Though everyone is seated at separate tables, just like a regular
restaurant, the oddball nature of the setting creates a festive
feeling. People feel comfortable enough to lean over and start a
conversation at the next table. The pretext could be the wine, what
to order or even the book set aside once the food arrives.</LD>
<TE>   This somewhat bohemian restaurant is the new project of Monique
King, former executive chef at Border Grill, and her husband, Paul
Rosenbluh, who was King's sous chef at her Chicago restaurant Soul
Kitchen. The food at Firefly Bistro is California cuisine at its most
exuberant. King subscribes to the more ingredients the merrier school
of cooking. And though her inspiration comes from all over the globe,
she doesn't pull any punches in terms of flavor. You might see
pecan-coated catfish or grilled pork chop with fresh corn spoon bread
on the same menu as Moroccan vegetable tagine or a Mexican-accented
crispy pork dumpling.</TE>
<TE>   I kept wondering where I'd seen the affable maitre d' before. That
Hawaiian shirt could be confusing things, I mused. Maybe he wore a
tux in his previous position. But no, one of my friends in the movie
business set me straight: That's character actor Carl Weintraub. I'd
say he's got this role down pat. Though when he pronounces every dish
wonderful, maybe, just maybe, he should fess up that he's the chef's
proud papa (and a partner).</TE>
<TE>   If this is California, the menu must have salads. Early on, these
encompassed a delightful variation on spinach salad made with roasted
cherries, Maytag blue cheese and smoked bacon-thyme vinaigrette. Now
there's a salad of grilled Belgian endive embellished with roasted
baby beets, caramelized pears and toasted fresh walnuts. The pears
are intensified with a vinaigrette made with pear cider. What a
lovely idea.</TE>
<TE>   The source of those baby beets is the farmers market. Thursday
nights, as you arrive for dinner, the market in front, which lasts
from 4 to 8 p.m. each week, will be winding down. If you want to
shop, though, be sure to arrive before 7. After that, it's leaner
pickings.</TE>
<TE>   Firefly Bistro's latest menu is high-spirited and fun, the best
yet from this young restaurant. You can start with ceviche of pretty
little rock shrimp and pineapple dosed with lime and a chipotle salsa
that really rocks, or else a single hauntingly spiced grilled quail
with a velvety plum sauce. Diminutive Dungeness crab fritters are set
off by a delicate pale avocado cream and a blast of house-made hot
sauce. My favorite appetizer, though, is the heat-seeking Firefly
shrimp served with a soothing mint yogurt, a dollop of mango chutney
and a demure chickpea salad.</TE>
<TE>   Among the main courses is a Moroccan spiced chicken breast with a
smear of bright red harissa and silky salty-sharp preserved lemons
and pickled dried apricot halves. Each plate is well thought out. For
example, a beautifully fresh piece of Virginia striped bass is
sauteed and placed on a swirl of soba noodles spiked with coconut
cream and cilantro. Spicy Chinese long beans take up the minor theme.
King and crew also turn out a respectable paella loaded with
shellfish, calamari, chicken and, in a smart departure, andouille
sausage.</TE>
<TE>   One night the entree everybody at my table wishes they'd ordered
is the lamb sirloin, grilled to a perfect medium-rare and served with
sweet potatoes laced with caramelized garlic and Brussels sprouts
that taste so fresh they could have been picked off the garden wall.</TE>
<TE>   The key to this menu's success is that it doesn't overreach what
the kitchen can accomplish with the staff and the space available.
So, too, Firefly Bistro's modest, but somewhat eclectic
all-California wine list is in tune with a neighborhood place like
this. It includes a good number of choices for less than $30,
including the 2000 Pacific Rim dry Riesling, a good match for spicy
dishes.</TE>
<TE>   Desserts ride squarely in the comfort zone, with a liquid-center
chocolate cake embellished with vanilla bean ice cream and, not to
gild the lily or anything, caramelized bananas. I'm less fond of the
gooey sweet chocolate-hazelnut fritters. An ice cream terrine striped
with Zinfandel-stained pear neatly bridges summer and fall. And every
day, the pastry chef dreams up another pudding. Best yet? The maple
flan with dainty ginger cookies.</TE>
<TE>   On a Sunday morning, the tent liberated to the breeze is a
terrific spot for brunch. The coffee is good and strong; the foam on
the cappuccino doesn't stick to your nose, and the menu easily moves
from breakfast into lunch. Hearty souls (those who already have done
their biking or running) can dig into grilled skirt steak and eggs
with fresh tomato salad or order the fluffy buttermilk biscuits with
sausage gravy with a cup of coffee (that's on the side). OJ, though,
doesn't taste as fresh as it could.</TE>
<TE>   A highly touted ricotta tart fresh from the oven is delicious, all
but hidden by a fluff of greens and other garnishes. A simpler
presentation would let it shine. And, I have to say it, it's a
surprise to find such generic breakfast tacos on a menu from someone
who cooked at Border Grill. I like the scrambled eggs and potato
filling, but the black beans are dry and taste unseasoned. The wan
salsa is just diced tomatoes, a little cilantro and a timid dose of
chile.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to fathom, too, why slices of chilly unripe brie are,
with spinach and asparagus, considered an essential component of the
green goddess omelet. But that's California cuisine for you. It's
more the kind of dish you'd expect to find at an earnest wine country
bed and breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   The book group at the next table who linger over brunch discussing
Richard Russo's latest novel and their lives, says it all. This is a
place where no one feels rushed, where a son can bring his mother for
brunch, where a little girl can twirl around the room in her sundress
while her parents polish off the last of that ricotta tart.</TE>
<TE>   If every neighborhood restaurant were as amiable and engaging as
this one, we'd all be thrilled to stroll up the block for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   By keeping their ambitions focused and considering what the
neighborhood really needs -- and it's not another serious French
restaurant or trendy sushi bar -- King and Rosenbluh have a South
Pasadena hit.</TE>

<HD>The elements of stew, refined</HD>
<DH>Cook the ingredients separately, then toss them together.
Turning the usual method on its head turns a humble dish into an
exceptional one.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Donna Deane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FOR most of my life, I made stew almost without thinking. Brown some
meat, toss in some vegetables and water, walk away for a couple of
hours, and there it was -- dinner.</LD>
<LD>   But a few years ago I ran into a recipe that completely changed
the way I make (and even think about) the dish. The recipe was for
Tycoon's Goulash, in "Gundel's Hungarian Cookbook" by Karoly Gundel.
Even though it's not a traditional stew, I came to think of the
recipe as the ultimate version of the dish, one that treated each
element with intelligence and care, and brought each to its fullest
potential.</LD>
<LD>   In the Gundel method, the broth, meat and vegetables are cooked
separately and then assembled just before serving. That gives each
component a distinct flavor and texture: a rich, deep broth; juicy
cubes of meat with a nicely seared crust; vegetables that are crisp
and tender.</LD>
<TE>   Although cooking each element separately sounds cumbersome, I have
adopted this method partly because of its ease of preparation.</TE>
<TE>   I like to make the stock a day or two ahead so all that's left to
do is finish the sauce with tomatoes, sear the meat and cook some
sort of starch to round out the dish, anything from noodles to barley
to polenta.</TE>
<TE>   These last bits of business all take less then 30 minutes, and,
presto, you have a wonderful dish.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it is such a painless way of preparing a great meal, I
began adapting it in every way I could imagine.</TE>
<TE>   I developed a basic stock recipe that would work for any stew meat
-- lamb or veal, as well as beef. (It also freeze beautifully, so you
can have a batch easily at hand.) I found that adding a bay leaf and
some fresh thyme gave the stock another dimension. I also learned
that the paprika was essential -- even if I wasn't making a goulash.
It adds a rich color and body to the stock so there is no need to
thicken it with flour or cornstarch.</TE>
<TE>   A shopping note: When you buy soup bones, ask for ones with some
meat on them for a more flavorful stock. If the bones are big, ask
the butcher to crack them (or pick out smaller bones for more
flavor).</TE>
<TE>   Another trick: When making the basic stock I found it was best to
first blanch the bones for 5 minutes, then drain and rinse them
before adding them to the stockpot. This is an extra step but it will
save you from constantly skimming the stock while it's cooking.</TE>
<TE>   Now onto browning the meat. To keep the meat tender, it must be
seared quickly in a hot skillet, and cooked just until medium rare.
(Don't use a nonstick skillet -- the meat won't brown as well.)
Cutting the meat into small cubes and patting it dry on paper towels
helps it brown quickly without stewing in the pan. Both beef
tenderloin and top sirloin were delicious (the fattier top sirloin
did have a little more flavor).</TE>
<TE>   For an interesting version of a classic stew, I like to steam a
mixture of root vegetables (rutabaga, turnips and parsnips), and
serve the stew with buttered flat noodles and a garnish of cracked
black pepper and a sprig of thyme.</TE>
<TE>   But don't stop there.</TE>
<TE>   Let your imagination take over. Just follow the basic recipe, and
vary the vegetable, starch and garnish. The possibilities are
infinite, and infinitely satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Variations on a theme</TE>
<TE>   Start with the master beef stew broth (make it ahead and freeze it
if you like), then vary the finishing elements to create vastly
different dishes. Here are some ideas to get you started:</TE>
<TE>   Provencal</TE>
<TE>   Steamed vegetables: baby yellow squash and haricots verts</TE>
<TE>   Starch: white beans</TE>
<TE>   Garnish: lemon slices and thyme sprigs</TE>
<TE>   Tuscan</TE>
<TE>   Steamed vegetables: asparagus tips and strips of red and orange
bell pepper</TE>
<TE>   Starch: polenta</TE>
<TE>   Garnish: olives and tarragon leaves</TE>
<TE>   Eastern European</TE>
<TE>   Steamed vegetables: shiitake, cremini and oyster mushrooms, and
red chard</TE>
<TE>   Starch: barley</TE>
<TE>   Garnish: fresh sage or rosemary</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Master beef stew</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour, 35 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   Note: This can also be made with leg of lamb meat and lamb neck
bones or veal tenderloin and veal knuckle bones.</TE>
<TE>   3 pounds beef bones (shank or knuckle), with meat</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   2 cups minced onions</TE>
<TE>   3 cloves garlic, crushed and coarsely chopped</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons sweet Hungarian paprika</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   1 sprig thyme</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   3 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 pound beef tenderloin or top sirloin, cut into 1-inch cubes</TE>
<TE>   2 cups steamed root vegetables, a mixture of rutabaga, turnip,
parsnip, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</TE>
<TE>   2 cups cooked flat buttered noodles</TE>
<TE>   Cracked black pepper</TE>
<TE>   Fresh thyme leaves, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   1. Place the bones in a large saucepot. Add enough cold water to
cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer
5 minutes. Drain and rinse the bones under cold water; set aside.
Rinse the pot to remove any sediment.</TE>
<TE>   2. Set the pot over medium-high heat and add 3 tablespoons of oil.
Add the onions and garlic and cook until the onions begin to brown, 2
to 3 minutes; reduce the heat to low and continue cooking until the
onions are golden, 10 minutes more. Stir occasionally to keep the
onions from burning.</TE>
<TE>   3. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the paprika. Add the
rinsed bones and 6 cups of water. Add the bay leaf, thyme sprig and 1
teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer,
partially covered, 1 hour. Skim the broth to remove any sediment
while cooking. Remove the bones, bay leaf and thyme from the broth
and skim off any fat or sediment. (The broth can be refrigerated at
this point for up to three days. If the broth has been refrigerated,
heat it to a simmer and proceed.)</TE>
<TE>   4. Add the tomatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a
simmer and cook, partially covered, until slightly thickened, 15
minutes. Add salt to taste.</TE>
<TE>   5. In a heavy skillet, brown the meat in the remaining 1
tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat until the meat is
medium-rare, 2 to 3 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   6. Spoon the broth into 4 large shallow bowls. Spoon the meat into
the center of each bowl and surround with it steamed vegetables.
Spoon the noodles on the side. Sprinkle with cracked black pepper and
fresh thyme.</TE>

<LD>The tiny town of Trinidad in Northern California sits at the top of a
rocky point. As you wind down the road to a small fishing harbor, you
might be so dazzled by the view that you miss Katy's Smokehouse, were
it not for the small sign reading "Tuna, as good as home-canned."</LD>
<LD>   The tuna is probably not what you're used to. It's very fresh,
caught locally. And it's canned with no added water or oil. The
result after the high heat of the canning process is a round filet of
albacore that has a flavor and texture closer to roasted than
poached. While it lacks the suave texture of the best oil-packed
ventresca tuna from Italy or Spain, it has a clean, sweet appeal. And
at $4.99 for almost a half-pound, it's considerably cheaper. Also
check out Katy's smoked fish, all prepared on site.</LD>

<HD>A natural progression</HD>
<DH>Bob Cantisano says his mission is to steer the state's wine
industry away from chemicals and toward organic growing and
eventually a better wine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rod Smith</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>THE stocky man in baggy shorts, T-shirt and sandals crouches down
next to a grapevine and peers at the leaves and purple grapes from
under his straw hat. "This vineyard is not a complete disaster," he
tells the anxious grower hovering nearby. "But there's a lot of work
to do." The grower looks relieved as he opens a notebook and poises
his pen.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Cantisano, 51, better known as Amigo Bob, is not a grape
grower, winemaker or winery owner. Yet he's one of the more
influential figures in California wine today. Officially, he's an
organic viticultural consultant, but in practice he's almost a
missionary for organic growing. His followers include some of the
state's most prominent wine producers, both large companies such as
Fetzer and Sutter Home and small, respected wineries such as Araujo,
Spottswoode, Frog's Leap, Corison, Calera, Staglin and Shafer. His
mission is to steer the industry away from chemicals toward what he
believes is a brighter, cleaner future -- and possibly, better wine.</LD>
<TE>   Organic viticulture is similar in theory to preventive medicine,
he explains. It's aimed at growing healthy vines that are able to
resist pests and diseases naturally. Pesticides and herbicides create
a kind of desert above and below the ground. They disrupt the
intricate natural balance of a healthy ecosystem and generate a
vicious cycle of chemical dependency: Plants become vulnerable to
problems that can only be controlled by more chemicals. Artificial
fertilizers are just as bad, he says. "It's like steroids in people.
They build up parts of the physiology and weaken others."</TE>
<TE>   In the organic paradigm, cover crops provide habitat for predators
that keep pests in check. A healthy soil is alive with its own
ecology of organisms that help nourish the vine and promote its
ability to resist pests and diseases.</TE>
<TE>   "And, as it turns out, the fruit tastes better," Cantisano says.
"The plant's picking up nutrients and trace elements called
phytochemicals, which is a catch phrase for minerals and compounds
created by microorganisms, and sometimes by the healthy plant itself.
Some of them have an impact on flavor. Winemakers tell me they're
able to make fuller-bodied, more flavorful and intense wines from
organic grapes."</TE>
<TE>   That's difficult to prove. But many producers believe it,
including Shafer Vineyards president Doug Shafer, who has worked with
Cantisano since 1989. "My gut feel is that if you have a healthier,
happier vine that can withstand pests, you get a better balanced
grape," Shafer says, "and to me that would translate into a better
balanced wine."</TE>
<TE>   Bart Araujo, who hired Cantisano in 1998, isn't as sure about a
direct relationship with wine quality, "because so many variables are
involved," he says. "But the health of the vines is extraordinary.
They respond to stress in ways that are almost ridiculous. Prior to
'98 we'd have scorched leaves during a heat spell. Now it doesn't
matter. It can be 110 degrees and our plants look like it's 85. And
if the vines aren't stressed, the grapes are maturing in a much more
orderly fashion."</TE>
<TE>   The movement toward organic farming appears to be escalating.
Agricultural pesticide use statewide has declined by 60 million
pounds since 1998, according to a California Department of Pesticide
Regulation report issued last week. Last year application of
pesticides by California wine grape growers was down 4.8 million
pounds from 2000, to 22.8 million pounds, the lowest level since
record keeping began a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   California Certified Organic Farmers, which claims 75% of the
state's organic farmers as members, has 110 wine-growing members.</TE>
<TE>   Still, not every grower is rushing into organic farming. Sonoma
Cutrer Vineyards is trying organic farming on 200 of its 1,000 acres,
but vineyard manager Kirk Lokka says there's no big rush to embrace
organics completely.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting away from a lot of the nasty stuff we were using 10
years ago," he says, "but it works both ways. Sulfur and copper and
the new biological sprays aren't as good as the synthetics. You have
to be twice as vigilant about what's going on in the field, and you
have to spray a lot more. The nasties work well, they're easy to
apply, and they're not very expensive. That's tough to beat."</TE>
<TE>   Amigo Bob -- a girlfriend called him that when he was 18 and it
stuck -- calls himself a "back-to-the-land hippie." He cites the
first Earth Day, in 1970 at San Francisco State, as a red-letter day
in his life. "The light bulb went on real strong," he recalls. "The
speakers were powerful and inspirational. They spoke about how
fragile the environment was and how important it was to protect it."</TE>
<TE>   He eventually settled in the San Juan Ridge area northeast of
Sacramento, one of the seminal back-to-the-land communities in
California. He still lives there with his family, growing olives and
producing organic olive oil. He began advising fruit and vegetable
growers in the Sierra foothills during the 1970s. In 1977 a Nevada
City doctor with six acres of Chardonnay asked him to manage the
vineyard. "I didn't know all the challenges," he recalls. "I was
naive."</TE>
<TE>   That year he started an organic farming supply business. A key
client was Fetzer Vineyards in Mendocino County, the first big
producer to go completely organic. Cantisano organized Fetzer's
transition in 1987. Then Carneros grower Leigh Hudson called for
advice. So did Frog's Leap Vineyards founder John Williams.</TE>
<TE>   When post-phylloxera replanting accelerated the organic movement
in the early '90s, Amigo Bob was the guy to call. Now he consults
full time and has dozens of clients throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   He's aware that critics say his approach is not an adequate
response to such menaces as phylloxera and Pierce's disease, an
incurable grapevine disease spread by a voracious leafhopper called
the glassy-winged sharpshooter. But Cantisano says organic techniques
can win even those battles, and besides, the immediate goal is not
revolution -- it's keeping his clients in business.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell every grower up front that we'll try all the alternatives
first," he said, "but if I really have a failure he should use a
pesticide."</TE>

<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This domaine has always made great Chateauneuf, but its latest
release seems to mark a departure from the rustic, earthy Vieux
Telegraphe style we have known. The scent is less of garrigue, more
of wild raspberry and rose petal with a delicate touch of oak. The
taste is remarkably clean and focused, highlighting the gorgeous
fruit. Add smooth, silky tannins and the result is a particularly
elegant Chateauneuf, one you can drink with pleasure now or hold back
to enjoy its evolution over the next 15 years.</LD>
<LD>   When I taste something like this, I think game -- wild duck
roasted over the spit, squab, venison, etc. But since I'm not
expecting a hunter to show up on my doorstep anytime soon, I'll go
with pork roast or a leg of lamb redolent of herbs.</LD>

it won't be around long.</TE>

<HD>Their 'Son' was Fogerty's baby</HD>
<DH>The last thing the singer wants is a Creedence corporate
revival, but he doesn't own the rights, so 'Fortunate Son' now sells
jeans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Baker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Put yourself in John Fogerty's shoes and see if you don't feel like
slapping somebody.</LD>
<LD>   Fogerty, the guiding force behind Creedence Clearwater Revival's
hits of the late '60s and early '70s and now a solo performer, has
fretted for more than two years as one of his most meaningful songs,
the Vietnam War-era protest anthem "Fortunate Son," has been used by
Wrangler as a patriotic endorsement of its jeans.</LD>
<LD>   "It makes me angry," he said by phone from his home in Los
Angeles, where he lives with his wife and four children and is
writing songs for a new album, his first since 1997. "When you use a
song for a TV commercial, it trivializes the meaning of the song. It
almost turns it into nothing."</LD>
<TE>   Wrangler was able to have its way with Fogerty's 1969 hit because
he long ago signed away legal control of his old recordings to
Creedence's record label, Berkeley-based Fantasy Records. Without
consulting Fogerty, Fantasy sold Wrangler permission to use the
lyrics and master recording of "Fortunate Son," a stark, hard-rocking
song about privilege and hypocrisy.</TE>
<TE>   Wrangler estimates the commercial has so far received 3 billion
"impressions," or individual viewings. The company boosted its TV
buys 25% this year to promote its Five-Star Premium Denim line, which
means a significantly higher number of people are noticing the use of
the song.</TE>
<TE>   "People walk up to me, people I've met through my kids, at school,
people who rarely talk to me about the old days, and they say, 'Oh,
John, I saw your commercial,' and the first thing out of my mouth is:
'It stinks,' " said Fogerty, who first saw the spot in the summer of
2000. "They usually get a surprised look on their face -- they're
just making conversation -- and then I have to explain."</TE>
<TE>   What hurts the most, he said, is the reaction he fears from men
who were of draft age during the Vietnam War, men for whom "Fortunate
Son" protested the unfairness of the loophole-filled Selective
Service System. "It really ticks me off that they're thinking, 'Oh,
they got to John. Musta given him a new boat or something.' "</TE>
<TE>   Fogerty's angst stands out in a pop-music climate where the notion
of "selling out" seems to have disappeared decades ago. Old rock hits
are routinely used in TV commercials to sell everything from cars to
detergent to cell phones to toothpaste. Younger bands welcome -- and
sometimes solicit -- the exposure commercials bring. Two years ago
Moby became the gold standard for this ethos by licensing all 18
songs on his album "Play" to commercials or movies.</TE>
<TE>   Wrangler and its ad agency created a 30-second commercial that
exploited Fogerty's song's explosive guitar-and-drum instrumental
opening. As jeans-clad actors frolic, the first two lines of the song
can be heard :</TE>
<TE>   Some folks are born made to wave the flag</TE>
<TE>   Ooh, they're red white and blue</TE>
<TE>   In the context of the ad, the lines are an appeal to your sense of
Americanism, just what a company would want you to associate with its
product. There's only one problem: That opening couplet alone does
not convey the theme of the song, in which Fogerty shrieked about the
way he felt those phony patriots were sending everyday men to their
deaths in an endless quagmire:</TE>
<TE>   Some folks inherit star-spangled eyes</TE>
<TE>   Ooh, they send you down to war</TE>
<TE>   And when you ask them how much should we give?</TE>
<TE>   They only answer, "More, more, more"</TE>
<TE>   With each chorus he proclaimed:</TE>
<TE>   It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one</TE>
<TE>   Craig Errington, director of advertising for Wrangler's parent
corporation, North Carolina-based VF Jeanswear, said the company was
initially drawn to "the energetic, uplifting sound and beat ... that
makes you turn your head back to the TV." He said the company studied
the lyrics and concluded that "Fortunate Son" was not merely an
anti-war song but "more an ode to the common man.... The common man
is who we have been directing Wrangler toward."</TE>
<TE>   Fantasy's director of musical licensing, Pamela Bendich, said
Fantasy had "a very clear concept of what the commercial was.... I
didn't find it misleading." Neither she nor Errington would discuss
how much Wrangler paid to use the song.</TE>
<TE>   Fogerty is financially compensated by Wrangler as the song's
author (as he was by a paint company a decade ago when, to his
dismay, it used Creedence's "Who'll Stop the Rain") but says he finds
that hollow. At age 57, he still holds unabashed '60s political
views, and to him the Wrangler commercial is a crime against his
generation.</TE>
<TE>   "I happened to be on tour in a hotel room somewhere in America the
first time I heard the Beatles' 'Revolution' used in a Nike
commercial" in 1987, the result of the group's having lost the rights
to the song.</TE>
<TE>   "The trash can they provide in my room clanged against a wall.
That was my reaction to that then -- they're stealing something from
me.... All my emotions welled up then at another nail in the coffin
of the ideals of the '60s."</TE>

<HD>Study: O.C. arts numbers down after 9/11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Boehm</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new statistical glimpse of how the arts were faring economically in
Orange County in the year leading up to the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks shows a public increasingly eager to pay for performances and
exhibitions, and donors willing to keep writing checks in the face of
a balky (but not yet plummeting) stock market--all of which
encouraged gung-ho cultural institutions to hike their spending
commensurately.</LD>
<LD>   But that was then--the 2001 fiscal year documented in the
quadrennial state-of-the-arts study by Chapman University economists
and the Orange County Business Committee for the Arts. The
this-is-now part of the study, released Tuesday, was predictably more
chastened. The 55 participating Orange County nonprofit arts
organizations foresaw four years of steady spending growth slowing to
a crawl in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   The study, titled "The Economic Impact of the Nonprofit Arts on
Orange County," mainly looks back on the salad days before Sept. 11
and the stock market bust, said Esmael Adibi, the Chapman economist
who analyzed the data.</LD>
<TE>   Figures for about half of the institutions surveyed -- including
many of the largest -- reflected fiscal years that ended in July
2001, before the seismic shift in national mood and agenda. The rest
gave figures for the calendar year, including the nearly four months
after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   According to the survey, the take from paid admissions to museums,
performances and arts festivals soared 58.6% during the boom economy
-- from $29.5 million in 1997 to $46.8 million in 2001. The number of
paying patrons rose 37%, from 1.45 million to 2 million. Donations to
operating budgets grew 65.1%, from $29.8 million to $49.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   With total income up 56.2%, the arts groups raised their spending
even more aggressively--by 58.9%. The number of full-time employees
increased 40%, from 417 to 585.</TE>
<TE>   Those figures come from the 38 organizations that responded to
both the 1997 and 2001 surveys--including all of the heavyweights,
such as the Orange County Performing Arts Center, the Philharmonic
Society of Orange County, Pacific Symphony, South Coast Repertory and
major local museums.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers speak for themselves," Adibi said. "People who are
doing well spend more on arts, and when that becomes part of the way
you live, you continue to do that unless the trends change your
behavior."</TE>
<TE>   But the trends have shifted. Asked to estimate the impact of Sept.
11 and the recession, more than 60% of the organizations surveyed
said that donations were hurt, and more than 30% said attendance was
hurt. Collectively, the 55 organizations projected that their earned
income would fall nearly 3% in 2002, from $63.9 million to $62.1
million. However, they expected donations, which pay for nearly half
of their aggregate expenses, to rise 8.9% -- an estimate that
surprised Adibi.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're very optimistic," given the recession economy and
bear market, he said. The organizations collectively expected to
increase spending 1.9% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   The new study is the fourth conducted since 1989 by Chapman and
the Business Committee for the Arts. It aims to document the role
that the nonprofit arts play in the county's economy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's to tell [business donors] their money is going to two causes
-- one is to improve quality of life, the other is to improve the
economy," Adibi said.</TE>
<TE>   The study concluded that arts institutions' total economic impact
on the county grew to $407.9 million.</TE>

<HD>Canadian wins Booker Prize for 'Life of Pi'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Canadian writer Yann Martel won the Booker Prize on Tuesday, taking
one of the world's most prestigious literary awards for "Life of Pi,"
his quirky fable about a boy's survival after a shipwreck.</LD>
<LD>   The Montreal novelist was the hottest favorite in the 34-year
history of the prize after the organizers mistakenly put out his name
as the winner last week when doing a test run on the prize's Web
site.</LD>
<LD>   After judges decided Tuesday night, prize administrator Martyn
Goff said, "The discussion was strong and good but never unpleasant.
They felt very strongly about things and really discussed them. It
was a close run thing with another book."</LD>
<TE>   However, Goff refused to name the runner-up after the judges voted
4-1 for Martel after 70 minutes of thrashing out their choice. Asked
if last week's embarrassing slip-up was a problem with the judges,
Goff said, "No, it wasn't even mentioned."</TE>
<TE>   That had been one of Martel's fears when literary gamblers made
him the evens favorite. He said before the decision, "I hope it won't
annoy the judges."</TE>
<TE>   The 39-year-old Martel did not start making his living from
writing until his late 20s. He now divides his time among writing,
yoga and volunteer work at a care unit.</TE>
<TE>   The winner, hailed by London literati at a glittering dinner in
the British Museum, received $77,300 for his prize, which was
sponsored this year by the hedge fund managers Man Group. Martel's
work was picked from 130 novels from Britain, Ireland and the
Commonwealth.</TE>

<HD>A West Coast invasion of East Coast news gatherers</HD>
<DH>All-stars from network and cable TV shows are making
Southland stops. Their goal is a fresh perspective.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Typically, it takes something like a major news event, such as the
Democratic National Convention in 2000, or something out of this
world -- like the Angels in the World Series -- to get prominent
figures in East Coast broadcast media to venture west of the Atlantic
Seaboard.</LD>
<LD>   And yet, in some sort of harmonic convergence, a few of
television's news all-stars have traveled to Southern California to
do live shows in the last several days -- an unofficial World Series
of topical news shows. Surprisingly, perhaps, the presence of the
Angels in the Series has nothing to do with it.</LD>
<LD>   CNN's "Lou Dobbs Moneyline" host just completed a multiday visit,
with live broadcasts of his show from several locations, including
the deck of the Navy destroyer Higgins in San Diego Harbor, UCLA's
Anderson School of business and the rooftop of the Renaissance Hotel
in Hollywood. His guests included Oscar winner Kevin Spacey and Walt
Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner.</LD>
<TE>   Jim Lehrer and Robert MacNeil, veteran PBS newsmen from the
groundbreaking "The MacNeil-Lehrer Report," were scheduled to make
rare public appearances together at the Skirball Cultural Center on
Tuesday night and at a fund-raising event tonight at KCET-TV.</TE>
<TE>   MacNeil, who retired from the news program in 1995, was set to
interview his former partner, who has written his 13th novel, a Civil
War murder mystery titled "No Certain Rest."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Matthews, host of the Washington, D.C.-based "Hardball,"
will host a live telecast of the MSNBC series tonight at Chapman
University in Orange. The installment, part of the yearlong Hardball
College Tour 2002, will feature actor -- and possible future
gubernatorial candidate -- Arnold Schwarzenegger.</TE>
<TE>   Matthews said of the East Coast news invasion: "Yes, it is weird.
It's a strange thing, but all the big news, with the exception of the
sniper story, seems to be coming out of Los Angeles and Florida." He
cited the Danielle van Dam kidnapping-murder trial, the O.J. Simpson
case and the continuing voting chaos in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Lehrer, who is host of the PBS program "The NewsHour With Jim
Lehrer," said that when he travels to the West Coast, "I always get
questions I don't expect. Since I live on the East Coast, I am always
talking to people who have the same interests, and they want to know
things like about the economy and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "But when I come to the West Coast, I am asked things like how I
can do a daily news show and write a novel on the side at the same
time. The angle is always different. That's one of the main reasons
to make trips like this. It is important to find out what people out
here are thinking about."</TE>
<TE>   Dobbs was blunter when addressing his predominantly student
audience during Thursday's edition of "Moneyline," which was
broadcast live outside UCLA's Anderson School.</TE>
<TE>   While noting that New York City is "the financial and media
capital of the world," Dobbs added that he still believes there is
too much emphasis on perspectives from the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the reasons that we are out here on the West Coast,
because it is important to us as journalists and those of us who
report not only to this country, but indeed to our international
audience, to give that kind of perspective," Dobbs said.</TE>
<TE>   During the show at the business school, Dobbs and his guests,
including Bruce Willison, dean of the Anderson School, fielded
questions about corporate safeguards and the importance of ethics,
even at the college level.</TE>
<TE>   After the show, Dobbs said that California "is on the edge of
every major issue in the news -- corporate scandals, ethics,
politics. And it's great to see how the students out here are
thinking about ethics and the government."</TE>
<TE>   Matthews, who also is host of a syndicated news show, "The Chris
Matthews Show," which airs Saturdays at 6:30 p.m. on KNBC-TV, said he
had some perspective on the differences between the East and West
coasts because of his 13-year-stint as Washington bureau chief for
the San Francisco Examiner.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Bay Area, and in California, people get outside and enjoy
life," he said. "On the East Coast, the weather is terrible, and
people stay inside and read the paper. In California, life is a lot
more kinetic. Life is meant to be lived. The politics aren't as
intense, as tribal, as they are back East."</TE>
<TE>   MacNeil had a less flattering view of Californians, saying they
are "seduced by their culture."</TE>
<TE>   "It's very enveloping," he added. "There's this aura of
self-sufficiency that fights curiosity."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Dobbs brought another insight as he addressed the students
last week right before a commercial break.</TE>
<TE>   "The predominant population is on the eastern part of the
country," he said. "The West Coast is going to get short shrift. But
there are some trade-offs here." He pointed to the blue sky and the
sun.</TE>
<TE>   The students laughed appreciatively.</TE>

<LD>It's 10 o'clock on a Saturday night, and we're sitting on the couch,
waiting for the kids to come home.</LD>
<LD>   "So where were they going after that?" I ask.</LD>
<LD>   "To a party," my wife explains.</LD>
<TE>   "Which party?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   We go over what the plans were after the school dance. Who was
driving. Who else was in the group. It's comforting just to talk like
this, to know the usual suburban surveillance system is in place,
spotty as it is.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't anything else on?" I say, already struggling to stay awake.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Sleepless in Seattle,' " my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "No ballgames?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 10 o'clock," she reminds me.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a day blessed with terrific sporting events. College
football. The World Series. AYSO soccer. Is October our greatest gift
or what?</TE>
<TE>   Now it's 10 at night, and we're waiting for the two older kids to
come home. The boy is out at a dance. The college girl is back in
town and out somewhere visiting friends. On TV, Tom Hanks is reaching
for Meg Ryan's hand.</TE>
<TE>   "If you'd like, I could go put on my ref's uniform," I tell my
wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Forget it," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Too sexy?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Exactly," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, she saw me for the first time in my AYSO
referee's uniform. Yellow shirt. Stretchy black shorts. Black knee
socks. I looked like a human school bus. I looked like a prank.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm guessing you find me kind of hot," I told her then.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, that's it," said my wife.</TE>
<TE>   It was like a male negligee, this referee's uniform. I slipped it
on and suddenly she couldn't keep her eyes off me, even as she
stifled a laugh. Strange what turns a pregnant woman on.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe what?"</TE>
<TE>   "You look like a bumble bee," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Better believe it, baby," I told her.</TE>
<TE>   Tick, tick, tick</TE>
<TE>   It's 11 o'clock on a Saturday night and we're sitting on the
couch, waiting for the kids to come home.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Dad," the little girl asks. "Want to hear a song that's
stuck in my head?"</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   "Three little pumpkins sittin' on a fence, a witch comes flying,
flying by," she sings.</TE>
<TE>   Even before this moment, it had been a long day. Three hours on a
sunny soccer field. Like many dads, my forehead is my solar panel. It
tends to hold the heat. So late on a Saturday night, I can close my
eyes and feel the autumn sun in my corneas.</TE>
<TE>   "Three little pumpkins sitting on a fence," the little girl sings.</TE>
<TE>   "Why isn't she in bed?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Want some ice cream?" my wife asks.</TE>
<TE>   Every time I ask a question of substance, I get answered with
another question. I ask her why our youngest child isn't in bed yet.
She asks me about food. Works every time.</TE>
<TE>   "Want some ice cream?" my wife says again.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course," I say.</TE>
<TE>   As the clock ticks, I entertain my wife with gossip from the high
school football game the night before. How I learned that Craig threw
out his back. How Brian sold his house. How another couple had first
gotten pregnant 16 years ago. You can learn a lot at a high school
game, especially when the home team is behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Pregnant on their wedding night?" my wife asks.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what he said."</TE>
<TE>   "That wasn't very good planning," she says.</TE>
<TE>   My wife sits on the couch rubbing her pregnant tummy. She's eight
months along and round as a Christmas ornament. Nineteen years after
our first child, we're having another. How's that for planning?</TE>
<TE>   "What are you going to be for Halloween?" I ask her.</TE>
<TE>   "A big balloon?" asks the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Tony Siragusa?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of these ideas appeals to the pregnant wife. Women, when
they blimp up like this, can be a little sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   "A beach ball?" asks the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Anna Nicole Smith?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   The little girl and I finally decide that her mother should go as
a shoplifter. Because she is not big and puffy the way some pregnant
women get. She is big only in the tummy, as if hiding something under
her shirt.</TE>
<TE>   So what we're recommending is that she paint the very bottom of
her tummy like a basketball, an orange crescent peeking out from
beneath her maternity shirt. Like a basketball shoplifter.</TE>
<TE>   "We could handcuff you too," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "To whom?"</TE>
<TE>   "To me," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be redundant," she says.</TE>
<TE>   It's midnight and we're sitting on the couch, waiting for the kids
to come home.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to bed," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "Already?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Night," she says and disappears into the shadows.</TE>
<TE>   The dog, the one with the vasectomy, is sleeping next to me on the
couch, snoring softly and using my bare knee as a napkin.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, my eyes begin to close. I don't know that I can hold out
till the kids come home. Chances are I'll be sleeping a father's
sleep -- one moment snoring heavily, the next thrashing about as if
making snow angels. That's how I sleep, alternately resting and
exercising.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, Daddy," says the older daughter, leaning over the couch.</TE>
<TE>   At first, I think it is an apparition. My lovely and patient older
daughter home again. It's like a Bergman film. A moment earlier, I
was worrying-dreaming about her. The next moment she is helloing me
awake.</TE>
<TE>   "What time is it?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Want some ice cream?" she asks, heading into the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Why does the oldest kid come home first? What is the younger one
up to? Can Cal beat Oregon State?</TE>
<TE>   These are the questions that occupy fathers late in the night, as
we sit on the couch, nursing our weekend wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Has the stock market finally rebounded? Can I ever retire? Where'd
my wife put that leftover chicken?</TE>
<TE>   On TV, Sam Malone is reaching for the barmaid's hand. Good luck,
pal. She's playing you like a guitar. It's happened to men before.</TE>
<TE>   And on the couch, the dog snores softly, just him and me, waiting
for a kid to come home.</TE>

<LD>The sun's rays carry energy that heat Earth. Some pollution and
certain types of clouds trap the sun's energy. This trapped energy
makes Earth's surface warmer. Other types of clouds and particles in
the air reflect the sun's energy back into space, so Earth doesn't
get that heat.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists are trying to sort out this tug of war between Earth's
heating and cooling. They want to learn how the sun's rays are
affected by both nature and humans.</LD>
<LD>   NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has created a special instrument
called the Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) to help with
this. MISR is one of five instruments on board the Terra satellite,
which has been orbiting Earth since December 1999.</LD>
<TE>   MISR takes pictures of Earth at different angles using nine
cameras -- sort of like a nine-eyed Earth watcher. It carefully
measures the sunlight reflected by clouds, airborne particles and the
different parts of Earth's surface. Scientists are using this
information to gain a better understanding of Earth's environment and
climate.</TE>

<HD>'Arturo Ui' proves hard to resist</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- It was not supposed to be this much fun. There appeared
to be the aura of stunt, of Camp Hollywood hiatus, around the Bertolt
Brecht production that Al Pacino and a mess of indie-film hotshots
were play-acting for a few weeks down at the obscure Pace University
theater, where Tony Randall recently retreated with his scorned
Broadway misnomer, the National Actors Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Although all seats were going for $115, an off-Broadway record,
the press was not even invited to warn the public until we threatened
to storm the barricades. What, we had to wonder, was being hidden in
the unlikely guise of a pre-Broadway work-in-progress?</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks into an extended four-week run, we were grudgingly
allowed in last weekend to be thoroughly surprised and delighted for
almost three hours by Pacino, Steve Buscemi, John Goodman, Dominic
Chianese, Billy Crudup, Chazz Palminteri, Charles Durning and Randall
in "The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui."</LD>
<TE>   Brecht wrote the macabre Chicago gangster-Adolf Hitler parable and
raucous farce in 1941, soon after he began his exile from Germany.
Even without the chilling Nazi parallels, the play connects the
thuggery dots with terrible glee. And the implications of Brecht's
cautionary epilogue are profound.</TE>
<TE>   The hero of this National Actors Theatre production is clearly
Pacino, that wildly eccentric but ever-dedicated stage seeker. This
time Pacino has a real director. Simon McBurney, the visionary
iconoclast from London's popular Complicite theater, runs the huge,
mostly male cast as if he were choreographing a '30s Expressionist
ballet. His high-styled, high-concept multimedia production is a
bad-news circus, a heavily gestural dance of death between the silly
and the unspeakable, the absurd and the strangely beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   Pacino is a hoot as Ui, first a cadaverous old buzzard, a two-bit
Chicago crook who uses the Depression, capitalist corruption and
thugs with tommy guns to control the cauliflower market and, through
protection rackets, catapults himself to the top of grocery crime. As
he continues what Brecht insists is his resistible rise and grows a
familiar little mustache, Ui sheds his old brown leather coat and
plaid pants. But he still seems to have too many teeth in his mouth.
He's still a little man in a big suit -- a cross between Pacino's Big
Boy Caprice from "Dick Tracy" and an adenoidal "Richard III."</TE>
<TE>   Did we mention that even Randall is terrific? He owns the tiny but
pivotal part of the hambone actor, an old bore who teaches the
low-life Ui to orate, to hold his genitals in public and to walk --
toes first, as in a goose step.</TE>
<TE>   McBurney, with the help of George Tabori's playfully disciplined
adaptation, finds just the right quirky characters for his feast of
offbeat actors. Buscemi is creepy with dignity as Givola, the
"florist," the henchman with the clubbed foot and a hip way with the
pole microphone. Durning is endearingly deft and upstandingly
duplicitous as Dogsborough -- Brecht's parallel to Weimar Republic
president Paul Hindenburg -- the mayor who is blackmailed into
comatose complicity.</TE>
<TE>   Goodman is ideally foolish as the evil clown, Giri; Palminteri
plays easily with loyalty as Ui's heavy; and Chianese -- Uncle Junior
to the Soprano clan -- is likably corrupt as the cauliflower mogul.
Crudup does neat double duty as the slick moneyman Flake and the --
Jewish? -- lawyer who defends the communist framed for torching a
warehouse -- echoes of the burning of the Reichstag. Paul Giamatti
has a fabulous moment as a dwarf named Dullfeet, while, as his widow,
underutilized Linda Emond squirms her legs as if they're weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The whole extravaganza is wrapped in Robert Innes Hopkins'
costumes and sets, a simple stage upon a stage upon which worlds are
carved up.</TE>
<TE>   McBurney knows how to get a slow-motion scene to be funny and
scary at the same time. The sounds of Shostakovich churn under the
war newsreels, while projections by Ruppert Bohle make vertigo seem
like narrative. Before this weekend, we scoffed at the ticket price
and talk of a Broadway transfer. No more.</TE>

<LD>I love Movieline's assumption that Rosie O'Donnell is "Most Likely
Rethinking Her Career Right Now." I don't believe this is the case.</LD>
<LD>   Rosie quit her popular TV show because she had made enough money
to be comfortable for life and because she wanted time for her
children and a private, creative career. She has plenty of fish to
fry. Rosie thought her magazine would continue to express her views,
but the fact that it hasn't worked out that way doesn't mean she'll
revise her philosophies.</LD>
<LD>   And, by the way, the Broadway show that Rosie is mounting about
the life of Britain's Boy George, "Taboo," is a big smash in London.
Rosie has the great Charles Busch rewriting it for a U.S. audience.</LD>

<HD>Composer tunes into aural universe</HD>
<DH>Frogs, vacuum cleaners, even bedsprings find their voices
in 'earth' composer's works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Victoria Looseleaf</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anne LeBaron hears music in almost everything: vacuum cleaners,
bellowing frogs and "processed" voices. "I'm fascinated with what you
can do with sound," the composer says. Especially "the sounds we hear
but don't pay attention to."</LD>
<LD>   Her latest musical offering can be heard in the multidisciplinary
theater piece, "On earth as it is in heaven." (Onstage at the 24th
Street Theatre, the play is a meditation on the nature of prayer, and
LeBaron's score includes a live percussionist and a prerecorded
soundtrack that incorporates voices run through electronic changes,
an unusual toy-like harp and, more conventionally, a string quartet
and wind instruments (the Dustbuster and amphibians belong to other
works). The work ripples throughout the play's 60 minutes, making
music that owes something to jazz, gospel, blues and classical
postmodernism.</LD>
<LD>   LeBaron, 49, who was born in Baton Rouge, La., grew up a Southern
Baptist in Tuscaloosa, Ala., which was a factor in her taking on the
project.</LD>
<TE>   "The notion of prayer and how characters deal with it intrigued
me," she says. "It's been part of my life, although I left the
Baptist church and only lately I've been a practicing Episcopalian."</TE>
<TE>   She also was interested in working with Theresa Chavez, director
of "On earth" and its co-writer, along with Laurel Ollstein and Rose
Portillo. Chavez and LeBaron are colleagues at CalArts, where the
composer teaches composition, theory and electronic media. For
LeBaron, the project began last summer, when she met with the four
"On earth" actors.</TE>
<TE>   "I determined what instruments I wanted based on interviews with
each actor. One of the things they worked on was repeating the words
'Why this?,' which I recorded at different tempos, worked with
electronically and turned into a pitched drone. It is in the music,
but you would never know, it seems so integrated," LeBaron explains.</TE>
<TE>   LeBaron's impulse toward such musical integration started early.
Her father, who worked in advertising, for fun played guitar, dobro,
mandolin and banjo, all by ear. LeBaron taught herself to play piano
at age 7.</TE>
<TE>   She studied with a Juilliard-trained teacher when she was a
teenager.</TE>
<TE>   When she enrolled at the University of Alabama, her intent was to
study piano. But she also added harp and was, in her words, "bitten
by the composition bug."</TE>
<TE>   After earning a composition degree in 1974, LeBaron stayed in
Alabama, teaching piano and composing. The next year she attracted
attention when she made a foray into electronic music with "Concerto
for Active Frogs." Scored for saxophone, percussion, string bass and
a chorus of human "frog" voices, the musicians were required to wear
green plastic garbage bags and to interact with a collage tape of
frog vocalizations. The Washington Post praised the work's "flair for
theatricality [and] playful humor."</TE>
<TE>   "It's limited to write only for instrumentalists," she points out,
"I'm drawn to the possibility of hearing something in a context not
expected."</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, as she made her way toward graduate and post-graduate
degrees in composition, LeBaron added a year as a Fulbright scholar,
studying under electronic music pioneer Gyorgy Ligeti, and his
eclecticism underscored her own ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "It was heady," LeBaron says of her time with Ligeti. "His
interests are extremely broad, and it made every person I worked with
seem narrow in comparison."</TE>
<TE>   Her next big piece was a kind of bluesy opera, "The E. &amp; O. Line,"
written in collaboration with librettist and poet Thulani Davis. The
opera resets "Eurydice" from Hades to a small Southern town, where
the ride to the underworld is by train. Included in LeBaron's sonic
bag of tricks were digitally altered bedspring creaks that turn into
train whistles and, in turn, train whistles that morph into human
voices. Selections from it landed on a CD, "The Musical Railism of
Anne LeBaron," which earned five stars from Downbeat, the magazine's
highest rating.</TE>
<TE>   Another early work, "Sacred Theory of the Earth," was completed
for her doctoral thesis at Columbia in the late 1980s. Partly
inspired by a James Gleick book on chaos theory, the work blends
mysticism, science, traditional musical forms and jazz; it has
thrived beyond its premiere, not always a given in the world of new
music. Southwest Chamber Music, for example, plans to perform it in
Los Angeles in February.</TE>
<TE>   And what about vacuum cleaners? "Sauger," a name derived from the
German staubsauger or vacuum cleaner, is a work for trombone and
processed vacuum cleaner and was written during a residency last year
in Bellagio, Italy. The composition was inspired by "The Vacuum
Cleaner," a one-act play written by New York law professor-playwright
Edward DeGrazia. He and LeBaron are reworking it as an absurdist
opera to be performed next year at New York's La Mama Theater.</TE>
<TE>   "You can extract harmonics from vacuum cleaners," LeBaron says.
"We abused them, feeding nails and garbage into these poor vacuums to
get different sounds.... I just like the sustained white noise a
vacuum produces."</TE>
<TE>   All these everyday sonic materials, she says, add to music's
special way of communicating.</TE>
<TE>   "The sonic environment we commonly hear is not just sound, it's
like perfume," LeBaron says. "It goes right to the limbic system of
the brain, it triggers emotions as nothing else can."</TE>

<HD>Setting its sights lower, Sony takes another swing</HD>

<LD>While hardly the kind of anniversary that merits champagne and
flowers, it was one year ago this week that Sony announced plans to
shut down its network TV unit, cutting loose writers tethered to the
studio by lucrative "development deals" and laying off roughly a
fifth of its television-related employees.</LD>
<LD>   Today, if not quite a phoenix rising from the ashes, the
since-renamed Sony Pictures Television is alive and making deals,
while the studio -- indeed, the whole industry -- tries to discern if
it's possible to run something as confounding as prime-time
television like a normal business.</LD>
<LD>   Sony's odyssey is more than a mere academic exercise, but rather
symbolizes the puzzle with which the industry is grappling, one whose
final resolution will dramatically influence network schedules in the
years ahead. Because the bottom line, in an industry devoted to it,
is that networks and studios will be less inclined to give us splashy
dramas and star-driven sitcoms if they can't afford to make them,
inevitably leading to the proliferation of cheaper, unscripted shows
like "Fear Factor" and "The Bachelor" to fill out their lineups.</LD>
<TE>   This equation, combined with the networks' penchant for supplying
their own programming, has gradually taken its toll on independent TV
producers, most of which were either absorbed by bigger players or
folded their tents before Sony joined the procession.</TE>
<TE>   Still, seeing an entity with the Japanese conglomerate's vast
resources forced to retreat -- and resort to significant staff
cutbacks -- was a major wake-up call that the old way of doing
business was broken, and set off tremors from Burbank to Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowing baseball terminology, that system has always been about
home runs. Studios traditionally took plenty of at-bats with new
shows and struck out more often than not in pursuit of the next
elusive blockbuster -- from "Home Improvement" and "Seinfeld" to "ER"
and "CSI" -- that more than pays for all the failures.</TE>
<TE>   Sony had employed this strategy along with everyone else. In the
past decade or so, the studio produced roughly 180 prime-time
prototypes, or pilots. Of those, only five -- "Mad About You," "The
Nanny," "Party of Five," "Dawson's Creek," and "King of Queens" --
became series that endured long enough to generate 100 episodes, the
requisite number to cash in by selling reruns into syndication.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being a major studio, Sony also played this long-odds game
of long ball with a significant handicap. Federal law prohibits a
foreign company from owning more than 25% of a broadcast property. So
while Viacom and Disney gobbled up CBS and ABC, respectively, and
quickly filled those networks with their own productions, Sony found
itself increasingly relegated to the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Sony sought to counter this dynamic by paying millions to sign
deals with established writers and producers, assuming networks would
clamor to be in business with them. The hits, however, didn't keep
pace with that investment, and eventually the corporate types decided
to clean house.</TE>
<TE>   All of which brings us to the present and the studio's one-time
head of program distribution, Sony Pictures Television President
Steve Mosko, who has spent the last year trying to figure out how to
apply new math, as it were, to the TV business.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, given the calendar, Mosko returned to the
baseball analogy.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think our success is predicated on hitting the home run,"
he said during an interview at the studio in Culver City. "We're like
the Angels. We have to execute the basics better than anyone else.
And if we do that, we'll be successful."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Sony was never really out of the television business. The
company produces a wide variety of programs, among them the tandem of
"Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!," the daytime soaps "Days of Our
Lives" and "The Young and the Restless" and cable series such as
"Ripley's Believe It or Not," which the company is offering to local
TV stations for 2003. Sony is also developing a series with the
popular online auction site EBay.</TE>
<TE>   Still, trying to tackle network prime time had left mighty Sony
gasping for air. Sure, there were ongoing shows such as "King of
Queens" and "The Guardian," but all the studio ended up doing,
ultimately, was throw money at a longshot business.</TE>
<TE>   Mosko said Sony executives have spent the last year deciding what
makes sense, trying to "look at the business in a much more
financially disciplined way" and find models where Sony can deliver
solid singles and doubles without needing to swing for the fences.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, that has included inching back into prime time, from a
proposed comedy series that Adam Sandler would produce for the WB
network to a new drama for Fox from the producers of "Party of Five."</TE>
<TE>   "It took us some number of months, as it related specifically to
network prime time, to sort of come to how we would approach it,"
said Russ Krasnoff, Sony's president of programming and production.
"The notion was, can we apply the creative and financial discipline
that we had in cable to the network business, but they're not always
equivalent."</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to be smarter about how we produce ... so you don't
have to have 'Seinfeld'-type numbers just to break even," Mosko
added.</TE>
<TE>   A few recent factors may also have been to Sony's advantage. In
keeping with Hollywood tradition, the networks simply went nuts with
nepotism, voraciously buying projects from sister studios. Although
this sounds great in theory, when shows fail, as most do, all that
means is the network loses money on two fronts -- both as broadcaster
and producer.</TE>
<TE>   Networks still want to produce most of their programs and reap the
benefits of owning hits, but even ABC executives admitted they didn't
do themselves any favors this year by letting Disney produce roughly
90% of their series candidates.</TE>
<TE>   A related issue, meanwhile, is the fact that those networks which
own studios seldom trust studios that own competing networks to treat
them squarely -- a bit of paranoia given teeth when 20th Century Fox
moved "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" from the WB to UPN.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Sony gets to position itself as Switzerland, a
neutral combatant, friendly to all. "We're everybody's
second-favorite supplier," Krasnoff said. "The favorite is
themselves, without question. But we're second."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, "we're No. 2" is hardly the kind of proud banner one
expects to see flying in a ballpark, much less a corporate
prospectus. Still, in a TV business in which singles are about the
most anyone can realistically aspire to, the rules of the game are
changing, a reality that is altering the view on the field, and from
the cheap seats.</TE>

<HD>Borne out by Angels</HD>
<DH>Once maligned, Jackie Autry is riding high now that the
team she helped build is in the Series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hilary E. MacGregor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody liked her. They slammed her as cheap and mean, a tightwad
former banker with a teller's personality, married to the sweet old
singing cowboy who would have done anything to see his team win the
World Series. That was the rap on Gene Autry's wife, who essentially
ran the Angels from 1991 to 1996, when the team was sold to Disney.
And as the media turned on her, Jackie Autry, always a private
person, simply retreated from the public eye.</LD>
<LD>   Today, four years after the death of the Cowboy, with the Angels
in the World Series for the first time, she's suddenly back in the
spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   "She has become a celebrity now that they don't own the team
anymore," Stan Schneider, the Autrys' family accountant for 40 years,
said with a cackle last week.</LD>
<TE>   Angel fans went wild when she appeared on Edison Field after the
team won the American League championship, and outfielder Tim Salmon
sprayed her with champagne. She struggled to juggle the endless media
requests following that win. And after donning her husband's number
26 jersey -- awarded to him by the team to symbolize the Angels' 26th
man -- she stepped onto the mound on Saturday to throw out the first
pitch of the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   It was a sinker, but no one cared.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, everybody loves her.</TE>
<TE>   'Owner in training'</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Ellam met Gene Autry when she was vice president at
Security Pacific National Bank in Palm Springs, handling the Autry
hotel account. Shortly after his first wife died, Gene asked Jackie
on a date. He had married his first wife after just three nights out,
and he quickly decided he wanted Jackie.</TE>
<TE>   "About two weeks after we started dating, he asked me to come into
his office and have a seat," she recalled. "He asked me, 'Do you
believe in big weddings or small weddings?' "</TE>
<TE>   Honorary Hollywood Mayor Johnny Grant, who met Autry in the Army
Air Corps in '44 and later worked in his radio and television
stations, said Autry called him on a Sunday morning and asked,
"Tiger, do you know a preacher? Jackie and I want to get married
today." Grant replied: "You want me to get you a preacher? It's
Sunday. They're all working." But Autry persisted, so Grant went to
services at his Methodist church and persuaded his clergyman to
perform the ceremony afterward. It was July 1981. She was 39. He was
73.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, Gene Autry groomed Jackie to take over the
team, sometimes referring to her as the "owner in training."</TE>
<TE>   Jackie was good raw material: She had played hardball herself as a
girl, back in parochial school in Ironia, N.J., and knew the nuances
of the game as a player. (She was a center fielder and an "excellent
hitter -- the best on the team," she said.) She was a smart
businesswoman who could read spreadsheets and make sound financial
decisions. And she was a real sports fan. Before marrying Gene she
was a football devotee, able to recite the names of players, their
stats and their histories as well as any guy.</TE>
<TE>   When the two of them would go to the games in Anaheim, it was
Jackie who went crazy in the owners' box, while Gene stood by,
outwardly stoic. "I'm the screamer and yeller," said Jackie, who
admits she does not like to lose. "He would turn to me and say, 'Talk
to 'em, baby.' "</TE>
<TE>   Grant said it was a good thing Jackie liked baseball -- as did
Autry's first wife -- because Autry wasn't about to give up the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Being with Gene, and baseball, worked into a great love for her,"
added Monte Hale, a close friend of the Autrys and a fellow singing
cowboy. Hale said that when they drove home after games, Jackie would
put on western music -- Autry or Patsy Cline. "Win or lose, it didn't
make a difference, the four of us would sing," said Joanne Hale,
Monte's wife.</TE>
<TE>   A 5-year plan</TE>
<TE>   By 1991, Jackie carried the title of executive vice president and
was a member of the board of directors. While her control of the
Autrys' holdings had steadily increased, her public profile remained
low -- until she began to try to curb the team's losses by favoring
home-grown players over high-priced free agents.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat down in the spring with the beat writers," she recalled. "I
started talking about where baseball was going. I talked to them
about the future of baseball, the economics of baseball. I used the
word 'budget.' This word had never come up in baseball before."</TE>
<TE>   The team was competitive. She and Richard Brown -- the team
president from 1990 to 1996 -- knew there were only two courses of
action: grow talent through the farm system with a five-year plan, or
spend the money to buy a pennant, like the Florida Marlins did.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Autry opted for the former, and was brutally specific. "If
we try to retain all of our young men that are going to be free
agents in the off-season, and try to deal with arbitration as well,
we're going to be losing $8 million to $10 million next year," she
told the Los Angeles Times in a story headlined "Wife of the Angels'
Owner Says Bottom Line Now Must Come First." "Gene has said, 'I
refuse to raise ticket prices again.' Well, now you've got a
problem."</TE>
<TE>   At a time when no one talked about spiraling player salaries, and
it was suggested that many owners would gladly write a $10-million
check to see their team win the World Series, her comments amounted
to baseball sacrilege. She became the whipping girl for three decades
of pent-up Angel-fan frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone loved Gene. The fans. The players. The owners," Jackie
said. "They all wanted Gene to win a World Series. They thought the
best way to do this was a quick fix, to go out and get the players
for the Cowboy, because he's not going to be around next year."</TE>
<TE>   Jackie disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "That is where I started being called cheap," she said. "They said
I was not willing to win, I was not willing to go out and get free
agents."</TE>
<TE>   The five-year plan was supposed to reach fruition in 1995, Brown
said. That year the Angels tied for the division championship but
lost a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Complete authority</TE>
<TE>   In 1992 Jackie Autry publicly acknowledged that she had been given
complete authority by her husband to run the club.</TE>
<TE>   Brown remembers those as difficult times.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Jackie looked at baseball economics as sick," he said. "I
think now -- even Commissioner Bud Selig pointed out eight or nine
months ago that out of 30 teams, six teams are on the verge of
bankruptcy, 16 to 18 weren't making money. She could look at it
unemotionally. With her head and not her heart. She could see that
baseball was not going to get better in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't forget, 'fan' is short for 'fanatic,' " he added. "A fan
looks at a baseball team and they say, 'I don't care who owns it. I
just want the team to do well. I don't care if they can't afford it.
Sell it to someone who can.' "</TE>
<TE>   Schneider, the family accountant, is more blunt: "She got blamed
for things that were never her fault. The ballclub did not cut
budgets to the detriment of the team. But because she was not going
out and going crazy, everyone said, 'You are not willing to spend the
money.' It was easy to blame the new woman on the block."</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Autry stuck to her guns, working with Brown to develop
talent on farm teams, traveling the country and scouting for the
best. By the time the Autrys sold the Angels to the Walt Disney Co.
in 1996 for $140 million (and Disney spent another $98 million to
renovate Edison Field), they had built up the beginnings of a good
team, including some players on the World Series' lineup, such as Tim
Salmon, Darin Erstad, Garret Anderson and Troy Percival.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who knew what I was going through see my babies out there,"
said Jackie, who admits she started bawling when she heard the Angels
won the wild-card playoff spot. "I was sitting at home watching them
on television and they started jumping up and down and I couldn't
help it. I started to cry. I called my office and they were all
crying. My assistant had gone through a box of Kleenex."</TE>
<TE>   'She was right'</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Autry is a strong woman. Schneider said if she had been
born in another time she would have been a trailblazer in the Wild
West. But in the years since the Cowboy died she has devoted her
energies almost completely to honoring Gene Autry's name and memory.
She attends Angels' games like a Little League mother (the Walt
Disney Co. allowed her use of the owner's box at Edison Field for the
rest of her life), and blew up two photos of Gene at the height of
his career, in his number 26 jersey, and hung them from her box so
every fan in the stadium could see. She is chairman of the Autry
Museum of Western Heritage, and maintains an office in Studio City to
make sure Autry's music and films stay alive. All this as well as
serving as honorary American League president of major league
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "She is the best thing that ever happened to him," Schneider said.
"I'm a personal believer that she kept him alive as long as he
lived."</TE>
<TE>   Some who have watched the Angels head to the World Series say that
when the fans go crazy for Jackie Autry, they are cheering for the
Cowboy. But many of those closest to her see the team's arrival after
42 years as a win not just for him, but for his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "She was terribly maligned," said Joanne Hale, co-founder of the
Autry Museum. "I think part of the reason was because she was a woman
talking about baseball. But she had good, sound business sense.
Everything that she said and espoused has become fact. It is what all
the owners are saying now, but she started it. She was right. She was
damn right. Her business sense and philosophy relating to baseball
was right on track. I want this win for Jackie."</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, Jackie Autry always speaks of Gene, of how he is looking
down and smiling, of how happy he would be if he could just see his
team now. But she knows what she did. Privately, she feels
vindicated.</TE>
<TE>   "When I threw out the first ball at one of the Seattle games, they
were all standing and cheering," she said. "I don't think those
people understand. I think they see me as representing the Cowboy.
They don't recognize that my way was the right way."</TE>

<HD>Catholic groups target film about clerical misdeeds</HD>
<DH>'Father Amaro,' Mexico's highest- grossing native film,
spurs protests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Crime of Father Amaro," a movie that caused an uproar among
conservative Catholics when it was released this summer in its native
Mexico, has prompted a flurry of protest among some Catholic groups
in the U.S., with hundreds of angry letters and postcards flooding
the offices of the film's U.S. distributor in the last few days.</LD>
<LD>   A conservative Catholic lay group, American Society for the
Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, has mounted the protest,
and its members say they intend to picket theaters when the film
rolls out in the U.S. beginning Nov. 15.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 80,000 people have been asked through mass mailings to
participate in the first phase of the protest, which involves signing
and sending postcards to Samuel Goldwyn Films. The American Society,
known as TFP, targeted Latino Catholics for the letter-writing
campaign.</LD>
<TE>   The film, which became Mexico's highest-grossing native film, is
based on a 19th century Portuguese novel by Jose Maria Eca de Queiroz
but is set in contemporary Mexico. It stars Gael Garcia Bernal as an
ambitious priest who begins an illicit affair with a young
parishioner, with tragic results. The movie also deals with issues
confronting many Mexican priests, including accepting large donations
from drug dealers and aiding guerrilla activities in more rural and
impoverished areas.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Ritchie, director of the TFP-affiliated America Needs
Fatima group, concedes he has not seen the film but has read from
newspaper accounts that some of the scenes could be considered
blasphemous.</TE>
<TE>   He finds particularly offensive a scene in which the priest and
the young woman make love under the mantel of Our Lady of Guadalupe.</TE>
<TE>   "There are millions of Catholics who are offended by this film,"
Ritchie contended from his organization's headquarters in Hanover,
Pa. The group's postcards, which arrived by the hundreds at the Los
Angeles Times as well, list several objections to scenes in the film,
including one in which the priest urges the woman to have an abortion
and one in which a communion host is eaten by a cat.</TE>
<TE>   Ritchie claimed the organization has an additional 250,000 members
who will be asked to participate in the protest in coming days. He
plans to turn the protest into a moral crusade of sorts, asking
Catholics nationwide to boycott the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to protest this and will go out in front of
theaters when this film is shown. There will be a lot of negative
publicity for the studio," Ritchie said. "We will make this into a
moral decision, and that is where a lot of people won't go; all of a
sudden it is not just fun entertainment anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Director Carlos Carrera defended his film.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fictional film. We know there are good priests and bad
priests," he said Tuesday in a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledged that much of the story line is adapted from
from widely reported scandals besieging the Catholic clergy and
hierarchy in Mexico and elsewhere. "All of this behavior seen in the
film has happened in reality," Carrera said. "None of this is a lie
or a part of our imagination.... I think it's very healthy for the
Catholic Church to discuss some of these problems and not let this
questionable behavior off the hook."</TE>
<TE>   Meyer Gottlieb, president of Goldwyn, said he has received scores
of letters and is alarmed by their anti-Semitic tone.</TE>
<TE>   "What I find offensive is that they are taking the leap that I am
only doing this because I am Jewish," Gottlieb said.. "Everyone can
have an opinion about a film. But the thing that I object to [is the
insinuation] that ... if I wasn't Jewish I wouldn't be releasing this
movie, which is of course absurd."</TE>
<TE>   One such handwritten letter from a man in Manchester, Conn.: "I am
sure you don't plan on showing rabbis or Jews in a compromising
position, but your hatred is vented against the Savior who gave his
life to redeem mankind for their sins."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how much sway the American Society holds among
mainstream Catholics. Even fellow activists like William Donahue,
president of the Catholic League, a watchdog organization that keeps
tabs on what it considers anti-Catholic messages in the media and
popular culture, dismiss the American Society as a "fringe cultish
group."</TE>
<TE>   Donahue's group has spearheaded protests against the Brooklyn
Museum for a controversial art show and Kevin Smith's film "Dogma"
and plans to campaign against Miramax's "The Magdalene Sisters," the
Venice International Film Festival prize-winner about an asylum run
by Irish nuns, due out next year.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Donahue wrote a letter to Gottlieb asking to see "The
Crime of Father Amaro." He said he will decide if his organization
will participate in a protest after his representative sees the film
Nov. 4. Donahue said he doubts he will ask for picketing of the film
outside theaters, although he is concerned about the tone of the
film, which bishops in Mexico unsuccessfully pressured the government
to ban: "There are a number of things there that raised our
eyebrows," he said.</TE>

<HD>A house at stake, an attitude in flux</HD>
<DH>The battle over preservation of an Oscar Niemeyer home
shows a region waking up to cultural needs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicolai Ouroussoff</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Political maneuvering, legal threats--preservation can be a nasty
business.</LD>
<LD>   The latest example can be found in a dispute over the fate of a
sleek, glass-and-steel residence designed in 1963 by Brazilian
Modernist Oscar Niemeyer. Last spring, the house, which stands on a
choice parcel of land in Santa Monica overlooking the Riviera Country
Club, was sold for $3.4 million by its original owner, Anne Strick,
to local developer Jon Monkarsh.</LD>
<LD>   But soon after, neighbors learned that Monkarsh planned to tear
down the 4,500-square-foot house and replace it with a more imposing
residence. When a local architect, James Schwentker, caught wind of
Monkarsh's plan, he contacted the Los Angeles Conservancy and Santa
Monica's Landmarks Commission. Officials then informed Monkarsh that
the commission was considering nominating the house for landmark
status.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, the commission and Monkarsh have signed an agreement
that effectively delays demolition while Monkarsh explores other
options, including selling the house or building an addition that
would satisfy landmarks officials. (Monkarsh would not return several
phone calls for this story.)</TE>
<TE>   What is at stake is a significant architectural landmark.
Niemeyer, a disciple of Modernist architect Le Corbusier, is a
well-known figure in South American architecture. Among the greatest
of his works is the 1942 Casino at Pampulha, Brazil, whose flowing
interiors were once described by architectural scholar Kenneth
Frampton as an expression of "an elaborate game ... as intricate as
the habits of the society it was intended to serve."</TE>
<TE>   The architect is best known for his design of Brazilia, the vast
Modernist city whose looming abstract structures and sterile plazas
became an emblem of modern alienation.</TE>
<TE>   Strick hired Niemeyer in 1963, a few years after Brazilia was
completed. Since the U.S. government refused to grant the professed
Communist a visa, he was forced to design the house without visiting
the site. The plans were completed by a local architect, Ulrich
Plaut. The interior was designed by Amir Farr.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, in its sensuality, the house is closer to Niemeyer's
early work than to the colder visions of his later years. It is also
his only known residential commission in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The house is designed in a T-shape, with the top of the T set
perpendicular to the street. Visitors slip along one arm of the T
under a narrow trellis before entering the double-height living room
and kitchen area. The two bedroom wings extend out from this central
space.</TE>
<TE>   This layout creates a subtle hierarchy of public and private
zones. The kitchen and dining area -- set at the intersection of the
structure's three arms -- becomes the house's communal focal point.
From the living room, a stunning view opens out across a rectangular
swimming pool to the Santa Monica Mountains. The children's wing, by
comparison, is remarkably tranquil, with light filtering down through
narrow clerestory windows.</TE>
<TE>   There are other quintessentially modern themes here. The house's
hedonistic aura, for example, stems from its careful blend of indoor
and outdoor spaces. Its long, sleek lines reach out to embrace the
surrounding landscape, framing a series of outdoor rooms. In back,
the pool, nestled between the living area and master bedroom,
projects toward the edge of a hill, drawing the eye out to the
languorous mountain views.</TE>
<TE>   But the house also occupies a critical place in the history of
L.A. architecture. During the early and mid-20th century, architects
in places as disparate as Brazil, Southern California and North
Africa often looked to each other for examples of how to adapt the
Modern aesthetic to a tropical climate.</TE>
<TE>   Niemeyer stood at the cutting edge of that experiment, and his
influence can be felt in the later works of such architects as John
Lautner, whose compositions of concrete and glass made him a major
force in L.A. architecture in the 1950s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   As such, the Santa Monica house embodies a rare link between the
city's Modernist tradition and a broader cultural conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Such connections may be lost on many of Southern California's
homeowners. In the last year alone, several significant landmarks
have been demolished, including Rudolf Schindler's Wolf House on
Catalina and Richard Neutra's Maslon House in Palm Springs. In Santa
Monica, a group of homeowners is lobbying for a ballot measure that
would effectively ban the creation of historic districts in the area,
something that would deal a serious blow to the preservationists'
cause. The landmark commission's willingness to negotiate with
Monkarsh over the Niemeyer house's future can be seen as a reflection
of its desire to avoid the homeowners' ire.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the strength of L.A.'s preservation movement is
clearly growing. And if there is a benefit to such brazen cultural
violence, it is that it awakened many people to the vulnerability of
our architectural treasures. The destruction of the Maslon House, in
particular, was met with a national outcry. Given that changing
climate, it is less likely that a homeowner such as Monkarsh would
take the risk of being labeled a cultural barbarian.</TE>
<TE>   Some homeowners may see this as evidence of the erosion of their
sacred property rights. It is, in fact, a sign of the region's
growing cultural maturity.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>All those World Series promos for Fox's "Girls Club" were apparently
scant inducement for viewers to tune in Monday, as the new legal
series from producer David E. Kelley was virtually thrown out of
court, ratings-wise.</LD>
<LD>   Based on Nielsen Media Research estimates, the show attracted a
mere 5.8 million viewers and finished fifth in its time slot, just
behind the WB's new drama "Everwood." "Girls Club" also plummeted
more than 40% off the Fox series preceding it, the season premiere of
Kelley's "Boston Public."</LD>
<LD>   By comparison, "Ally McBeal" -- another Kelley-produced series
that "Girls Club" replaced -- drew nearly 11 million viewers for its
premiere last year. The weaker competition proved a boon to NBC's
"Third Watch," as the rescue drama averaged 12.4 million viewers, its
biggest audience this season.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, Fox announced that the sitcom "Andy Richter Controls
the Universe" will return to its lineup Dec. 1, airing Sundays after
"Malcolm in the Middle." "The Grubbs," a new sitcom starring Randy
Quaid, had been penciled in for that slot but has been delayed
indefinitely. Fox previously reduced the number of episodes ordered
on "Grubbs," reflecting a lack of faith in the series.</TE>

<LD>The British government on Tuesday announced hikes in its annual
funding for the British Museum that will help the cash-strapped
institution move forward with reforms and reopen galleries now closed
to the public, the BBC reported.</LD>
<LD>   The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said it would give the
museum nearly $57 million in 2004, an increase of 1.5%, plus an extra
$619,000 in 2003 for opening more galleries. Government funding will
rise to $58.5 million in 2005-06.</LD>

<LD>UCLA Performing Arts has canceled tonight's performance of "Quick
Lime," a play by the Dutch company ZT Hollandia, because stage sets
may not arrive in time from Holland due to the recent dockworkers
strike at West Coast ports.</LD>
<LD>   Spokeswoman Krista Fleischner said the sets are in Long Beach and
would not be unloaded until early today. UCLA Performing Arts decided
not to risk the sets' arrival at the Freud Playhouse, where "Quick
Lime" is scheduled, in time for the 8 p.m. curtain. "ZT Hollandia was
not late in sending the sets," she said, noting that although the
strike has been temporarily halted, the backlog of cargo has led to
continued delays.</LD>
<LD>   The port strike also delayed delivery of sets for the L.A. Opera
production of "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk." The opera is building its
own sets for that production, which opens tonight.</LD>
<TE>   Ticket holders for tonight's show should call the UCLA box office
at (310) 825-2101 to reschedule for Friday or Saturday night or to
receive a refund.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Random House is making an offer it hopes a worthy author won't
refuse: resurrecting the "Godfather" characters immortalized by Mario
Puzo.</LD>
<LD>   "I love 'The Godfather' and just kept thinking about those
characters. I wanted to see more," Jonathan Karp, a vice president
and executive editor at Random House, said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In an e-mail to literary agents last week, Karp wrote that he was
looking for "someone who is in roughly the same place in life Mario
Puzo was when he wrote 'The Godfather' at mid-career, with two
acclaimed literary novels to his credit, who writes in a commanding
and darkly comic omniscient voice." Puzo died in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Many consider the movie versions superior to the book, but Karp's
message emphasizes that "the original Puzo novel -- not the films --
are the basis for this sequel. The author can either create a story
that occurs after the events in the novel or concurrent with them."</TE>

<LD>Former Broadway theater producers Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb
each were charged Tuesday in Canada with 19 counts of fraud for
allegedly doctoring financial statements of Livent Inc., their
now-bankrupt company.</LD>
<LD>   Two others also were charged in the case that involved alleged
fraud of $322 million, one of the largest in Canadian history, said
Detective Inspector Craig Hannaford of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. Livent was one of the major Broadway theater companies in the
1990s, producing hit shows such as "Ragtime" and "Fosse."</LD>
<LD>   Drabinsky and Gottlieb also face fraud and conspiracy charges in
the United States, where they are accused of stealing $4.6 million
from Livent during the 1990s and manipulating company financial
records to hide it. Both have denied any wrongdoing. The company
filed for bankruptcy protection in November 1998.</LD>

<HD>Appellate court ruling boosts Getty Villa expansion plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the administrators of the J. Paul Getty Trust, an epic drama
turned toward a happy ending Monday. After years of contention, a
state appellate court has cleared the way for the Getty to add a
450-seat outdoor theater and make other changes at its villa in
Pacific Palisades.</LD>
<LD>   For the villa's traffic-and-noise-wary neighbors, the three-judge
panel's ruling was a blow, and many spent Tuesday poring over the
51-page opinion. Attorneys said an appeal to the state Supreme Court
is possible. The neighbors' attorney, John Murdock, did not return
phone calls.</LD>
<LD>   "We're disappointed," said Kelly Comras, who lives about a block
and a half from the villa and is past president of the Castellammare
Mesa Homeowners Assn. "The neighbors have never been opposed to the
Getty per se. It was the increase in parking and the theater."</LD>
<TE>   The appellate court's decision, which follows more than five
months of consideration, overturns a 2000 decision by Superior Court
Judge Dzintra Janavs, who ruled that the Los Angeles City Council
improperly approved the Getty's plans for the 450-seat theater when
it waived zoning restrictions. The appeals panel found that the city
acted within its authority.</TE>
<TE>   With the ruling, said Peter Erichsen, vice president of and
general counsel to the J. Paul Getty Trust, the villa's
conditional-use permit can be reinstated, and the organization can
obtain building permits. It's too soon to set a construction
timetable, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The 64-acre Getty villa site has been a legal battleground for
nearly three decades. Oil magnate J. Paul Getty first opened the
villa to public visits in 1974 -- without the city's permission.
Neighbors sued.</TE>
<TE>   The result, a year later, was a settlement in which the city
granted the Getty a conditional-use permit, and a neighbors' group
agreed that Getty visitors could leave the property via an easement
on its property.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Getty's operations were closely limited,
including visitor traffic. Parking reservations were required -- a
measure that's not expected to change.</TE>
<TE>   As new conditional-use permits were granted, the Getty villa
operation evolved into a museum complex of 134,000 square feet, 291
parking spaces and a seldom-used garden performance space
accommodating 450 guests.</TE>
<TE>   With the opening of the Getty Center in Brentwood in 1997, the
villa was closed and Getty officials set in motion the $150-million
expansion plan that led to this week's court decision.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the villa complex would grow to 210,000 square feet,
including a new restaurant to replace the site's old tea room,
expansion of the bookstore and renovation of museum galleries for
display of the Getty antiquities collection.</TE>
<TE>   The new outdoor theater, which will replace the garden performance
space, may be used up to 45 nights a year, outside regular museum
hours. Plans also call for boosting parking spaces to 560.</TE>
<TE>   In rejecting objections to the plan, the appellate court noted
that the villa's attendance, about 400,000 visitors a day through
1997, "is expected to remain static or to decrease" because of the
villa's new, narrower focus on antiquities.</TE>

<KH>ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL: CINDY SIMON</KH>
<HD>Wall Street to Main Street</HD>
<DH>Cindy Simon, former Democrat and bond trader, campaigns
without controversy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicholas Riccardi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>San Diego</DL>
<LD>Cindy Simon seems like a natural today, standing behind a podium in a
posh ballroom, talking about business policies like workers'
compensation reform and bashing Gov. Gray Davis. But a year ago, she
had never made a political speech, and this group -- the Conservative
Order for Good Government, open only to registered Republicans --
would not have had her as a member.</LD>
<LD>   Simon, a child of suburban Illinois and former Wall Street bond
trader, was a Democrat until she switched to the GOP last year so she
could vote for her husband, Bill Simon Jr., in the Republican primary
for governor. Uneasy at first with his decision to run for office,
she has thrown herself into the campaign with the same practical,
hands-on enthusiasm that has marked many of her other unexpected
turns. "When she embraces something," Bill Simon said in an
interview, "she does it enthusiastically."</LD>
<LD>   With a red, elephant-checkered scarf dangling around her neck, she
tells the white-haired Conservative Order crowd that "family, faith
and fitness" keep her going each day; that she needs her
early-morning walks more than ever during the hurly-burly of
campaigning; that California is falling apart under the Davis
administration; and that the state is desperately in need of the
expertise her husband can bring to Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, the questions start on a high note. "At our table,
we've decided you would make a great U.S. first lady," says one man.
Simon beams.</TE>
<TE>   But soon, things get complicated. The next questioner says Simon's
husband looked bad in his debate against Davis, and a woman rises and
asks for Bill Simon's position "on the homosexual agenda and gay
marriage."</TE>
<TE>   Simon freezes at the podium. It's a touchy topic -- her husband
was barraged with criticism for first pledging to back gay marriage,
then reversing his position after his conservative supporters cried
foul.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really feel prepared to talk about that issue," she says,
hesitantly. But unlike a more experienced campaigner, she doesn't let
it end it there. "Bill is a man of inclusion.... We'll get you that
position. I'm not sure what it is."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, 47, likes to call herself her husband's best advocate. "The
person who seems even more comfortable on stage than Bill and seems
able to communicate her effervescent personality is Cindy," said John
Morrissey, a friend and neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Until the campaign, her full-time job was raising their children:
William, 14; Lindsay, 13; and Griffith, 10. Now she can spend 18-hour
days on the road, sometimes holding more public appearances than her
husband, whose campaign has been dogged by missteps. She wolfs down a
sandwich or edamame beans before lunch speeches so she can talk to
people. She describes it as a dream job for a biography junkie who
devours obituaries because she is fascinated by people's life
stories.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel privileged to meet all these people across the state,"
Simon said in an interview. In an online journal she keeps for the
campaign, she elaborates: "Was I really flying on Air Force One? Did
I really share a joke with Condoleezza Rice? Was I really standing up
there on the stage next to my husband Bill, hands clasped in front of
me in nervous excitement, while he proudly proclaimed his victory
speech on primary night?"</TE>
<TE>   Woman of many roles</TE>
<TE>   To her friends and family, Simon's charm is that she has managed
to play many roles while remaining the same down-home Illinois native
who, after 12 years on L.A.'s Westside, still gets excited when she
spots a celebrity at her local supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   "While she's been able to accomplish all these things and do all
these incredible things, she's still Cindy," said her younger sister,
Julie Head. "She's just very natural and down to earth."</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Louise Stewart was raised in Oak Park, a middle-class
suburb of Chicago. Her father, Glen, was a manager at Sunbeam; her
mother, Dorothy, worked briefly as a teacher but spent most of her
time raising her three children.</TE>
<TE>   Two forces dominated the household: local service and the
basketball team at Indiana University, which every member of the
Stewart clan had attended or would. The family gathered around the
television during the season to root for Indiana; they also stood
together at elevated-train stops to hand out fliers for Glen
Stewart's successful campaign for the local Parks Council.</TE>
<TE>   At Indiana, Cindy majored in sociology. Many of her classmates
were focused on getting jobs after graduation; she was more
interested in learning about other people. It was pure happenstance
that put her on a track to Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   The summer after her freshman year, Cindy joined her parents at a
church picnic and met a representative from the financial firm Kidder
Peabody. He offered her an internship in Chicago that paid 25 cents
an hour more than her previous summer job, at the Schwinn bike
factory.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy was soon fascinated by investment banking and the energy
coursing through the high-rises of Chicago's financial district. She
decided she would move to New York after graduation and pursue a
career on Wall Street. She interviewed at Kidder Peabody her senior
year.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1977, and women were just entering the investment banking
field. Cindy recalls the man who interviewed her at Kidder Peabody
proposing that she start as a secretary and work her way up the
ladder. "I said 'No, no, no, I want to be on the trading desk,' "
Simon recalled.</TE>
<TE>   That's where she ended up, and her reliability, level-headedness
and attitude impressed many of her co-workers, including a young man
named Peter Simon, one of two sons of Richard Nixon's former Treasury
secretary. "She came to New York City and came to a trading desk, the
male chauvinist capital of the world at that point," Peter Simon
recalled in an interview. "She didn't care. It's not like she was
arrogant, she was just, 'Hey, I'm here to learn.' "</TE>
<TE>   Because all members of the trading desk used the same phone lines,
Cindy occasionally picked up calls from Peter's older brother, Bill.
At a Kidder Peabody party, Peter introduced his brother to Cindy. "I
was introduced to her as, 'Oh, this is Cindy that you've been talking
to for years and years,' " Bill Simon recalled. "I remember thinking
to myself, man, she's cute."</TE>
<TE>   About a year later, in 1985, Cindy had just ended a relationship,
and Peter leaped into action. He called his brother and told him that
this was his chance. Bill made a date with Cindy, then realized it
would conflict with a game in the NCAA basketball tournament's Final
Four. A sports fanatic, Bill kicked himself for not offering to meet
her somewhere at 8 p.m., after the match, but gamely knocked on her
door at the agreed-upon 6:30.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy recalls answering the door: "Hey Bill, hi, it's really great
to see you, but can you wait a couple of minutes? Because I want to
watch the rest of the basketball game."</TE>
<TE>   The couple married in Oak Park two years later. Soon after, Simon
became pregnant with her first child. She took a maternity leave from
her post, now vice president at Kidder Peabody, and never returned.
Bill and Peter were about to go into business with their father, and
someone needed to move from the East Coast to run the California
office. Bill and Cindy went to Los Angeles to check it out.</TE>
<TE>   "People used to say to me, 'How long did it take you to get used
to living in California?'" she said. "The 30 seconds it took me to
get off the plane."</TE>
<TE>   Simon became a fixture in her Pacific Palisades neighborhood,
throwing herself into local projects like beautifying son Willy's
elementary school and organizing coffee gatherings for parents there.
She also helped her husband disburse some of the family fortune into
charitable projects as a member of the Cindy and William E. Simon
Charitable Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "She jumps in and she isn't one of the people who says, 'Let me
write you a check and go away,' " said Donna Fol, a friend and
neighbor. "She'll go pull weeds in some area that's being
beautified."</TE>
<TE>   A 'partnership'</TE>
<TE>   In a speech to hundreds of local government officials at the Long
Beach Convention Center last month, Bill Simon laid out a picture of
his marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "I take care of all the major decisions, and my wife takes care of
everything else," he said. "I define major decisions as: What is the
family's stance on the federal trade deficit? What is the family's
stance on national unemployment? What is the family's stance on
Taiwan? ... Everything else, I follow her lead."</TE>
<TE>   The line drew big laughs from the crowd, but friends say it is a
pretty good description of the Simons' home life. That has been
apparent in the governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon told his wife about his interest in running during the
winter holidays of 2000. Both knew it would mean a big change for the
family.</TE>
<TE>   "We really have this partnership, and I really felt it was
important to him -- so let's do it," Cindy Simon said. "I could have
easily said, 'What are you talking about? We have this life.' "</TE>
<TE>   Though she accompanied him on some early forays, Simon spent the
first half of her husband's campaign far from the public eye. She
mostly stayed home and helped the kids with homework.</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of 2000, when former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan
announced he wanted to be the Republican nominee for governor, some
of Riordan's supporters suggested that Simon should get out of the
race or shoot for a lower office, like lieutenant governor or
treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   "Cindy said, 'Nah, if you're going to go for it, go for it,' "
recalled Bill Simon. "She said, 'You've just told everybody you want
to be governor for a, b and c, and now you're going to tell them you
want to be lieutenant governor for e, f and g. Who's going to believe
you?' "</TE>
<TE>   It was not until Bill Simon won the primary -- surging 60 points
in the polls in two months -- that Cindy Simon truly saw what her
husband was getting into. His siblings had flown in for the primary
and the clan had dined at home in the Palisades, then crammed into a
van and rode to the hotel outside LAX, where Bill Simon would declare
victory before thousands of supporters and dozens of cameras.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids were watching a movie on the video screen in the van, we
were all excited and talking, then we turned that corner and saw what
looked like hundreds of cameras," Cindy Simon recalled. "There was a
hush in the van, we all felt it.... Bill and I looked at each other
and said, 'OK, here we go.' That was something you never, ever
forget."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Simon has had a steadily increasing role in the
campaign. No longer does she spend her days taking care of her
children's schedules; now she relies on neighbors to carpool.</TE>
<TE>   "This campaign has really showed me what life is like as a working
mother," she told a roundtable of Republican businesswomen in Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Although she is enthusiastic about campaigning, Simon shies away
from talk of politics. She is willing to acknowledge she is
pro-choice -- something her husband, who opposes abortion, has cited
as an example of how he is respectful of differing views on the issue
-- but is hesitant to discuss her views on gay marriage or other
areas where she may differ politically from her spouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly didn't marry Bill because I'm exactly like him," she
said. "There's so much more to Bill than a label."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband says that having Cindy on the trail has strengthened
them both.</TE>
<TE>   "Previously, I went to the office in the morning and went on
business trips and she was home, and we would kind of hook up at
night and chat about our respective days," he said. "Now ... its kind
of like we're partners in an enterprise."</TE>

<LD>You were silly like us: your gift survived it all</LD>
<LD>   -- W.H. Auden ("In Memory of W.B. Yeats")</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   As the governors of California and New Jersey now have discovered,
living poets can be as inconvenient as they are stirring.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike their dead colleagues -- whose well-bound and edited
"selected works" are a reliable source of eloquent platform allusions
and uplifting wedding party sentiments -- living poets frequently
behave like, well, poets.</TE>
<TE>   Some are prone to confuse the prophetic with extravagant
foolishness. Many believe that the ecstatic and the orgiastic are
subjects just as suitable as the edifying. Some are sinister fools.
Many others are in the process of living the same sort of messy,
contradictory lives as everyone else -- though usually more
poetically.</TE>
<TE>   Auden himself was no stranger to those facts. Neither are Quincy
Troupe, 62, who resigned last week as California's first official
poet laureate, and Amiri Baraka, 67, who is locked in a fight to the
finish to hold on to the same post in New Jersey. There already is a
tendency to link their names, since both are enmeshed in controversy
and both are African American artists. However, any similarity to
their situations ends with those superficial facts.</TE>
<TE>   Since his appointment by Gov. Gray Davis in June, Troupe has been
an exemplary poet laureate. He resigned -- voluntarily and at his own
initiative -- Friday, after a routine background check preceeding his
confirmation by the state Senate uncovered a 30-year-old lie on his
resume. Though Troupe, who is also a professor of creative writing
and American and Caribbean literature at UC San Diego, attended
Grambling College in Louisiana, he did not graduate, as his resume
says.</TE>
<TE>   None of this has anything to do with his long career as a poet who
has produced seven collections of poetry, nor as a writer whose other
seven books include a masterful portrait, "Miles and Me," nor as a
teacher whose courses are annually oversubscribed and whose students
have gone on to win MacArthur, Guggenheim and Lannan Foundation
grants.</TE>
<TE>   Baraka -- the Newark poet formerly known as LeRoi Jones -- is
another matter entirely. During a poetry reading last month, he
recited a long work, "Somebody Blew Up America," in which he repeated
the discredited slander that the World Trade Center's Israeli tenants
stayed away on Sept. 11 because they had been warned of the impending
terrorist attack:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who knew the World Trade Center was gonna get bombed</TE>
<TE>   Who told 4,000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers</TE>
<TE>   To stay home that day</TE>
<TE>   Why did Sharon stay away.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the poem, Baraka repeats another anti-Israeli
calumny:</TE>
<TE>   Who knows why Five Israelis was filming the explosion</TE>
<TE>   And cracking they sides at the notion</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All sorts of New Jersey groups, including the Anti-Defamation
League, reacted with understandable revulsion. Gov. James E.
McGreevey demanded that Baraka resign his honorary post and, when the
poet refused, the state legislature began drafting a law that will
allow the governor to fire the laureate.</TE>
<TE>   As these facts would suggest, the two poets also take entirely
different attitudes toward their situations.</TE>
<TE>   "I deeply regret this whole thing," Troupe said Tuesday. The
fabrication, he said, "went on my resume about seven years into my
academic career, when I was a lecturer at the College of Staten
Island in the City University of New York. Somebody told me I would
never get on the tenure line unless I changed my resume. So, I just
did it and, since then, it never came up. Since then, I've made my
living by my chops, writing and publishing books and teaching."</TE>
<TE>   Troupe said UCSD officials called him at his La Jolla home Oct.
10. "They said this had come to their attention, and was it true? I
admitted it immediately," Troupe said.</TE>
<TE>   "We started talking about what we should do, and I said, 'I think
I should resign.' I had already talked to somebody else, and they
said, 'If you resign, it will be done gracefully,' and I agreed with
that."</TE>
<TE>   Troupe said he called the governor's office and said he intended
to withdraw. "Everyone there was extremely sad that I was leaving."
Still, Troupe said, "as a realist, I understand that this is a
political season and they are in an electoral race. A lot of
political considerations would have come into play. But I'm not
blaming anybody -- not the Senate Rules Committee, nor the governor's
office. What I want them to focus on is why they picked me in the
first place. This has nothing to do with my performance as poet
laureate of this state."</TE>
<TE>   Troupe said he still is unsure what impact the revelation will
have on his professorship. "They gave me every assurance they want me
to stay here," he said. "I've given my life to teaching and they know
that."</TE>
<TE>   Baraka, by contrast, not only continues to defend the wicked
allegations in his poem but also said he will sue to block any
attempt to remove him. "They are trying to pull the wool over the
eyes of these hicks by making it seem like it's possible to remove me
without violating my 1st Amendment rights and passing an ex post
facto law. Who are they fooling? They're just trying to impress
people with weak minds before Nov. 5."</TE>
<TE>   Baraka dismisses as fabrication the fact that at least six Israeli
citizens died in the World Trade Center. "I have asked the ADL to
have a televised debate with me, to put the poem on the wall and to
go down line by line. They won't do it.... This charge of
anti-Semitism they've made against me is character assassination. I
say Israel and the United States knew about this before it happened.
Why am I called an anti-Semite for pointing this out? Because
assassinating my character is some kind of attempt to maintain the
image of Israel as a victim when it is carrying out ethnic cleansing.</TE>
<TE>   "The good thing about New Jersey," Baraka said, "is that I was
picked for this job by a panel of other poets. It doesn't say
anything in the proclamation naming me that I have to follow the
politics of fools."</TE>
<TE>   There is, of course, a long tradition of formidable poets who gave
themselves over to sordid politics. Ezra Pound is but the most
obvious example. Still, there is hardly a sinister political notion
that has come down the pike over the last 30 years that Baraka-Jones
has not embraced. There is a good case to be made that the people who
ought to resign are those who named him. But even former U.S. poets
laureate are reluctant to ask him to step down.</TE>
<TE>   "Poet laureate does not entitle one to anything or oblige one to
anything," Robert Pinsky said. "It is like being given a compliment.
You can't fire somebody from a compliment. The poet laureate of New
Jersey has the same right as any other American to make a fool of
himself. Compliments can be regretted, but not revoked."</TE>
<TE>   Another former U.S. laureate, Stanley Kunitz, said, "I am not
particularly in sympathy with the kind of statements Amiri Baraka
used in that poem. But having said that, I feel a rebuke might be all
that is necessary."</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, four years after he had written his famous elegy to
Yeats, Auden mused on the great poet's flirtation with the ramshackle
fascism of Eoin O'Duffy's Irish Blueshirts and on the Norwegian Nobel
laureate Knut Hamsun's collaboration with the Nazis. Perhaps, Auden
told an interviewer, Yeats had been fortunate to have died in 1939,
since that foreclosed any possibility of his making "the same
disastrous mistake, and for the same reasons, as Hamsun did."</TE>
<TE>   Such sentiments led Auden to remove lines in which he predicted
that Yeats' talent -- like those of the imperial apologist Rudyard
Kipling and the reactionary French Catholic Paul Claudel -- would
absolve him.</TE>
<TE>   These are the lines of which Auden repented; readers can decide
whether they are true:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Time, that is intolerant</TE>
<TE>   of the brave and innocent,</TE>
<TE>   And indifferent in a week,</TE>
<TE>   To a beautiful physique,</TE>
<TE>   Worships language and forgives</TE>
<TE>   Everyone by whom it lives;</TE>
<TE>   Pardons cowardice, conceit,</TE>
<TE>   Lays its honors at their feet.</TE>
<TE>   Time that with this strange excuse</TE>
<TE>   pardoned Kipling and his views,</TE>
<TE>   And will pardon Paul Claudel,</TE>
<TE>   Pardon him for writing well.</TE>

<HD>Globe picks exec director</HD>
<DH>San Diego theaters hire former Pacific Symphony and ABT
executive director.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Louis G. Spisto, executive director of Orange County's Pacific
Symphony from 1987 to 1998 and of New York's American Ballet Theatre
for a stormy two years, now has the same position at Globe Theatres
in San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Spisto resigned from ABT under pressure in 2001, after several
staff resignations, rocky relations with some board members, and an
ousted employee's claim of sex and age discrimination. That was
resolved in a settlement with ABT, the employee said. But during
Spisto's ABT years, income and touring weeks increased.</LD>
<LD>   After his resignation, he moved to Los Angeles to set up shop as a
consultant.</LD>
<TE>   Globe consultants conducted "extensive research" into Spisto's
past, Globe artistic director Jack O'Brien said. "Lou divulged every
bit of what went on [at ABT], with no sense of obfuscation." The
controversy "doesn't say as much about Lou as it does about that
organization, which has a history of dysfunctional situations with
its leaders."</TE>
<TE>   Spisto was "clearly the front-runner" of 12 or 15 top candidates
to replace interim executive director Garet Clark, O'Brien said. "He
has the kind of vibrant personality and enthusiasm that the theater
and community have always expected of me." This was an important
consideration because "The Full Monty" and "Hairspray" director
O'Brien has been increasingly busy elsewhere, and "it's very
important to me that I not be made to feel guilty" when away.
Although Spisto's resume is filled with classical music and dance
entries, he acted, directed and produced theater in college, graduate
school and summer stock, Spisto said.</TE>
<TE>   During Spisto's Pacific Symphony tenure, he received credit for
doubling the budget, erasing a deficit, creating an endowment, and
presiding over the hiring of current musical director Carl St.Clair.
Jim Medvitz, then the orchestra's vice president of operations, said
the group's "survival and success during that time were due to his
untiring efforts at building the board."</TE>
<TE>   Of his ABT years, Spisto said he believes that "the company
benefited greatly from my tenure, and the facts attest to that. It
was not only a great company, but it was a great learning experience
for me that will benefit me in the future."</TE>

<LD>"The first thing we have to do," Sabina said, "is form a planning
committee. That's how they do it where my mother works. Who wants to
be on the committee?"</LD>
<LD>   A dozen hands went up. Paul and Matt, the class troublemakers,
raised their hands, and Rachel made a list of students and their
phone numbers. "Tomorrow we'll meet at lunchtime and choose a
leader."</LD>
<LD>   All evening the friends spoke on the phone about what they would
do when they met with their committee.</LD>
<TE>   "First we have to vote on a leader," Rachel said the next day. "I
nominate Sabina. Those in favor?"</TE>
<TE>   "Hold it!" Paul cried. "I nominate Matt. Men are better leaders."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel made a face. "Fine. Like, how many for Sabina? How many for
Matt?"</TE>
<TE>   "Sabina wins!" Rachel announced with a grin when only two votes
went for Matt. "Now let's get down to work."</TE>
<TE>   "We made a list last night," Sabina began, "of what we need to do.
For instance, we need to make posters to put up around school asking
for books. Who likes to paint?"</TE>
<TE>   A girl and a boy raised their hands.</TE>
<TE>   "You're in charge of getting art supplies and making posters."</TE>
<TE>   "Who'll pay for it?" one of the boys asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe Ms. Fishgold, the art teacher, can help?" someone asked.</TE>
<TE>   "What should we say on the posters?"</TE>
<TE>   "How about 1 + 1 = 2," Paul offered. "You know, one of your books
and one of the publisher's books equals two books."</TE>
<TE>   "I like that," Sabina said. "Paul, Matt? When the posters are
done, how about hanging them?"</TE>
<TE>   "Is there anything we're forgetting?" she asked when the bell rang
to end lunch period.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, like where do we store all these books and how do we get
them to the right schools?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Sabina said. "But I'll try to find out."</TE>

<HD>Documentary makes the case for work of public defenders</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the court of public opinion, few get a worse rap than public
defenders. Stereotyped as mediocre lawyers who sleep through trials,
they are more often maligned than appreciated for protecting the
rights of the indigent.</LD>
<LD>   Filmmakers Pamela Yates and Peter Kinoy try to set the record
straight in "Presumed Guilty," a persuasive two-hour documentary
airing tonight at 9 on KCET. The show follows four cases handled by
the San Francisco Public Defender's Office, helping us understand why
these pros fight the good fight, even if it's usually on behalf of
people who have done bad things. As one defender says, a vigorous
defense is like a muscle that must be exercised, lest it atrophy when
needed most for the innocent client.</LD>
<LD>   Two cases are misdemeanors assigned to feisty rookies; intertwined
with those stories are murder cases handled by longtime defenders.</LD>
<TE>   Jeff Adachi, who was motivated to study law after his parents and
grandparents were interned for being Japanese Americans, defends a
Cambodian immigrant accused of slaying a gang boss.</TE>
<TE>   Will Maas, a Vietnam vet fighting his own demons as well as the
prosecution, comes off as twisted but cunning in his defense of the
alleged triggerman in a murder for hire. Maas, who tapes a bizarre
video diary in the wee hours and wears big glasses in court to "peer
into the souls" of witnesses, recalls a 1966 firefight to psych
himself up for legal battle. A lone enemy soldier killed 12 men in
Maas' squad that day.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson? "You never know," Maas says. "You might win a battle
here and there, and you might win the war."</TE>

<LD>National ratings for the all-California World Series are lagging well
behind last year's New York-Arizona faceoff, tracking so far about on
par with 2000 viewing levels, based on estimates issued Tuesday by
Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, ratings are much higher locally, with Game 2
attracting roughly 30% of homes in the Los Angeles viewing area,
compared to 12% nationally.</LD>
<LD>   Because baseball skews to men and older viewers, certain programs
can hold their own against the Series, which proved the case Sunday,
with solid ratings for "The Practice" and "Law &amp; Order: Criminal
Intent."</LD>
<TE>   Last week's box score for rookie series, meanwhile, was generally
unimpressive -- particularly on Friday, when Fox's "John Doe" and
"Firefly" put up mediocre numbers, as did CBS' "Robbery Homicide
Division" and the once-promising "Hack."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's "Push, Nevada" concludes its run Thursday, none too soon, as
the mystery drew the lowest rating for that hour in the network's
history opposite CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," which again
hit an all-time high. Despite that lead-in audience, however, CBS'
"Without a Trace" hasn't made much of a dent in "ER" at 10 p.m.
Thursdays, last week retaining a lowest-yet 48% of "CSI" viewers.</TE>
<TE>   The WB's "Smallville" also posted a best-ever rating, while "Birds
of Prey" lost altitude in its second telecast, dropping nearly a
third from its premiere.</TE>

<HD>Measat Joins Satellite-TV Suit Against NDS Group</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Measat Broadcast Network Systems joined a lawsuit
against NDS Group, a satellite-TV encryption company controlled by
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., according to filings Tuesday in U.S.
District Court here.</LD>
<LD>   Measat is a Malaysian operator with about 800,000 customers. None
of its representatives could be reached for comment late Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   That makes four companies that are suing NDS for allegedly helping
pirates undermine their systems. The others are U.S. system EchoStar
Communications Corp., Swiss encryption developer Kudelski and French
developer Canal Plus. Canal Plus plans to drop out of the suit as a
result of a deal its parent Vivendi Universal made with News Corp.</LD>
<TE>   The same allegations also have prompted a criminal probe by the
U.S. attorney's office in San Diego, which this month subpoenaed
documents from NDS' American headquarters in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   NDS has denied all charges in the case, which allege that it
committed cyber-sabotage.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, NDS said it was suing DirecTV, the satellite TV system
that its parent News Corp. had unsuccessfully tried to buy. The suit,
which was filed under seal in Los Angeles and alleges
misappropriation of trade secrets, is a response to a suit by DirecTV
alleging that NDS misappropriated its trade secrets.</TE>

<HD>AT&amp;T Cuts Costs, Returns to Profitability</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Hall</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long-distance telephone and cable television giant AT&amp;T Corp. on
Tuesday ended a streak of three straight quarterly net losses, but
revenue remained under pressure on weak demand for telephone and data
services.</LD>
<LD>   Deep cost-cutting helped the company return to profitability for
the first time since the same quarter a year ago, when its results
got a boost from the spinoff of its AT&amp;T Wireless division.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T -- which plans to sell its cable television business to
Comcast Corp. -- said third-quarter net income fell to $207 million,
or 5 cents a share, compared with $11.3 billion, or $3.13 a share, a
year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue fell 8.3%, to $12 billion, driven by plunging
long-distance telephone sales. AT&amp;T also lost more basic cable
television customers than expected.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T and other long-distance telephone companies have struggled
against a glut of communications networks, slack demand and increased
competition from the Baby Bells.</TE>
<TE>   To offset the decline in its core long-distance business, AT&amp;T has
wooed some customers from troubled rivals and expanded into new
markets such as local telephone service. It also slashed
third-quarter operating expenses by 8.3% to $10.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The business and consumer arms performed well enough to
compensate for higher-than-expected subscriber loss in broadband, and
that resulted in financial outperformance for the entire group," said
Banc of America Securities analyst David Barden.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding one-time items, AT&amp;T's third-quarter earnings totaled 6
cents a share, compared with a loss of 2 cents a share in the
year-earlier quarter. That exceeded Wall Street analysts' forecasts,
which averaged 5 cents a share, according to research firm Thomson
First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Shares rose 52 cents to $13.05 on the New York Stock Exchange.
AT&amp;T announced results before markets opened.</TE>

<HD>Blockbuster Returns to the Black</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Bates</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blockbuster Inc. returned to the black in the third quarter, earning
a $51-million profit that nonetheless fell short of the video chain's
expectations because of higher marketing costs and additional money
spent to add more DVDs and video games to its stores.</LD>
<LD>   The results contrast with a year-earlier loss of $224.9 million
stemming from write-downs as it continues clearing out videocassettes
to make room for higher-profit DVDs and video games. Revenue in the
quarter rose 9.6%, to $1.39 billion from $1.26 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The Dallas-based firm, which is 82%-owned by entertainment giant
Viacom Inc., said it was disappointed with the per-share earnings of
28 cents, 3 cents short of Wall Street projections.</LD>
<TE>   Blockbuster has been spending more on marketing, in part to launch
rental and sales programs to meet competition from stores such as
Wal-Mart and Best Buy that are aggressively selling DVDs to
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   But in a conference call Tuesday, Blockbuster Chief Executive John
Antioco promised a "great" fourth quarter and a strong first quarter
next year. One reason: the upcoming release on DVD and video of such
films as "Spider-Man," "Men in Black 2," and "Minority Report."</TE>
<TE>   Salomon Smith Barney analyst Margaret Blaydes said she expects the
company's stronger sales but lower profit margins to continue.</TE>
<TE>   For the nine months, Blockbuster posted a $1.66-billion loss, the
result of a noncash adjustment stemming from new accounting rules on
the treatment of acquisitions. Revenue rose 4.9% to $3.98 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Blockbuster's shares fell $1.21 to $24.42 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Slide on Earnings Reports</HD>
<DH>Weak results from Kimberly-Clark, Wyeth and Texas
Instruments prompt investor selling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Still skeptical about the stock market's long-term potential,
investors Tuesday cashed in some gains from almost two weeks of
rallies, sending prices lower. Disappointing earnings from
Kimberly-Clark, Wyeth and Texas Instruments also prompted some
selling.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts had expected the market to give back some of its recent
advance, which over the previous eight sessions had boosted the Dow
Jones industrials more than 1,200 points.</LD>
<LD>   After falling as much as 162 points Tuesday, the Dow closed down
88.08 points, or 1%, at 8,450.16. The Nasdaq composite index fell
16.87 points, or 1.3%, to 1,292.80. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
declined 9.56 points, or 1.1%, to 890.16.</LD>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 4 to 3 on Nasdaq in moderate trading.</TE>
<TE>   Since hitting multiyear lows Oct. 9, the Dow and Nasdaq have
jumped 16%. The S&amp;P 500 has climbed 14.6%.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the strength of the rally, it was appropriate to expect a
pause. The fact that you are getting less compelling earnings news
today from market leaders like Texas Instruments and Kimberly-Clark
also gives rise to a pause," said Jack Caffrey, equities strategist
J.P. Morgan Private Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts and investors are wary of the latest advance,
worried they will be faked out by what might be another bear market
rally, such as the one-week surge in late July when the Dow jumped
more than 1,000 points.</TE>
<TE>   But others are optimistic and say this time could mark a real
upward trend, largely because earnings news has been stronger than
expected.</TE>
<TE>   About 255 Standard &amp; Poor's 500 companies have posted their
quarterly earnings. Sixty percent of the firms have topped analysts'
expectations, while 12% have missed estimates, according to Thomson
First Call. The companies are posting profit growth of 10.4% on
average, compared with 1.4% in the second quarter, First Call said.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Texas Instruments put a dent in Wall Street's newfound optimism,
falling $3.12 to $14 and ranking as the most active on the NYSE. The
world's largest maker of semiconductor chips for cellular phones
reported a third-quarter profit in line with expectations, but
drastically cut fourth-quarter forecasts due to a softness in orders.
The SOX semiconductor index fell 6.1%. Chip leader Intel lost 33
cents to $15.12, and leading chip equipment maker Applied Materials
fell 95 cents to $13.09.</TE>
<TE>   * Kimberly-Clark sank $6.18 to $50.50 after the consumer products
maker missed third-quarter earnings expectations by 4 cents a share
and said its 2002 results will come in below analysts' estimates.</TE>
<TE>   * Video game publisher THQ, which plunged in after-hours trading
Monday after warning that the current quarter and year would be at
the low end of estimates, dragged other game firms lower. Electronic
Arts lost $5.54 to $66.60, Activision sagged $3.87 to $19.90 and
Take-Two Interactive Software fell $1.42 to $26.21. THQ, based in
Calabasas Hills, closed down $8.37 at $14.80, ranking as the largest
percentage loser on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   * Exxon Mobil fell 82 cents to $35.18 and helped pressure the Dow.
World oil prices fell Tuesday, extending the previous day's dramatic
plunge after President Bush said Iraq could be disarmed peacefully.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug makers Wyeth and Pharmacia slumped after posting anemic
third-quarter results, as consumers weigh the risks and rewards
associated with taking their flagship medicines for menopause and
arthritis. Wyeth fell $1.30 to $34.35. Pharmacia dropped $1.20 to
$42.25.</TE>
<TE>   * Japan's Nikkei stock average finished down 3.2%. In Europe,
France's CAC-40 index fell 1.1%, Britain's FTSE 100 declined 0.4% and
Germany's DAX index dropped 3.9%.</TE>

<HD>McDonald's Profit Dips but Stock Rises</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>McDonald's Corp. on Tuesday posted lower earnings for the seventh
time in eight quarters, but its stock rose on plans to cut new
restaurant openings and increase spending on existing outlets.</LD>
<LD>   With the help of a 1-cent dividend increase, McDonald's stock
moved up as much as 9% in its biggest one-day gain on the New York
Stock Exchange in at least two years.</LD>
<LD>   McDonald's said that next year it would open about 600 hamburger
restaurants worldwide, down from a high of about 2,000 in 1996. It
plans to open 1,300 restaurants this year.</LD>
<TE>   As part of a worldwide review of its costs, McDonald's Chief
Executive Jack Greenberg also told analysts in a conference call that
job cuts are likely, but he would not say when or how many jobs would
be cut.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts said that McDonald's, which has long relied on
opening new units to drive sales, should fix problems in its existing
U.S. restaurants instead of opening new ones.</TE>
<TE>   "Management has 'gotten religion' and will dramatically reduce new
restaurant openings," Bank of America analyst Andy Barish wrote in a
note. He called the decision a "positive."</TE>
<TE>   While cutting back on its traditional restaurants, the Oak Brook,
Ill.-based company also said it would expand its non-hamburger
chains, including Chipotle, Pret A Manger, Donato's Pizza and Boston
Market.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's reported third-quarter net income of $486.7 million, or
38 cents a share, compared with $545.5 million, or 42 cents a share,
a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Systemwide sales, made up of both company-owned and franchised
restaurants, rose 3%, to $10.91 billion. Revenue, comprising sales in
company-owned restaurants and fees from franchisees, rose 4%, to
$4.05 billion.</TE>
<TE>   On a global basis, comparable sales fell 3%. In the U.S.,
McDonald's biggest market, comparable-store sales fell 2.8%, and they
fell 1.3% in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's stock was among the most actively traded issues on the
NYSE on Tuesday, rising 65 cents to close at $18.95 after peaking at
$19.95 earlier in the session. The stock is down about 28% this year,
compared with a nearly 14% drop in the S&amp;P restaurant index.</TE>

<HD>Musicians in N.Y. Urge Rights Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York musicians are lobbying lawmakers to introduce legislative
reform for the music industry, including a bill to reduce the length
of recording contracts in the state.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes two months after a similar artists rights bill died
in the California Senate.</LD>
<LD>   The New York bill, which could open the door on free agency for
recording acts in the state, is expected to be proposed before the
end of the current legislative session, sources said. Additional
proposals focusing on other industry practices, including accounting,
probably will follow, sources said.</LD>
<TE>   The New York effort is spearheaded by entertainment attorney L.
Londell McMillan and the Artist Empowerment Coalition, a New
York-based nonprofit group that includes dozens of recording stars
such as Prince and Stevie Wonder. McMillan and AEC member Montell
Jordan testified in July at the California Senate hearings on
accounting practices in the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   The New York legislation is the latest development in an ongoing
debate over artists rights in the recording industry. Over the last
year, California lawmakers have held hearings to examine allegations
by artists about unfair contracts and music companies shortchanging
them on wages and health-care and pension benefits.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, AEC is scheduled to host the first in a series of
concert benefits aimed at raising awareness about artists rights
issues. The New York concert is expected to feature performances by
such stars as DMX, Roberta Flack, Faith Evans, Scarface, Wonder,
Jordan and Hezekiah Walker.</TE>

<LD>Charter Communications Inc. placed Chief Operating Officer David G.
Barford on paid leave as a federal grand jury investigates the cable
company's accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   Charter President and Chief Executive Carl Vogel has assumed
Barford's responsibilities on an interim basis. It is not clear what
role Barford has in the grand jury's investigation and a second
company statement on the matter did not elaborate.</LD>
<LD>   The St. Louis-based company, the nation's fourth-largest cable
operator, said in August that the subpoena sought documents related
to how the company accounts for costs for current and former cable
subscribers.</LD>
<TE>   Charter said the release Tuesday was prompted by "the close
scrutiny and speculation" resulting from the news.</TE>

<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief Executive Carly Fiorina said her company is
planning for low single-digit growth in information technology
spending in 2003, but she predicted that a slowed industry growth
rate will become permanent.</LD>
<LD>   "There has been a substantial decline in strategic growth rates,"
Fiorina told a meeting of analysts. "This is not a cyclical change --
this is a structural change."</LD>
<LD>   She said HP's combination with Compaq Computer Corp. is working,
giving the company the scale to offer everything from hand-held
computers to mainframes while advising customers on how to manage
their infrastructure.</LD>

<HD>Regulators, Securities Firms to Discuss Analysts' Banking
Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State and federal regulators will meet Thursday with lawyers for 10
of the largest securities firms to propose rules intended to ensure
investors get unbiased stock research from Wall Street analysts,
people familiar with the meeting said.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators are expected to advocate that Citigroup Inc., Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and the other eight firms help create independent
research organizations to root out conflicts of interest. Another
proposal would set limits on the contact between analysts and
investment bankers, the people said.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting at the Securities and Exchange Commission in
Washington is the first involving all the parties and is aimed at
settling year-old probes into Wall Street practices. The
investigations have undermined investor confidence by shedding light
on the relationship between Wall Street research departments and the
investment bankers who raise capital by selling new shares.</LD>
<TE>   "The meeting is very important," said Ira Sorkin, a securities
lawyer and former head of the SEC's New York office. "There is a
consensus among regulators that this can't continue. You're driving
investors out of the markets."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the securities firms have told regulators, including
New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, that banning all contact between
bankers and analysts would damage their business, already hurt by a
market decline that has wiped out $9 trillion in value from U.S.
stocks since the March 2000 peak.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives have argued that analysts help bankers identify
promising companies for initial public offerings, and reject IPOs
that would make poor investments for clients.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine those 10 firms being unanimous after one
meeting," said Alan McFarland, partner at McFarland Dewey &amp; Co., a
boutique investment bank.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreed to pay $100 million to settle a
probe by Spitzer. Since then, representatives from Wall Street firms,
the SEC and industry self-regulatory organizations have discussed
fines and reforms to reduce the potential for conflicts by changing
the relationship between research and banking.</TE>

<HD>USI Holdings Raises $90 Million in IPO</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the dismal market for first-time stock offerings, USI
Holdings Corp., a San Francisco-based insurance firm, raised $90
million through an initial public offering Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   USI Holdings sold 9 million shares at $10 a share in an IPO led by
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. The company's stock -- ticker symbol USIH --
closed unchanged at $10 in Nasdaq trading Tuesday. Proceeds will be
used to pay down debt.</LD>
<LD>   The IPO is notable in a year when so few companies have gone
public. The third quarter saw nine IPOs, the fewest for any quarter
since the 1970s. The market for first-time offerings has collapsed in
the stock downturn. IPO performance has been poor this year, with the
average IPO down 8.7% from its offer price.</LD>
<TE>   Insurance is one area that has remained strong despite the market
downturn. About a dozen insurance-related IPOs have gone to market
since 2001 and are up an average 37% from their offer price,
according to Thomson Financial, a New Jersey data firm.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a look at this market and saw there was no question it
was a challenge, but our sector has done pretty well," USI Chief
Executive Dave Eslick said.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1994, USI distributes insurance and financial products
to small and mid-sized businesses. With 58 offices in 20 states, the
company has 2,100 employees.</TE>
<TE>   A company that goes public now is either one of two extremes,
"they really need the money or they are so good, they can rise above
the current environment," said Richard J. Peterson, a market
strategist for Thomson.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, 14 California companies have gone public, and on
average, their stock is down 22% from their offer price.</TE>

<HD>Blue Cross, HCA in Partial Agreement</HD>
<DH>The health giants' lengthy impasse on reimbursements is
affecting six California hospitals, including three in the Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue Cross of California said late Tuesday that it reached a partial
agreement with hospital operator HCA Inc. in a lingering contract
dispute that has been disrupting care for patients in several
California communities.</LD>
<LD>   For weeks the health-care giants had been at loggerheads over how
much Blue Cross will reimburse HCA for services at its six California
hospitals. Contracts expired Oct. 1, leaving tens of thousands of
Blue Cross members without coverage for most services at the
hospitals, except for emergencies.</LD>
<LD>   Late Tuesday, Blue Cross spokesman Michael Chee said negotiators
meeting in Thousand Oaks had reached an agreement on a new contract
for the three HCA hospitals in Southern California -- in Riverside,
West Hills and Thousand Oaks. He said the two sides would return to
the table today to talk about the three other hospitals, which are in
San Jose.</LD>
<TE>   Chee would not provide terms of the Southern California contract.
HCA officials could not be reached late Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts viewed the contract dispute as another sign of the
heightened tensions between insurers and hospital companies as they
grapple with the pressures of rising health costs. Most expect such
conflicts to intensify in the near future -- a menacing prospect for
patients, who often are caught in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross previously said it had offered HCA a 50% increase over
two years, but an HCA spokesperson said Blue Cross payments were the
lowest of all insurers and insufficient to cover the cost of medical
services.</TE>
<TE>   Many doctors have been clamoring about the Blue Cross-HCA fight,
saying they have been forced to delay tests, postpone elective
surgeries and divert patients to other hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "There's compromise in care," said Dr. Michael Papanicolaou.
Tuesday, he and other doctors at Los Robles Regional Medical Center
in Thousand Oaks reluctantly transferred a 60-year-old patient
recovering from a head hemorrhage to a hospital about 20 miles away
in Oxnard. "They'll probably take good care of her," he said, "but
there won't be any [doctor] there who knows her case."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Los Robles, the two other HCA acute-care hospitals in the
Southland are West Hills Hospital and Medical Center and Riverside
Community Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   HCA, the nation's largest hospital chain, this week reported a
third-quarter profit of $200 million on revenue of $4.9 billion, even
after big, one-time losses in the value of investment securities. The
latest financial reports filed with California show that two of HCA's
hospitals in San Jose were losing money, but the rest are profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross of California is owned by WellPoint Health Networks,
the biggest health insurer in California. WellPoint is expected to
report its quarterly earnings today. The company, known for its
aggressive rate negotiations with providers, has been one of the most
profitable in the managed-care industry.</TE>

<HD>State's Delayed Power-Bond Sale to Proceed Today</HD>
<DH>Initial phase of the $11.9-billion deal was postponed as a
result of a complaint by PG&amp;E.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Debora Vrana</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a lawsuit filed last week, the state of California plans to
go forward today with the first phase of the largest municipal bond
sale in history.</LD>
<LD>   The first phase of the planned $11.9-billion bond issue -- the
sale of $4.25 billion in adjustable-rate bonds -- was slated for this
week and was expected by bond traders to happen Tuesday. But it was
delayed a day to allow investors to review the latest lawsuit filed
in connection with the bond sale, according to the state treasurer's
office.</LD>
<LD>   The bond sale is needed to repay loans from banks and the state's
general fund that helped the state buy power during California's
energy crisis in early 2001. It has been delayed for more than a year
because of political and legal wrangling.</LD>
<TE>   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. filed a suit last week that questions a
plan to use utility revenue to back the bonds and claims a state
agency violated due process requirements when it set the amount of
revenue to be collected.</TE>
<TE>   Although the possibility of such a suit already was disclosed in
bond documents, notice that the complaint was filed will be added to
the prospectus for the sale to ensure that full disclosure is made to
potential investors, state officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the large Wall Street investors expected to buy the
variable-rate portion of the bond issue said they would purchase the
bonds even with another delay.</TE>
<TE>   "The potential legal issues were already disclosed. With a deal
this complex, it doesn't surprise us there are some legal challenges;
we just thought they would come after the bonds are sold," said
Steven Permut, senior portfolio manager at American Century
Investments in Mountain View, Calif. "We still think the variable
rate and the long-term bonds are appropriate for purchase."</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Fitch
Ratings have said the PG&amp;E lawsuit won't change their
investment-grade ratings for the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   If the sale of the $4.25 billion in adjustable-rate bonds is
completed this week, it will be followed by a sale of $6.75 billion
in fixed-rate bonds the next week and then $950 million in taxable
bonds in November.</TE>
<TE>   This first phase of adjustable bonds is expected to be sold mainly
to large institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance
companies. The fixed-rate portion is expected to draw strong interest
from California's individual investors because the bonds would be
exempt from state and federal taxes for state residents.</TE>

<HD>CAA Agent Out After Allegedly Seeking Finder Fee on Client
Home</HD>
<DH>Michael Gruber loses his job after trying to get $250,000
from the sellers of a villa that actor George Clooney was buying,
sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Eller and Anita M. Busch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a top Hollywood agent, Michael Gruber has cut deals for some of
the industry's biggest names. But on Tuesday he lost his job for
allegedly using his longtime relationship with client George Clooney
to cut a deal for himself.</LD>
<LD>   Gruber was forced to resign from the powerhouse Creative Artists
Agency after Clooney learned that his agent had tried to obtain a
"finder's fee" of as much as $250,000 from the sellers of an Italian
lakeside villa the actor was buying, according to sources close to
both men.</LD>
<LD>   Clooney, a source said, heard about the proposed payment during a
discussion of why negotiations for the Lake Como property, which sold
for an estimated $10 million, had taken so long to conclude.</LD>
<TE>   One of the parties blamed the delay on Gruber and his finder's fee
request, which ultimately was dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Clooney, according to the sources, believed that discussion of any
such fee was inappropriate and fired Gruber about two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   CAA agreed that the behavior was unacceptable and gave Gruber "the
opportunity" to resign, according to one of the sources.</TE>
<TE>   Reached on Tuesday, Gruber declined to comment on the
circumstances surrounding his sudden departure from CAA, except to
say: "This is just a situation I'm leaving so I can move on to
something else."</TE>
<TE>   Clooney, through his spokesman, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   CAA issued a brief statement saying that Gruber had resigned from
the agency, and wished him "all the best in his future plans."</TE>
<TE>   Gruber had worked at CAA since 1999 and represented Clooney for
eight years. His other clients included such celebrities as Cindy
Crawford, Ice Cube and "Red Dragon" director Brett Ratner.</TE>
<TE>   CAA representatives said they had confirmation from all of
Gruber's former clients that they planned to remain at the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Gruber, a well-known Hollywood player, was previously the head of
the talent department at the William Morris Agency until his
departure in 1999. Gruber started his career as a trainee in Morris'
New York office in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Gruber's representation of Clooney began during the actor's first
season on NBC's "ER." The actor moved to CAA in 1999, with an
understanding that Gruber soon would follow when his contract expired
at the Morris agency a few months later.</TE>
<TE>   As for his future, Gruber said: "I don't want to be a competitor
to CAA. I want to work with CAA."</TE>
<TE>   One possibility is that Gruber might become a talent manager. Such
managers often work hand in hand with talent agents. Another
possibility is to team up in a production company with Ice Cube,
sources said. Gruber received a producer credit on the rapper's 2000
hit movie "Next Friday."</TE>

<HD>Conexant Cuts Losses; Posts 10% Growth</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conexant Systems Inc. narrowed its losses and posted a 10% growth in
sales in its fourth quarter amid continued weakness in the
semiconductor industry.</LD>
<LD>   The Newport Beach communications chip firm reported a
$176.2-million net loss, or 66 cents a share, on revenue of $157.9
million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a $238.8 million
net loss, or 95 cents a share, on $143 million in sales a year
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   For its fiscal year, Conexant sales fell 29% from 2001 to $601.8
million, while losses of $880.8 million, or $3.40 a share, were down
from a net loss of $1.4 billion, or $5.91 a share, in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Conexant, which this year spun off a manufacturing site, wireless
chip business and digital imaging business, has struggled to regain
footing as key customers suffered downturns.</TE>
<TE>   Conexant in July said it will cut 400 jobs, or 15% of its work
force. Those cuts will help Conexant become profitable this quarter,
said company Chief Executive Dwight Decker.</TE>
<TE>   Shares rose 11 cents to 96 cents Tuesday on Nasdaq, but gained 7
cents in after-hours trading after Conexant released its results.</TE>

<HD>Builders Report Robust Results</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl Strickland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ryland Group Inc., parent of one of the nation's largest
homebuilders, said Tuesday that third-quarter net income jumped 27%
thanks to a record backlog of orders.</LD>
<LD>   The Calabasas-based company, which also has a mortgage-related
finance unit, said net income climbed to $47.4 million, or $1.70 a
share, for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, up from $37.2
million, or $1.30, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue from homebuilding rose 3% to $714 million from $695.2
million; total revenue rose 2.7% to $732.7 million. The increase
reflected a higher average home-closing price of $209,000.</LD>
<TE>   The company's backlog of homes -- those units sold in a previous
period but not yet delivered -- rose 15% to 6,687; orders for new
homes in the third quarter climbed 30% to 3,558; and the number of
home sales closed in the quarter edged up less than 1% to 3,362.</TE>
<TE>   Boosted by the latest results, Ryland said it expects earnings for
the year to exceed $6 a share, up 50 cents a share from a previous
estimate. Analysts were expecting 2002 earnings of $5.74 a share,
according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Low mortgage rates have helped boost profits for Ryland and other
builders as more first-time buyers enter the market.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday, shares of Ryland fell $1.96 to close at $40.50 in New
York Stock Exchange trading on concerns that interest rates are
starting to creep higher.</TE>
<TE>   Also posting robust results was Bloomfield Hills, Mich.-based
Pulte Homes Inc. The nation's largest builder reported that
third-quarter earnings rose 49% to $123.4 million, or $1.99 a share,
from $82.8 million, or $1.52, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding income from discontinued operations, profit was $113.5
million, or $1.83 a share. Revenue rose 25% to $1.86 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Centex Corp., another major builder, said quarterly profit jumped
24% to $115.6 million, or $1.83 a share, from $93.3 million, or
$1.50, a year earlier. Revenue rose 11% to $2.1 billion.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Toy maker Jakks Pacific Inc. said third-quarter net income rose more
than 27%, a result of cost cutting, new products and the company's
best-ever quarterly sales.</LD>
<LD>   The Malibu-based maker of World Wrestling Entertainment action
figures and Pentech pens said Tuesday that it earned $14 million, or
58 cents a share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, up from $10.9
million, or 56 cents, in the same period a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Sales for the period rose more than 10% to $102.6 million, up from
$92.8 million a year ago, partly on the strength of back-to-school
sales of Jakks' Flying Colors brand of notebooks, lunchboxes, pens
and other children's stationery supplies.</LD>
<TE>   Jakks shares rose 48 cents to $11.41 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The company said because of advanced planning, it expects little
effect from the disruption at West Coast ports. On a Tuesday morning
conference call with analysts after the market's open, Jakks
executives also affirmed the company's sales and earnings guidance
for the year, with earnings per share of $1.64 to $1.70, excluding
charges, on sales of $310 million to $330 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We were impressed with the quarter and the tone of the conference
call," said Anthony Gikas, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "They feel good about their position heading into the holidays and
we agree."</TE>
<TE>   Jakks expects this week to complete its acquisition of Toymax,
creator of Go Fly a Kite and Fundoodle products.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase will make Jakks the nation's third-largest toy
company behind Mattel Inc. and Hasbro Inc.</TE>

<HD>Overture Profit Rises 88% as Revenue More Than Doubles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Overture Services Inc., which provides advertisers with favored
placement on Internet search engines, said Tuesday that its
third-quarter net income rose 88% despite high-profile customer
defections over the last several months.</LD>
<LD>   The Pasadena company, whose service is used in search engines for
Yahoo Inc.'s flagship site and Microsoft Corp.'s MSN, earned $16.9
million, or 28 cents a share, compared with $8.97 million, or 15
cents, for the same period a year ago. Sales rose to $172.7 million
in the three months ended Sept. 30 from $72.5 million last year.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Ted Meisel said during a conference call with
analysts that Overture continues to find new customers, even during
this rough climate for online advertising.</LD>
<TE>   "We grew our advertiser count by 6,000 to 73,000," said Meisel. He
said he expected Overture "to be on a high growth path for the next
several years," especially in its foreign operations.</TE>
<TE>   But the company has taken hits over the last several months from
chief rival Google Inc., which won accounts from AOL Time Warner
Inc.'s America Online, EarthLink Inc. and Ask Jeeves Inc., all former
clients of Overture.</TE>
<TE>   Overture, formerly known as GoTo.com, earns a fee whenever a user
of a search engine on a partner site clicks through to an advertiser
who paid for placement. Advertisers who pay the most are listed first
in search results.</TE>
<TE>   Overture shares fell 66 cents on Tuesday to $29.84 on Nasdaq
before the results were announced, then fell further in after-hours
trading.</TE>

<HD>Bid Fails; Baseball Souvenirs Stuck at Port</HD>

<LD>Despite a ninth-inning offer of help from baseball-loving
dockworkers, it appears that efforts to free a container of World
Series souvenirs from the backlogged Port of Los Angeles has struck
out.</LD>
<LD>   Chatsworth entrepreneur Mitch Tendler said he was informed Tuesday
by the ocean carrier handling his shipment that his 57,000 disposable
cameras won't be unloaded in time to make the Fall Classic. The
cameras were supposed to be given away to fans tonight at Game 4 in
San Francisco as part of a promotion by MasterCard Inc. But they are
stranded in a ship harbored outside the Port of Los Angeles as West
Coast ports struggle to dig out from a 10-day lockout that ended Oct.
9.</LD>
<LD>   Unionized dockworkers Tuesday volunteered to unload the container
on their off time. They blamed the Pacific Maritime Assn., which
represents shipping lines and terminal operators, for dragging its
feet.</LD>
<TE>   "Baseball is America's pastime," said Steve Stallone, spokesman
for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. "The guys would
love to make this happen, but the PMA won't cooperate."</TE>
<TE>   The management group said the decision to give priority to a ship
carrying disposable cameras rested with the carrier, not the PMA. The
employers' group blames the current backlog at the ports on a union
slowdown, a charge that the ILWU denies.</TE>
<TE>   "The union is trying to exploit this issue," said Steve Sugerman,
spokesman for the Maritime Assn. "We'd love to see them take this
approach on a daily basis. That ship would already be unloaded by
now."</TE>
<TE>   Tendler, owner of Greeting Camera, said he appreciated the union's
offer, "but it's too little too late."</TE>

<HD>Radio Data Services Vying for Top Spot</HD>
<DH>Clear Channel pushes research firm Mediabase in showdown
against rival Nielsen BDS</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 140 cities across the country, music detectives at a research
service called Mediabase sit in front of personal computers listening
to seven-second snippets of radio broadcasts. It is, in a sense, the
high-stakes corporate equivalent of "Name That Tune."</LD>
<LD>   For a decade, record labels relied on Nielsen Broadcast Data
Systems to track how often their songs received play -- or "spins" --
on radio stations. But three years ago, broadcasting giant Clear
Channel Communications Inc. entered the game when it bought
Mediabase.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Mediabase's sales staff is receiving backup from Clear
Channel's radio programmers, who wield enormous clout at record
labels starving for airplay. San Antonio-based Clear Channel owns
about 1,200 radio stations, six times more than its most powerful
rival, Viacom Inc.'s Infinity Broadcasting.</LD>
<TE>   Record executives say Clear Channel's aggressive push for
Mediabase is the latest example of how the industry giant is using
its size and reach to tap into the tens of millions of dollars spent
on radio promotion by major record labels.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel executives deny that they require their own stations
to use Mediabase data.</TE>
<TE>   But recently, the music director at Clear Channel's Z-100 in New
York, an influential pop radio station, had some news for record
industry officials. "Z-100 exclusively only looks at Mediabase for
any song information," music director Cubby Bryant said in an e-mail
to a label pitching a new R&amp;B record. "I thought I'd give you the
scoop. We only care about Mediabase numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said his station's policy is not part of a mandate from
Clear Channel management. But he also made clear that he doesn't mind
helping out a sister company. "We knew the rest of the country wasn't
quite on the Mediabase bandwagon yet," he said. "But after awhile we
said we should start spreading the word."</TE>
<TE>   Record executives say Bryant isn't the only Clear Channel
programmer touting Mediabase.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Clear Channel's muscle, another advantage that Mediabase
has over BDS is cost. In many cases, Mediabase is able to offer its
service to record labels at a lower price because it is effectively
subsidized by its deals with stations.</TE>
<TE>   The two services essentially square off in a matchup of man versus
machine. BDS places inaudible "tags" in new songs and positions
computer-equipped radio tuners in more than 125 markets to listen for
the tags as they are broadcast from more than 1,100 stations. The
equipment forwards the information to BDS, which tallies the number
of plays of each song and compiles nationwide data for delivery every
morning -- and in another BDS service, those numbers are updated
online every few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Mediabase relies on people, not computers, to track
airplay. The company "skims," or samples, broadcasts from radio
stations, and in turn sends audio feeds to 135 music experts
scattered around the country. Their task is to determine whether each
clip is a lyrical blast from Eminem, guitar solos from U2 or snippets
of a Christina Aguilera melody, then fill in the song's title on a
station log sent to a central database.</TE>
<TE>   "Every piece of audio passes a human ear before it is journaled,"
said Rich Meyer, Mediabase's president. "That gives Mediabase an
edge, for example, in identifying a 'leaked' song," which BDS may not
have entered into its computers.</TE>
<TE>   BDS, however, maintains that its electronic monitors are superior
to humans, and it remains the dominant market research company at
major labels.</TE>
<TE>   "Our product is more accurate and ... is delivered in a more
timely manner than our competitor's," said Rob Sisco, executive vice
president for Nielsen BDS. The company is a unit of Dutch
conglomerate VNU, which also owns the Nielsen TV ratings service and
Billboard magazine. (Billboard, the music industry bible, bought an
interest in BDS long ago when it began using the company's statistics
on its pages.)</TE>
<TE>   Before BDS pioneered electronic monitoring, play charts were based
entirely on verbal reports made by radio personnel, whom executives
say were easily corrupted with gifts and money from record labels.</TE>
<TE>   Radio play remains the most powerful tool to sell new music. BDS
and Mediabase monitor the playlists of 1,100 radio stations among the
12,000 stations scattered across the country.</TE>
<TE>   The five major record conglomerates pay about $15 million a year
for the two rival tracking services -- sometimes buying both BDS and
Mediabase numbers in order to cross-check them -- but the total
amount of money at stake is considerably greater. Playlists have a
domino effect on music promotion campaigns, record store retail
orders, concert bookings and bonuses awarded to record label
promotion executives.</TE>
<TE>   With album sales sliding amid rampant music piracy, record labels
are scrambling to cut costs and are questioning whether they can
support two duplicative airplay services.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the world's biggest music company, Universal
Music Group, owned by Vivendi Universal, threatened to drop BDS and
keep only Mediabase. Ultimately, Universal Music cut a one-year
contract for access to BDS at a lower cost, according to industry
sources.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a horrible choice," said one Universal executive. Because
of BDS' higher fees, "you'd love it if you could go with their
competitor. But then you say to yourself, do you really want to
empower Clear Channel? You're sort of caught."</TE>
<TE>   But Mediabase's influence is growing. In addition to being the
service used by many large radio stations, its charts are published
in Radio &amp; Records magazine and serve as the rankings for programs
such as "Rick Dees Weekly Top 40," which is syndicated by Clear
Channel unit Premiere Radio Networks.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, New York-based BDS isn't standing still. It has
started moving more aggressively into Mediabase's traditional turf,
pursing radio stations as clients; BDS now claims 350 stations as
subscribers. Mediabase has 1,100 radio station clients -- of which
about 25% are owned by Clear Channel, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   A Clear Channel spokeswoman said she was not aware of any of the
company's 1,200 stations using BDS's services.</TE>
<TE>   BDS contends, however, that's not because they aren't interested.
"Many Clear Channel programmers have told us they would prefer to
subscribe to BDS," asserted Sisco, the Nielsen executive, "but are
forbidden to by corporate edict."</TE>

<HD>Morgan Stanley Will Advise Freedom Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Corie Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The board of Freedom Communications Inc., parent company of the
Orange County Register, met Tuesday to approve Morgan Stanley as the
investment bank to help evaluate an intra-family buyout proposal.</LD>
<LD>   Morgan Stanley will work with a special committee made up of
Freedom's six independent board members; a preliminary proposal is
due to be presented at Freedom's Nov. 12 board meeting.</LD>
<LD>   "The younger generation of shareholders is working on a proposal
to buy out their elders," Freedom Chief Executive Alan Bell said.
"It's a way to provide cash for the shares of those family members
who want out." Merrill Lynch is the investment banker for that group,
Bell said.</LD>
<TE>   Freedom is privately held by 11 branches of the family descended
from firm founder Raymond C. Hoiles' three children. Combined, the
descendants divide $13 million to $14 million in annual dividends.
Estimates of the company's worth range from $1.5 billion to more than
$2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Tim Hoiles, a third-generation family member, sought to
cash out his family's 8.6% stake in Freedom, the 12th-largest media
company in the U.S. with holdings in small-market newspapers and
television stations. In the wake of that bid, members of the family's
fourth generation banded together to propose a buyout package that
would give them control of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, it was announced that the Register would eliminate 35
jobs across all departments and freeze wages next year under pressure
to increase its profit margins faster than planned.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>State Contract Helps Fuel Sempra's Earnings</HD>
<DH>Profit soars 56%, but the pact, signed during the energy
crisis, is being renegotiated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sempra Energy posted a 56% jump in third-quarter earnings Tuesday,
thanks largely to a controversial long-term electricity contract that
California officials say hurts consumers.</LD>
<LD>   The company reported earnings of $150 million, or 73 cents a
share, up from $96 million, or 46 cents a share, in the same quarter
a year ago. Revenue was $1.38 billion, down slightly from $1.42
billion last year.</LD>
<LD>   The San Diego-based company has 21 million customers through its
utility subsidiaries, Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas &amp;
Electric -- more than any energy utility in the country. But its
strong third-quarter showing was due mainly to the performance of its
wholesale power generating subsidiary, Sempra Energy Resources.</LD>
<TE>   Sempra Energy Resources reported earnings of $29 million for the
quarter, a turnaround from the $9-million net loss in 2001, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   The gain was primarily from the sale of power to the California
Department of Water Resources under a 10-year power-supply contract
signed last year, said Sempra Energy spokesman Doug Kline.</TE>
<TE>   That contract, signed when harried state bureaucrats were trying
to cope with the energy crisis, contributed to the unit's
third-quarter loss last year. The company sold power at a loss, under
the condition that the deal would become more profitable in future
years.</TE>
<TE>   Given that arrangement, said Michael Heim, a St. Louis-based
analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc., "this is not a contract that
Sempra is anxious to walk away from" at this point.</TE>
<TE>   State officials, however, have been renegotiating long-term
contracts with Sempra and other power suppliers, saying they were
signed in 2001 amid the chaos of the energy crisis and are too
expensive. The state passes on the power that it buys to Southern
California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp;
Electric, the first two of which ran into severe financial troubles
stemming from the state's deregulated power market. High wholesale
energy prices are then ultimately absorbed in the rates of business
and residential customers.</TE>
<TE>   Although some companies have reached accords, Sempra still is in
talks with state officials on a resolution. The Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission is expected to convene settlement hearings on
the issue as early as December if the two sides are unable to come to
terms in the weeks ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra's contract with the state is valued at $6.6 billion. The
state signed a total of $43 billion in long-term deals with power
providers.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Department of Water Resources in July asked a San
Diego Superior Court judge to void the deal with Sempra on the
grounds the company committed fraud by failing to complete by this
summer the first phase of a new power plant in Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   The DWR's suit alleges that Sempra violated the contract terms by
buying power on the open market and reselling it to the state,
instead of providing it from the Bakersfield plant. Sempra bought
power on the open market, where prices averaged $30 to $40 per
megawatt hour, the state says, and resold it at the contract price of
$160 per megawatt hour, profiting on the spread.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeking to have the contract voided," said DWR spokesman
Oscar Hidalgo. "In general, we're looking at a different market today
than when we negotiated the contract. We're looking to improve the
contract for the state, and ultimately, for the consumer. We need to
get a better deal on costs."</TE>
<TE>   Sempra's Kline said the contract allowed the company to provide
power from a range of sources, including the market. "We have a solid
binding contract and we're very confident that the contract will be
upheld by federal regulators and the state court."</TE>
<TE>   Sempra Energy Resources is set to bring power plants on line next
year in Bakersfield; Arlington, Ariz.; and Mexicali, Mexico. The
three would produce 2,135 megawatts by the end of next year, Kline
said. That's enough to power 1.6 million homes for one hour.</TE>
<TE>   More than 85% of Sempra Energy Resources' power capacity is under
medium- to long-term contract, and analyst Heim said that fact
separates Sempra from other troubled energy generators that "have
nowhere to sell the power."</TE>
<TE>   Sempra Chief Executive Stephen L. Baum also took note of the
company's rare position in the sector. "We are pleased to continue
strong financial and operating performance at a time when many of our
peers in the energy sector have struggled," he said in a statement
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Touting the company's "strong investment-grade credit ratings," he
reaffirmed the company's earnings guidance for 2002 of $2.55 to $2.65
a share and provided guidance for 2003 of $2.60 to $2.80 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra shares rose 65 cents to $20.21 Tuesday on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Slatkin Associate Agrees to Guilty Plea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A business associate of EarthLink Inc. co-founder Reed Slatkin has
agreed to plead guilty in an elaborate scheme to obstruct the
Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation of Slatkin.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Jacobs will plead guilty to conspiracy to obstruct justice
when he is arraigned next month, the SEC and the U.S. attorney's
office in Los Angeles said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Slatkin, 53, who also served as a financial advisor to
celebrities, business executives and socialites, pleaded guilty in
April to five counts of mail fraud, three counts of wire fraud, six
counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to obstruct
justice.</LD>
<TE>   In his plea agreement, Jacobs, 60, acknowledged that when the SEC
began its investigation of Slatkin in 1999, he and others provided
the SEC with false documents on NAA Financial, a bogus Swiss
brokerage firm in which Slatkin claimed he was holding investors'
funds.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Slatkin was using money collected from new investors to
pay older investors while claiming he was delivering above-average
returns.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs has admitted that during the investigation, he set up phony
European phone numbers for NAA Financial, bought European-style
letterhead stationery for Slatkin and altered a fax machine at his
home so recipients would think faxes were coming from a European
phone number.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs also fabricated bank records and correspondence to convince
the SEC that Slatkin had transferred more than $400 million into the
phony Swiss bank account.</TE>
<TE>   In return, Slatkin paid Jacobs $1 million and some gold coins, the
SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   The plea agreement could bring a sentence of about one year in
prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. Jacobs also may be required to
pay back the $1 million in fees he received.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs has agreed to cooperate with an ongoing investigation,
federal prosecutors said.</TE>

<HD>$18-Million UPS Salary Settlement Disclosed</HD>
<DH>Part-time supervisors were given no compensation for extra
hours. Hundreds of firms have agreed to pay in similar cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 6,000 people who worked as part-time supervisors at United
Parcel Service Inc. in California are entitled to a share of an
$18-million settlement announced Tuesday in a suit alleging that UPS
violated the state's wage-and-hour laws.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement covers UPS supervisors who were scheduled to work
25 hours a week, earning average monthly salaries of $1,500, said
Kyle Van Dyke, a San Diego lawyer who represented the plaintiffs. The
supervisors, he said, had received no additional pay for working more
than their scheduled hours, nor did they receive overtime pay for
working more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week.</LD>
<LD>   Peggy Gardner, a spokeswoman for UPS, said the company changed its
pay practices in California on Sept. 1 to comply with a revision of
California's wage-and-hour laws that took effect in January 2000. UPS
had been looking into how it would comply with the revision when the
lawsuit was filed in May 2000, Gardner said.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of other local and national companies have made
substantial payments to settle similar lawsuits filed on behalf of
white-collar workers alleging violations of California's unique labor
laws. The UPS case is believed to be the first settlement of a case
filed on behalf of part-time supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Although settlements have no precedent-setting value, it could
open the door for new suits filed for alleged violations of the
salary minimum requirement, said Debra Hurst, another lawyer for the
plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Now California employers are going to have to treat part-time
employees the same as full-time employees," Hurst said.</TE>
<TE>   The UPS suit alleged that the part-time supervisors did not earn
enough to be exempt from the state requirement that they be paid an
overtime premium of time and a half after eight hours a day.
According to the wage-and-hour code revision in 2000, anyone earning
less than $1,993 a month in California could not be exempt from the
overtime requirement. That minimum salary has since been raised to
$2,340.</TE>
<TE>   To comply, UPS, among other things, now requires supervisors and
specialists who work part time in California to record the time they
begin and end each shift, Gardner said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never asked our managers to essentially clock in and
clock out, so we didn't track their hours minute by minute," she
said. "It's too early to tell if this system will be adopted anywhere
else."</TE>
<TE>   The settlement was approved Aug. 1 but a confidentiality agreement
prevented disclosure before September.</TE>
<TE>   Van Dyke and Hurst said they decided to announce the settlement on
Tuesday because the Dec. 3 deadline for claims to be submitted was
approaching. The lawyers said they hoped the publicity would
encourage more former California supervisors to avail themselves of
the settlement.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Has Deal to Sell French Publishing Unit</HD>
<DH>The media giant's agreement with Lagardere would free up
cash to increase its stake in telecom firm Cegetel. Investors are
wary of taking on more debt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal moved closer to unloading some of its publishing
businesses as part of efforts to ease its cash crunch. But the
company's next strategic move could end up swelling its already heavy
debt load.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi Universal is expected to announce today that it has
reached a preliminary deal to sell its European publishing
businesses, which include French dictionary publishers Larousse and
Le Robert, to French media and aerospace conglomerate Lagardere.</LD>
<LD>   The Lagardere purchase price was not known.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi is still mulling over offers for its U.S. publisher
Houghton Mifflin Co., the Boston-based publisher of the American
Heritage Dictionary and the "Curious George" series, according to
sources familiar with the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have speculated that Vivendi is eager to sell its
publishing business and reduce its stake in the company's core water
utility to help raise cash to gain control of French telecom company
Cegetel.</TE>
<TE>   Investors, however, aren't warm to the idea of Vivendi taking on
more debt. The company's shares on the New York Stock Exchange fell
nearly 10% on Tuesday to close at $13.17, down $1.39.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're swapping publishing assets for telecom assets, it
definitely elevates the risk profile of the whole company," said Paul
Kim, an analyst with Kaufman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi is vying with Britain's Vodafone for control of Cegetel,
the profitable French telecom company. Vodafone, which owns 15% of
Cegetel, has offered to pay $12.6 billion for Vivendi's 44% stake in
Cegetel along with stakes held by two other shareholders -- BT Group
and SBC Communications Inc. Vivendi has until Nov. 10 to make a
counteroffer to BT and SBC.</TE>
<TE>   But Vivendi, which is carefully weighing its options, is reluctant
to give up Cegetel, which owns the popular French mobile phone
operator SFR, because it wants access to Cegetel's steady cash flow.</TE>
<TE>   "By making this bid now, Vodafone has put maximum pressure on
Vivendi Universal at its most difficult time and that is now," a
source close to the board said.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of Vivendi's publishing units has been a thorny issue for
Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou, who has faced demands from French
politicians that the French publishing businesses stay out of foreign
hands. Lagardere publishes Elle and Car &amp; Driver magazines, and makes
cars for Renault.</TE>
<TE>   Joined by New York private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings,
Lagardere is among three groups that bid for Vivendi's entire
publishing business (other bidders include BNP Paribas and Carlyle
Group).</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi recently extended its deadline for bids because the first
round came in well below the $3.5 billion it hoped for, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   In selling off Vivendi's publishing business, Fourtou is undoing a
key plank of predecessor Jean-Marie Messier's strategy. It's part of
a plan to raise $12 billion in asset sales over the next 18 months
and lower the company's $19-billion media debt. Vivendi already has
sold its French consumer publishing business and its money-losing
Internet portal Vizzavi.</TE>

<HD>Webcast Measure Divides Its Ranks</HD>
<DH>Some oppose a bill in Congress to reduce royalties from
small stations, saying it still would not help them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brian Hurley broadcasts little-known music over the Internet purely
for the love of it, transmitting songs to a tiny audience from a
computer in the spare bedroom of his suburban Detroit home.</LD>
<LD>   New royalties for record companies and performers just raised the
price of Hurley's hobby, threatening to drive him and many other
small Internet broadcasters off the virtual airwaves. Yet Hurley
fiercely opposes a proposal in Congress to reduce royalties from
small Webcasters, arguing that the bill wouldn't help the vast
majority of them.</LD>
<LD>   "The practical effect of what [the bill] was going to achieve is
that a huge Webcaster with 1,000 listeners may pay as much as one
with 20, and that doesn't strike me as fair," said Hurley, whose
Webcasts reach an average of 30 listeners. "People at the bottom
would effectively be eliminated," even by the discounted rates
Congress is considering.</LD>
<TE>   His views reflect the growing rift in Webcasters' ranks over how
to treat the little guys, whether they be small businesses,
nonprofits or hobbyists like Hurley. That rift spells trouble for the
small Webcasters' bill that passed the House but got bogged down in
the Senate last week. It also threatens to spoil the chances for any
other legislation this year to discount Webcast royalties.</TE>
<TE>   The House-passed bill includes discounts that would keep some
small Webcasting businesses afloat. But its limited scope worries
other Webcasters, who fear that Congress won't revisit the issue to
provide any help for them.</TE>
<TE>   Congress ordered Webcasters in 1998 to pay royalties to record
labels for the music they played online, in addition to the royalties
they already were obliged to pay songwriters. After a long and costly
arbitration process, the librarian of Congress set the rates in July.</TE>
<TE>   For commercial Webcasters, the fee is about a penny per hour for
each listener. For noncommercial stations, the royalty is about a
third of a cent per listener hour. That can add up to thousands of
dollars per year. For Hurley, the bill could be more than $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   A computer network engineer who's between jobs, Hurley has been
broadcasting online since February 1999. "I wanted something that
would combine my interest in computers with my interest in music," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hurley's station -- dubbed Detroit Industrial Underground -- plays
songs from the industrial and electronic genres, resulting in a
propulsive and occasionally harsh mix of music.</TE>
<TE>   "It's basically a one-man project," he said, adding that he spends
about 20 hours per week on the station.</TE>
<TE>   The effort costs him a couple hundred dollars per month, including
the money he spends buying music for his playlists. He also receives
some CDs for free from independent record labels and artists,
including a number of bands from Detroit's burgeoning
electronic-music scene.</TE>
<TE>   To Hurley, Internet radio is an important outlet for bands who
don't play mainstream music. "If you're an industrial band starting
out, you will get no airplay on any station in the country, except
maybe some college stations."</TE>
<TE>   One fan of Hurley's efforts is Ed Altounian of the Detroit
Electronica Coalition, a promotional group for about three dozen
local electronic-music bands.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of levels the playing field between us and the big
artists that all the record labels are pouring their money into to
promote," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some record labels and artists agree, saying Webcasters are an
important promotional tool at a time when over-the-air broadcasters
are consolidating stations and shrinking playlists. But John Simson,
executive director of SoundExchange -- the royalties arm of the
Recording Industry Assn. of America -- said if Internet radio really
promoted CD sales, "we would have seen great increases in sales....
We haven't."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, Simson said, Webcasting isn't like over-the-air
radio. It can better satisfy a listener's cravings for some genres,
potentially reducing CD sales, he said. There's also the threat of
digital radio recorders that could search for and record specific
songs from online radio streams, Simson said.</TE>
<TE>   These concerns are driving the RIAA to demand higher royalties
from Webcasters than any other group pays to broadcast music anywhere
in the world, critics say. In the compromise that the RIAA and
artists struck with representatives of 14 small Webcasters,
commercial stations would pay up to 12% of their revenues or 7% of
their expenses instead of the rates set by the librarian of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The House speedily approved a bill by House Judiciary Committee
Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) to implement that
compromise, but the bill ran aground in the Senate after Sen. Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.) raised objections. His move was blasted by the bill's
proponents, but a number of hobbyists, college radio and
noncommercial broadcasters praised Helms.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't fault [the Webcasters who negotiated the bill] for trying
to get better rates, but it was at the expense of everyone else in
the industry," Hurley said. "The Webcasting industry as a whole needs
to work together to get lower rates for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Although Congress is expected to go back into session in
mid-November, an aide to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
said it was highly unlikely that any new measures would be taken up
by lawmakers. Nevertheless, Webcasters opposed to the Sensenbrenner
bill are pinning their hopes on persuading the House and Senate to
pass a broader measure.</TE>

<HD>Balkan Firm Is Supplying Iraq, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Weapons factory has been exporting military equipment,
officials contend. Leaders in Yugoslavia and Bosnia pledge to
investigate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alissa J. Rubin and Zoran Cirjanovic Special to The Times</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- U.S. officials have publicly confronted
leaders of Yugoslavia and Bosnia with evidence that a Balkan weapons
factory is exporting military equipment to Iraq with the complicity
of a leading Yugoslav defense company.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Tuesday that the U.S. has "clear evidence" of the transfers.</LD>
<LD>   "The officials have pledged a full investigation of these
allegations," he said. "The U.S. expects the relevant authorities in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Yugoslavia to undertake the necessary steps to
immediately halt any ongoing cooperation with Iraq, to conduct a
thorough investigation and to hold accountable those responsible."</LD>
<TE>   The evidence, including computer disks and letters, was gathered
in a surprise inspection by NATO peacekeepers of a weapons factory in
Bosnia nearly two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. diplomat who requested anonymity said the Orao weapons
factory and Yugoimport defense company had been "refurbishing
military aircraft for Iraq." Officials would not confirm whether
Serbian technical experts were helping the Iraqis in person, but
there have been local reports that several company employees are in
Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Yugoimport is based in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia and its
main republic, Serbia. Orao in located in Bijeljina, a town in
Republika Srpska, the portion of Bosnia-Herzegovina whose population
is mostly Serbian. Until Bosnia won its independence with a war that
ended in 1995, both companies were part of Yugoslavia's vast
military-industrial complex.</TE>
<TE>   If Yugoslavia fails to move quickly to deal with the incident,
diplomats and U.S. government officials said, it could undercut its
prospects for joining Western international organizations such as the
Partnership for Peace and starting on the road toward joining the
European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to do everything we can to bring them into the Western
family of nations, but they have to understand we have red lines and
this is one of them," said a senior U.S. Senate staff member who
follows the Balkans and requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   After a late-night session Tuesday, the Yugoslav government
released a statement saying it had dismissed Jovan Cekovic, the
former army general who chairs Yugoimport, and fired an assistant to
the federal defense minister in charge of military equipment and
weapons, according to a local news agency. Yugoimport was ordered to
close its office in Baghdad, according to the government statement.</TE>
<TE>   Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic told a Belgrade radio
station that "a very serious and detailed investigation has been
opened." Mihajlovic, who is also the chairman of Yugoimport's
managing board, said he had no knowledge of any arms sales to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Yugoimport also released a statement saying that although in the
past it had extensive dealings with Iraq, it respects all United
Nations weapons embargos. The Security Council imposed an embargo on
the export of arms to Iraq in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic nor Yugoslav
President Vojislav Kostunica commented on the situation, although
they have known about the charges for several days.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the U.S. asked the Bosnian government to look into
reports that the Orao firm was providing Iraq with equipment and
technical expertise. After a review, Bosnian officials denied that
there was anything suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   However, the surprise inspection by peacekeepers from Oct. 11 to
13 found evidence of illicit links, both in the portion of the
company that is housed in a former sugar factory and in documents
belonging to top company officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We found a contract between Orao and a third party outside of
Bosnia-Herzegovina which shows that Orao has been involved with the
unreported export of weapons systems and components," said Yves
Vanier, a spokesman for the peacekeepers.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence was confirmed by a Serbian minister, according to
media reports in the Belgrade daily newspaper Blic. It included
documentation of the two companies' ongoing relationship with Iraq
and their efforts to cover it up.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter addressed to the Iraqi Department of Defense dated
Sept. 25, Yugoimport officials "asked the Iraqis to remove Orao's
name from all of the documents used for maintenance, and to take off
Serbo-Croatian language instructions," the newspaper reported. The
letter also told the Iraqis to obliterate the Orao company logo,
which is stamped on equipment.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the letter reportedly said that "in the event of
United Nations weapons inspections, Yugoimports experts would be able
to disassemble all of the equipment within 10 days and that the
Iraqis then should hide the equipment. When the inspections are over,
Yugoimports would again assemble the equipment within 10 days."</TE>
<TE>   Officials refused to disclose the nature of the equipment, but the
Orao company produces and rebuilds aircraft engine parts, including
those for Russian MIG jets, which are part of the Iraqi air defense.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Serbian engineers have expertise in building radar
systems that elude enemy detection. In its war against NATO in 1999,
the far inferior Yugoslav military shot down a U.S. F-117 Stealth
fighter and protected Yugoslav military assets by using a
sophisticated radar system designed by Serbian engineers.</TE>
<TE>   Military experts say it is possible that Serbian technicians may
be helping the Iraqis design a similar system. The deal, they say, is
the result of both a long relationship with Iraq dating to the 1970s
and the almost complete independence of the army from any government
control.</TE>

<HD>Bahrainis Get a Chance at Polls</HD>
<DH>Election for newly created parliament is seen as referendum
on king's support for U.S.</DH>

<LD>MANAMA, Bahrain -- For an absolute monarch, Sheik Hamed ibn Isa
Khalifa has been acting a lot like a U.S. president worried about an
upcoming midterm congressional election.</LD>
<LD>   The 52-year-old king of Bahrain, educated at U.S. and British
military academies, has opted to do something that many Persian Gulf
rulers find to be dangerous nonsense: share at least a modicum of
political power with his people.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, voters in this island nation of more than 600,000
residents will go to the polls to elect 40 members to a newly created
parliament, the first such election since the king's late father
disbanded the legislature in 1975 during a crackdown on dissent.</LD>
<TE>   Khalifa, who succeeded his father in 1999, made a rare television
address Monday night to list his achievements and urge -- almost
plead with -- his subjects not to heed a call by Islamic groups to
boycott the election.</TE>
<TE>   "What shall fathers and mothers say to their children tomorrow if
we boycott the future?" said the king.</TE>
<TE>   Said one Bahraini intellectual of the speech, "The king looked
nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Though the election has been scheduled for months, the recent
tension between President Bush and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has
added a last-minute issue to an otherwise low-key campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "This election can be seen as a referendum on the king's support
for the U.S. as well as [on] the king himself," said Rep. Darrell E.
Issa (R-Vista), an Arab American and Persian Gulf expert in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   To Issa and other Western analysts, the election and aftermath
will test whether a pro-Western leader in the region can move his
country toward democracy without unleashing a whirlwind of anti-U.S.
sentiment and empowering conservative Islamic activists.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. armed forces have had a foothold in Bahrain since World
War II. The Navy's 5th Fleet is headquartered here, and military
planes use the international airport as a regional hub. Loss of
basing privileges could undercut American military influence in the
region.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic leaders have stepped up their criticism of the U.S.
presence as part of their opposition to Bush's threat to use military
force to topple Hussein. At an angry demonstration outside the United
Nations building here, Islamic leaders called for the U.S. to leave
Bahrain.</TE>
<TE>   "The Islamists have been able to make gains [in Bahrain] because
of the unpopularity of George Bush's war on terrorism," said Hugh
Canavan, analyst with the London-based Gulf Center for Strategic
Studies. "Bush's rhetoric is counterproductive in terms of spreading
Western values through the region."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Tuesday, the crown prince, Sheik Salman bin
Hamed Khalifa, sought to downplay the idea that a low turnout in the
election would be a vote of no confidence in his father. He noted
that British Prime Minister Tony Blair came to power with the support
of roughly 30% of all eligible voters.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get anything over what Tony Blair got, I'll be happy," said
the 33-year-old prince, who studied at Cambridge and Washington State
universities.</TE>
<TE>   The king's critics -- who are free to hold rallies and give
interviews, unlike during the repressive days under his father -- say
the venture into democracy is all for show. They note that the
parliament disbanded in 1975 had greater power.</TE>
<TE>   The promises of democracy are "written on the water," said Islamic
political leader and boycott organizer Sheik Ali Salman, who predicts
voter turnout will be as low as 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Bahraini experience is seen by many as a milestone in
the nascent effort to convince Gulf rulers to share power with their
people.</TE>
<TE>   Under the constitution adopted by Bahraini voters, the
parliament's latitude will be limited. The king retains power to name
all Cabinet ministers and veto all bills.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there will be a second legislature-like body whose
members are named by the king. That body can block any bill from
reaching the palace.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the king is neutral about the 170 candidates,
including eight women.</TE>
<TE>   But in last spring's municipal elections -- in which officials
were elected to advise the government on issues such as potholes --
nearly half of the seats were won by members of the conservative
Shiite sect, which is thought to oppose the king.</TE>
<TE>   The royal family belongs to the Sunni sect. Shiites have been
blamed by authorities for inciting political violence in the past,
allegedly at the urging of forces in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   To boost the chances of pro-monarch candidates -- and thwart the
boycott -- the king has put on a burst of politicking that any U.S.
political operative would admire.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly each day brings a new initiative to improve the economy and
standard of living in Bahrain: a housing development, better health
clinics, rights for labor unions, higher wages for public employees,
even a new home for the family of a 12-year-old girl whose
disappearance has been the subject of heavy media coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The king's wife, Shaika Sabika bin Ibrahim al Khalifa, has visited
all five parliamentary districts to woo women voters. Her message is
akin to that of an American first lady: Tell me your concerns, and I
will tell them to my husband.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the merits of democracy, the king and his government know
that it is good for business. Investors prefer a less autocratic and
more transparent society, officials here acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   With only modest oil resources, Bahrain has double-digit
unemployment, and its citizens enjoy few of the social welfare
benefits bestowed on citizens of oil-rich neighbors Kuwait and Qatar.
The king's government is trying to encourage tourism and transform
Bahrain into a banking and insurance hub.</TE>
<TE>   As the election approaches, officials reject any suggestion that
they are attempting to lead a democracy movement in the Persian Gulf.
The idea is particularly touchy with leaders in another neighbor,
Saudi Arabia, which has no plans for elections.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not done this to be poster boys for democratic reform in
the Arab world," said the crown prince.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have invited reporters and candidates to watch the vote
counting to avoid any suggestion of fraud. Bahrain studied election
procedures in Europe and the U.S., including the controversy in
Florida after the 2000 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   "We have nothing to hide," said election official Ahmed Ateyatalla
Khalifa. "We will have no hanging chads."</TE>

<HD>Suspect Says He Trained at Al Qaeda Camps</HD>
<DH>As his trial starts in Germany, Moroccan accused of
abetting the Sept. 11 attacks testifies that religion propelled him
to Afghanistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Terry McDermott and Dirk Laabs Special to The Times</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HAMBURG, Germany -- A Moroccan accused of providing logistical
support to the Sept. 11 suicide pilots told a court Tuesday that he
and other members of the alleged Hamburg terror cell trained in Al
Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, but he said the training was for purely
religious purposes.</LD>
<LD>   Mounir Motassadeq is the first person accused of direct
involvement in the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon to go on trial anywhere. He is charged with aiding and
abetting the murders of more than 3,000 people, but he said he knew
nothing of plans for the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Motassadeq, a 28-year-old electrical engineering student,
testified for four hours on the opening day of his trial. His
attorneys had previously denied that he attended Al Qaeda camps, but
Motassadeq said in court that he had spent a month in a camp outside
the southern Afghan city of Kandahar in July 2000.</LD>
<TE>   He said that Mohamed Atta, believed by investigators to have been
the leader of the Hamburg cell, gave him detailed instructions on how
to reach Afghanistan, but he testified that he had no direct
knowledge that Atta himself ever attended a camp. He acknowledged
that many of the other men accused of belonging to the cell --
alleged pilots Marwan Al-Shehhi and Ziad Samir Jarrah and supporters
Ramzi Binalshibh and Zakariya Essabar -- all went to camps in
Afghanistan. He said he met Essabar outside the Kandahar camp nearly
every day for prayers.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq said he did not learn the camp was financed by Osama
bin Laden until after he arrived there. He said he never saw Bin
Laden but was told by others that Bin Laden visited regularly,
sometimes staying overnight nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq said the men from Hamburg never discussed becoming
suicide bombers, which he said would be a violation of his faith. In
fact, he said, training in the camps was an end in itself, a
fulfillment of religious duty.</TE>
<TE>   "We spoke about the jihad, but we meant struggle," Motassadeq
said. "I decided to study five years electrical engineering, then go
back and bring electricity to a village and the poor people. Then I
did the jihad too. That's the jihad I decided for.</TE>
<TE>   "As a Muslim, according to the Koran, it is your duty to learn how
to shoot, swim and ride a horse. That's why I wanted to be trained
militarily. It's normal, like serving in the Bundeswehr [German
army]. Afghanistan was the nearest country for us to be trained
militarily," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq stressed several times that he was not asked by anybody
to join the jihad when he left the camp after a month.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody gave me any orders," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq did not make an opening statement. Instead, he answered
questions from his attorneys, prosecutors and the judge. Even though
he said he was unaware of the Sept. 11 plot, his testimony provided a
first detailed glimpse into the relationships among the Hamburg men.
Chief Judge Albrecht Mentz established in an hourlong examination
that Motassadeq knew all the alleged cell members and was
particularly close to Atta, with whom he met regularly, as often as
four times a week, for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq said he prayed with Atta, ate with him on the weekends,
and studied and worked with him at a computer company, where several
of the cell members were employed part time.</TE>
<TE>   When asked by the judge what kind of topics the men discussed,
Motassadeq said: "Religious and political topics, such as the
problems in Kosovo, Chechnya and Palestine." He said their
discussions were never anti-American or anti-Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   He said there was an understanding within the group "that there is
a war going on in Palestine and this problem needs to be solved."
When asked how, Motassadeq said: "We need a political solution. The
people need to communicate. Violence never solves any problem....
Suicide missions are not allowed, according to the Koran. There are
rules even in war -- you are not allowed to kill women, children and
old people."</TE>
<TE>   The men frequently discussed their desire to fight in the
separatist Russian republic of Chechnya. In late 1999, Motassadeq
said, Atta, Al-Shehhi, Binalshibh, Jarrah and Essabar all decided to
go there to fight. Al-Shehhi was the first one to fly to Afghanistan
and the first to come back, less than two months later. "Marwan
[Al-Shehhi] said: 'They don't need fighters anymore. That's why I had
to come back.' "</TE>
<TE>   Al-Shehhi and Atta told Motassadeq how to get to the Afghan camps,
what hotels to stay in and how to make contact, he said. Fly to
Quetta, Pakistan, they told him, and ask any taxi driver how to get
to the "Taliban office." People at that office, an old hospital, knew
how to arrange entry into Afghanistan, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq said he crossed the border in taxicabs with a handful
of other Arabs. They did not even need to present their passports, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Of his own trip to Afghanistan, Motassadeq, who is married and has
a child, said he went because the timing was right.</TE>
<TE>   "Our baby was about to be born soon," he said. "I knew if I don't
go now, I will never go."</TE>
<TE>   For four weeks, Motassadeq said, he was trained "theoretically and
practically" in how to use and fire Kalashnikov rifles. About 100 men
were at the camp when he was there, he said. The seven recruits in
his group stayed together in one tent and fired "three to four
bullets a day on targets -- I didn't always succeed." Motassadeq said
there were four levels of training at the camp, but he never went
beyond the first level.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the trial's opening day, Mentz told Motassadeq that
he had told the court some "new and surprising" things.</TE>
<TE>   "Please consider now [whether] to take one or two more steps.
Think about whether you want to stick to your statement that the
camps really had no ideological or political background," the judge
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mentz urged Motassadeq to consider whether the trips of the cell
members to the camps -- all within six months and in two coordinated
waves, which Motassadeq confirmed -- really were a coincidence or
part of a broader plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Take your time, think about it. You don't have to answer
tomorrow," the judge said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Add Indonesian Group to List of Terrorist
Organizations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. government will designate the Islamic militant group
suspected of carrying out a deadly car bombing in Bali on Oct. 12 a
terrorist organization, State Department officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jemaah Islamiah has been blamed for bombings throughout Southeast
Asia, and U.S. officials say the group has ties to Osama bin Laden's
Al Qaeda terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   The group seeks to create a fundamentalist Islamic state
comprising Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the southern
Philippines. Some U.S. officials say the group has been trying to
open a new front of terrorism against the United States.</LD>
<TE>   The designation will make it illegal for Americans to donate money
to the group and will prevent its members from obtaining visas to
enter the United States. The department asserted earlier this year in
its annual report on terrorism that Jemaah Islamiah members were tied
to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-four other organizations are on the State Department's list
of terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   The move represents another public acknowledgment by the Bush
administration that Indonesia is plagued by terrorism. President
Megawati Sukarnoputri's government has sought to play down such
connections for fear of driving off the foreign investment that it
badly needs.</TE>
<TE>   The car bombing on the vacation island of Bali killed nearly 200
people and increased pressure on Indonesia to go after suspected
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the U.S., several of Indonesia's neighbors, notably
Singapore, have been pushing for Megawati's government to crack down
on militants. But authorities have treated the subject gingerly, for
fear of offending public opinion in the world's most populous Muslim
country.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. move comes just after the formal arrest of Jemaah
Islamiah's alleged leader, Abu Bakar Bashir. He is accused of helping
plan a series of church bombings in Indonesia in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of shifting opinion within Indonesia, two large moderate
Muslim groups have called this week for the government to take
measures against Islamic militants suspected of violence.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>North Korea agreed today to resolve international concerns over its
nuclear weapons program through dialogue, but stopped short of
meeting a U.S. demand to immediately abandon the program.</LD>
<LD>   "In order to guarantee peace and stability on the Korean
peninsula, the South and North will actively cooperate in resolving
all the issues, including the nuclear issue, through dialogue,"
according to a joint statement after four days of talks.</LD>
<LD>   But the agreement did not contain a clear North Korean promise to
give up its nuclear weapons program, which violates a 1994 agreement
with the United States.</LD>

<HD>Father's Modest Dream Leads to Tragic Journey</HD>
<DH>Mexican migrant who hoped to earn enough to finish his home
died in rail car.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Boudreaux</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LOS CONOS, Mexico -- Roberto Esparza was a skilled, hard-working
young man with a welding shop in his mother's garage. He had a baby
son, the joy of his life, and a modest start toward his dream: the
mud-brick walls of a little home for his new family.</LD>
<LD>   But one day in June, Esparza despaired of his limits and made a
heartbreaking choice. Welding jobs in this poor farming village bring
$4 on a good day, too little for building materials in addition to
food, so he turned to a thriving local businessman for help.</LD>
<LD>   The man was a wealthy migrant trafficker. For $1,500, he would get
the 23-year-old tradesman to Sarasota, Fla., where he might earn
enough to return next year and finish his house. On June 10, Esparza
kissed his wife and left for the Texas border with two cousins.</LD>
<TE>   Then something went horribly wrong. Esparza, one cousin and nine
other migrants died after being left in a locked grain car, and their
skeletal remains were discovered only last week in a Denison, Iowa,
rail yard. The trafficker called the family from somewhere in Florida
to beg forgiveness.</TE>
<TE>   The family's tragedy underlines the poverty that spurs migration
from thousands of small communities across Mexico, making
people-smuggling their most lucrative enterprise and draining away
their ablest workers. The gruesome scene in Iowa was a sign of the
risks Mexicans are willing to take for higher-paying work in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   The problem will be high on the agenda this weekend when President
Vicente Fox, playing host to world leaders, will press President Bush
for a revival of Mexico's proposals to make migration by its laborers
to the U.S. easier and safer. Talks on the issue were shelved after
the Sept. 11 attacks diverted Bush's attention.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Border Patrol has stepped up its checkpoints in populated
areas along the Mexican border since the mid-1990s, but this has only
prompted undocumented migrants to take more perilous paths. At least
320 people have been reported dead trying to cross the frontier in
the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's terrible what happens to them," said Father Jesus Mendoza,
the Roman Catholic priest for Los Conos and the 23 other villages of
El Llano municipality in Aguascalientes state, about 260 miles
northwest of Mexico City. "They die in train cars, drown in the
river, get lost in the desert."</TE>
<TE>   At least 600 of El Llano's 16,000 people work in the U.S., most of
them in Florida, authorities here say. The priest said he has buried
at least a dozen others who died trying to get there over the last
eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers leaving Mass here Sunday said the latest deaths left the
community shaken but not surprised, gripped by new fears for those
trekking north but no less certain that they'll go anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "You can never trust the smugglers," said Saturnino Martinez, a
chicken farmer whose teenage son followed one smuggler to Texas this
year. "But you cannot stop the young people from going to them. There
aren't enough jobs here."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Francisco Silva estimated a 20% to 30% jobless rate in El
Llano. A textile plant, its biggest employer, is losing jobs to
China, and farmers are adjusting poorly to a decade-old withdrawal of
government subsidies. There's little commercial traffic on the muddy
streets save for the twice-weekly Corona beer truck.</TE>
<TE>   So poor are people here that, when a collection was taken up for
the Esparzas, the heartfelt sympathy for the family translated into
just $69.05 from 44 donors.</TE>
<TE>   Although remittances sent home from U.S.-based migrants
are Mexico's third-largest source of income, El Llano has not benefited
as much as some places have.</TE>
<TE>   "Our young men go north, dreaming of returning with money for a
car, a house, or so a brother or sister can go to university," Father
Mendoza said. "But they get there and forget why they went. They try
to live like Americans. They get another wife. They drink."</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Esparza seemed an exception. He labored 11 months in an
Indiana shoe factory in 2000, came back to start a family, and left
again in mid-2001 to build swimming pools in Sarasota, sending
hundreds of dollars home each month.</TE>
<TE>   Back from Florida last March, he met his son for the first time,
and the two became nearly inseparable. His mother's four-room house
began to feel cramped, occupied as it was by 11 members of the
Esparza clan, so he started building his own. To pay for bricks, he
bought welding equipment and set up shop, making metal doors and
signs.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted his son to grow up better than he had, in a nicer
place," said his wife, Irene Godinez.</TE>
<TE>   But Esparza soon realized there wasn't enough money here. Without
one last trip to Florida, he told his wife, the new house would
remain an illusion.</TE>
<TE>   "We can build gradually," she remembers arguing, begging him to
stay. "But he was driven to finish it."</TE>
<TE>   Godinez, 22, and her mother-in-law, Leticia Rico, 45, told this
story while playing with the toddler, now 14 months, in their tiny
living room. Both women wept as the tale turned to woe.</TE>
<TE>   Traffickers in migrants are known as coyotes, and the best-known
coyote in town supervised a cross-border network of guides. Esparza
told his wife he trusted the man, who had smuggled him safely across
the Rio Grande last year and put him on an airplane to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the welder was accompanied by two 16-year-old cousins,
Omar Esparza and Eduardo Martinez. On June 10, they took a bus to
Matamoros, the family said, and were rafted across the Rio Grande.
Five days later, they joined about 30 other undocumented migrants in
Harlingen, Texas, where they were smuggled aboard three empty grain
hoppers.</TE>
<TE>   A grain hopper is a rail car that can be sealed tightly from the
outside to keep its contents clean and dry. Locked inside too long, a
stowaway can suffocate, starve or succumb to 150-degree heat.</TE>
<TE>   "You're dripping wet, gasping for air and praying to get caught,"
said Fidel Macias, a Los Conos migrant who once spent 14 hours in a
hopper in Texas before the Border Patrol opened it.</TE>
<TE>   In stifling darkness, the Esparzas and their companions apparently
were supposed to travel several hours to Houston, far beyond the last
Border Patrol checkpoint. Then the coyote or a guide was to let them
out for a safer overland trip to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Rico, Roberto's mother, said she learned these details from
Eduardo Martinez, who was caught and deported. Border Patrol agents
inspecting the train in Harlingen found him among the stowaways in
two hoppers but didn't check the third.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Los Conos in late June, the teenager told Rico: "Don't
worry, Auntie, the other boys got through safely."</TE>
<TE>   But weeks went by without word from them. The family's agony
stretched into the fall.</TE>
<TE>   The third hopper, it turns out, had gone not to Houston but to
Oklahoma City, where it remained in storage from June 18 to Oct. 10.
The 11 stowaways' bodies were discovered Oct. 14 after the car
arrived in Denison to collect grain.</TE>
<TE>   Of the dead, only Roberto and Omar Esparza and two Honduran men
carried identification papers. Officials said the others -- three men
and four women -- may remain unidentified unless relatives come
forward with DNA samples.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, before the bodies were officially identified,
the coyote called Roberto's stepfather from Florida to report that the
two Esparzas were among the dead, Rico said. The coyote was crying
into the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sorry, but don't do anything against me," he pleaded,
according to Rico. "Think of my family."</TE>
<TE>   "Why didn't you think of my family?" the stepfather replied before
slamming down the phone. "You could have saved them."</TE>
<TE>   The Esparza family and others here want the trafficker in jail,
but he hasn't been seen here in months.</TE>
<TE>   Coyotes have rarely been prosecuted in Mexico. But the government
is starting to crack down, using laws against organized crime.
Mexico's Congress is debating a bill to raise the maximum prison term
for human smuggling from 12 to 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   But Fox wants a comprehensive deal with Washington that would
expand permanent U.S. visas and guest-worker programs for Mexicans,
give legal status to about 3 million Mexican migrants working in the
U.S., and pump aid and investment into villages like Los Conos to
keep their workers home.</TE>
<TE>   "Fox and Bush could join forces," said Rico, whose late father
worked six months in a U.S. guest-worker program in the 1940s. "They
could end the fear and uncertainty of thousands of families over what
might happen when their children go north."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>BAGHDAD -- More than 100 Iraqis held an unusual street demonstration
here Tuesday, seeking information about jailed relatives who did not
return home after President Saddam Hussein declared a general amnesty
and all but emptied the country's jails.</LD>
<LD>   Although the group was small, and demonstrators chanted
pro-government, pro-Hussein slogans, just the fact of such a protest
was remarkable for a society as tightly controlled as this one.</LD>
<LD>   Whether it was an emotional response to the dramatic events of two
days earlier, when the nation's prisons were virtually cleared of all
political and criminal detainees, or a sign of budding discontent
depended on who was doing the interpreting.</LD>
<TE>   "I think this is a very unusual thing to happen," said Wamidh
Nadhmi, a political science professor at Baghdad University. Although
he said that the regime remains strong and in control, he said it
appeared that "there must be some kind of organization behind it that
knows what they are doing."</TE>
<TE>   The demonstration began in the early afternoon, when men and women
carrying pictures and chanting slogans presented the presidential
office in Baghdad with a petition asking for information about
missing relatives. The government said all inmates had been let go --
including all political prisoners -- except for spies for Israel and
America.</TE>
<TE>   Tens of thousands of inmates poured out of the nation's prisons
Sunday, often rushing into the arms of loved ones. But some people
who had earlier entered Iraq's prisons didn't come out. They may have
died or been executed or, perhaps, are still being held. It was some
of their relatives who decided to take to the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "My son was arrested 10 years ago, and I haven't heard anything of
him since," said a woman in the crowd in Baghdad. "They took him with
no explanation. Now I want to know where he is and when he will be
released."</TE>
<TE>   Especially unusual was the group's decision to gather outside the
Information Ministry, a nondescript building on a busy street. It is
the place where journalists from foreign news organizations often
work.</TE>
<TE>   This prompted some, like Nadhmi, to conclude that a group was
behind the event. If he was right, it would mark the first time in
years that an opposition group has attempted to operate openly inside
Hussein's Iraq. Nadhmi said that if those organizers stuck to
reasonable demands, it would be healthy, but if they believed the
regime is weak, they would be wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an opposition," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone agreed. One European diplomat said, "I am not sure it
is significant enough to draw any conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   Whether organized or not, the group was clever in its approach.
Its members not only chanted pro-presidential slogans but carried
pictures of the president -- while also demanding information. The
dual message seemed to put off the police who responded. Often, when
the authorities tried to shoo the protesters away, they chanted,
"Yes, yes, President Saddam Hussein," and the police backed off.</TE>
<TE>   The authorities eventually fired shots over the protesters' heads,
and they dispersed. Their demands were reportedly given to
Information Minister Mohammed Said Sahaf, who had announced the
amnesty on TV.</TE>

<HD>Heat Won't Preclude Iraq War</HD>
<DH>Unlike in 1991, analysts say, new technology means the
Pentagon is prepared to battle Saddam Hussein in the spring or even
summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Hendren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon is prepared to invade Iraq even if
political negotiations and Saddam Hussein's maneuvers drag on into
winter and rule out action during the coolest months, defense
officials and military analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   For months, military analysts have spoken of a winter war as
essentially the only option and suggested that it would be impossible
for U.S. troops to fight in the searing Iraqi summer.</LD>
<LD>   With an eye on the calendar, President Bush rushed to secure a
tough resolution on Iraq from Congress and is pushing for a second
one in the United Nations. Administration officials have grown
increasingly impatient as the U.N. negotiations have dragged on for
weeks. Bush has warned that once a resolution is adopted, he will
tolerate no delay in inspections for chemical, nuclear and biological
weapons after U.N. teams return to Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Yet even as diplomacy forges ahead on the presumption that the
"weather window" for an attack will close in March, the Pentagon is
ready to fight a war in the spring, one that could even spill over
into summer, when temperatures in Iraq can hit 120.</TE>
<TE>   Advances in weapons technology and military tactics over the last
decade have dramatically altered the calculations for waging a second
Persian Gulf war, making weather far less a determining factor than
it was during the first conflict, in winter 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Improved surveillance, new satellite-guided bombs that can plunge
to their targets through thick cloud cover and less restrictive
chemical-protection suits have made U.S. troops and their equipment
more weatherproof than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "We would prefer to get it done by May for lots of reasons,
strategic as well as weather, but there's less constraint" than
during the '91 war, said Michael Vickers, a former Green Beret and
CIA operations officer now with the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments think tank in Washington. "Even if Saddam
manages to delay this until, say, May, it doesn't necessarily
preclude conflict until next November. We might be willing to launch
the campaign in the summer."</TE>
<TE>   Gulf dwellers tend to scoff at the notion that the weather should
affect U.S. plans.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you come from Texas or Arizona, the weather is not
that different," said Bader Omar Dafa, Qatar's ambassador to
Washington. A potential command center for U.S. air power is now
rising in the Qatari desert.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, Pentagon planners say, U.S. forces would have to alter
their strategy for a later attack. But in the end, a strike decision
would be largely a matter of how as opposed to when.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times when weather can be a detractor and when there's
an optimum window. But we are capable of being an all-weather force,"
a senior defense official said. "Would we hate it? Sure. But putting
a window on it isn't right."</TE>
<TE>   As part of their contingency planning, military strategists say,
officials at U.S. Central Command are already mapping weather
patterns in Iraq, using technology to explore the nuances of their
effects on warfare. A testing facility at Florida's Eglin Air Force
Base, for example, can simulate any weather, from conditions in
Antarctica to those in the tropics.</TE>
<TE>   Under one option, U.S. and allied forces could rely mostly on air
power during the hot months and employ special operations soldiers on
land only in key operations, military analysts and defense officials
say. Under the worst-case scenario, American and allied forces would
simply prepare for high numbers of heat casualties in brief fighting
that most analysts predict would last less than a month.</TE>
<TE>   "You can work around it when you employ air power with the amount
of effectiveness the U.S. Air Force and the Navy are capable of,"
said Col. William F. Burnette, vice commander of the Air Force
Weather Agency at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. "We don't want
thousands of guys crapping out in chem suits on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has more than a million new chemical protection suits
and masks -- more than enough for the 250,000 or so U.S. soldiers,
sailors, Marines and airmen most analysts believe would be required
to topple Hussein's regime. That's an improvement from 1991, when
soldiers complained that supplies were inadequate and the suits
suffocating, although Gulf veterans say problems remain.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi military defectors and senior U.S. defense analysts say
there is a significant chance that Hussein would use chemical or
biological weapons if attacked, because unlike the '91 war, which
aimed only to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait, an invasion now would
be aimed at toppling Hussein. Although the Iraqi leader denies having
chemical or biological arms, the U.S. suspects that he does and notes
that he has used chemical arms on Iranian soldiers and Iraqi Kurds in
the past.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gulf War, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf relied heavily on
weather reports, which he considered so sensitive that his press
briefers often declined to describe the weather in Iraq to reporters.
On Oct. 29, 1990, nearly three months before the war was launched,
Schwarzkopf asked for a detailed study of how the weather would
affect military operations.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted meticulous information on rain, sandstorms, wind and
temperatures through April. He wanted precise daylight hours because
the short light of winter gives U.S. planes and ground troops with
night-vision equipment the power to "own the night," in the words of
one pilot.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis came back nine days later: "The bottom line was that
mid-February is an extremely advantageous time for U.S. forces to
attack," Schwarzkopf wrote in his autobiography. Opting to launch an
air war with the goal of saving the optimum time for a ground
invasion, U.S. forces went in on Jan. 17.</TE>
<TE>   There was ample reason for avoiding summer fighting. The Tomahawk
missiles and heat-seeking devices that were celebrated for their
effectiveness in the Gulf War sometimes fail in extreme heat. The
bulky Gulf-era protective anti-chemical suits and masks would have
made it punishing, if not impossible, to rappel down a rope from a
helicopter or even to turn a wrench under the sweltering Iraqi summer
sun.</TE>
<TE>   Yet fighting in the Iraqi winter also has its disadvantages. In
the Gulf War, inclement weather often limited AC-130 gunships'
ability to offer close support to ground troops. The laser-guided
bombs that made their debut in 1991 were ineffective when there was
heavy cloud cover.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, technological advances have solved many such
problems. AC-130s have been equipped with thermal imaging cameras
that can see through the haze common in the Iraqi winter. U.S.
soldiers have patches taped on their helmets that identify them to
aircraft even in low light.</TE>
<TE>   Surveillance planes, such as U2s, now use airborne sensors that
can penetrate clouds with radar. And when weather defeats
laser-guided bombs, warplanes can now use the satellite-guided Joint
Direct Attack Munitions used in Afghanistan, which can find their
targets through heavy cloud cover.</TE>
<TE>   Despite advances in defending against the heat, the problems posed
by temperatures that can top what amounts to 140 degrees for soldiers
in heavy gear and armored vehicles are myriad. The vision-distorting
flush that radiates off the white sand grows so intense that even T.
E. Lawrence, the British adventurer better known as Lawrence of
Arabia, conceded, "After a while I could not endure it."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the summer heat and winter clouds, there is the ubiquitous,
choking sand. In 1991, American equipment operators strapped
pantyhose over vehicle air intakes until small-bore grates were
delivered. The problem is worst in the sweeping thunderstorms from
February to April and the sandstorms that rake the desert from April
through summer's end.</TE>
<TE>   It was just such swirling sand that Delta commandos encountered in
Iran in 1979 on their way to try to rescue hostages at the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran. Eight commandos and pilots died when a plane and
helicopter collided in a sandstorm before ever leaving the ground.
The debacle put an end to further rescue attempts. Now, using
commercial satellites, Air Force weathermen can pull down data on
dust storms as well.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. soldiers might be able to fight in any weather, but their
performance will inevitably suffer in summer, and the number of heat
casualties would rise, according to soldiers who know the region.
During the winter fighting of 1991, heat illness accounted for less
than 1% of sick-call visits to Navy clinics, which treated all U.S.
service members, but summer illnesses could range from painful heat
contractions to delirium and even death.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the armed forces have made some advances that blunt
the heat. The Gulf War-era chemical gear -- a bulky mask and a
charcoal suit with a strap-on hood -- has been replaced by an
improved mask and a sleeker, one-piece suit designed to seal out
chemicals but cool the wearer by allowing heat to pass through the
fabric. New Humvee-mounted biological agent detection labs, as well
as the Fox chemical detection vehicles, are air-conditioned -- to
protect the equipment, not the soldiers, Army officials say.</TE>
<TE>   There are advantages to fighting in the summer: Clear weather
expands the options for warplanes. And there are also regions in Iraq
where the cold grows lethal. Schwarzkopf acknowledged in his
autobiography that he had underestimated the severity of the weather
in Iraq's mountainous northwest, where two members of a U.S.
"Scud-busting" mission to take out Iraqi missiles on the ground died
of exposure in freezing temperatures in the war's early days.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzkopf relied on combat weathermen like Air Force Master Sgt.
Jeffrey Johnson to keep him informed. Johnson had no computer and
needed five or more colleagues to help lug 800 pounds of TV monitors
and antennas to intercept satellite reports. None of the instruments
could detect a sandstorm.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, of the Air Force's 10th Combat Weather Squadron,
remembers looking at the printout of a satellite picture in the
desert and seeing a thunderstorm. Minutes later, the rains kicked up
a dust storm that blotted out the sun.</TE>
<TE>   "In the middle of the day, it was like it was 2 in the morning. It
was just pitch black. It was unreal," Johnson, 39, recalled in an
interview from Ft. Bragg, N.C. "That was probably the scariest day of
my life. You wanted to tap your shoes and say, 'There's no place like
home.' "</TE>

<HD>U.S. Text Meets Tough Going</HD>
<DH>Russia and France lead a tenacious effort to soften the
American draft of a Security Council resolution on Iraqi arms
inspections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley and Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- In a setback for Washington's hopes for quick
Security Council approval of a resolution on Iraq, Russia and France
led tough and bitter negotiations Tuesday aimed at reining in an
increasingly impatient United States.</LD>
<LD>   In two meetings of the five veto-holding Security Council members
Tuesday, representatives of Moscow and Paris and, for the first time,
Beijing fought hard to shape a U.N. resolution that would keep the
U.S. from using force against Iraq without council approval. They
spent hours going line by line through a U.S.-drafted measure.</LD>
<LD>   "The United Nations does not have forever...," said White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer. "The United Nations is entering the final
stages on this, and we would like to see an agreement reached."</LD>
<TE>   The United States floated its draft resolution Monday, calling for
tougher inspections to seek out any Iraqi weapons of mass destruction
and saying it would consult with the Security Council about the
serious "consequences" after any report that Iraq was not cooperating
with the monitors.</TE>
<TE>   However, the draft made clear that the U.S. would not have to wait
for the Security Council to authorize military action. The proposal
also recalled that Iraq is already in "material breach" of U.N.
resolutions and that failure to cooperate with the world body would
constitute a further breach -- which, U.S. officials argue, is
sufficient justification to warrant use of force.</TE>
<TE>   Russia and France, backed by China, fear this is a hidden trigger
that would allow an attack on the regime of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, while diplomats said Washington considered it a warning for
Baghdad to take Security Council demands seriously.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and British officials hoped their concession would have been
enough to satisfy the French, who don't want Iraqi interference with
the inspection process to automatically trigger a military strike.
The French, and at least half the other 14 members of the council,
want the U.S. to wait for U.N. approval before taking any military
action. The U.S. proposal was crafted to meet them halfway, but
diplomats said Tuesday that it wasn't close enough.</TE>
<TE>   In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov told the
Interfax news agency after he met chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans
Blix that "the American draft resolution ... does not, for the
moment, meet the criteria which the Russian side had previously
outlined and stands by now."</TE>
<TE>   And in Luxembourg, French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin
said, "Some progress is still needed, and so we have much work to
do."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday morning, the hard work began. Russian Ambassador to the
U.N. Sergei V. Lavrov summoned the other four veto-holding members of
the Security Council -- France, Britain, China and the U.S. -- to the
Russian mission. For three hours, the diplomats went over the text,
arguing over words and concepts. Unable to agree, they met again for
an hour in the evening and adjourned without significant
breakthroughs, diplomats said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to allow the negotiating process a little bit of
time," said U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte after the evening
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   As they get down to final negotiations, the U.S. and its chief
partners on the Security Council have vastly different takes on where
the resolution stands.</TE>
<TE>   French officials charged that the U.S. compromises did not take
out the most contentious passages but merely moved them to other
parts of the resolution. The Russians, who had taken a back seat to
the French in challenging the American demands on Iraq, have suddenly
dug in their heels.</TE>
<TE>   "The Russians are in nit-picking mode," rejecting each paragraph
as unacceptable, said a council diplomat who requested anonymity.
"They are just playing hard on every single point in a way that
wasn't helpful."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in weeks of negotiations, the Chinese also have
taken a firm stand since Monday in rejecting parts of the draft
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "Take it or leave it" messages from hard-liners in Washington and
charges of American "sneaky tricks" in manipulating the text have
caused some diplomats to ask if the U.S. resolution was written to
fail. On Tuesday, one diplomat from a veto-holding country for the
first time questioned U.S. intentions -- and strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "I've begun to wonder whether the United States really wants a
resolution," said the official, who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials remained confident.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a complicated process, because it is a long
text," said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. "It's
probably going to be a messy process. I would advise people not to
overreact to the comments and debate that they might see ... because
at the end of the day, other members of the council want a strong
Security Council resolution that can effectively disarm Iraq, and
that's what we're trying to do."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Bush administration appears to be playing a
tactical game in holding on to tough draft language until it is
assured that the resolution will not be too watered down. Further
U.S. compromises might be in the offing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to work with these guys. We know their concerns.
You'll see a certain amount of flexibility," a senior State
Department official said. He described the negative reaction to U.S.
revisions of its resolution, which was presented in full text Monday,
as "constructive" to Washington's thinking.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. does not intend to budge on the issue of including
language about Iraq being in "material breach," which U.S. officials
point out has been used at least 11 times in earlier resolutions and
Security Council statements on Iraq.</TE>

<HD>Jiang's Visit With Bush Likely to Be More Show Than Summit</HD>
<DH>The Chinese leader's meeting at the U.S. president's ranch
may polish his image, but no breakthroughs are expected to come of
it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Chu and Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BEIJING--This time, it's personal.</LD>
<LD>   Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrived Tuesday in the U.S. for a
three-day trip that will include a brief meeting Friday with
President Bush at his Texas ranch. The two men are expected to cram
discussion of Iraq, North Korea, weapons sales, Taiwan and perhaps a
few other issues into one hourlong tete-a-tete and a working lunch.</LD>
<LD>   But in spite of sunny official statements about the significance
of the visit for Sino-U.S. ties, observers on both sides of the
Pacific expect no breakthroughs to emerge from the summit.</LD>
<TE>   Many analysts believe that the trip is more of a sentimental
valedictory tour for Jiang, a final chance for the Chinese leader to
burnish his credentials as a world statesman before his expected
retirement next month as chief of China's Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   Tramping around the First Ranch and acting chummy with the U.S.
president would allow Jiang to bask in Bush's reflected glory.</TE>
<TE>   "I regard this visit as very much a personal one. It's not a state
visit," said Chu Shulong, an expert on international relations at
Qinghua University in Beijing. "Jiang Zemin likes to go to the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at China's Foreign Ministry acknowledged last week that
no joint statement or communique is likely to come out of the summit
-- the third meeting between the two leaders in about a year.</TE>
<TE>   But, a senior Chinese diplomat told reporters, Jiang's American
tour, featuring stops in Chicago and Houston, marks "a very important
event" that will help the two countries further "develop a
constructive and cooperative relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Sino-U.S. ties have sailed along on a fairly even keel during the
last 12 months, after weathering a major contretemps in April 2001,
when an American spy plane crash-landed in southern China.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the knotty relationship between the world's most
populous nation and its most powerful one loomed large on the
diplomatic stage. But attention has since been diverted by the
American-led campaign against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Elbowed out of the spotlight, relations between Washington and
Beijing have improved marginally and there have been no new crises.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Beijing bowed to longtime American demands that it
publish a list of missile-related items banned from export. Days
later, the White House officially labeled as "terrorist" an obscure
Islamic group that Beijing accuses of fomenting separatism in western
China.</TE>
<TE>   The two countries have engaged in some modest intelligence-sharing
following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. On Tuesday, Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft came to the Chinese capital to open an FBI attache office.</TE>
<TE>   And last week, two high-ranking U.S. diplomats were in Beijing to
discuss the surprise admission by North Korea, one of China's allies,
that it is pursuing a nuclear weapons program. In Texas, Bush is
likely to urge Jiang to bring Chinese pressure to bear on Pyongyang
to desist.</TE>
<TE>   Both Chinese and U.S. officials also report a more cordial, if not
ideal, atmosphere over issues of human rights and military exchanges.
The two sides could barely stand to talk to one another following
last year's spy-plane crisis, but once again phone calls are getting
answered and conversations are being held, rather than lectures
delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing says that a human rights dialogue will probably take place
before year's end. And Bush has ordered a resumption of military
contacts, such as the visit to China this month by Vice Adm. Paul G.
Gaffney, president of the National Defense University in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "There's enough mutual trust and confidence that we can disagree
without being disagreeable," U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard
L. Armitage said on a visit here two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The relative calm in the relationship suits both nations for now,
experts say, because both are facing a more pressing concern: regime
change.</TE>
<TE>   For the U.S., that means Iraq. The Bush administration is busy
trying to drum up support for its tough line against Saddam Hussein
and is mindful that China wields veto power at the United Nations as
a permanent member of the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Although China would probably not approve any resolution
authorizing military force against Baghdad, the White House hopes
that Beijing will abstain from voting and generally keep quiet.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, the Bush administration just wants the Chinese to stay
out of the way," a former U.S. diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing may use its leverage to demand that the U.S. lift
sanctions slapped on Chinese companies suspected of exporting
sensitive military equipment. It also wants Washington to end a ban
on letting American companies launch satellites aboard Chinese
rockets.</TE>
<TE>   But officials here deny that Jiang will demand any quid pro quo
over Iraq while in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not deal-making," He Yafei, of the Chinese Foreign Ministry,
said at a briefing last week.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Beijing is eager not to pick a fight with the U.S.
at the moment because it too is focusing on regime change -- within
China itself. The country is gearing up for a crucial Communist Party
gathering next month, at which Jiang and other senior officials are
expected to pass the baton to a younger generation of leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Embroiled in political machinations at home, China has little
energy to spare for diplomatic clashes abroad.</TE>
<TE>   This may explain why the Chinese government has reacted rather
meekly to recent U.S. actions regarding Taiwan that would probably
have provoked a stronger response in the past. Chinese officials have
been alarmed by what they see as a growing closeness between the U.S.
and the island, which Beijing claims as its territory but which has
had its own separate government for half a century.</TE>
<TE>   Since the beginning of the year, Washington has approved more arms
sales to Taiwan and allowed the island's defense minister and its
first lady to make trips to the U.S. Last month, the vice minister of
defense, Kang Ning-Hsiang, became the highest-ranking Taiwanese
military figure to come calling at the Pentagon since the U.S. broke
off diplomatic relations with Taipei in favor of mainland China in
1979.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the Bush administration also decided to resume flying
the U.S. flag over the unofficial American consulate in Taipei.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing has lodged official protests with the U.S. over these
developments. But Chinese leaders have not vented outrage in public,
through the state-controlled media, as they have been wont to do in
the past.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the time to act strongly in external relations with
the U.S.," said Chu of Qinghua University. "They want to maintain
their focus on domestic issues."</TE>
<TE>   He added that Beijing is still taking its measure of the Bush
administration and may not have reached any final conclusions about
where U.S. policy is headed. The Chinese see splits within the U.S.
government on policy toward China -- broadly speaking, between hawks
at the Pentagon and doves at the State Department -- and are trying
to develop a more sophisticated approach to ties with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In the same way, the Bush administration is trying to settle on a
more realistic, pragmatic approach to Beijing than the label Bush
affixed to China, "strategic competitor," during his election
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "China is not our enemy. We view China as a partner on some
issues, and a competitor on others," a U.S. defense official said.
"We wish to develop areas in which our interests converge."</TE>
<TE>   With no breakthrough on the horizon at this week's mini-summit,
experts say the most important result is likely to center on the
personal: warmer feelings between Jiang and Bush.</TE>
<TE>   This could pay dividends even after Jiang steps down as China's
leader. Analysts expect him to exert a heavy influence over foreign
policy from behind the scenes.</TE>

<HD>Spies' Role Debated in U.N. Inspections of Iraq</HD>
<DH>U.S. argument for use of experts is a pretext to permit
intelligence operations, some say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Drogin and Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- When United Nations inspectors last scoured Iraq for
weapons of mass destruction in 1998, the CIA and its sister spy
services were rarely far away.</LD>
<LD>   Undercover U.S. agents working with the U.N. teams secretly
planted a high-tech "black box" device in Baghdad that year to
eavesdrop on Saddam Hussein's phone calls, among other Iraqi
communications, former inspectors say. The signals then were
encrypted in other U.N. data and transmitted via satellite to the
National Security Agency headquarters at Ft. Meade, Md.</LD>
<LD>   Other operatives helped the U.N. team track Iraqi officials
abroad. In one case, they planted hidden cameras and microphones in
the hotel room of an Iraqi scientist trying to buy banned missile
parts in Romania -- and then sneaked into his room at night to
photograph the contents of his briefcase.</LD>
<TE>   As new U.N. inspectors plan to return to Iraq after a four-year
absence, and as the Bush administration prepares for a possible war
there, the role of intelligence in the effort to disarm Iraq is the
subject of sharp debate at the U.N. and in Washington and other world
capitals.</TE>
<TE>   Hans Blix, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, argues that U.N.
credibility was badly hurt by disclosures about covert CIA, British
MI6 and Israeli Mossad operations with the former U.N. inspection
teams.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the intercepts and other data were used to help identify
and target Hussein's suspected hide-outs when U.S. and British
bombers launched the Desert Fox airstrikes in December 1998 after the
U.N. inspectors were withdrawn, former inspectors say. If U.N. teams
go back to Iraq in coming weeks, Blix insists that he will not
provide any direct assistance or information to U.S. or other
intelligence agencies that could compromise the teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not an espionage service, a spy organization," Blix said
in a recent interview. "We want intelligence from member governments,
but it must be a one-way street. We will tell them what we are
interested in."</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. diplomats are fighting to ensure that a new U.N.
resolution on Iraq will allow the U.S. and other permanent Security
Council members to send their own "experts" and equipment with the
disarmament teams, which otherwise would be limited to U.N.
employees.</TE>
<TE>   France, Russia and Iraq, among others, objected to the initial
U.S. proposal last month, saying the addition of such outside experts
was a pretext to permit spying under the U.N. flag.</TE>
<TE>   A second U.S. draft resolution emerged Monday, three days after
Blix met with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to discuss the
inspections. It suggests that they reached a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   The new draft would allow Blix and Mohammed Baradei, director
general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is
responsible for finding and dismantling Iraq's suspected nuclear
weapons program, to choose which outside experts could join their
teams.</TE>
<TE>   "The key thing is that [the U.N. and IAEA] shall determine the
personnel, not Iraq," said a Security Council diplomat.</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, the new proposal does not bar outside experts from
reporting to their home governments. The draft also would guarantee
experts "the right to unrestricted voice and data communications,
including encrypted communications," as well as the right to use
"equipment or materials for inspections and to seize and export any
equipment, materials or documents taken during inspections."</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council diplomat denied that such language was
designed to provide cover to intelligence operatives. "Some people
are trying to read all sorts of rubbish into it," the diplomat said.
"All it means is that the personnel are selected by merit."</TE>
<TE>   A former senior weapons inspector said the proposal would allow
U.S. experts to provide intelligence to senior members of the U.N.
team. Only the U.S. experts, he said, would handle sensitive U.S.
intelligence. Anything gathered in Iraq could be sent directly to
Washington without sharing it with every member of the U.N. team.</TE>
<TE>   Such a setup is designed to prevent Iraqi spies or informants from
penetrating U.N. inspection operations in New York, Baghdad and at
the U.N. office in Bahrain, as they did in the 1990s, former
inspectors said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. maintains a roster of 220 scientists, technicians and
other arms control experts who could be deployed in shifts to Iraq.
But Ewen Buchanan, the public information officer for the weapons
inspectors, said other experts also could be sent.</TE>
<TE>   "We have used staff on the roster of trained individuals,"
Buchanan said. "But that's not an absolute. We could also call upon
people for specific jobs or for short-term tasks, not necessarily
from that roster."</TE>
<TE>   However reliable intelligence is collected -- from satellites,
sensors or spies -- it will be crucial to the success of a new round
of inspections and disarmament, intelligence officials and former
inspectors say.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30 governments provided the U.N. teams with intelligence
data in the 1990s, officials say, although only a handful apparently
were involved in covert collection operations against the Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the programs were overt. Washington flew a U-2 spy plane
based in Taif, Saudi Arabia, to shoot aerial photographs for the U.N.
inspectors, for example, while U.S. spy satellites provided other
pictures.</TE>
<TE>   But starting in 1996, other operatives secretly monitored Iraqi
military radio frequencies during U.N. inspections to determine where
Hussein's forces were moving or hiding banned weapons. By 1998, the
system "worked like a charm," said Scott Ritter, who ran the
intelligence-gathering program for the U.N. team.</TE>
<TE>   "We nailed down the frequencies," said Ritter, who publicly
opposes U.S. policy toward Iraq. "It was all encrypted. The operators
would grab it, shoot it over a satellite to Bahrain, the CIA would
de-encrypt and interpret it, then shoot it back. It was real-time,
high-value intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. intelligence official declined to comment on what the CIA
did to help the U.N. inspectors in the 1990s, or what its role will
be if the inspectors return.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Gallucci, a former deputy chairman of the U.N. disarmament
team, says new inspections will fail unless team members are allowed
"to get and share intelligence" with U.S., British, French, Chinese
and Russian intelligence services.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're dealing with Iraq, you need a dialogue with the
intelligence community," said Gallucci, now dean of the Georgetown
University School of Foreign Service in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The intelligence community is going to have to trust the
inspection regime."</TE>

<HD>Military Officers in Venezuela Call for Citizens to Rise Up</HD>
<DH>Vice president says the country is calm. Opposition wants
to oust President Chavez.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>A group of 14 military officers, including nine accused of leading an
April coup, urged Venezuelans on Tuesday to rise up against President
Hugo Chavez with nationwide protests.</LD>
<LD>   But the vice president said that "absolutely nothing is happening"
and that the country is calm.</LD>
<LD>   The officers called on soldiers and citizens to join them in an
impromptu protest in an eastern Caracas plaza, which they declared a
"territory liberated by the armed forces." Several hundred citizens
rallied at the plaza.</LD>
<TE>   "We declare ourselves in legitimate disobedience and don't
recognize the current regime," said army Gen. Enrique Medina Gomez,
reading a statement on national television. "We call on all
components of the armed forces to accompany us on this mission."</TE>
<TE>   The rebellion call came a day after the opposition staged a
general strike that closed thousands of businesses and called for a
referendum on Chavez's rule, charging that the fiery leftist former
paratrooper is mismanaging the economy and polarizing Venezuelan
society.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, who has angered Washington with anti-U.S. rhetoric and his
ties with Cuba's Fidel Castro, was ousted for two days in April by
dissident officers before being swept back to power.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel said Tuesday that the country
was "totally calm."</TE>
<TE>   "We've been in contact with every barracks throughout the country,
with every command -- the air force, the army, navy and national
guard -- and there is absolutely nothing happening," Rangel said.
"Every commander totally repudiated these coup plotters."</TE>
<TE>   Army Gen. Raul Baduel -- who dispatched troops to restore Chavez
during the coup and is one of the most powerful figures in the
military -- told reporters in the central city of Maracay that his
division had government orders "to be ready to act at any moment,
anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   There were no reports of unusual troop movements.</TE>
<TE>   Rangel said the government would allow the officers to speak to
the crowd in Altamira Plaza but that they will be prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has voiced its opposition to any use of force
either to oust or preserve Chavez's democratically elected
government.</TE>

<HD>In Liberal Oakland, Davis Scarcely Outshines Simon</HD>
<DH>Voters say the governor just doesn't seem Democratic
enough.</DH>
<SE>One in an occasional series of conversations with California
voters. In this article, Bay Area Democrats are interviewed.</SE>
<AU>Mark Z. Barabak</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Ask Mary Ann Boddum about the race for California governor and she
goes on at length about Bill Simon Jr.: his inconsistent stands on
issues, his questionable business practices, lack of personal
integrity and bumbling campaign. "I just don't think he's suited for
the job," Boddum said of the GOP gubernatorial nominee.</LD>
<LD>   She is scarcely more impressed with the Democratic incumbent, Gray
Davis. He kowtows to big business, Boddum said, panders to
contributors and has not been the friend to education that he
promised to be. "Also, I think he plays a little dirty sometimes in
his campaigning," Boddum said.</LD>
<LD>   In this overwhelmingly Democratic area, what's a party loyalist to
do?</LD>
<TE>   The question brought Boddum up short. If her support were needed
to keep Simon from office, the 55-year-old Berkeley mom finally said,
she would reluctantly vote to reelect Davis. Instead, she may skip
that line on her ballot. Or perhaps back one of the lesser-known
candidates, such as the Green Party's Peter Camejo. "My son keeps
pressing me to vote my conscience," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, California Democrats exulted at the prospect of
electing Davis and ending 16 years of Republican rule in Sacramento.
Now, with Davis a favorite to win reelection on Nov. 5, many
Democrats view the prospect with something akin to resignation,
frustration, even outright hostility.</TE>
<TE>   "Slimy" and "super slimy" was how Kevin Christison, 33, an Oakland
sculptor, described Davis and Simon. "Tweedledum" and "Tweedledee,"
echoed Herb Lotter, 62, during a recent break from a volunteer shift
at Alta Bates Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The cynical shorthand ignores vast differences -- in experience,
philosophy and, not least, on issues -- that separate Davis from his
GOP rival. Even so, the statements reflect a widespread discontent in
Democratic ranks, particularly on the left, that could hurt the rest
of the party ticket even if Davis prevails. (Polls show that Simon is
facing just as many partisan defections as -- or more than -- Davis,
which helps explain why the governor's race is not closer.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's unlikely that one-third of the Democratic vote will go to
Simon," said Darry Sragow, a strategist for Democrats in the
Assembly. "The concern is that a significant chunk will decide to
stay home and just not turn out."</TE>
<TE>   In part, Davis suffers from a malaise that seems to be hurting
incumbents all over the country, regardless of their records. "We
have an electorate that is uniformly discouraged, depressed,
disgusted," said Sragow, citing words he has heard repeatedly in
countless focus group interviews over the last year. "Folks see a bad
economy, a bad stock market, corporate scandals, a church scandal,
terrorism, the threat of war in Iraq. It's pretty tough for an
elected official to shine in that environment."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, however, Davis has estranged many fellow Democrats
by, in short, not seeming Democratic enough.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his term the governor has hewed carefully to the middle
ground, courting business interests, shunning broad-based tax hikes
and taking an uncompromising stance on law-and-order issues. The
broad center is where statewide elections are usually decided in
California, so Davis' course has left him well positioned for
reelection. But, taken with his bland persona, Davis' centrist
straddle has done little to excite hard-core Democrats. "It's always
been half a loaf," said a consultant, Bill Carrick, who is running
races for several of the down-ballot Democratic candidates.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, as his reelection effort stepped up, Davis has
signed measures with explicit appeal to the party's base of
environmentalists, women, gays and -- foremost -- organized labor.
But even then, critics say, his actions have often seemed
fainthearted and grudging at best.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't feel like a Democrat," said Larry Tramutola, an
Oakland-based campaign strategist. "His personality and his incessant
fund-raising and his seeming willingness to sell out progressive
Democrats make it appear the guy has no values at all. Even though he
may champion Democratic causes, the activists think he's insincere."</TE>
<TE>   Or as Larry Waidhofer put it: "Gray Davis seems pretty much like a
Republican, beholden to corporate interests."</TE>
<TE>   The 39-year-old waiter was standing in front of the Sierra Club
bookstore on Oakland's College Avenue, smoking a cigarette and
drinking a cup of coffee from a shop run by two neighborhood food
mavens. The java was a political statement, his stand against the
onslaught of Starbucks' franchised brew. "Gray Davis is no friend of
classic Democrats," said Waidhofer, who will probably cast a protest
ballot for the Green Party. "If Bill Simon beat Gray Davis, there
would not be much of a difference, except a few judgeships here and
there."</TE>
<TE>   College Avenue, which runs from Oakland to Berkeley, offers a
funky melange of upscale galleries, juice bars, consignment shops and
gourmet burrito stands. At its crowded sidewalk cafes, lunching
ladies with designer handbags sit alongside scruffy bohemian wannabes
and students from the nearby University of California campus.</TE>
<TE>   Urban and affluent, this area showed its Democratic affinity in
the 2000 presidential election. Al Gore carried the local
congressional district with 79% of the vote. Republican George W.
Bush's 12% put him barely ahead of the Green Party's Ralph Nader, who
received 9%.</TE>
<TE>   But it is not just any Democrat who wins favor. Rep. Barbara Lee
of Oakland famously cast the lone "no" vote in Congress against war
in the aftermath of Sept. 11 and, here at least, became a folk hero.</TE>
<TE>   A poll that Tramutola conducted for former Assemblyman Tom Bates,
running in the hotly contested race for Berkeley mayor, also tested
the popularity of other figures. It found an 83% positive view of
Lee, compared with 42% for Davis. While candidate Bates is happy to
draw attention to his support from the Green Party and groups like
the Sierra Club, "any mention of [Davis] would kill a candidate,"
Tramutola said.</TE>
<TE>   That view is obviously extreme; elsewhere, the governor would
undoubtedly be happy to advertise his rejection by the city's leftist
electorate, with its loony reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, there are plenty of Democrats who enthusiastically
support Davis. One of them is Enid Hunkeler, who appreciates his
support for abortion rights and gun control even as she acknowledges
that Davis is "not the most outgoing, charismatic personality."</TE>
<TE>   Because of that, Hunkeler went on, "people don't understand how
committed he is to those fundamental social goals."</TE>
<TE>   The 58-year-old medical researcher, glasses pushed back on her
head, scolded wayward Democrats by summoning memories of the 2000
presidential campaign and the Nader vote that, some analysts say,
undercut Gore and helped put Bush in the White House. She asked, "Do
you really want to waste your vote again and risk bringing someone to
office who's not only right-wing but proven himself politically
incompetent?"</TE>
<TE>   For their part, strategists for the Davis campaign and the state
Democratic Party profess not to worry about a mass exodus of
loyalists on election day, or even a significant decline in turnout.
They anticipate placing more than 1 million phone calls and sending
out more than 4 million pieces of campaign literature to Democratic
households over the next two weeks, exhorting party faithful to the
polls. "We have a far more extensive get-out-the-vote and end game
than we did in 1998" when Davis won his first term in a landslide,
said Garry South, the governor's chief campaign strategist.</TE>
<TE>   Many Democrats seem to share that confidence -- which, in an odd
way, may actually work to Davis' detriment. Consider Lucy Bunch.</TE>
<TE>   The 45-year-old university administrator had driven from
Sacramento to meet a friend for lunch on College Avenue. As she stood
at a parking meter fiddling with quarters, the Democrat expressed her
disappointment with Davis over the last 3 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish there was an alternative," she said. "I think everything
in his life is about raising money and getting elected. I don't think
he has any principled construct. He doesn't seem to have any vision
for the state that he can articulate."</TE>
<TE>   Supporting Simon would be unthinkable, however, so Bunch is
contemplating a vote for the Green Party's Camejo -- "as a statement"
-- or she may simply ignore the governor's race when she casts her
ballot Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "California deserves better," Bunch said, as the sun struggled to
peek through the late-morning fog. "It's really sad."</TE>
<TE>   Bunch was convinced that Davis would win a second term, and win
handily.</TE>
<TE>   But "if I thought there was a chance Bill Simon would be elected,"
she said, "I would rush to the polls to vote for Gray Davis."</TE>

<HD>Ships of Baseball Fools Ply McCovey Cove</HD>
<DH>A carnival of kayakers, surfers and dogs vies for
splashdowns. Paddlers turn petulant when the visiting Angels beat the
hometown Giants, 10-4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoffrey Mohan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>AFLOAT IN McCOVEY COVE</DL>
<LD>They began assembling before noon, arriving in monster-sized
motorboats, in dinghies barely seaworthy, even on an inflatable
seahorse.</LD>
<LD>   Despite brisk winds and temperatures in the low 50s that made
kayakers feel like champagne bottles in an ice bucket, they came for
the first World Series game at Pacific Bell Park. Call it the
ultimate stern-gate party.</LD>
<LD>   "This is great," said Blake Ridgeway, smoking a cigar and sitting
on a surfboard tethered to a small float. "We got everything we need:
beer, peanuts and Cracker Jacks."</LD>
<TE>   The Anaheim Angels crushed the Giants, 10-4, and not a single ball
soared cove-ward, but many in the fleet said they'd be back.</TE>
<TE>   Ed and Carol Shaffer said they planned to sleep in their 41-foot
Sea Ray power boat, the Mutual Fun'd, on the inlet for the entire
three-game homestand.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to find a space during good games, but this is
madness," said Carol Schaffer, wielding two signs that read, "Shock
the Monkey."</TE>
<TE>   Named for Giant Hall of Fame slugger Willie McCovey, this narrow
inlet of brackish port water would have languished in obscurity under
its official name of China Basin, but for the construction of Pac
Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Giant venue opened two years ago, 27 baseballs have
landed in the frigid waters just off right field.</TE>
<TE>   In search of memorabilia or just memories, an armada of more than
150 crafts -- from modest paddle boats to a 65-foot, two-masted 19th
century schooner owned by the San Francisco Maritime Museum --
gathered Tuesday in the cove.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Russell, 53, and two friends set off before 4 p.m. for the
cove from a marina in a pair of inflatable kayaks and a large
inflatable launch, with plans to snare big flies. Russell, a
solutions consultant for Vector ESP, brought along his own solution
for the Angels' pesky mascot, the Rally Monkey.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm gonna tie him to my fishing rod and throw his monkey butt in
the water," he said, demonstrating how he had tied a noose around the
stuffed animal's neck. This was Russell's maiden voyage. "Usually I
get a nice cozy seat inside. What ... am I doing here?"</TE>
<TE>   His buddy Mike Ellison, who also works for Vector, persuaded him
to come out. Ellison made sure the trio was well-provisioned: He
pushed off in the "mother ship," carrying an ice chest and barbecue
grill.</TE>
<TE>   The cove has developed its own culture, its own rituals, even its
own celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents' homers don't count as true "splash hits" and the
faithful have been known to hurl them back over the arcade wall onto
the field. A team of Portuguese water dogs -- Justy, Lyla, Quarry,
Rio, Rita and Surfer -- leaps from the Good Ship Jollipup to retrieve
baseballs during weekend games.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be outdone, human retrievers often work in teams, using
nets large enough to land a tuna. They listen to the game on radios,
watch on portable TVs and keep their ears cocked toward the stadium,
all in preparation for a splashdown.</TE>
<TE>   Mischievous fans sometimes throw baseballs -- known as dork balls
-- into the water to see the mayhem that ensues.</TE>
<TE>   Cove regulars are not easily fooled. They were out in force
Tuesday, greeting each other and drawing cheers from the stadium
promenade.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Hoynes -- owner of a record seven splashdown balls, including
the first ever -- acted as master of ceremonies, decked out in his
Giant orange life vest, black jacket and black-and-orange cap. As
Hoynes handed out trading cards with his "splash" stats on them -- he
nets right-handed -- police waved to him from their patrol boat.</TE>
<TE>   Paddleboat kings Edgar Lazona, 35, and Brice Gamble, 30, were
there too, in the bright orange craft rigged with water cannons that
Giant fans voted Best Boat in the Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Jay Austin floated past astride an inflatable seahorse,
wearing floral-patterned shorts. "I'm insulated by a combination of
light rum and Vicodin," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Undaunted by the cold or drizzle, the cove crowd grew edgy as the
home team fell behind, trying to spur on the loyal counterparts
inside the stadium walls.</TE>
<TE>   The floating fans revived in the fifth inning, letting off
celebratory blasts on their air horns when Giant second baseman Rich
Aurilia and Bonds homered, but were mostly subdued after that.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone bobbing in the cove cared much about what happened in
the game.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Hajicek-Dobberstein, 52, wearing a yellow helmet, hoped his
family in Chicago would spot him on TV. He offered up a tip for
first-timers: "If a ball lands near you, paddle away from it. For
about 15 seconds it becomes whitewater."</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't kidding: As Bonds approached the home run record, port
officials had to mark splashdown sites with buoys and ban
motor-powered craft after several near-disasters. One fan launched
himself from pier-side, apparently unconcerned that he couldn't swim.
He was fished out by nearby boaters.</TE>

<HD>Pit Bulls' Bullish Rescuer</HD>
<DH>The breed doesn't deserve its bad reputation, says a woman
who takes them in. Of course she also keeps wolves and tigers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nora Zamichow</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tia Maria Torres is a patron saint of lost causes -- she rescues pit
bulls, dogs so notorious that many shelters immediately kill them.</LD>
<LD>   A pit bull bit off part of a mail carrier's nose last summer in
Los Angeles. Another pit bull mauled a 2-year-old in La Habra,
tearing into his face and scalp. It's also the type of dog that
sleeps curled up by Torres' head, while another snores beneath her
feet at night.</LD>
<LD>   Torres provides sanctuary and training in Agua Dulce for about 80
dogs at the Villalobos Rescue Center, one of the nation's largest pit
bull rescue efforts. She takes in dogs no one else wants. She teaches
free obedience classes at city shelters. She pairs pit bulls with
juvenile delinquents in a program called Pets in the Hood. Courts
throughout California send her problem dogs, telling the owner that
the animal either trains with Torres or dies.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, it's like swimming against a tsunami. Of the
70,000 dogs at city shelters each year, nearly half are pit bulls or
pit bull mixes, said Jackie David, spokeswoman for the Department of
Administration of Animal Services, which runs the city's six animal
shelters.</TE>
<TE>   When possible, Torres finds homes. A Burbank-based German shepherd
rescue group, for instance, places 20 dogs a month. On average,
Torres places one.</TE>
<TE>   "We take the animals that people want to walk across the street
from," said Torres. "I give priority to hard luck cases."</TE>
<TE>   These are dogs like Piglet, who was stabbed and then doused with
battery acid. And Peanut, whose face resembled hamburger after being
confiscated from a man suspected of staging dog fights. And Poppy,
one of 39 emaciated dogs found chained to a barn in Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   "Tia shows that these animals can be trained and can be good
pets," said David. But even among dog lovers, rescuing pit bulls is
controversial.</TE>
<TE>   "The nicest thing you can do for those dogs is euthanasia," said
Eric Sakach, director of the West Coast regional office of the Humane
Society of the United States. "People who think you can rehabilitate
these dogs are well-intentioned but naive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Torres is more comfortable with animals than with people. She sees
pit bulls as big-hearted animals that are always loyal and, when
necessary, fierce. It is how she sees herself.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, hearing panicked barking, Torres ran into
the kennel of Jack, a border collie with a history of biting. A
rattlesnake, coiled and hissing, was trying to strike.</TE>
<TE>   Torres pulled Jack to safety, even as he tried to bite her. With a
rake, she prodded the snake into a crate and slammed the door shut.
She carried the snake away from the kennels and, to the chagrin of
her kennel cleaner, released it by the road.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very superstitious," Torres said. "Since I stopped killing
rattlesnakes, they stopped biting my dogs."</TE>
<TE>   Torres, 42, describes herself as the "wild child" of animal
rescue. At one L.A. animal services commission meeting, rescuers of
different breeds showed off photographs of saved dogs to officials.
Torres had no pictures. So she peeled off her shirt, showing the
tattoo of her pit bull, Duke, on her right shoulder and one on her
back of her daughter's pit bull, L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Torres occasionally has the foul-mouthed bluntness of a short
order cook. Take, for instance, the message on her telephone
answering machine, in part:</TE>
<TE>   "Help me remember when I'm having a really bad day that it takes
42 muscles to frown and only four to extend my middle finger...."</TE>
<TE>   On most warm days, Torres wears a jog bra, leopard-print boxer
shorts and sneakers. She gathers her red-brown hair in a bun atop her
head. She wears no protective gear; she says that in 11 years of
rescuing pit bulls, she's never been bitten by one. She does,
however, don leather gloves.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to break my nails," she said. Torres' long nails are
painted burgundy. When she dresses up, she cultivates a vampish look:
thigh-high leather boots, low-cut blouse, heavy eyeliner, dark
lipstick and loose hair.</TE>
<TE>   Torres likes her Bad Girl image, though she neither drinks nor
uses drugs. Recently, after a presentation on pit bulls, police
officers complained to Torres that the dogs seemed to react
negatively to their uniforms. Describe your uniforms, Torres said.</TE>
<TE>   Boots, badge, black shirt and pants, an officer volunteered. From
a bag, Torres pulled out black leather pants, Spice Girl boots,
rhinestone stars and a transparent black negligee. "Something like
this?" Torres asked the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Honey," one man answered, "you put that on and I'll get on all
fours and bark like a dog."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Torres allows no barking in the kennels at Villalobos, which is
just behind her home. If a dog barks, Torres barrels out of her
office and yells, "Quiet!" Most times, her voice is sufficient. If a
dog doesn't respond promptly, she uses a hose to spray the offender.</TE>
<TE>   Torres believes pit bulls suffer an undeservedly bad reputation.
So the dogs at Villalobos receive obedience training. When she places
a dog in a home, she wants to know the animal will be a good
ambassador for the breed.</TE>
<TE>   Since she began running Villalobos, Torres said, only one dog has
been returned because it was too aggressive. Of the hundreds of dogs
she has rescued, Torres has had a handful killed for the same reason.
And when she cannot place a dog, it remains with her for the rest of
its life.</TE>
<TE>   "Tia does the dirty work that no one else will do," said Cinimon
Clark, a Los Angeles dog trainer who specializes in pit bulls and
Neapolitan mastiffs. "Her dog runs are spotless, her dogs are quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Torres' office is sprinkled with photographs of pit bulls in their
adopted homes. Here's the Christmas shot of Gus and Cleo, wearing red
antlers, sitting on their owners' laps. And a beach shot of Whisper,
a deaf pit bull adopted after living with Torres for four years. And
Blinky and Brad lounging in their owner's bed.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing is more gratifying than placing a pit bull in a good home.
Torres says. "That's the ultimate, ultimate, ultimate."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Torres' rose-colored adobe ranch house sits on 10 acres of scruffy
high desert, about 40 miles northeast of Los Angeles, nowhere near a
supermarket or movie theater. There are no green lawns here; it's a
land of dust and sand, chaparral and tumbleweeds. It is home to her
two daughters, Tania, 17, and Mariah, 11, as well as two girls whom
Torres has taken in. It's also home to seven black cats, two
parakeets, a tarantula named Itsy-Bitsy, and 11 dogs, ranging from a
Chihuahua to a 180-pound Fila Brasileiro mastiff. (Because the Fila
Brasileiro bit Tania in the buttocks when she was wrestling with her
sister, Torres is cautious about inviting people inside her home.)</TE>
<TE>   "Call us the Osbournes," Torres said, referring to MTV's series
about rock star Ozzy Osbourne's family, "toned down a notch."</TE>
<TE>   Family dinners? No such luck.</TE>
<TE>   The living room was stripped bare after Torres had a fight with
Mariah's father some years ago and dumped the furniture in the yard.
Torres had a worker cut up the sofas and chairs and put them in a
garbage bin. Now, the living room has only dog crates.</TE>
<TE>   Torres no longer sleeps in the house. She spends nights on a couch
in her office, a trailer lined with dogs in crates. Although the
dust-ridden trailer has no running water, Torres stays there so she
can better hear the dogs in case of such trouble as windstorms or
rattlesnakes. A chain-link fence encloses the office and the kennels,
where most of the dogs stay. Each dog has its own fenced area and a
plastic shelter. Only one pit bull, the elderly Tatanka, is permitted
to roam freely. The other dogs go out on walks or spend time in a
fenced paddock.</TE>
<TE>   Torres grew up in the San Fernando Valley. When her father and
stepmother split up, she lived with her stepmother, a horse
enthusiast. Torres' pets included raccoons, a ferret, a bobcat and
dogs. As a teenager at Chatsworth High School, she competed in rodeo,
specializing in barrel racing, goat tying, and roping. As an adult,
she enlisted in the Army, worked as a gang counselor, and managed a
country-western bar. Today, she's estranged from most of her family;
but still close to her stepmother.</TE>
<TE>   Torres likes to say that a woman's children and her dogs say a lot
about a person. In her case, Torres is proud of her daughters. Tania
has piercings and tattoos, Torres said, but she lives at home,
doesn't use drugs and helps with chores. Torres points to Mariah as a
proficient dog handler, who's appeared on "Leeza," the daytime TV
talk show, to defend pit bulls.</TE>
<TE>   Torres has two personal dogs, Duke and Joe. She trained Joe, a
black pit bull, to be a certified narcotics detection dog -- a task
she thought was a good challenge for the high-energy dog. When Duke
was brought into the animal shelter, his previous owner complained,
"Not mean enough." Duke has been with Torres for five years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're like Siamese twins," Torres said. "We don't go anywhere
without each other."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tatanka was the first pit bull Torres rescued. She was 4 years old
when she was found chained to a truck axle at the scene of a double
homicide at an illegal drug lab in Lancaster. Torres had gone to the
animal shelter with a friend who was getting a collie. They spotted
Tatanka and Torres asked to see the dog. It sprang free from the
handler and charged Torres' daughter, who was sitting nearby on a
bench.</TE>
<TE>   Tatanka reached the little girl and began licking her face. Torres
was hooked.</TE>
<TE>   It was clear, Torres said, no one wanted pit bulls. So she stepped
up. And since she rescued Tatanka 11 years ago, Torres' kennels have
grown. So, too, have expenses. She spends $22,000 a year for kibble
alone.</TE>
<TE>   After the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 last year, donations dried
up. Torres was left with only one reliable sponsor, John Chambliss,
president of the Simon Wolf Organization, a company that makes
X-rated films.</TE>
<TE>   When Torres started doing rescue work in the early 1990s, she
began with wolves and wolf hybrids. The first came from her brother.
Today, at the top of the hill behind her home, cages hold 20 wolves
and wolf hybrids.</TE>
<TE>   Torres' wolves and pit bulls are periodically used in films and
videos. Her dog Duke, for instance, has appeared in videos with Snoop
Dogg and Jagged Edge, as well as a Nike commercial. Torres met
Chambliss two years ago, when he needed a wolf as a background prop
for a film.</TE>
<TE>   "Tia can be very gruff; you dig through that and she's one of the
sweetest, most wonderful people on earth," said Chambliss. "I don't
have a great need for money and I wanted to help these animals and
Tia. I couldn't turn my back on her or the animals."</TE>
<TE>   Although Chambliss professes a special affinity with the wolves,
he was also interested in the other animals that Torres keeps. Midway
down the hill, three tigers pace in separate cages. Torres got them
when a friend left town and had no other place to put them. And when
a person has 20 wolves, how hard is it to tend three tigers? Not a
big deal, apparently, although it requires 300 pounds of raw meat a
week and the proper federal permits.</TE>
<TE>   Torres credits the tigers and wolves with honing her skills as a
trainer. After working with them, she said, pit bulls are a piece of
cake. Soon, she expects to house a black leopard and three bears,
including a 600-pound male grizzly.</TE>
<TE>   Torres has big plans for renovating Villalobos into something that
looks like a medieval castle. She's begun installing a waterfall
fountain and erecting sheets of wood that will be painted to look
like castle walls. She wants a wrought iron fence with gargoyles.</TE>
<TE>   "I want people to say 'This is like a garden paradise; pit bulls
live here?' " she explained.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Pit bull" is a generic term used for American pit bull terriers,
American Staffordshire terriers, and pit mixes. Greyhounds were bred
to run and Labradors to retrieve. The American pit bull terrier has
been bred to fight other dogs. They are agile, powerful and
determined, generally ranging in size from 50 to 80 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't mean that all pit bulls fight; it means that if a fight
breaks out, a pit bull can inflict serious injuries. Even with
training, socialization and a loving owner, Torres says, "Never trust
a pit bull not to fight." Pit bull owners need to be more vigilant
than others, Torres said, and should never allow their dogs to run
free or off-leash.</TE>
<TE>   Why bother with the hassle of a dog like this? They are loving,
loyal and humorous, Torres said. Aggression toward humans, shyness
and instability are not typical traits.</TE>
<TE>   Problem pit bulls are a result of breeding and owners who don't
understand how to handle these animals, Torres said. One woman
adopted a white 3-year-old pit bull she found tied to a tree in a
Northern California neighborhood. The dog recently got loose in a
parking lot and bit a man. After a judge labeled the pit bull a
"potentially dangerous dog," her owner came to Torres.</TE>
<TE>   Torres taught the animal such basic obedience as walking on a
leash without lunging for other dogs. The harder part of her
assignment: trying to get the dog's owner to understand her animal's
limits. Midway through training, the owner asked Torres to train her
dog to obey commands off-leash. "This is a dog that should never be
off-leash," Torres said.</TE>
<TE>   Well-bred pit bulls are not usually the ones that make newspaper
headlines. Experts say problem pit bulls often come from backyard
breeders raising fighting dogs. Some owners like having a pit bull
snarling at the end of a chain, said Sakach of the Humane Society,
which can be as effective at scaring people as carrying a gun.</TE>
<TE>   And dog fighting, while illegal, is flourishing. Winners can net
tens of thousands of dollars. At the upper echelon, good candidates
for fighting can sell for $3,500.</TE>
<TE>   Owners have several ways of preparing pit bulls to fight -- such
as administering steroids or putting hot pepper in the anus to make
dogs more vicious. Losers are sometimes killed outright. Others are
mutilated and set loose.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of a gray brindle named Jeffrey, animal control
officers discovered the dog bleeding from slash wounds on a San
Fernando Valley street. His nasal passages were severed and his
vision was damaged. Despite blood loss and extensive injuries,
Jeffrey wagged his tail at the animal control officer, who phoned
Torres.</TE>
<TE>   "You're looking at a breed that's so tortured, bashed and
physically abused," said Torres. "Yet they are so forgiving; they
don't hold a grudge. They're silly and goofy. These dogs are all
heart. They don't even blink at putting their lives at risk."</TE>
<TE>   Torres believes in second chances. The love of her life is a man
in jail awaiting trial on charges of drug trafficking and murder.</TE>
<TE>   Torres met him by accident, while trying to find the jailed owner
of a white pit bull in an animal shelter. They exchanged letters and
telephone calls over two years. Torres has visited him in Florida
three times. And having reviewed some of the evidence in his case,
Torres has become convinced of his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Now they talk several times a day. Torres said she is in love. He
knows her so well, she said, that he knows she likes white cheese and
hates yellow cheese. She's hoping he'll be cleared by December and
move in with her. She'd like him to get involved with her Pets in the
Hood program, in which pit bulls visit a juvenile detention camp to
give kids something to care about.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm adopting another pit bull," Torres said. "The
bark is definitely worse than the bite. I call him my poodle."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Torres' number is unlisted. Even so, she continually gets calls
from people wanting to give up a pit bull. Sometimes it's because the
dog owner's insurance company canceled their homeowners policy after
learning they have a pit bull.</TE>
<TE>   Torres tells callers the kennel is full. She has a waiting list of
people willing to pay to have their pit bull boarded for the rest of
their lives. Torres finds it difficult to pass up a hard luck case.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, a dog trainer arrived at Villalobos with a 3-year-old
chocolate pit bull named Twister, with a blue-silk kerchief tied
around its neck. Twister no longer got along with the trainer's four
Rottweilers.</TE>
<TE>   Torres sighed. She'd already said she had no room. But Twister
looked up at her with big brown eyes and clamored for a tennis ball.</TE>
<TE>   Torres escorted Twister into a crate in her office. Later, she
would shrug and say, "It's a cute little dog."</TE>

<DL>ANCHORAGE</DL>
<LD>A crewman was swept overboard Tuesday from a ship searching for
survivors of an explosion and fire on a fishing vessel in the Bering
Sea, and became the third person missing in the frigid water.</LD>
<LD>   The man was aboard the Clipper Express, a 138-foot Seattle-based
vessel that on Sunday had rescued two people swimming in survival
suits after they abandoned a burning fishing vessel.</LD>
<LD>   The Clipper Express was holding its position Tuesday, attempting
to ride out 30-foot seas and winds close to 60 mph , when the crewman
was lost, said a Coast Guard spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   He said the Clipper Express crewman was not wearing a life jacket
or a survival suit. He was identified as Daniel Schmiedt of
Arlington, Wash. A Coast Guard rescue helicopter and a C-130 aircraft
were searching for him.</TE>
<TE>   One man was killed and two were lost after the explosion aboard
the Galaxy, a 180-foot Seattle-based vessel used to catch Pacific
cod.</TE>

<LD>   He pleaded not guilty.</LD>

<LD>   The six U.S. citizens of Yemeni descent are from Lackawanna, a

<LD>Gov. George Ryan said he has "pretty much ruled out" granting blanket
clemency to Illinois' death row inmates.</LD>
<LD>   As Ryan spoke in Springfield, the state's Prisoner Review Board
was in its second week of clemency hearings for 142 of the 160
inmates on death row. The board was flooded with clemency petitions
after the governor said he might commute all death sentences to life
without parole.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan said his main concern is to make sure no innocent person is
executed.</LD>

<HD>Bush Hits Campaign Trail, Shadowed by Democrats</HD>
<DH>He touts GOP hopefuls in Pennsylvania and Maine, as rival
party ads offer different message.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BANGOR, Maine -- One television commercial hammers at the theme of
corporate corruption. A second draws attention to pension worries and
the loss of jobs in the economy over the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   Each was devised to shadow President Bush during the final two
weeks of the fall campaign, offering an electronic presence for the
Democratic Party as he brings the mantle of his office into some of
the most closely fought races.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Bush and the Democrats were focused on two House
contests, one in the outer ring of suburbs southwest of Philadelphia
and the other a blue-collar, rural and struggling mill-town district
that cuts across the northern swath of Maine.</LD>
<TE>   Bush brought the White House entourage first to Downingtown, Pa.,
campaigning for Republican Jim Gerlach, a state senator running for
an open seat against Democrat Dan Wofford, son of a former U.S.
senator from Pennsylvania, Harris Wofford. Political analysts give
Gerlach a slight edge.</TE>
<TE>   In Bangor, Bush was trying to help Republican Kevin Raye, who is
seeking an open seat against Mike Michaud, the state Senate
president. Analysts rate this race a tossup.</TE>
<TE>   While in Maine, Bush also touted U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a
Republican favored to win reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush's precise schedule is changing each day as new polls
determine where his political services may be most needed, he plans
to devote nine days during the next two weeks to campaign
appearances. And while he does that, the Democrats plan to run a
series of television commercials in the communities he visits so that
his message is countered with the advertising paid for by the
Democratic National Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The duel for attention stems from the high stakes in the Nov. 5
vote. For one of the few times in U.S. history, both chambers of
Congress are clearly up for grabs--the Republicans control the House
by just six seats, the Democrats control the Senate by a single seat.</TE>
<TE>   The first Democratic commercials were unveiled in connection with
Tuesday's travel.</TE>
<TE>   One shows a young man at home, circa 1955, about to start his
first day at work. His wife asks if he is ready for the job and he
replies excitedly, "Ready as I'll ever be."</TE>
<TE>   It morphs into the present, the young man now old but also
starting a new job. His wife asks whether he is ready. "Ready as I'll
ever be," he says wearily.</TE>
<TE>   In depicting a senior citizen forced to start over again, the ad
notes that the U.S. economy has lost about $175 billion in savings
and 2 million jobs over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   The second commercial features a senior citizen telling his wife:
"I trusted my bosses and their accountants, and our savings are
gone." The next scene shows a fictitious corporate executive telling
a congressional hearing: "Again, I'm taking the 5th Amendment."</TE>
<TE>   The announcer says: "Overcoming years of Republican opposition to
tough corporate responsibility laws wasn't easy. It took Democrats.
They stood up and said, 'Enough.' "</TE>
<TE>   The commercials' themes reflect the Democratic effort to turn the
voting public's attention to domestic issues in general, and the
economy in particular, while the possibility of war with Iraq remains
front-page news.</TE>
<TE>   Their impact as elections approach is uncertain. Democrats argue
the domestic concerns will benefit the party, increasing its Senate
majority and winning it control of the House. But Republicans say the
Democrats are misreading the public's mood.</TE>
<TE>   "The public is clearly anxious this year. But they're not angry.
And there's a big difference," Ken Mehlman, the White House political
director, said Monday. "The public clearly has concerns about the
economy, but those concerns are not being necessarily taken out on
public perceptions about the president."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, though, has made a point in his recent campaign appearances
to express concerns about the economy. The president stressed that,
in his view, "the foundations for growth are strong--interest rates
low, inflation is low, we've got the highest productivity in the
world among our workers and our farmers and our ranchers." But he
added: "Still, too many people can't find a job. So I look forward to
working with Congress to expand jobs opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   In Maine, the Democrats' private polling has found that worries
about the nation's future are forming an undercurrent that often
works against an incumbent party.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Democratic poll, 50% of those surveyed say the
country is on the "wrong track," and 38% say it is headed in the
"right direction," a Democratic Party official said.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also believe they have the right candidate for the
socially conservative House district.</TE>
<TE>   Michaud "is pro-gun, pro-life ... a guy who can appeal to labor
unions and social conservatives--a nice mix for him," said Stuart
Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In Pennsylvania, the GOP's Gerlach is expected to benefit from a
financial advantage in the race's closing days. But the new
Democratic commercials on the economy and failed corporate
responsibility could find their mark in the district, said Terry
Madonna, a professor of political science at Millersville University
in Millersville.</TE>
<TE>   "As good a set of two issues you can find," Madonna said.</TE>

<HD>Jeb Bush Goes on the Attack in Debate</HD>
<DH>Florida governor, holding a slim lead in reelection bid,
says his challenger would raise taxes. McBride sees an attempt to
alarm voters.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ORLANDO, Fla. -- With the latest poll showing Gov. Jeb Bush hanging
on to a slim but steady lead, the scion of Republican royalty came
out swinging in a televised debate Tuesday night, accusing his
Democratic challenger of stealth plans to raise taxes and fealty to
special interests.</LD>
<LD>   Bill McBride, Bush said, doesn't differ on a single issue with his
chief backer, the state's teachers' union, and hasn't even condemned
a politically influential Miami preacher who characterized the Bush
family, which includes President Bush, the governor's brother, as
neo-Nazis on his radio program.</LD>
<LD>   McBride, Bush said, "can't be all things to all people."</LD>
<TE>   The Democrat, a former Tampa law firm manager who won the Bronze
Star as a Marine in the Vietnam War, accused Bush of trying to
frighten voters by claiming he wants to increase taxes and of wrongly
implying he endorses the smear on the Bush family.</TE>
<TE>   "Governor, you really need to raise your game," McBride
complained.</TE>
<TE>   The hourlong televised debate, held in a ballroom at the
University of Central Florida and moderated by NBC-TV's Tim Russert,
was a stark contrast in personalities: the intense 49-year-old
incumbent from the GOP who is seeking reelection and seemed at ease
and fluent with a wide spectrum of issues, and the more rambling,
vague and folksy McBride, 57.</TE>
<TE>   A poll published earlier in the day indicated that Bush may have
succeeded in holding off the challenge from the Democratic upstart,
who waged a brilliant campaign to upset former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno
in their party's Sept. 10 primary.</TE>
<TE>   Bush Has 5-Point Lead</TE>
<TE>   Bush was favored among 49% and McBride by 44% of likely voters
surveyed Thursday through Sunday by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research
for a number of Florida media outlets. McBride's 5 percentage-point
deficit was virtually unchanged since a similar survey a month ago,
hinting that the surge that lifted him from political unknown to
serious gubernatorial contender may have stalled.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe McBride has peaked too soon, or is facing a money crunch,"
said Jeffery Mondak, professor of political science at Florida State
University in Tallahassee. "The governor has quite a bit more money
available. As the incumbent, the governor can make news without
spending much money. Being the brother of the president also helps."</TE>
<TE>   Florida, however, has a notoriously fickle electorate that often
reserves nasty last-minute surprises for politicians, incumbents
included. In 1994, when Bush made his first run at the governorship,
he led in the polls until a week before election day, when the
Democratic incumbent, Lawton Chiles, likened himself in a televised
debate to a wily old raccoon.</TE>
<TE>   Chiles' reference evidently flummoxed the transplant from Texas,
but struck a deep chord among many conservative voters of Central and
North Florida. Bush narrowly lost that election. He tried again in
1998, and won by 418,000 votes.</TE>
<TE>   Put on the defensive, especially concerning his record on
education, Bush has been jetting up and down Florida's sandy
peninsula, appearing at barbecues, churches and condominium
association meetings. He has announced a plan to ease the state's
serious school overcrowding by building 12,000 new classrooms, and
proposed toughening criminal penalties against con artists who bilk
senior citizens out of $10,000 or more. In Miami, his campaign doled
out free hot dogs to Cuban Americans, a key GOP voter bloc.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor now decides he cares about the public schools," said
McBride, whose mantra is improving the schools, remarked wryly during
a stop on the campaign trail. "Who knows, within a week or two, he
may end up endorsing me."</TE>
<TE>   Much of Tuesday night's debate, the last of three face-to-face
encounters between the candidates, centered on the cost of a proposed
cap on classroom size that voters in Florida will be asked to approve
on election day.</TE>
<TE>   McBride said he supports a 50-cent-a-pack tax increase on
cigarettes to pay for school expansion, "and that's the only tax I've
supported." He said he'd tap the state's general revenue fund to
raise additional funds.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, the Democrat complained, "is now running an ad, which is
just frankly absurd, suggesting all sorts of wild numbers, trying to
scare the people of Florida." McBride denied he'd raise sales or
property taxes or institute a state income tax.</TE>
<TE>   But when pressed by Russert, McBride couldn't say how much the
constitutional amendment that he backs would cost taxpayers if
adopted. It would be "somewhere" between various estimates, which
range from $8 billion to $27 billion, he said, eliciting laughter
from spectators inside the university ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   McBride Hit on Taxes</TE>
<TE>   "Again, you can't be advocating something as governor, and not
have responsibility ... to explain how you're going to pay for it,"
Bush said disapprovingly. "Mr. McBride would propose more taxes and
big government. That's not what Floridians want."</TE>
<TE>   During his campaign swings and on Tuesday night, Bush has ticked
off a long litany of accomplishments during his tenure: rapid job
growth, medical assistance for Florida's large population of seniors,
a decline in crime to its lowest point since 1972.</TE>
<TE>   McBride, though, in some of his most spirited remarks, accused
Bush of taking credit for national trends, or giving a warped picture
of reality.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is not booming," he said. "People are nervous about
their health insurance, are out of work. We're in a crisis."</TE>
<TE>   It was the Democrat who got out what was probably the best line of
the night. Asked at the debate's end what he admired most about Bush,
McBride answered, deadpan, "I like his mom very much."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Bush, who was in Florida stumping for her son, attended
the debate, as did McBride's mother, Pat.</TE>
<TE>   Though McBride jetted north last week to attend fund-raisers
sponsored by Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Florida Republican
Party has accumulated much more money than the Democrats, $36.6
million versus $10.7 million as of last month. Tuesday's debate was
carried in nine media markets, but in the end, it may be paid
political announcements that sway the undecided, and the GOP has a
far heftier bankroll to pay for them.</TE>
<TE>   Late last week, Bush predicted he would succeed in becoming
Florida's first Republican governor to win reelection, and that by a
margin "bigger than a bread basket, but smaller than an Escalade," a
make of sport-utility vehicle. But he seems to be taking no chances;
during a face-to-face encounter with a Times reporter who lives in
Florida, Bush also asked for his vote.</TE>

<HD>Some Detainees at Guantanamo Bay Prison to Be Released</HD>
<DH>It is the first time any of the onetime suspected Al Qaeda
and Taliban fighters have been repatriated. No numbers are given.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard A. Serrano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--After holding detainees for 10 months at the naval base
on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, U.S. officials are now prepared to release a
small number of the 598 once-suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters
captured in the war on terrorism, Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The release will mark the first time any of the detainees have
been repatriated. Although Pentagon officials declined to publicly
reveal how many would soon be going home, or to what country, sources
close to Rumsfeld's decision said a "half-dozen or less" were being
returned to Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   The move also signals that the U.S. has at last sorted through the
backgrounds of some of the detainees and determined that some might
be so-called "innocents," instead of the "hardest of the hard," as
the Defense secretary first characterized the Guantanamo Bay
detainees.</LD>
<TE>   Asad Hayauddin, a spokesman at the Pakistani Embassy in
Washington, said that while his country had not been formally
notified, any Pakistani detainees would be treated like returning
prisoners of war.</TE>
<TE>   "We vetted them once," he said, explaining that his country does
not believe that any of the Pakistanis at Guantanamo Bay are
terrorists. "Nothing will happen to them now. They will be treated
just like a POW is treated. They will be debriefed, and then
repatriated."</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, pressure had mounted from several countries for
the release of their citizens, especially as the time has dragged on
without an announcement from the United States that any of the
detainees are terrorists or that they will be tried in U.S. military
tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the United States had only repeated the assertion that
the detainees housed in Cuba beginning in January were "enemy
combatants" and that extensive interrogations were needed to sort out
their backgrounds. U.S. intelligence officials have sought to
determine what they might know about future threats, as well as the
Sept. 11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said that much of that investigative work for the
returning detainees has been completed.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think about the universe of detainees," he said, "for the
most part they've all been interrogated, the purpose being not law
enforcement but intelligence gathering."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement brought new hope for other countries with
detainees at Guantanamo Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The families of 12 imprisoned Kuwaitis are seeking help through
legal and diplomatic channels. Taraq Al-Mezrem, a spokesman at the
Kuwaiti Embassy, said the release of detainees from any country boded
well for their cause too.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hoping, we believe, and we have faith in the American due
process system," he said. "If they are guilty, take them to justice.
If they are not guilty, they need to be released."</TE>
<TE>   At the Saudi Arabian Embassy, Nail Al-Jubeir said there are
believed to be about 100 Saudi detainees in Cuba, and that "we would
like to have all our people."</TE>
<TE>   "We've made that clear," he said. "If they are guilty of anything,
they should stand trial in Saudi Arabia. We believe Saudi justice is
a little more severe than American justice."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement also heartened Erwin Chemerinsky, a Los Angeles
attorney who is suing the United States on behalf of all of the
detainees. His suit argues that they should be afforded the legal
protections of international law, rather than be held for so long
without being formally accused of a crime.</TE>
<TE>   "It's excellent that the government will not keep all of them
forever and throw away the key," he said. "But it is also troubling
that many of them have been held since January, and under
international law, prisoners are entitled to certain rights."</TE>
<TE>   In explaining why some are now being released, Rumsfeld said the
military interrogators had concluded that this small group of
detainees are "very likely not to be of any additional intelligence
value."</TE>
<TE>   Once that determination was made, he added, those detainees were
"stuck in a different basket" and "looked at for law enforcement
purposes."</TE>
<TE>   He said the U.S. next weighed whether the detainees were wanted
for prosecution at home, and whether they were "people who ought to
be kept off the street simply because they might be inclined to go
back and again engage in activities that would be opposed to the
Afghan government or to the United States."</TE>
<TE>   When it was deemed that their own government did not want them for
prosecution, and that they were not considered a danger if set free,
the U.S. decided, "Let's get rid of them," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Pressed to divulge who and how many were going home, the Defense
secretary would only say: "I don't know that I even bothered to look
at what the nationality of these folks are. But there are a small
number that have now been moved through that process, [and] I've said
that's fine with me."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "It's true that ... there are some people likely to come
out the other chute."</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
added, "I know what we decided -- that we were willing to turn them
back."</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials, citing privacy concerns, stressed that the
U.S. will not reveal who has been released until after they are
returned home. In some cases, they said, they may not even release
the names then.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect there will be a number of detainees released and
transfers to other countries," said Lt. Col. Barbara Burfeind, a
Department of Defense spokeswoman. "But we won't put those detainees
at risk by talking about it beforehand."</TE>
<TE>   Hayauddin, the Pakistani Embassy official, said a group of his
government's foreign affairs, intelligence and interior department
officials visited the Camp Delta prison on Guantanamo Bay several
months ago. Since then, he said, his government has been "encouraged"
that some of their countrymen might be released.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't surprise us," he said. "It was something we had
brought to the U.S. when our team came there and we didn't get a
negative response from the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Those people there were not a threat to the U.S. and did not pose
a danger to any country."</TE>
<TE>   Rather, he said, "I personally think those who were caught and
rounded up, a lot of them were just cannon fodder. They were people
who were motivated by their village clerics, that Islam was in
danger. They went to fight and got arrested, but they had no
background in terrorism, they had no military training.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very difficult to categorize someone who picked up arms and
thought they were fighting for a pristine Islamic movement as someone
who really wanted to go like a terrorist and blow up post offices and
buses and trains."</TE>

<HD>A Day Fear Reached a New Level</HD>
<DH>Montgomery County, Md., residents are doubly alarmed.
Sniper drama started there, and it is where it appeared to have
returned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan K. Stack and Jonathan Peterson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ASPEN HILL, Md. -- Alfred Love woke up to the clatter of his
telephone -- and a sick sense of deja vu. His neighbor had news:
another sniper attack in Montgomery County, this one right at the
foot of the hill.</LD>
<LD>   By daybreak their apartment complex was hemmed with police tape.
Love couldn't get to work; when his niece told him flatly she was too
afraid to go to school, he didn't have the heart to force her.</LD>
<LD>   "It started here, and now it's back," he said glumly. "To tell you
the truth, I think he lives here."</LD>
<TE>   Nowhere has the sniper's stark campaign of psychological warfare
been so keenly felt as in Montgomery County. It was here that an
unknown gunman kicked off a bloody rampage through two states and the
nation's capital, and it was to Montgomery County that he appears to
have returned.</TE>
<TE>   People here are cranky from worry; weary of sitting around
indoors; sick of the wail of sirens and the thrum of news helicopters
overhead. Maybe the worst part is that they're getting used to it. Or
maybe it's that they believe, almost every one, that the killer lives
among them.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody feels trapped," said Mario Villalta, a 16-year-old
student who missed class Tuesday because police cordoned off his
apartment complex. "We can't go anywhere, and everybody's angry. The
teachers say they'll catch him, don't worry, but we don't believe
that."</TE>
<TE>   For miles around, the sniper has clamped a vast region of 5
million people into a state of suspended terror. Commuters spent
Tuesday morning trapped in endless lines of vehicles as police hunted
for the elusive killer among the roadways -- to no avail. Phone lines
jammed as police chiefs, school superintendents and county officials
debated whether to keep schools open. Then, as the day drew to an
end, parents sped to pick up their children with the echo of a threat
playing in their heads: "Your children are not safe anywhere at any
time."</TE>
<TE>   Normalcy was just starting to creep back to Montgomery County.
People were beginning to relax a little, were laughing through
tightened throats and reminding themselves that there's no point in
hiding. In the 20 days since a bullet tore through the front window
of a nearby craft shop, the surrounding community has passed through
drastic mood changes.</TE>
<TE>   These people watched while an invisible gunman cut down four of
their neighbors in less than 24 hours. Then the carnage spread --
into the capital, east to a neighboring Maryland county, then deep
into the Virginia countryside. And the people of Montgomery County
came to the quiet conclusion, fed by profilers and by common sense,
that the sniper is hiding in plain sight, in their midst.</TE>
<TE>   "After the lull, everybody thought he lives here in the area, but
he'll travel around to kill in other places," said a 31-year-old
mover who declined to give his name. "People were starting to relax."</TE>
<TE>   This bedroom town of dipping hills and gated complexes was still
deep in slumber when 35-year-old Conrad Johnson was shot to death on
the steps of a commuter bus. Neighbors have seen the drivers
lingering down there so often they hardly notice them anymore as they
drink their coffee and fill out crossword puzzles, passing the scraps
of time between their routes. In retrospect, like the other victims,
they were easy targets.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so frightened I don't like to come to work anymore," said
Concepcion Cortes, an El Salvador native who waited for his bus
behind the shelter of a sidewalk newspaper box. "But what can I do?
Everybody has to work."</TE>
<TE>   Wastes Three Hours</TE>
<TE>   Bent on getting to work in Gaithersburg, Nicholas Cardenas wasted
three hours driving into traffic jams, then executing nimble U-turns
to circle back. Try as he might, he couldn't get through. Finally, in
desperate need of a bathroom, he gave up and headed back to where he
began -- a few blocks from the scene of the dawn shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "Next time I hear this on the radio, I'm just going to stay home,"
he said. "It's not worth it."</TE>
<TE>   For businesses like Shipley Plumbing in Maryland, the police
roadblocks are expensive quagmires of missed appointments, wasted
fuel and lost hours. "It's devastating my income," owner Ron Shipley
said. "I've just got trucks idling. I've got customers asking: 'Why
didn't you get here?' "</TE>
<TE>   Time is passing. Fall is flaming red and orange in the woods;
trees weep dead leaves over empty sidewalks and the bite of winter
has stolen into the air. The ground of Aspen Hill is soft underfoot
with fallen pine needles. The craft shop window that caught the
sniper's first bullet has been mended; the panes are bright with
painted leaves and pumpkins.</TE>
<TE>   "You could throw a bowling ball through the shopping centers
around here without hitting anybody," said the owner of a flower shop
at the edge of an Aspen Hill cemetery. Terrified of being targeted
next, she refused to give her name and asked that the name of her
business not appear -- but she couldn't control her anger at the
mention of the sniper.</TE>
<TE>   "This is horrendous; it's like a war zone now," she said, her
voice rising over the beat of the helicopters. "We have families to
take care of! People buy something and I thank them for coming out of
their houses!"</TE>
<TE>   Harmony Hills Elementary School in Silver Spring was tamped down
tighter than a prison Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Every window was covered with blinds. The dodge-ball ring was
deserted, the slide abandoned and dead leaves piled on the sidewalks.
Only the locked cars in the parking lot hinted that school carried
on, hidden behind the bricks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's crazy, you know? Crazy," said Sam Tapri.</TE>
<TE>   In Richmond, Va., schools were closed for the second day in a row.</TE>
<TE>   But to the ire of some parents, many schools around the Beltway
were determined to keep on teaching.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought hard on Sept. 11 about where they were safest,"
Arlington, Va., School Board member Dave Foster said. "We concluded
then and I do now that in school they are as safe as they can be."</TE>
<TE>   Long before classes let out at Washington's Brightwood Elementary
School, parents clogged the street out front. When the time came, the
adults rushed the foyer under the watch of guards and a police
cruiser to scoop up their children and spirit them home.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel I can trust anyone anymore," said one of the
mothers. "How do I know that that man across the street or this woman
next to me is not going to harm my children?"</TE>
<TE>   In Aspen Hill, residents are reduced to eyeing one another
suspiciously, scanning each face for a hint of homicide. This
neighborhood is a wildly diverse mix of white-collar professionals
and blue-collar laborers, a melange of immigrants from Latin America,
Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   It is the sort of place where people come and go, where one
doesn't necessarily know one's neighbors and where nobody looks
particularly out of place. It isn't hard to disappear here.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes you prejudiced. It makes you look at your neighbors
differently," Love said. "And that's not fair. It is not fair that
we're under siege like this."</TE>
<TE>   Creeps From Home</TE>
<TE>   But nobody can stay inside forever.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later, the cupboard is bare, the tank is empty or it's
time to show up at work. When an Aspen Hill nurse named Emerita Ugay
crept from her condominium to drive to the hospital, she quaked
visibly in the fresh air.</TE>
<TE>   "What if he shot this guy, walked back home and watched it on TV?"
she asked, waving an arm at the empty brick facades of her gated
complex. "I think he did, and it's really scary. Oh, my God, I'm
scared. What will we do?"</TE>
<TE>   When Isaac Vonero Richards slipped into a pullover, tugged his
Yankees cap over his ears and made for the front door, his family
called after him, urged him to be sensible, stay inside. But
Richards, who moved to Maryland from Liberia a year ago, ignored
their admonitions. "It's hard to stay inside all day," he said.
Instead, he went for a walk, breathing in the cold, spiced autumn
air.</TE>
<TE>   "In my country it was war and shooting every day, and every day an
uprising," he said. "Nobody knows who's next. As we're standing out
here, we could be shot. You have to live your life."</TE>
<TE>   If the sniper stays on the run much longer, Richards said, his
neighbors will get used to the dread. They will assimilate. "They'll
get tired of it," he said. "They may be frightened today, but
eventually they will have to come out again."</TE>

<HD>Killer Escalates Sense of Control</HD>
<DH>His demand for money surprises experts, but his chilling
threat to harm children does not.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- It was a gut punch to an entire region: "Your children
are not safe anywhere at any time."</LD>
<LD>   But experts in criminal behavior said it was not unexpected that
the Washington-area sniper would make such a threat, given that he
has shown a pattern of trying to escalate his sense of power and
control over the community he is terrorizing.</LD>
<LD>   The real surprise Tuesday, said behavioral psychologists, was
another statement made by the sniper: a demand for money. They said
such a demand was virtually unheard of in similar cases of multiple
killings.</LD>
<TE>   "It's extraordinary," said James Alan Fox, an authority on
homicide at Northeastern University in Boston. "I can't think of any
others like that. People in these cases usually have more of a
psychological or political agenda."</TE>
<TE>   "This would be unexpected compared to the 20 serial killers I've
seen," said Dr. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a New York University
psychiatrist. Lewis cautioned, however, that the public knows so
little about the sniper that it is hard to draw a clear picture of
the person, his motives and his intentions.</TE>
<TE>   The chilling caution on children's safety, as well as the apparent
demand for money, came in a letter left at the scene of the shooting
outside an Ashland, Va., restaurant on Saturday. That was the most
recent before Tuesday's fatal assault on a bus driver in the same
Montgomery County, Md., suburban area where the attacks began three
weeks ago today.</TE>
<TE>   Sources in the probe told Associated Press on Tuesday that the
note, described as lengthy and poorly worded, suggested the killer
wants $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We have researched the options you stated and found that it is
not possible electronically to comply in the manner that you
requested," Montgomery County Police Chief Charles A. Moose said in a
Tuesday night statement to the letter writer. "However, we remain
open and ready to talk to you about the options you have mentioned."</TE>
<TE>   And he added: "You indicated that this is about more than
violence. We are waiting to hear from you."</TE>
<TE>   It is not uncommon for serial killers to leave notes, often
taunting police or boasting of their skills in evading authorities.
Notes in past cases have also threatened children. The self-named
Zodiac killer, who stalked Northern California in the late 1960s and
early 1970s, sent letters laying out plans to detonate a bomb under a
school bus, even drawing diagrams of his planned device. No such
attack took place.</TE>
<TE>   But several criminal behavior experts said they could not think of
a case where someone had killed several people and then began
demanding money.</TE>
<TE>   Some specialists said the demand probably had less to do with the
money itself than with the pleasure of manipulating authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "This person is enjoying the terror he's creating. This may just
be a move to intensify that," Fox said. "It may have something to do
with just his being in charge -- we don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton R. Van Zandt, a former FBI profiler and hostage
negotiator, said killers can evolve over time, and it is possible
that the sniper would in fact turn "to some form of extortion, like a
person who threatens to put ground glass in baby food."</TE>
<TE>   The demand for money is only one way in which the sniper differs
from other serial killers. Where repeat killers often show a
predilection for a particular type of person -- young blond women,
for example -- the person stalking the Washington region has chosen a
variety of victims.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Levin, director of Northeastern University's Brudnick Center
on Violence and Conflict, said the letter and other communications to
police led him to three conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   First, the sniper is probably not part of organized or
international terrorism. "Al Qaeda doesn't leave its phone number,
and it wouldn't claim to be God," Levin said. A tarot card left at an
earlier shooting reportedly included the words "Dear Mr. Policeman, I
am God," and the Ashland note contained a telephone number apparently
designed to facilitate communication with police.</TE>
<TE>   Second, it is unlikely that the sniper is working with a partner,
as about 25% of serial killers do. "It would be unprecedented for a
team of killers, like friends, to be communicating with the police or
the media," Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're too busy communicating between themselves. Their killing
spree is intended to enhance the bond between them. I've racked my
brain to remember just one case of a team of serial killers who have
sent messages to the police or media, and I can't think of one."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, "this killer is more interested in what happens in the
aftermath of his murders than in the murders themselves," Levin said.
"Very few serial killers use a firearm. Most use their hands and get
off on their victims suffering. This one distances himself from the
victim but enjoys the cat-and-mouse with police." Fox saw the
sniper's threat against children as part of an escalation of his
sense of control over others. "It's a general announcement of how
much power he has. It's not a surprise that he ... is articulating
it."</TE>
<TE>   Levin ventured that the best way to find the killer would be for
police to release the text of his letter and hope that someone
recognizes the writing style.</TE>
<TE>   That strategy worked in the Unabomber case, when the language used
by Theodore J. Kaczynski was recognized by his brother after the
bomber's 35,000-word treatise was published in two newspapers. But it
was no help with the Zodiac killer, who wrote more than 20 letters to
newspapers and was never found.</TE>

<HD>Salt Lake Mayor Backs Free-Speech Plaza Ruling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Mayor Rocky Anderson on Tuesday said he would keep the sidewalks
through a Mormon-owned Main Street plaza open to free speech, in
compliance with a ruling by a federal appeals court.</LD>
<LD>   In a 22-page memo released Tuesday, Anderson also said he would
not renegotiate the contract in which the church bought the property
in 1999. The city kept an easement for public access, and the U.S.
10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that people using that easement
retained their free-speech rights.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson said he was compelled to agree with the court's ruling
that the city was responsible for controlling conduct on the public
sidewalk, not the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which
had imposed a long list of forbidden behaviors.</LD>
<TE>   The mayor's statement came after two closed-door meetings with
advisors. The mayor said he would like reasonable and constitutional
restrictions on the sidewalk, and would take to the City Council
recommendations for so-called time, place and manner rules.</TE>
<TE>   "If, hypothetically, they came up with something that was
constitutionally suspect, I would veto it. We've had enough of this
division in the community," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson also issued a plea that visitors to the plaza "be
peaceful, respectful of others and -- most of all -- kind and
friendly in our interactions."</TE>
<TE>   The church still plans to appeal the 10th Circuit ruling. The
appeal would be filed today, the action's deadline, church lawyer Von
Keetch said Tuesday. He said Anderson's decision was disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   The "prime solution" would be for the city to give up its easement
to the church. The church in turn would grant 24-hour public access,
subject to the church's behavior restrictions, Keetch said.</TE>

<HD>Study Lends Support for Nurse-to-Patient Ratio Laws</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A patient's risk of dying from routine surgery is higher at hospitals
with fewer nurses at the bedside, according to research published in
today's Journal of the American Medical Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The study, conducted by University of Pennsylvania researchers,
appears to validate California's legislative efforts to limit the
number of patients assigned to each hospital nurse. California is the
first and only state to approve nurse-to-patient ratios, which take
effect in January 2004.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers concluded that inadequate nursing levels lead to
thousands of avoidable deaths each year. They also found that a
patient's risk of death within 30 days of admission increased by
about 7% for every additional patient in a nurse's workload.</LD>
<TE>   If a typical nurse is responsible for six patients, rather than
four, patients had a 14% greater chance of dying after surgery. The
mortality rate increases by 31% if a nurse's patient load increases
to eight from four.</TE>
<TE>   "We find a really strong and unequivocal relationship between
nurse staffing and mortality," said Linda Aiken, director of the
Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research at Penn's nursing
school. "We hope that this will help resolve the issue of whether
this is a big problem or a small problem."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers examined data from 168 hospitals, 232,342 surgical
patients and 10,184 nurses in Pennsylvania. The patients underwent
general, orthopedic or vascular procedures in 1998 and 1999. Such
surgeries include gallbladder removals and knee and hip replacements.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that burnout and job dissatisfaction are higher
among nurses with more patients under their care. Those nurses said
they were far more likely to leave the profession than their peers.</TE>
<TE>   Aiken suggested that hospitals could counteract the nurse shortage
if they were able to retain stressed nurses who now are likely to
quit because of poor working conditions.</TE>
<TE>   In California, supporters of the nurse-to-patient ratios hailed
the study. Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the California
Nurses Assn., said nurses would return to work in hospitals if the
conditions were more reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of what drives nurses out of nursing is a crisis in
conscience," DeMoro said. "They feel that they go home at night, and
they're extremely concerned and depressed about what's happening with
their patients."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Aiken's article called California's ratio law "a credible
approach to reducing mortality and increasing nurse retention in
hospital practice ... "</TE>
<TE>   But critics of the ratios say hospitals cannot recruit enough
nurses to fill the slots.</TE>
<TE>   California has the second-lowest number of registered nurses per
capita in the country. And the state's colleges aren't even
graduating enough nurses each year to replace those who retire, said
Dorel Harms, vice president of professional services at the
California Healthcare Assn., a hospital trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital leaders say they need the flexibility to change the
staffing mix based on the severity of patients in the hospital and
the time of day. Patients asleep at night, for instance, may require
less supervision than those awake during the day.</TE>
<TE>   The ratios in California would vary depending on the hospital unit
in which a patient is staying. In trauma units, for instance, the
ratio would be as high as one nurse for every patient. In
medical-surgical units, it would be one nurse for every six patients
in 2004 and then drop to one nurse for every five patients.</TE>
<TE>   Before the regulations take effect, state health officials will
hold three hearings around the state to hear public comments. The
first will take place at 10 a.m. Nov. 15 at the Ronald Reagan state
office building, 300 S. Spring St., in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>In Deal, Moussaoui's Ex-Roommate Agrees to Testify</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- A former roommate of Zacarias Moussaoui who admitted he
lied to FBI agents was sentenced Tuesday to time already served after
promising he would testify against the so-called 20th hijacker.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the agreement, Hussein al-Attas, 24, who pleaded guilty
in July, will remain in prison as a material witness until the end of
the year.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said they had no evidence that Al-Attas was a member
of any conspiracy to murder U.S. citizens, use weapons of mass
destruction or planned to participate in terrorist activities.</LD>
<TE>   If called as a witness at Moussaoui's trial next year, Al-Attas is
expected to tell a jury about sharing an apartment with Moussaoui for
a month during the summer of 2001 in Norman, Okla. Moussaoui, who is
a suspect in the Sept. 11 plot, briefly attended a flight school
there. Al-Attas, a citizen of Yemen, then drove his roommate to
another flight school in Minnesota, where Moussaoui enrolled in a
course to study big jets.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI arrested Moussaoui and Al-Attas in Eagan, Minn. on Aug.
16, 2001. While Moussaoui remained in jail, Al-Attas was able to post
bond, but was arrested again on Sept. 11. He was brought to New York
City six days later, where a grand jury was investigating the attacks
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to apologize for my regrettable actions," Al-Attas wrote
in a letter to U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey, who sentenced him
Tuesday to time served plus two years of probation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in a state of shock and confusion when I lied to law
enforcement agents, but that does not excuse my unlawful actions," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want to do is distance myself from a situation that really
didn't involve me," he added. "Still, I should have been truthful and
let the truth take care of me."</TE>
<TE>   Al-Attas admitted not telling the truth when he denied planning to
travel to New York City with Moussaoui, using a firearm at a target
range, and making plans to visit Pakistan to learn about the concept
of holy war.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate letter to the judge, Alexander E. Eisemann, the
chief defense lawyer for Al-Attas, said his client was a "good person
who reacted inappropriately when he found himself in the wrong place
at the wrong time."</TE>
<TE>   Eisemann said that Al-Attas had no idea the "ghastly and shocking
events of Sept. 11 would occur."</TE>
<TE>   In a plea agreement with prosecutors signed July 22, Al-Attas
admitted giving false statements, including lying about whether he
knew that Moussaoui wanted to take part in jihad. Moussaoui is
charged with conspiring to help the 9/11 hijackers.</TE>

<HD>GOP Hopeful Gets Back in Montana Race</HD>
<DH>Senate candidate, upset over Democrats' TV ad, says he
wants to root out slander in politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HELENA, Mont.</DL>
<LD>Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Taylor, who dropped out of the
race against Sen. Max Baucus two weeks ago, said Tuesday he is
resuming a limited campaign aimed largely at "getting the slander out
of Montana politics."</LD>
<LD>   Taylor dropped out of the race Oct. 10, complaining that a
Democratic Party ad was calculated to make him look like a gay
hairdresser.</LD>
<LD>   "I went home and I prayed -- for my family, my friends, and for
all people of Montana who were hurt by the slander and suggestions
about me," Taylor said. "The message, then, became clear .... If I
must go down, it should be in a good cause."</LD>
<TE>   He told a news conference he is launching a statewide bus tour,
but does not plan to resume media advertising. Ken Miller, chairman
of the state Republican Party, said the state GOP would pay for the
bus tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I am here for one reason and one reason alone: to send a message
against mudslinging," Taylor said. "I want to save democracy from the
smear campaigns."</TE>
<TE>   Miller said the party also worried that the lack of a visible
Republican campaign for the most prominent Montana race would hurt
local GOP candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor was trailing Baucus badly in the polls and said the
Democratic Party commercial amounted to character assassination. He
said his campaign lacked the money to counter the damage done.</TE>
<TE>   The TV ad accused the 61-year-old state senator of a scam
involving student loan money when he ran a Colorado beauty school in
the 1990s. It included videotape from the 1980s of Taylor wearing an
open-front shirt and gold chains while massaging a man's face. The
video was from Taylor's "Beauty Corner," a segment he used to host on
a Colorado TV news program.</TE>
<TE>   The state Democratic Party denied use of the old tape was intended
to suggest Taylor is gay. Taylor, a father of two and a cattle
rancher, has been married to his wife, Janna, for 22 years.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats said Taylor's campaign suspension was a ploy to divert
attention from Democratic accusations that Taylor pilfered money from
the government's student loan program.</TE>
<TE>   "When Mike Taylor quit, it was obvious it was a campaign stunt,
and when he got back in, it was obvious it was a stunt," said Brad
Martin, executive director for the Montana Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Polls had Baucus holding a 19-point lead over Taylor before the ad
began running. Taylor said his polls showed Baucus' lead grew after
the ad first ran.</TE>

<HD>Bus Driver's Slaying Carries Mark of Sniper</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>ASPEN HILL, Md. -- A single gun blast killed a suburban Maryland bus
driver Tuesday, signaling that the Washington-area sniper may have
returned to his terror-stricken starting place, and police confirmed
a dire new threat from the gunman to the region's young.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators continued a dialogue with the rifle-wielding killer
even as they combed for evidence and tried to track him down. Urging
the killer to stay in contact, Montgomery County Police Chief Charles
A. Moose recited a menacing passage from a letter found last weekend
near a restaurant in Ashland, Va., the site of one of the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   " 'Your children are not safe anywhere at any time,' " Moose read.</LD>
<TE>   The unspecified threat played a role in a spate of school closings
in and around Richmond, Va., on Monday and Tuesday. Moose said he
revealed the passage because of the "concerns of the community."</TE>
<TE>   Late in the day, the police chief emerged to read another missive
to the gunman. In the cryptic exchange, Moose told the killer that
police had "researched the options you stated" but found they were
"not possible electronically."</TE>
<TE>   (The Washington Post reported that the letter listed half a dozen
calls that had been ''ignored" by operators at the task force command
center. The letter writer claimed that "five people had to die"
because "incompetent" workers had hung up repeatedly on him. The
letter demanded $10 million, according to sources quoted by the Post
and Associated Press.)</TE>
<TE>   Police were awaiting the results of ballistic tests to see whether
Tuesday's shooting could be linked to the previous attacks, which
have killed nine and wounded three over the last three weeks. But the
killing bore the sniper's distinctive signatures: a solitary gunshot,
a forest hide-out, a stealthy escape through a massive police
dragnet. No one reported seeing his face or his gun; no one reported
seeing his getaway vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Ashen-faced investigators conceded the obvious during a news
conference soon after Conrad E. Johnson, 35, was pronounced dead at
Suburban Hospital in Bethesda. The sniper's skill at stalking human
prey, killing from a distance and eluding a massive manhunt has left
the entire Washington region at risk.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not been able to assure that anyone -- any age, any
gender, any race -- about their safety with regards to this
situation," Moose said. The sniper, he added, displays "a clear
willingness and ability to kill people" at "different times,
different days and different locations."</TE>
<TE>   The attack came at dawn Tuesday, almost exquisitely timed and
placed to maximize dread. Johnson was cut down inside his bus just
before 6 a.m. as it idled halfway between the sites of two of the
first assaults.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, hundreds of county police and Maryland state
troopers swarmed over highway ramps and clamped down on side streets
all around Washington's Beltway. Brandishing shotguns, pistols and
rifles, they scanned the faces of male drivers and stopped scores of
white vans -- the type of vehicle witnesses had seen at previous
sites.</TE>
<TE>   But the police were relying on sniper alerts more than a week old.
After interviewing scores of neighbors on Tuesday, investigators had
no new witness reports to radio to the roadblock officers, no fresh
descriptions of an escape vehicle. The four-hour dragnet came up
empty.</TE>
<TE>   The failure to apprehend the killer has magnified pressure on law
enforcement officials, who are trying to reassure the public even as
they concede their inability to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing everything in our power to keep people safe, collect
evidence, use any strategy to get this person off the street and get
this person indicted," Moose said.</TE>
<TE>   But he and other authorities were forced to wave off growing
reports that the FBI and other federal agencies would take a more
prominent role in the probe. Federal officials are researching
gun-related statutes, one official said, but the homicide cases
remain the responsibility of Maryland and Virginia police
jurisdictions -- seven agencies so far.</TE>
<TE>   "The circumstances have not changed," said Gary M. Bald, special
agent in charge of the FBI's Baltimore office, who heads a team of
federal agents. "This continues to be a joint investigation. It's a
situation where each of the agencies are bringing their expertise to
these cases."</TE>
<TE>   Officials close to the investigation said federal officials
already have had a primary role in decision making on police matters,
but share that status with Montgomery County officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got more than half of the homicides in this case, and
that's not something you just push aside," one county official said.</TE>
<TE>   The Times has also learned that the CIA offered to help out the
FBI on the sniper case -- but that aid has so far been limited.</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't taken it up," said one U.S. intelligence official.
"The only assistance we've been asked for is some of our
bomb-sniffing dogs." The canine teams were "used by local authorities
to look for cartridges" after a recent shooting in Falls Church, Va.,
not far from the CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. No spent cartridges
were found.</TE>
<TE>   The rifle-wielding killer struck before sunrise Tuesday, aiming at
an easy target illuminated in the morning's darkness. Johnson, a
10-year county employee and father of two, had just pulled his
commuter bus up near a staging area where county buses start their
day. Commuters were straggling to bus stops. Yellow school buses were
out, too, rolling on their first runs.</TE>
<TE>   The gunshot reverberated out from Northgate Park, a small wooded
space near the bus staging area. Johnson, who stood near the open
door of his bus, was struck in the abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred yards away, Juan Tilleria, 42, heard the booming
sound while sipping coffee out on the second-floor balcony of his
garden apartment. His cup clattered and he almost dropped a
cigarette. The Chilean-born carpenter instantly recognized the noise.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a rifle shot, I know this," he said. And Tilleria guessed
who cradled the gun. "It had to be him." He retreated inside and
turned on his television, waiting for confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   At the next building over, Jessica Adenji, 17, was struggling with
a balky book bag on the outside steps. She heard the boom and looked
over toward the vaulting oaks in Northgate Park.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounded like a bomb," she recalled. But she could not imagine
a blast in her sleepy neighborhood. She was almost to the street when
a car screeched up. A teenager craned his head out.</TE>
<TE>   "Didn't you hear those gunshots?" the boy shouted. "Where do you
think you're going?"</TE>
<TE>   Frightened, she raced back into her building.</TE>
<TE>   The first report of gunfire came at a bad moment for Montgomery
County police officers -- just as they were changing shifts. Police
cruisers from the night shift were pulling in while day-shift
officers were assembling for morning roll calls. When the first alert
sounded, officers in the Wheaton station, a mile from the murder
site, grabbed assault rifles and flak jackets.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's roll!" several yelled, struggling with bulletproof vests as
they headed for their cars. "The whole station emptied," said one
officer, who drove in to see day-shift officers sprinting out the
back door.</TE>
<TE>   Police moved quickly, though there were reports that they were
delayed by confusion at the first shooting report, uncertain whether
there was a man down near Bel Pre Road or Grand Pre Road. But within
minutes, they were spooling yellow crowd-control tape around the
blood-pooled bus and the park beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Trauma surgeons at Suburban Hospital were unable to revive
Johnson. Friends in Oxon Hill, in neighboring Prince George's County,
were left devastated and angry.</TE>
<TE>   "This is hitting hard. This not only strikes us as a community,
but as a people, as a nation," said Harold McClam.</TE>
<TE>   But police had little to go on. Federal firearms experts scoured
Northgate Park, but neighbors could provide no clue to the killer's
appearance or his escape vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Police cruisers sprawled across roads all morning, freezing
traffic while officers looked in car windows, sometimes halting
vehicles at gunpoint. Rifle-toting officers shut down almost every
road leading out of the murder site, even standing guard on remote
back streets.</TE>
<TE>   But the killer slipped through their net and by noon he had again
contacted task force investigators. Moose addressed the elusive
gunman in public.</TE>
<TE>   "We have received a communication and we will be responding soon,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Five hours later, Moose emerged again, this time offering a
cryptic exchange that hinted of negotiations and a balky delivery. He
talked of mail drops and toll-free numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "These past several days, you have attempted to communicate with
us," Moose said. "We have researched the options you stated and found
that it is not possible electronically to comply in the manner that
you requested."</TE>
<TE>   But Moose said "we remain open and ready to talk to you about the
options you have mentioned. It is important that we do this without
anyone else getting hurt. Call us at the same number you used before
to obtain the 800 number that you have requested. If you would feel
more comfortable, a private post office box or another secure method
can be provided."</TE>
<TE>   Then, for a moment, Moose dropped his guard. His head dropped and
he squinted.</TE>
<TE>   "You indicated that this is about more than violence," he said.
"We are waiting to hear from you."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SILVER SPRING, Md.</DL>
<LD>This is the text of a statement made by Montgomery County Police
Chief Charles A. Moose in which he said the sniper terrorizing the
Washington area made a threat against children:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   We have received a communication. We will be responding soon.
Secondly there continues to be a great deal of speculation as to a
reference, a threat in the message previously received. As stated
earlier, everyone knows that all of our citizens are and have been at
risk. The person or people have demonstrated a willingness and
ability to shoot people of all ages, all races, all genders and
they've struck at different times of the day, different days at
different locations.</LD>
<TE>   We recognize the concerns of the community and therefore are going
to provide the exact language in the message that pertains to the
threat. It is in form of postscript: "Your children are not safe
anywhere at any time."</TE>
<TE>   We feel it's important to provide this information to the public.
We are not providing the remaining content of the message. It does
not communicate to the public. However, to share that at this point
would be detrimental to an investigation and will not be released.</TE>
<TE>   Please understand that this exact language has previously been
shared with the leadership, the law enforcement community leadership,
people who needed to make decisions. As a result of numerous
inquiries, and reporting of incorrect versions, different versions,
we felt it was important to come out and give the exact version so
that people could have it ....</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Times to Control Herald Tribune</HD>
<DH>Newspaper is buying out the Washington Post, which told its
reporters that it had reluctantly agreed to the Paris-based paper's
sale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The New York Times is buying out the Washington Post and taking sole
control of the Paris-based International Herald Tribune. The Post
told its reporters Tuesday that it agreed to the sale only after the
Times threatened to drive the Herald Tribune into ruin.</LD>
<LD>   The Times said the sale was by mutual agreement but had no
response to the Post's charges, which represented a rare airing of
dirty laundry between two newspaper titans. The Times and the Post
have equally shared ownership of the Herald Tribune since 1991.</LD>
<LD>   No terms of the sale were disclosed.</LD>
<TE>   The 115-year-old English-language paper, with a circulation of
264,000 from Spain to Lebanon to Japan, has been hit by a global
advertising slump in the last two years. But in a memo obtained by
Associated Press, Post Chairman Donald E. Graham made it clear to
Post editors and foreign correspondents that he had not wanted to
sell. The memo says the Times proposed the sale earlier this year and
warned of dire consequences if the Post did not agree.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Post did not sell, the Times said it would start its own
international edition anyway, intending to sell as many copies as
allowed under the IHT partnership agreement. The Times also said it
would block any cash infusion into the IHT, which the partnership
agreement would permit it to do," the memo reads. "With increased
competition from an international edition of the Times, and with the
Times effectively blocking ongoing support for the IHT, continued IHT
operations under joint ownership would soon become untenable,
threatening the future of the newspaper and its staff."</TE>
<TE>   The memo stated that the Post would have preferred to maintain
joint ownership and editorial control, but that the Times would not
budge and essentially strong-armed the Post into the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Times spokeswoman Catherine Mathis refused to discuss the Post
memo.</TE>
<TE>   "The Times has done a number of things over the years to expand
its content, so certainly this is a way in which we can become a
stronger international print voice," Mathis said. "We also believe
that the IHT will benefit from operating with a single parent."</TE>
<TE>   The feud is the latest development as both media companies try to
expand their reach domestically and overseas. But it is unusual to
see such a disagreement made public. The Post, which has its own
overseas reporting staff, said it is exploring other options,
including possible arrangements with newspapers and other media
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The transfer of Herald Tribune ownership should take place by the
end of the year or early next year, Executive Editor David Ignatius
said. Details and legal issues are still being worked out.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis said no job cuts or changes in operation or management were
expected.</TE>
<TE>   The paper prints articles from the Post, the Times and its own
correspondents. It has a staff of 250.</TE>
<TE>   Ignatius said he hoped the paper's headquarters would remain in
Paris.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the IHT's strength is that it is an international
newspaper based in Paris with its own voice and traditions," Ignatius
said. "We may speak with an American accent, but we are truly an
international paper."</TE>
<TE>   Founded in Paris in 1887, the newspaper has played an
international role in a city considered by many to be the world's
cultural capital.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that rather than owning half of a great global
newspaper, [the Times] wants to be a great global newspaper,"
Ignatius said.</TE>
<TE>   In April, for example, the respected French daily Le Monde started
publishing a 12-page weekly supplement of Times articles -- in
English.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Post and the Times have had a stake in the paper since
the mid-1960s, when they shared control with Whitney Communications.
They bought Whitney out in 1991.</TE>

<HD>Latest Victim, Father of 2, Killed Doing His Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon and Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- It began as a routine day for bus driver Conrad E.
Johnson as he prepared to start Route 34, which runs through the
usually peaceful Washington suburb of Aspen Hill, Md., to the
Bethesda subway station.</LD>
<LD>   But on Tuesday morning, Johnson, a 35-year-old father of two,
became the apparent 13th victim and 10th fatality of the
Washington-area sniper. He was struck in the abdomen as he stood at
the top of the steps of his bus shortly before 6 a.m. He died a short
time later at a hospital.</LD>
<LD>   "He had a large extended family, and he's going to be missed
greatly," said Montgomery County Executive Douglas Duncan.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson, an African American, was the latest in a diverse group of
the sniper's victims -- a cabdriver, a nanny, a landscaper, an
entrepreneur, a schoolboy, an FBI analyst -- people of varying age
and ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   Near the beige, two-story townhouse in the Maryland suburb of Oxon
Hill, where Johnson lived with his wife, Denise, and children, Devon,
8, and Dante, 14, neighbors recalled him as friendly and outgoing.</TE>
<TE>   "He was nice," said Felicia McClam, 12. "He was like the only
grown-up who would come out here and play football with the kids."</TE>
<TE>   Her uncle, Gary McClam, said Johnson loved to wash his car "every
chance he could get" while listening to music.</TE>
<TE>   "It's horrible," neighbor Barbara Addison said. "What else can you
say?"</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had been a bus driver for about a decade. His father,
Tyrone, works as a coordinator for the same agency -- Montgomery
County's Ride-On bus system, which has 336 vehicles and carries about
75,000 passengers daily.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's fellow drivers expressed fear and shock after Tuesday's
shooting. One said he was scouring the horizon every time he stops.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like he enjoyed his job a whole lot. It's hard to
believe," one of Johnson's regular passengers said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a terrible loss of one of our county employees," said
Duncan, who met with Johnson's family. "He loved basketball. He loved
his kids."</TE>
<TE>   Gino Renne, president of Johnson's union, the Municipal &amp; County
Government Employees Organization Local 1994, called him "a great
human being, a man of enormous integrity, a strong family man and an
excellent employee."</TE>
<TE>   County spokeswoman Mary Anderson said the county work force was
stunned that the attack had claimed one of its own.</TE>
<TE>   "It's surreal," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's "only mission [Tuesday] was to transport the citizens of
the county he served so well," said Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening.</TE>

<HD>Sniper Victim Was a Textbook Case for Doctor</HD>

<LD>WASHINGTON -- When Saturday's sniper victim was rushed into the
operating room with a bullet in his abdomen, he was fortunate enough
to have as his surgeon the man who literally wrote the textbook on
such devastating wounds.</LD>
<LD>   It was Dr. Rao Ivatury, editor of Textbook of Penetrating Trauma,
whose practiced hand helped save the life of the 37-year-old man
struck down in the parking lot of a Ponderosa steakhouse in Ashland,
Va., by a high-velocity .223-caliber bullet fired by the
Washington-area sniper.</LD>
<LD>   The man's injuries were a textbook case of what such bullets can
do, said Ivatury, who has treated thousands of similar cases.</LD>
<TE>   "It looked like it almost exploded inside, causing a huge amount
of damage," said Ivatury, chief of trauma surgery at Virginia
Commonwealth University's Medical College of Virginia Hospitals in
Richmond.</TE>
<TE>   The victim, who was not identified at the request of police and
his family, was in critical but stable condition Tuesday at the
Medical College of Virginia Hospital. He has improved every day,
according to hospital officials.</TE>
<TE>   High-velocity rounds such as the sniper has been using cause much
more devastation than the average handgun bullet.</TE>
<TE>   "The .223-caliber [ammunition] that the sniper uses goes in and
creates a large path of destruction, which is why it killed most of
the other people," said Dr. Marsh Cuttino, the emergency room doctor
who treated the victim.</TE>
<TE>   "When one of them enters the skin, it makes a small hole the size
of a pencil eraser," he said. "But a large tube of destruction --
five to 10 times the size of the bullet -- is generated by the shock
wave as the bullet travels through the tissue."</TE>
<TE>   If Tuesday's shooting of Conrad Johnson, a bus driver in the
Maryland suburbs of Washington, is connected to the sniper, it would
bring to 10 the number of people killed in the rash of shootings that
began Oct. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The man who survived Ivatury's surgery is one of only three to
survive.</TE>
<TE>   Any kind of bullet can kill a person in seconds if it pierces the
aorta or another major blood vessel, because the victim quickly
bleeds to death.</TE>
<TE>   But the bullets used by the sniper can cause a person to bleed to
death quickly even if the aim is not as precise, doctors said. Often
the bleeding is all internal, so a bystander might not see any blood.</TE>
<TE>   To keep his patient alive, Ivatury's team had to take out
everything that was bleeding, including parts of the stomach,
pancreas and spleen, and use sutures and clamps to control bleeding
in other areas, the doctor said.</TE>
<TE>   The man needed a second surgery to repair the organs.</TE>
<TE>   Ivatury said he had done "thousands and thousands" of similar
surgeries from 1980 to 1998 while working in the Bronx section of New
York, where gang and drug violence was common.</TE>
<TE>   But Ivatury said the location of the bullet also favored
Saturday's victim. "If the bullet was a little more to the right or
to the back, he would have had major vascular injuries and he could
have died.</TE>
<TE>   "I was always fascinated with these injuries, and there was not a
specific book that addresses these injuries," Ivatury said. So he and
some colleagues wrote one; it was published in 1996. Several chapters
deal with treating traumas caused by high-velocity bullets.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jonathan Groner, trauma director at Children's Hospital in
Columbus, Ohio, said it is rare for a doctor in the U.S. to have much
experience treating these kinds of wounds unless the doctor served in
the military.</TE>
<TE>   Groner treats gunshot wounds, but not from high-velocity bullets.
Such surgery would pose a significant challenge for him, he said. "I
can sew up a hole in an artery. I can't sew up a bomb crater."</TE>
<TE>   "The way the bullet reacts when it hits its target varies
depending on the specific type of bullet used," said Tom Diaz, senior
policy analyst for the Washington-based Violence Policy Center, a gun
control group.</TE>
<TE>   "But even the simplest .223-caliber bullet will cause significant
if not devastating damage."</TE>

<HD>Copyrights and Wrong Copying</HD>
<DH>Not paying for creative work on the Web is theft, pure and
simple.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The place was rural Washington state. In daylight, a man busily
unloaded trash from his pickup truck, scattering it on the shoulder
of the road.</LD>
<LD>   He was confronted. "Hey, this is private property!"</LD>
<LD>   "Oh sorry," the man with the pickup replied, "I thought this was
Weyerhaeuser land."</LD>
<TE>   A Weyerhaeuser forest ranger recounted this story to me.
Weyerhaeuser is a corporate landowner with vast timber holdings in
Washington state. And it wasn't the first time this ranger had
encountered a citizen who believed that corporations were owed
whatever insult you cared to deliver, including a load of garbage.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to today, to the Internet, to the grudges we bear
against corporations and, again, to private property. The property I
have in mind is the creative work of writers, filmmakers and
musicians -- the underpinnings of our culture, for better and for
worse.</TE>
<TE>   Over recent months, I've collected a stack of mail from Internet
fundamentalists on the subject of what I call stealing and what they
call the exercise of freedom, or "fair use," or whatever.</TE>
<TE>   The argument is this: I think it's wrong to build libraries of
music, books and movies by "sharing" from computer to computer
without remunerating the creators; worshipers of the Web think it's
not only right, but a right.</TE>
<TE>   Underlying the angry arguments of a growing number of these
missionaries is rage against the corporation. That is, corporations
are too big, too callous, too impersonal and too gluttonous for
profits. They are ripping us off. So why complain about ordinary
folks who respond in kind?</TE>
<TE>   Even if you sympathize with this line of reasoning -- and who
among us doesn't, at least some of the time -- the Internet zealots
turn out to be no less greedy and even more shortsighted than the
institutions they loathe.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, the rampages of these Internet true believers have
taken on respectable tones in a Supreme Court challenge against
copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   Under the U.S. Constitution, inventors, writers and the like can
be granted exclusive rights to their works "for limited times" by
Congress. Unfortunately, politicians have abused this authority.</TE>
<TE>   Only too eager for campaign contributions and dazzled by dinners
with movie stars, members of Congress have granted Hollywood
lobbyists their wishes time and time again. The original 14-year
copyright now has been extended to 95 years for collaborative works
and 70 years for individual creations.</TE>
<TE>   These perpetual copyrights are greedy and contrary to our founding
principles. I wish the Internet crowd good luck as the high court now
ponders whether Congress exceeded its authority.</TE>
<TE>   But I share with many thousands of writers, musicians and actors a
deeper fear: A victory over copyright is not all these
fundamentalists want. And a win before the highest court in the land
would only energize, and perhaps legitimize, the idea that
technology, not common sense, must define "fair use" of creative
work.</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, many of these people don't want to pay for music,
literature or films. And they have machines on their desks that make
it push-button easy to scoop up the work of others, all the while
claiming they're just freedom fighters out to settle scores with
corporations.</TE>
<TE>   There is dreamy religious mysticism to their reasoning. Bow before
the almighty power of the Web and it will set us free. As for the
incentive for writers to write, or singers to sing? Well, the
believers have only faith. Artists will emerge from under the
bootheels of their corporate masters and find other ways to put bread
on the table.</TE>
<TE>   Oh really?</TE>
<TE>   What we have here is another installment in the modern fantasy
fable about "new economics." Never mind that the first testament
proved to be pure hokum. There was no new economy in technology --
and millions of people paid dearly for the con. But the theology is
still with us: If you cannot see the world the same as they do,
you're too dim to have it explained to you.</TE>
<TE>   Let me speak to the writing of books, about which I know just a
little. A writer spends years pursuing a subject of interest. The
resulting book is offered for sale in the hopes that people will buy
sufficient copies to finance the undertaking of another book. The
role of the corporate publisher is essential to the process, but
ancillary to the writer's motive.</TE>
<TE>   As envisioned by the Internet fundamentalists, only one copy of
the book would have to be purchased. Then it could be posted on the
Web, liberated, for everyone to share.</TE>
<TE>   But what of the writer?</TE>
<TE>   The reply is always vague. Well, she or he will find ways to
prosper somehow, we're told. Maybe by writing a sign and setting up
on a street corner: "Will write for food." More likely, they'll
resort to other work, like welcoming shoppers to Wal-Mart.</TE>
<TE>   The way I figure it, if you can afford a computer, you can also
afford to pay writers and singers and movie stars and best boys and
costume designers and sound mixers and all the rest for their work.
To argue otherwise, to say that you're just settling scores with
corporations, is another load of garbage.</TE>

<HD>For China, Greatness Lies in Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Joseph A. Bosco</AU>
<BD>Joseph A. Bosco teaches a graduate seminar on Western
values and Asian security at Georgetown University's School of
Foreign Service.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jiang Zemin's farewell meeting with President Bush in Texas on Friday
will mark the passing of China's "third generation" of Communist
leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Mao Tse-tung established the People's Republic, and Deng Xiaoping
brought it into the world economy; now Jiang proclaims as his legacy
the abstruse and awkward "three represents." The Communist Party now
represents "productive forces" and "advanced culture" as well as the
traditional "masses."</LD>
<LD>   If the Chinese people are ever to achieve their full potential,
the fourth generation, after Hu Jintao's expected anointment as
Jiang's successor next month, needs to articulate a coherent new
vision based on political pragmatism rather than contrived party
ideology.</LD>
<TE>   The leaders should shape China's future with "three realisms":
Reform the dictatorial political system, reduce bloated and dangerous
military spending and reverse archaic policies on Taiwan, Tibet and
Xinjiang.</TE>
<TE>   * Political reform. Deng resuscitated China from the disastrous
economic policies of the Mao era. Jiang has consolidated economic
liberalization and helped bury discredited Marxism. But neither
leader dared alter the totalitarian features of the Leninist system,
fearing the loss of Communist control.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in his speech last year inviting entrepreneurs to join the
party, Jiang firmly rejected even the possibility of multiparty
democracy. In rigidly adhering to one-party dictatorship, Chinese
leaders are on the wrong side of history. Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan have demonstrated that democracy is entirely compatible with
"Asian values," political stability and economic prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   The structural weaknesses in China's economy -- rampant
corruption, lack of legal accountability -- can be cured only by the
transparency and rules-based system fostered by political openness.</TE>
<TE>   * Military expenditures. Beijing says it devotes 18% of its budget
to modernizing the army, surpassing other countries in the region
except its Communist ally, North Korea. Western experts believe the
figure is much higher. Even as it spends massive amounts on military
hardware, China pleads for developing-nation status to lower its U.N.
dues and goes hat in hand for Western money to develop the
countryside, to clean its environment and belatedly to fight an AIDS
epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Chinese doctrine that portrays the U.S. as an inevitable
enemy, American trade and technology transfers have fueled China's
economic growth and military modernization. No country covets Chinese
territory or poses a military threat to its political system, but
misguided Beijing policies based on paranoia, propaganda and a sense
of perpetual victimhood can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</TE>
<TE>   China's legitimate concern for secure sea lanes to ensure the flow
of Middle East oil does not require another blue-water navy in the
region. The U.S. presence has preserved freedom of the seas for half
a century and will continue to do so. A China that is not
expansionist need not fear containment. Benign American military
superiority, inevitable in any event, is not a bad scenario for
China's future development.</TE>
<TE>   * Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang. China's approach to Taiwan and its
treatment of minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang continue to deny China
the dignity and international respect it seeks, something the 2008
Beijing Olympics alone will not provide. Beijing continues to rely on
the use or threat of military force to resolve disputes within and
beyond its borders while selectively invoking or ignoring
international law.</TE>
<TE>   Although China has never governed Taiwan, it claims a right to
take it by force, contrary to the U.N. Charter. China's military
exercises and missile firings in 1996 closed the Taiwan Strait to
shipping and commercial aviation, in violation of international law.</TE>
<TE>   After winning its civil war with the Nationalists, the Communist
regime "liberated" the independent states of Tibet and Xinjiang in
1950 while the world was preoccupied with war in Korea. China's
cultural genocide in these formerly autonomous regions is
Taliban-like and reminds the world that Maoism is not dead. For China
to fulfill its aspirations and become a truly great nation, it must
become a normal one. A prosperous, democratic and peaceful China will
find no enemies in the West.</TE>

<HD>Another Bad Hollywood Sequel</HD>
<DH>Celebrities took action against Hitler but now oppose
confronting Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rafael Medoff</AU>
<BD>Rafael Medoff is a visiting scholar in the Jewish
studies program at SUNY-Purchase and co-author, with David S. Wyman,
of "A Race Against Death: Peter Bergson, America, and the Holocaust"
(2002, the New Press).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A number of Hollywood celebrities are stirring controversy with their
vigorous opposition to American military action against Saddam
Hussein. Among others, Woody Harrelson has declared that such U.S.
action would be "racist and imperialist," while Harry Belafonte has
characterized Secretary of State Colin L. Powell as a cowardly slave
kowtowing to his master.</LD>
<LD>   For some, Hollywood's interest in Iraq is reminiscent of
celebrities' earlier involvement in causes such as the Vietnam War,
the environment and nuclear disarmament. What is not widely known is
that the first cause that a significant number of Hollywood figures
embraced was the rescue of Jews from the Holocaust.</LD>
<LD>   The man who introduced Hollywood to the rescue issue was the
screenwriter and journalist Ben Hecht, whose credits included such
films as "Scarface" and "Wuthering Heights."</LD>
<TE>   In 1941, Hecht joined up with Peter Bergson, a militant Zionist
emissary from Palestine, who hoped to convince the Allies to
establish a Jewish military force to take part in the war against the
Nazis. Although the magnitude of the Nazis' slaughter of the Jews was
not yet known, enough information about Nazi atrocities had filtered
out to rouse the support of many Americans for the notion of arming
Jews to fight Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   When Hecht brought Bergson to Hollywood, he found considerable
sympathy for the project. Movie producer David O. Selznick signed the
telegram announcing the Jewish Army committee's local fund-raising
meeting, and actor Burgess Meredith was one of the featured speakers.
Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper made the first pledge. Among
Bergson's other early supporters were such well-known Hollywood names
as Melvyn Douglas, Eddie Cantor and Jimmy Durante.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1942, after Allied leaders publicly confirmed that the
Nazis were engaged in genocide, Bergson shifted gears. He set aside
the Jewish Army committee and established the Emergency Committee to
Save the Jewish People of Europe. Hecht followed, as did an
ever-growing list of Hollywood luminaries.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous celebrities volunteered their services for "We Will Never
Die," a pageant written by Hecht to publicize the Holocaust; it was
produced by Billy Rose and directed by Moss Hart, featured a musical
score by composer Kurt Weill and starred actors Paul Muni, Edward G.
Robinson and Stella Adler. Its two opening performances at Madison
Square Garden drew audiences of more than 40,000. When it was staged
in Washington, D.C., attendees included First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt
and several hundred members of Congress, as well as members of the
Cabinet, Supreme Court justices and prominent diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   The Emergency Committee maintained that there were many steps the
U.S. could take to help the Jews in Europe, such as pressuring
Hungary and other countries to permit Jewish emigration and urging
the British to open the gates of Palestine to Jewish refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Bergson's approach was directly at odds with the Roosevelt
administration's position that nothing could be done until the Allies
defeated the Nazis. Bergson placed full-page ads in newspapers across
the country with headlines such as "Action, Not Pity, Can Save
Millions Now" and "This Is Strictly a Race Against Death!" The names
of celebrities in the Emergency Committee's newspaper ads helped draw
attention to the cause. Then as now, the public and media paid
attention when a movie star or entertainer spoke out on an issue,
even if he or she had no expertise on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   With Hollywood's help, Bergson publicized the Holocaust and
channeled the publicity into congressional action. By the autumn of
1943, the campaign had generated enough sympathy on Capitol Hill for
U.S. Sen. Guy Gillette (D-Iowa) and Rep. Will Rogers Jr., a
California Democrat, to introduce a resolution urging the creation of
a government agency to rescue Jews from Hitler. The hearings on the
resolution cast unflattering light on the Roosevelt administration's
indifference to the Holocaust. Fortuitously, they coincided with an
effort by Treasury Department officials to press FDR on the rescue
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt, embarrassed by the publicity and anxious to head off a
potential scandal on the eve of an election year, preempted Congress
by establishing the rescue agency that the resolution was requesting
-- the War Refugee Board. Although understaffed and underfunded, the
board initiated a series of rescue actions in 1944-1945 that saved an
estimated 200,000 lives. Many in Hollywood could feel justly proud of
their role in helping to bring about the only meaningful U.S.
government response to the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty years ago, some of the biggest names in Hollywood urged
their nation to intervene when an evil dictator invaded neighboring
countries and sought to slaughter millions of Jews. Today, another
evil dictator menaces his neighbors and seeks the destruction of the
Jews -- yet now many Hollywood celebrities are urging the U.S. to
refrain from intervening.</TE>

<HD>Prop. 51 Helps Pave the Way to Greater Traffic Safety</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Dana Rose</AU>
<BD>Dana Rose is the state coordinator for the California
Safe Kids Campaign, a part of the UC Davis Medical Center's Trauma
Prevention Program.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Proposition 51, the safe-roads measure, rightly sets spending
priorities by using just 30% of the car sales tax we already pay to
make traffic safety improvements. It would fix our most dangerous
roads, replace unsafe school buses and ease our most congested
traffic bottlenecks.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,000 school buses used every day in California don't
meet 1977 federal safety standards. Thousands of additional school
buses spew out diesel exhaust fumes that can seep inside, risking
asthma and other health problems.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 51 also would improve the safety of bicycle and
walking paths and provide funds to enforce reduced speed limits near
schools.</LD>
<TE>   Traffic congestion would be relieved not only by providing highway
expansion at the worst bottlenecks but also by greatly expanding bus
and light-rail service to get people out of their cars and off the
roads. Some of the new transportation projects planned are:</TE>
<TE>   * the Exposition Boulevard light-rail line;</TE>
<TE>   * a connection between the El Monte busway and the Harbor Freeway;</TE>
<TE>   * traffic congestion relief along the Ventura Freeway, including
bus rapid transit, traffic light synchronization along parallel roads
and safety improvements;</TE>
<TE>   * new rapid bus service to LAX and service in the San Fernando
Valley and elsewhere;</TE>
<TE>   * extension of light rail east of Pasadena;</TE>
<TE>   * a 405 Freeway carpool lane over the Sepulveda Pass.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 51 also provides funds to reduce air and water
pollution from cars and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   It is supported by hundreds of public interest groups, including
the California Safe Kids Network, the California Nurses Assn., the
California Lung Assn. and the California Organization of Police and
Sheriffs.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure strict accountability, Proposition 51 contains taxpayer
safeguards that require annual audits by an independent citizen
commission.</TE>
<TE>   Administrative overhead is limited to 2% of the funds spent.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear that we must do more to reduce traffic congestion,
improve highway safety and make school transportation much safer.</TE>
<TE>   By using just 30% of the sales tax on cars now, we can avoid
future tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   And using an existing car tax to pay for these transportation and
safety programs simply makes sense.</TE>

<HD>Guatemala Opens Its Ears</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Suddenly norteamericano leaders are disparaging a small Central
American nation, and, oddly, the people there are glad.</LD>
<LD>   Rampant corruption and the spread of organized crime threaten to
cripple Guatemala, said John Hamilton, former U.S. ambassador to
Peru, at a hearing this month on his nomination as ambassador to the
Central American nation. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) warned
about the troubling deterioration of individual freedoms in
Guatemala. On Oct. 10, Otto Reich, assistant secretary of State for
Western Hemisphere affairs, criticized the administration of
Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo for its "lack of political
will" to advance the stalled 1996 peace accords between the
government and insurgents.</LD>
<LD>   By all accounts, since Portillo took office in December 1999,
corruption has increased dramatically. According to Reich's testimony
before a House subcommittee, "Narcotics trafficking and alien
smuggling are on the rise in Guatemala. Some of the leaders of these
activities have very close ties to the highest levels of government
and regularly influence decisions, especially with respect to
personnel nominations in the military and the ministry of
government." These are grave accusations that Portillo cannot afford
to ignore.</LD>
<TE>   Those old enough to remember the CIA-sponsored coup against the
legitimate government of Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954 may be
surprised at the positive reaction there to Washington's criticism of
the country. "The United States has joined the cause of those inside
Guatemala who are concerned with the current and future state of
Guatemalan democracy," read an editorial in Prensa Libre, the
country's largest newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has already told Congress that it wants to
pursue a new free-trade agreement with five nations of Central
America. Negotiations could begin as early as December. Costa Rica
and El Salvador are guiding the deal in the isthmus. The elections of
credible presidents in Nicaragua and Honduras signal that both of
those countries are moving in the right direction. The biggest
problem in the region is Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. wants to work with Guatemala to root out corruption, but
nothing can be done if President Portillo does not proceed more
aggressively. He must implement the National Anti-Corruption Plan
developed by the World Bank. He must convince his own party and the
opposition to pass legislation on corruption and transparency. In the
wake of Reich's comments, Portillo has announced measures to address
corruption. Much more needs to be done.</TE>
<TE>   The criticism against Portillo comes from right, left and center
and resonates both in the U.S. and Guatemala. He needs to listen.</TE>

<HD>A Bell Rings in Indonesia</HD>
<DH>Bali bombing shows that Megawati must confront the
extremist threat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mass murder has a way of rousing a nation from denial. Since the
ouster of President Suharto in 1998, Indonesia has struggled toward
democracy and labored to decide the role of Islam in the world's most
populous Muslim nation. Moderate Islamic political parties that want
to maintain the nation as a secular state push from one side; radical
groups that hope to institute rule by Islamic law push from the
other. Islamic extremists, some linked to Al Qaeda, lurk in cities
and villages.</LD>
<LD>   Neighboring nations such as Malaysia and Singapore have echoed the
United States in warning that this mix is explosive, but since taking
office 15 months ago President Megawati Sukarnoputri has been timid
about confronting the extremist threat.</LD>
<LD>   Then, 11 days ago on the Indonesian island of Bali, bombs killed
nearly 200, at least seven of the dead believed to be Americans,
along with many more Australian tourists. Finally the government is
awake.</LD>
<TE>   Last weekend, police arrested the man who experts say incites the
most religious violence in Indonesia. Abu Bakar Bashir was in a
hospital, admitted a day earlier for treatment of "exhaustion."
Apparently, Bashir's delivery of a Friday sermon and prayer for the
good health of Osama bin Laden had tired him out.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir has not been directly tied to the Bali bombing, but he
could have much to say about the workings of the Islamic extremist
group Jemaah Islamiah (though first he would have to reverse previous
statements and admit that the group exists). Jemaah Islamiah,
suspected in the Oct. 12 blasts, is accused of numerous acts of
violence. For now, authorities are investigating Bashir in the
bombings of Christian churches on Christmas Eve 2000 that killed 19.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorist experts blame a different Muslim group, Laskar Jihad,
for many deaths of Christians on Sulawesi and the Molucca islands,
where fighting between Muslims and Christians has killed at least
1,000 people in three years. After the Bali bombing, Laskar Jihad
announced it was disbanding, a welcome development. Indonesian
officials will have to ensure that the group, many of whose members
fought alongside the moujahedeen in Afghanistan, really does cease
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Megawati late last week also signed two emergency decrees to put
more steel in the country's anti-terrorism laws and to allow the
detention of suspected terrorists for up to six months without trial.</TE>
<TE>   Megawati's father, Sukarno, was a leader of the post-World War II
independence movement and as president struggled to make Islam one of
the pillars of Indonesia without letting it take over the government.
The majority of Muslims in the archipelago have agreed and support
secular rule. Megawati should be more active in seeking support from
these moderates in a campaign against terrorism. The Bali nightclub
bombing was an attack on her and her government, not just foreign
tourists.</TE>

<LD>Word that the Securities and Exchange Commission may be about to slap
Martha Stewart with civil charges is more than grist for the gossip
mills. Stewart's relatively pipsqueak case illustrates the depth and
breadth of the net the agency has cast while investigating
allegations that insiders have been using confidential information,
flaky accounting and other illegal vehicles to take innocent
investors for a ride.</LD>
<LD>   The style maven is accused of profiting from insider information
provided by the founder and chief executive of ImClone Systems, who
last week pleaded guilty to criminal charges. But Stewart's
questionable stock sale is just a high-profile sideshow amid ongoing
SEC investigations into failed dot-coms, media giants, energy
companies, drug manufacturers and investment banks.</LD>
<LD>   As the number and complexity of investigations grow, so does
pressure on the agency's anemic budget. Investor confidence won't be
restored, however, until Americans are convinced that a strong,
well-funded and independent agency is actively policing publicly
traded companies.</LD>
<TE>   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act that Congress passed in the summer began
reviving the SEC by providing a long-overdue surge in funding.
President Bush signed the bill July 30 and used the assembled news
cameras to declare that "corporate misdeeds will be found and
punished." Now the president is refusing to give regulators the money
needed to get the job done. The bill that Bush signed called for the
SEC's fiscal 2003 budget to grow by 77% to $776 million. But the
president now maintains that the SEC can make do with $568 million.
Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who co-authored the act, cautions that
the commission is in danger of being "seriously compromised."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a shortage of lawyers, accountants and examiners
hamstrings the SEC. Computer systems can't digest the complex wave of
data spun off by publicly traded companies. The agency needs money to
strengthen security, rebuild New York City offices destroyed in the
terrorist attacks and fund the much-needed accounting oversight
board.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, investors are still footing the bill for the painful
lack of oversight that led to the string of corporate accounting
scandals in Enron's wake. Bush keeps talking tough, but that, of
course, is cheap: Show us the money.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank you for "Pet Adoption Made Easier by Volunteers at Rescue Web
Site" (Oct. 13). The article draws a good picture of the range and
quality of animals that can be adopted from public and privately
supported animal shelters and of how Web sites can play such an
important and increasing part in adoption programs. Having said that,
I would like to point out that the Los Angeles Animal Services
Department has a state-of-the-art Web site that provides photos and
complete descriptions of all the animals at the six animal shelters:
www.laanimalservices .com.</LD>
<LD>   This site updates its photos and provides "current status"
information on all animals almost instantaneously. In fact, coupled
with an aggressive adoption program, this site is the reason that
animal adoption rates at city shelters have, over recent years,
increased by over 40%. We believe it offers a ray of hope to all
shelter animals waiting to finally be taken home.</LD>

<LD>"Ex-Enron Trader Admits Rigging Energy Market" (Oct. 18) makes one
wonder whether this latest development in the Enron mess will aid
California in reclaiming $9 billion from the energy companies and
whether any or all of that will be returned to the consumers who were
so shamelessly gouged by this manufactured energy crisis. Each month
when I pay my Edison bill (last month's was nearly $600), I am
reminded of how blatantly the energy industry has caused us to pay
for the malfeasance of others. I can't help wondering just how long
we're going to have to continue paying for it.</LD>

<LD>In "Winning Hearts and Minds of the Europeans," (Opinion, Oct. 20),
Seth Gitell assures himself smugly: "I felt I had done something of
at least partial value by articulating the American point of view."</LD>
<LD>   Let's get one thing straight. This paranoid, aggressive,
confrontational foreign policy that sees a military solution to every
problem is not "the American point of view" but rather the view of
the Bush administration.</LD>
<LD>   The subtext of Gitell's piece, clearly, is that if you do not
endorse George W. Bush's foreign policy you are un-American. I, along
with the tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands who will take to the
streets Oct. 26 (to demonstrate our adamant opposition to the
unprovoked invasion of a sovereign country), take offense to that
charge.</LD>
<TE>   Poll after poll shows Americans to be deeply ambivalent about the
prospect of a unilateral invasion in the absence of any U.N. mandate.</TE>
<TE>   Before going off to "win the hearts and minds" of the Europeans,
Gitell should acknowledge that millions of hearts and minds will have
to be won on this side of the Atlantic first. Until the Bush
administration proves that Iraq, which has been successfully
contained for over a decade, poses some clear and present danger to
the U.S., this invasion will be remembered above all for its
heartlessness and mindlessness.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Preventive Attacks Fail Test of History," Opinion, Oct. 20:
There is no evidence that Saddam Hussein is susceptible to Western
influence. To threats, yes. To persuasion by reason, no. There is
ample evidence that U.S. intervention in South Vietnam, however ill
advised, however ill directed, did win time for self-strengthening in
Southeast Asia and the end of Maoist aggressiveness in China, thus
helping to prevent the rest of the region's sharing the bloodbath of
Cambodia.</TE>

<TE>   I am shocked by Michael Ramirez's Oct. 20 editorial cartoon.
Implying that a very reasonable U.N. resolution could have the same
consequences for France and the world as the appeasement policy
toward Hitler in the 1930s is ridiculous. Comparing today's Iraq and
its two-bit despot, Hussein, to Hitler's Germany shows a poor
knowledge of history. Iraq is a poor, divided country with low
scientific and industrial skills. Hitler's Germany was a scientific
and industrial powerhouse. Add to this the Germanic sense of
discipline and organization and you got an almost invincible war
machine. Had France's enemy been Iraq, France would have won the war
in May 1940.</TE>

<LD>Contrary to Jill Stewart's account, the demise of the alternative
weekly New Times Los Angeles wasn't because of post-Sept. 11
advertising cuts or Angelenos' dislike of the paper's so-called
"hard-hitting" reporting (Opinion, Oct. 20). The truth is much
simpler: The paper's readers got tired of finding each week yet
another shrill, slanted and often inaccurate expose combined with
weak-to-nonexistent entertainment and arts coverage. Who wants to
read that? No one does, which is why New Times is no more.</LD>

<TE>   Thank you for running Stewart's story. The loss of a relentless,
take-no-prisoners, investigative alternative paper like New Times Los
Angeles inflicts a kind of a journalistic lobotomy on the L.A.
metropolitan region. Consider this a formal request to The Times to
step up to the plate, break with tradition, take a few New
Times-style risks and start annoying our local herd of sacred cows.
Earn your 50 cents.</TE>

<LD>Re "Restaurant Grades Get High Marks," Oct. 17: More information can
be found at www .lapublichealth.org/rating. Not only does it list the
current grade, but you can also click on "more info" to read a list
of the violations; e.g., not maintained clean, wiping rag, hazardous
material/chemicals. The site also shows the inspection history. We
check the site before we eat out and we patronize only the ones with
an A rating. Even if a restaurant has an A, it still depends on the
violations; we avoid restaurants that constantly are in the low 90s.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Calls for Assistance Hung Up in Overburdened 911 System" (Oct. 19)
misses the point of the 911 service. The 911 number is only for
life-threatening emergencies or any time life or property is in
immediate danger, such as in a fire or a burglary in progress. While
I empathize with the gentleman who is frustrated about the dirt bike
riders, I sympathize with people who cannot get a 911 operator to
help them with their life-threatening medical condition or violent
crime in progress because that gentleman and others are jamming the
911 lines with nonemergencies.</LD>
<LD>   Nowhere does the article explain to the readers when the
appropriate times are to call 911. It is not a 911 operator's
responsibility to counsel people when they don't know whom to call
for a nonemergency situation, and it is completely unacceptable that
people continue to call 911 even after they know it is the wrong
number to call. If people only called 911 for appropriate situations,
the 911 system would be less overburdened and response times would be
faster because the callers would not have to wait as long to get an
operator.</LD>

<TE>   We recently had an incident trying to reach 911. Several ladies
and I were leaving a friend's house in Brentwood. One of our ladies
is quite elderly and she happened to leave first. When the rest of us
opened the front door to leave, she was sprawled on the flagstone
walkway bleeding profusely from her head and not moving. We quickly
called 911 and it rang and rang for many minutes with no answer. We
then called an operator on another line and, although she tried, she
could not get through. We decided that I would get into my car and
drive to the nearest fire station, which fortunately was only a
couple of blocks away. They responded immediately and transported our
friend to the UCLA emergency room. This situation could have been a
matter of life and death.</TE>
<TE>   It is not just the LAPD that does not respond. What happens if you
need paramedics and you do not live near a fire station? It's a sad
commentary when you have to drive yourself to get help in an
emergency.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Overreaction to News Leak" (editorial, Oct. 19), on the planned
incarceration of whistle-blower Robert Mullally, was absolutely
correct in reminding readers that the greater good that came out of
Mullally's action necessitated some leniency in terms of how he
should be treated for violating U.S. District Judge William D.
Keller's court order.</LD>
<LD>   Mullally's actions in exposing how the Los Angeles Police
Department treats domestic violence in its ranks were heroic and
provided a tremendous public service to those who are protected,
served and policed by officers in this department, including those
who may have committed acts of domestic violence, sexual assault or
child abuse against their own family members.</LD>
<LD>   Because of Mullally's actions, the LAPD was forced to crack down
on officers who committed these crimes, which led to the arrests of
at least half a dozen of them after Mullally's revelations became
public.</LD>
<TE>   Ironically, he may serve more time in prison than any one of these
officers who committed a violent act, and that is a travesty of
justice -- and a reminder that when it comes to those in law
enforcement, too often it seems that they remain above the laws, and
that when any misconduct among them is exposed, the judicial system
continues to respond by trying to kill the messenger.</TE>

<TE>   Speaking as a "right coast" person, I want to let you know that
the LAPD's reputation in this part of the country is much like
Hollywood's. Is this stuff for real?</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial properly suggests that jail time is not appropriate
for someone who unmasked the rampant cover-ups of police domestic
violence in the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   But the question remains: Who at central casting picked that lulu
federal judge who thinks a court order is more important than
justice?</TE>

<LD>Re "State Poet Overstated His Case," Oct. 19: I would say that Quincy
Troupe, California's first formally selected poet laureate -- who
resigned Friday after acknowledging he had taken a bit of poetic
license on his professional resume, stating, "I deeply regret my
ill-advised decision to include inaccurate information on my
curriculum vitae" -- was being rather equivocal. I think a simple
"I'm sorry I lied" would have sufficed.</LD>

<HD>Former Principal Arrested in Theft</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former principal at St. Philip the Apostle Catholic School in
Pasadena has been arrested for allegedly embezzling more than
$200,000 from the school before leaving her job last February.</LD>
<LD>   Shelly Ann Randall, 51, of Sierra Madre, has posted $90,000 bail
and faces an initial court hearing Nov. 20 on one count of grand
theft embezzlement, according to Pasadena police and the pastor of
the Church of St. Philip the Apostle.</LD>
<LD>   The pastor, Father Joseph Moniz, and the head of the school's
Parent Teacher Student Organization, Colleen Welch, in an interview
Tuesday said this was one of the most disappointing experiences of
their lives.</LD>
<TE>   "We noticed several questionable transactions on the books after
she left," Moniz said. "We contacted the Pasadena police, who
conducted their own investigation, leading to her arrest last
Friday."</TE>
<TE>   Welch said Randall, a UC Berkeley graduate and former teacher, had
been "welcomed with open arms" when she arrived from the Bay Area to
become principal in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, the parents are shellshocked and feel betrayed," she
said. "We trusted her to run a fine school for our children."</TE>
<TE>   Moniz said, however, that he would delay a final judgment until a
crime had been proved.</TE>
<TE>   Randall could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, Moniz and the current principal, Jennifer
Ramirez, told parents of the alleged embezzlement and steps taken to
make sure it would not happen again.</TE>
<TE>   Moniz said that in the future, checks will require two signatures;
all bank statements will be checked by the principal in the presence
of a third party; an accounting professional will be hired as
bookkeeper; and a certified public accountant will conduct regular
audits.</TE>
<TE>   All expenditures in excess of $3,000 will have to be approved by
the pastor.</TE>
<TE>   The school, with 441 students, has an annual budget of about $2
million and has served the Pasadena community for more than 75 years.
The school tries to raise $150,000 a year in charitable contributions
to help with tuitions, Welch said.</TE>

<HD>Robert Beyers, 71; Spokesman for Stanford University</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert W. "Bob" Beyers, veteran spokesman for Stanford University who
was both controversial and admired for his candor, has died. He was
71.</LD>
<LD>   Beyers, who was director of the Stanford University News Service
from 1961 until the end of 1989, died Friday at his Palo Alto home of
pancreatic cancer.</LD>
<LD>   His frank reports about minority enrollment and hiring on the
conservative campus, tidbits about academic studies ranging from
aardvarks to zymurgy and admissions that yes, the band had been
"dropping pants ... on the field" after football games endeared
Beyers to students, faculty and the news media.</LD>
<TE>   That candor, or perhaps his attitude about ignoring what he called
"administrivia," did not always make him popular with administrators.
Beyers resigned after 29 years, saying he had been pressured by some
of Stanford's top officials to sanitize negative news stories. Not
so, insisted those who asked him to step aside, attributing their
dissatisfaction to Beyers' poor management.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 1989, amid the controversy, Beyers agreed to have
his operation examined by John Burness, Cornell's vice president of
university relations and a longtime friend. Burness' 10-page report
recommended that Beyers "step aside as director of the news service
and be relieved of all management responsibility" but also praised
him as a "national treasure" and "the most knowledgeable and prolific
reporter on education issues to be found in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Beyers' full disclosure practices were so unusual in his line of
work that his "early retirement" from Stanford at age 58 prompted a
front-page Wall Street Journal feature story indicating he was
punished for being a "blabbermouthpiece."</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City, Beyers graduated from Cornell. He worked
briefly at newspapers in Texas and Michigan, but spent most of his
career in public relations -- for the U.S. National Student Assn.,
the University of Michigan News Service and then Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   He helped create the Stanford Observer alumni newspaper and the
Stanford Report for faculty and administration.</TE>
<TE>   From 1974 until his death, he served as a trustee, and from 1986
to 1997 as board chairman, of Editorial Projects in Education, which
founded such publications as the Chronicle of Higher Education,
Education Week and Teacher magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Off-duty, Beyers applied his journalistic talents to civil rights
and other social issues. During the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer,
he volunteered to coordinate media and police relations for the
Council of Federated Organizations. In recent years, he worked with
his wife, Charlotte, to produce 12 documentary videos on such
problems as AIDS, homeless teenagers and drugs, and also volunteered
as associate editor for Pacific News Service in Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Beyers is survived by three children from
a prior marriage, William, Robby and Amy; four stepchildren, Pam
Kivelson, Nancy Stewart, Alan Davis and Cynthia Kanner, and 13
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A service is scheduled for 4 p.m. Jan. 6 in Stanford's Memorial
Church.</TE>

<HD>Police Find Guns Near Blake's Home</HD>
<DH>One of the weapons found in a barn behind the actor's house
may have been used to solicit his wife's murder, according to police.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two .38-caliber revolvers, live ammunition and other items were
recently recovered from inside a barn behind Robert Blake's Hidden
Hills home by detectives looking for further evidence implicating the
actor in his wife's murder, according to a police search warrant
affidavit released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles police sought the warrant after a man removing gym
equipment from the barn last Friday discovered one of the guns inside
a wooden box behind a stereo cabinet suspended about seven feet above
the floor.</LD>
<LD>   The man looked into "the box and saw a blue steel gun in a
holster," according to the search warrant. "He also saw a knit hat
and a garment that he thought might be a pair of gloves. [The man]
immediately became nervous and called LAPD."</LD>
<TE>   In the document, police investigators said Blake allegedly showed
a weapon in a zippered holster to the two stuntmen he is accused of
soliciting to murder his wife, adding that "the gun in the barn may
be that gun."</TE>
<TE>   "Recovery of that firearm will give us information regarding the
kinds of ammunition that Defendant Blake used and the sources of
Defendant Blake's firearms," Det. Ron Ito wrote in the search warrant
affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   "The discovery of the box in the barn leads me to believe that the
Hidden Hills house may yet contain documents or photographs which
pertain to Defendant Blake's plot to ... kill his wife," Ito
continued. "I believe it is likely that the clothing in the box
contains gunshot residue or other trace evidence relating to the
murder."</TE>
<TE>   Items recovered in the search include two .38-caliber revolvers,
11 bullets, a holster, leggings, steel wool, an oil can, Teflon
lubricant, a videotape, checks, a 22-inch metal bar with a black
handle, and the will of Blake's daughter, Delinah.</TE>
<TE>   Police declined to comment on the search warrant and its contents.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, was fatally shot inside the
actor's car on May 4, 2001, a few blocks from Vitello's restaurant in
Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   Blake told police he left Bakley in the car and returned to the
restaurant after dinner to retrieve a handgun he had left behind.
When he returned to the car, he said, he found Bakley bleeding from
the head.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley was killed with a World War II-vintage German pistol, an
unregistered Walther P-38, found in a dumpster about 10 feet from
where Blake's car was parked the night of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The weapon had no fingerprints and was covered in fresh motor oil,
according to earlier affidavits. The one bullet left in the gun
matched two casings found in and near the car.</TE>
<TE>   Since the murder, police have issued more than a dozen warrants to
search Blake's property or that of his co-defendant in the case,
Earle Caldwell.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's defense attorney, Harland W. Braun, refused to comment
Tuesday on the items recovered in the most recent search of Blake's
Hidden Hills property.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the state Supreme Court has yet to rule on a petition
by Blake's attorneys to overturn a judge's decision to deny bail for
the 69-year-old actor.</TE>
<TE>   Although prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty, they are
charging Blake with the special circumstance of lying in wait, and
the judge denied bail based on that allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights attorney Paul L. Hoffman and Braun argued in a
25-page petition that prosecutors had not shown clear and convincing
evidence for the special circumstance allegation.</TE>

<HD>Checkpoint Hours Will Be Reduced</HD>
<DH>Border Patrol will scale back at San Clemente and Temecula
sites, where illegal-immigrant apprehensions are down 90%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with sharp declines in illegal-immigrant apprehensions at
checkpoints in San Clemente and Temecula, the Bush administration has
agreed to scale back operating hours at the Border Patrol facilities.</LD>
<LD>   The decision marks a victory for Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista) and
other local officials, who have been trying for years to shut down
both checkpoints. They argue that the checkpoints are ineffective and
that agents could be better used at the border or tracking down
illegal immigrants elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Issa said the agreement reached earlier this month over operating
hours is the first step in eventually closing down both checkpoints.</LD>
<TE>   Under the agreement, the checkpoints -- on Interstate 5 just south
of San Clemente and on Interstate 15 in Temecula -- will no longer be
required to be open around the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Border Patrol officials now will have the authority to
deploy the about 245 agents assigned to both checkpoints to other
enforcement efforts such as dealing with immigrants charged with
crimes in the U.S. Some agents will also be used to set up mobile
checkpoints in remote areas closer to the border and alongside roads
used by smugglers to transport illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "The checkpoints have proven to be less effective as the years
have gone by," said Issa.</TE>
<TE>   Agents assigned to the facilities should instead concentrate on
arresting illegal immigrants and tracking down the 8.5 million
undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., he said.</TE>
<TE>   "These should be the first areas [the Border Patrol] should
concentrate on. We have to look at how to best use a very scarce
resource," Issa said. "In the spirit of compromise, the Border Patrol
is willing to go in the direction of what's a priority for my
district."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1996, the checkpoints were supposed to be in operation for
24 hours, but the realities of Southern California traffic and
weather conditions made it impossible for the Border Patrol to meet
that requirement. An investigation by the Justice Department
inspector general found that during a five-month period that year the
San Clemente facility did inspections on a 24-hour basis on only 22
of the 150 days studied.</TE>
<TE>   The checkpoints' limited hours of operation have led to 90%
declines in illegal-immigrant apprehensions at San Clemente and
Temecula since 1994, according to Border Patrol figures.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the plummeting number of apprehensions, a Border Patrol
spokesman in San Diego said there are no immediate plans to dismantle
the checkpoints. Ben Bauman said agents at the facilities "will
devote less time to the interstate checkpoints and more in areas
where our intelligence system says we'll do more good."</TE>
<TE>   Bauman said the congressional provision that the checkpoints be
operational 24 hours actually makes it difficult for Border Patrol
officials to use agents more effectively in areas around the
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Managers at the checkpoints don't have the discretion of
deploying agents to temporary checkpoints on side roads because of
the provision that [the facilities] be operational 24 hours," Bauman
said. "Money and agents haven't been available for these tactical
deployments."</TE>
<TE>   Operating hours at the checkpoints will be scaled back as soon as
Congress approves funding legislation for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which could happen later this year or in
early 2003.</TE>

<HD>Last of 3 Wild Condor Chicks Is Found Dead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite high expectations and intensive monitoring, a new generation
of California condors born in the wild became officially extinct
Tuesday, when the last of three chicks was found dead in a remote
sandstone cave.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death is unknown, but wildlife officials say the
chick's demise is a blow to the $35-million program aimed at
reintroducing North America's largest bird to the wild.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an emotional loss and more of a step backward than we
wanted," said Bruce Palmer, coordinator of the California Condor
Recovery Program for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "We wanted
these fledglings out there, but we never would have guessed that we
would have had three chicks this year."</LD>
<TE>   The birds were the offspring of adults raised in captivity and
later released. Biologists hoped the chicks would be the start of a
new generation of condors uncontaminated by human contact. Before
these chicks hatched, it had been 18 years since a condor was born in
the wild.</TE>
<TE>   The chicks, which lived in separate caves in Los Padres National
Forest, were all about 5 months old and on the verge of flying when
the first one died three weeks ago. The second died last week and the
third was found Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Although the first bird's cause of death remains undetermined, the
second chick had numerous foreign objects in its stomach and gizzard.
During a necropsy at the San Diego Zoo, pathologists found 12 bottle
caps, shards of glass, electrical fixtures, screws and washers inside
the turkey-sized chick.</TE>

<LD>Despite high expectations and intensive monitoring, a new generation

<TE>   The birds were the offspring of adults raised in captivity and
later released. Biologists hoped the chicks would be the start of a
new generation of condors born free and uncontaminated by human
contact. Before these chicks hatched, it had been 18 years since a
condor was born in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   The chicks, which lived in separate caves in Los Padres National
Forest, were all about 5 months old and on the verge of flying when
the first one died three weeks ago. The second died last week and the
third was found Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Although the first bird's cause of death remains undetermined, the
second chick had numerous foreign objects in its stomach and gizzard.
During a necropsy at the San Diego Zoo, pathologists found 12 bottle
caps, shards of glass, electrical fixtures, screws and washers inside
the turkey-sized chick.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists found more bottle caps inside the chick's cave, along
with springs, washers and glass. Palmer said the second bird clearly
died from swallowing the metal. He also said biologists found similar
objects near the spot where the first chick died.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably an old nest site used by other birds," Palmer
said. "Ravens are known for picking up small, shiny items and
bringing them back. The supposition is that the chick picked them off
the floor of the cave."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that condors, curious by nature, also like playing with
small objects. The chick's parents could have brought them to the
cave.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one more thing to enter into the challenges we are facing,"
Palmer said. "I have no idea how you protect against this."</TE>
<TE>   One idea under consideration is putting video cameras at nest
sites so biologists can monitor activity 24 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   The third chick is thought to have died Monday. A biologist
watching the nest saw one of the parents drag the carcass out of the
cave. It was recovered by biologists Tuesday and will be sent to the
San Diego Zoo for necropsy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sad day for everyone involved," said Marc Weitzel, who
supervises the condor recovery program in Southern California. "[But]
having had three chicks laid and hatched in the wild this year is
still a great success for the program."</TE>
<TE>   Over the 20 years of the condor captive breeding program, the huge
birds have died from lead poisoning, crashing into electric lines,
hitting power poles, drinking antifreeze and now from eating trash.</TE>
<TE>   There are 75 condors living in the wild and 126 in captivity. The
goal of the program is to establish two populations of 150 birds each
in California and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need are enough birds out there so that when these things
happen they can weather it," Palmer said.</TE>

<HD>Study Faults State on Child Issues</HD>
<DH>California is found to lag most states in various measures
of providing for its youth.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>Despite high levels of wealth, California compares poorly with many
other states in providing adequate education, health care and
economic security for young children and their families, according to
a study by the advocacy group Children Now.</LD>
<LD>   The annual California Report Card to be released today by the
Oakland-based group found that the state ranked 33rd among states and
the District of Columbia in public school expenditures per student,
last in student/counselor ratio, had the third-highest rate of
juveniles incarcerated and the eighth-highest rate of child poverty.</LD>
<LD>   In other measures -- based on census and other government data --
just over half of California's 3- and 4-year-olds attended preschool
in 2000 compared with two-thirds nationwide; 41% were enrolled in
Head Start programs compared to 58% nationwide.</LD>
<TE>   In 26 of 34 education, health, family economics and safety
measures where comparable national figures were available, California
ranked below the national average.</TE>
<TE>   The state was 34th in the percentage of children receiving early
childhood immunizations. It also fared worse than the national
average in the percentage of children under 18 who experience hunger
or food insecurity (18% nationally versus 23% in California) and the
percentage of eligible children served by federal school lunch
programs (90% nationally versus 71% here).</TE>
<TE>   California is making headway in some areas. It has the
sixth-lowest rate of infant mortality and the ninth-lowest rate of
low birth weight babies. The teenage birth rate is falling slightly
faster here than the national average, and fewer children here are
dying or being hurt in motor vehicle accidents (the California rate
is 4.9 fatalities per 100,000 compared to 7.0 nationally).</TE>
<TE>   In examining reasons for the gaps, the report concluded that the
state "has not made young children a top priority.... The data
illustrate that California's young children are growing up in
circumstances that demand our attention and action."</TE>
<TE>   The report said California lags despite Proposition 10, a 1998
initiative by actor and director Rob Reiner that dedicates a portion
of tobacco taxes to improving early childhood development. The
measure generated about $650 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a tendency to look to Proposition 10 and say 'There's our
spending on young children,' " said Children Now Vice President Amy
Dominguez-Arms, who co-wrote the report.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an important pocket of funds, but it's small in comparison
to needs of the state," she added. "Six hundred million in annual
revenues compared to a $100-billion state budget is not much."</TE>
<TE>   The report also noted how difficult it is for some families to
provide the best for their children. About 25% of youngsters in the
state live in families in which at least one parent works 50 weeks a
year but still meet federal guidelines for a low-income family (an
income of less than $28,300 for a family of three).</TE>
<TE>   Another child-friendly measure on this year's November ballot --
Proposition 49 sponsored by film star Arnold Schwarzenegger -- would
require the state to use up to $550 million in general fund revenues
to pay for before- and after-school programs for elementary and
junior high school students.</TE>
<TE>   State officials said they had not had a chance to read the report
thoroughly but cited areas in it showing improvement, including a
trend toward fewer children in foster care (8.3 children under 18 per
1,000 in 2000 compared to 9.8 in 1998).</TE>
<TE>   The state also has hiked spending on child care to about $3
billion a year, said Bruce Wagstaff, deputy director of welfare
programs for the state Department of Social Services. Funding of
other child welfare programs topped $2 billion, he said.</TE>

<HD>An Original Script for Making History Fun</HD>
<DH>Fifth-graders say they enjoy the usually dry subject more
when they act in teacher's plays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Duke Helfand</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most students learn American history by reading dry textbooks. The
fifth-graders at Marquez Charter School learn history by performing
it.</LD>
<LD>   Inside their school auditorium in Pacific Palisades, these 9- and
10-year-olds last week were rehearsing "Miracle in Philadelphia," a
musical co-written by their teacher about the Constitutional
Convention of 1787.</LD>
<LD>   "Hear ye, hear ye," proclaimed Wyn Delano, playing the part of
George Washington at the meeting of delegates. "The first question we
face is: Do we try to repair the Articles of Confederation, or do we
start discussing a new system of government?"</LD>
<TE>   It's been 215 years since Washington started the nation down the
path toward the government we now know. But Wyn and his classmates
say that history springs to life when they reenact the raucous
debates that produced the Constitution and sing Broadway-like numbers
about those seminal meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "The lines make you feel like you're really debating in the
Philadelphia State House," Wyn explained. "We're learning about the
biggest moment in our country's history. It shaped who we are today."</TE>
<TE>   Similar connections occur when the fifth-graders perform two other
musicals written by Marquez's fifth-grade teacher Jeff Lantos and his
friend, composer Bill Augustine.</TE>
<TE>   The public performances of "Miracle" in December, with students in
costumes and wigs, will mark the seventh year that Lantos has staged
the play. In March, the fifth-graders will put on "Hello Louisiana"
about the Louisiana Purchase and the Lewis and Clark expedition into
the nation's new frontier. In June, they'll do "Water and Power"
about the Industrial Revolution and the struggle for workers' rights.</TE>
<TE>   Lantos, who combines a love of history with a background in music
and theater, wrote the book and lyrics for the plays; he took much of
the dialogue in "Miracle" from the historical record or from
published letters. He and Augustine, a jazz pianist, donated their
works to Marquez, but earn small fees if other schools perform them.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez's fifth-graders also learn history the traditional way
four days a week--reading textbooks, taking tests, writing reports.
On Wednesday mornings, however, they put their books aside and
descend upon the school auditorium to take another turn playing out
the muggy summer of 1787.</TE>
<TE>   "It's stealth learning," Lantos said of his plays. "The rewards
are great--the enthusiasm, the retention of the material."</TE>
<TE>   For example, in one song about the virtues of the Constitution,
the students sing:</TE>
<TE>   It separates the powers,</TE>
<TE>   'N unifies the states,</TE>
<TE>   The feeble federal government,</TE>
<TE>   It rehabilitates.</TE>
<TE>   Say goodbye to weakness,</TE>
<TE>   Say goodbye to fear,</TE>
<TE>   We'll defend our people,</TE>
<TE>   Out on the frontier.</TE>
<TE>   Acting out history has turned 9-year-old Jacob Witten, who
portrays Patrick Henry, on to history for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to dread social studies because it was so boring," he
said. "But now I look forward to Wednesdays because we get play
practice. It's history, only it's 20,000 times more interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Ten-year-old Dylan Palladino put it this way: "It's like going
back in time and seeing what happened in America."</TE>
<TE>   Lantos and his co-director, fellow teacher Michelle Conn, have
plenty of admirers, including a group of researchers from UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   A UCLA study this year found that Lantos' students retain more
information about American history than their peers from nearby
schools.</TE>
<TE>   The university researchers gave a history test to sixth-graders at
Paul Revere Middle School who had come from Marquez and other feeder
elementary schools.</TE>
<TE>   The Marquez students got the highest scores. The researchers
looked into various possible reasons and statistical flukes and
concluded, with much praise, that Lantos' program was the primary
cause for the students' achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "It remains to be seen whether a larger-scale implementation would
yield the same effects if Mr. Lantos were not the lead teacher. But
clearly, a larger-scale implementation and evaluation is warranted,"
wrote the group from UCLA's psychology department.</TE>
<TE>   Lantos' students can throw out historical facts the way other kids
spout off baseball scores.</TE>
<TE>   They can tell you, for example, that the Constitution replaced the
Articles of Confederation, which had granted independence to each
state and did not give Congress the authority to collect taxes or
solve many national problems.</TE>
<TE>   They also can tell you how the large and small states argued over
power and how delegates from Connecticut, led by Roger Sherman, put
forward the compromise that resolved the impasse. It led to two
legislative houses--one based on equal representation for each state
( the Senate) and the other based on proportional representation (the
House of Representatives).</TE>
<TE>   And they can tell you how the delegates from the Northern and
Southern states fought over issues of slavery, finally deciding that
slaves would count as three-fifths of a person in the total for a
state's representation. The Southern delegates wanted to count each
slave as a full person to boost their states' numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best way for a kid to learn," said Katie Lantz, 10,
who plays Benjamin Franklin. "When you do it, you understand how it
actually happened."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Wednesday morning, Katie and her classmates rehearsed
"Miracle in Philadelphia." Most of the students were wearing shorts
or jeans and T-shirts. Almost all had scripts in hand as they ran
through the play.</TE>
<TE>   Lantos coached them through their lines and accompanied them on
piano as they sang. They looked and sounded like a junior version of
a Broadway show.</TE>
<TE>   In the audience, parent Shari Nathan beamed as she watched her
son, Wyn, and the other students perform. Nathan, a professional
clown, had come to give the kids some theatrical pointers.</TE>
<TE>   She said her 8-year-old son, Hero, already knows the songs in the
play because big brother Wyn comes home singing them.</TE>
<TE>   "This play doesn't talk down to the kids or to people in the
audience," Nathan said. "I'm happy as a mom because Wyn is learning
that anything good in life is worth fighting for. He's actually going
through the process that our forefathers went through."</TE>
<TE>   Lantos' musical curriculum is used by a handful of teachers at
other California schools who have learned about it by word of mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-grade teacher Steve Nairin, who used to teach at Marquez,
will stage "Miracle in Philadelphia" next spring at Superior Street
Elementary. It will be the third time Nairin has put the play on at
the Chatsworth campus.</TE>
<TE>   Nairin says his students aren't the only ones who benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "It has taught me a lot more about the Constitutional Convention.
I didn't know about all the verbal battles back and forth" between
the Founding Fathers, he said. "It has made me a better teacher. I
wish I had this when I was a kid."</TE>

<HD>Student, 20, Gets Probation in Crash That Killed 2 Friends</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During an emotional court hearing Tuesday, a 20-year-old Oxnard
College student was sentenced to probation and community service for
causing a crash last year that killed two of her friends.</LD>
<LD>   Sopheak "Sophie" Riem dabbed tears from her eyes and smiled as she
left the courtroom. About two dozen supporters, including her
parents, had clapped loudly in court after Riem was spared jail time.</LD>
<LD>   Riem said she was thankful for the support.</LD>
<TE>   She was ordered to spend three years on supervised probation and
perform 200 hours of community service.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tragic thing that has happened," said Deputy Dist. Atty.
Anita Patel, "but I think under the circumstances I agree with the
court's decision."</TE>
<TE>   Although Superior Court Judge Edward Brodie could have ordered
Riem to serve two years in state prison, he said he believed she did
not intend to injure anyone on the day of the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Brodie said that 90% of the population fails to pay attention
while driving, and that even on his way to court on Tuesday he had
watched a woman run a red light in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   "You simply lost control of your car," the judge said. "It's a
tragic end to something that probably shouldn't have been."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Todd Howeth, choking back tears, said
dozens of friends, teachers and other supporters had written letters
commenting on Riem's honesty, potential and remorse.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not going to be a day she doesn't think about the
friends she lost," Howeth said, pausing to compose himself.</TE>
<TE>   Riem lives with her parents in Oxnard and plans to attend USC,
where she wants to major in communication.</TE>
<TE>   Late last month, Riem pleaded no contest to charges of vehicular
manslaughter stemming from the crash on June 11, 2001, on the Ventura
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Riem and two friends were headed to a friend's high school
graduation ceremony in Ventura. Authorities believe Riem was speeding
and made an unsafe lane change near Johnson Drive that caused her to
lose control of her car.</TE>
<TE>   It hit a guardrail, skidded off the freeway and landed upside down
on nearby railroad tracks, killing Ana Rosa Uribe, 17, a student at
El Camino High School in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   The other passenger, Lea Casillas, 16, a standout softball player
at Buena High School in Ventura, died later the same day at a local
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Riem spent a week in the hospital with a fractured collarbone and
punctured organs. All three were wearing seat belts at the time of
the crash.</TE>
<TE>   The families of Uribe and Casillas have filed a wrongful death
lawsuit against the state, alleging it failed to maintain the
guardrail. A trial in that case is scheduled for Feb. 24.</TE>

<HD>Lockyer Critical of D.A.'s Actions</HD>
<DH>The state attorney general says Rackauckas' response to a
report from the Orange County Grand Jury invites 'ridicule.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas' actions in response to a
critical grand jury report have "held [his] office and all of law
enforcement up to ridicule," State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said in a
biting letter to the prosecutor.</LD>
<LD>   The letter, sent last week, marks another salvo in a dispute
between the state's top lawman and Orange County's top lawman.</LD>
<LD>   Lockyer's office assisted the grand jury in a civil investigation
that criticized Rackauckas of interfering in cases involving
political supporters and punishing foes in the office, among other
things.</LD>
<TE>   But instead of embracing the grand jury's recommendations,
Rackauckas has repeatedly criticized them, Lockyer said. The attorney
general said he wants to communicate with Rackauckas about taking
"more appropriate" action in response to the grand jury's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Chuck Middleton said: "We received the
attorney general's letter [Tuesday] afternoon. We will engage in
careful review and consideration of his letter and respond in due
course."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's letter, dated Oct. 18, came in response to a request by
the Board of Supervisors that he further examine the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said he was particularly concerned about one aspect of the
report. The grand jury found that the district attorney office's
chief investigator spent more than $4,700 set aside for witness
protection and undercover investigations for food and alcohol during
meetings with lawmakers, lobbyists, the media and others.</TE>
<TE>   The panel recommended that Rackauckas enforce rules created by his
predecessor prohibiting use of the fund for anything other than law
enforcement. Instead, he initially changed the policy to allow
employees to use the fund for lobbying. He then changed his mind and
decided to enforce the policy.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said his initial action "engendered mistrust of public
officials."</TE>
<TE>   "I commend you for making this revision, which I hope you will
keep in effect throughout your administration," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of the lobbying funds prompted a tense debate at the
Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer at first refused to vote on routine grant
requests from the district attorney's office, saying he had "very
serious" concerns about spending by the office. He has urged
Rackauckas to refund the $4,700 his office used for food and drinks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not comfortable supporting anything until we get some answers
to our questions," he said. "Otherwise, we'll keep getting blown
off."</TE>
<TE>   At that point in the meeting, Supervisor Jim Silva accused Spitzer
of "blackmailing" the board and threatened to walk out.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson repeatedly urged Spitzer to reconsider and
vote. Spitzer eventually voted in favor of the measure, which
otherwise would have failed because two members of the five-person
board were absent.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, Silva said: "I agree with Supervisors Spitzer
and Wilson. I have concerns about how county money is spent. But I
don't think you want to jeopardize funding for public safety over an
$18 bottle of wine."</TE>
<TE>   Middleton, of the district attorney's office, said Spitzer never
contacted the office about his concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "It is regrettable that Supervisor Spitzer has elected to
grandstand politically while risking funding for public safety,"
Middleton said. "His pattern of 'ready, fire and aim' has not well
served the citizens of Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas has said the grand jury findings are the result of an
incomplete investigation and were swayed by the testimony of his
political enemies.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Lockyer said Rackauckas' insistence that the grand
jury investigation was motivated by politics "is simply false," and
the assertion that it was influenced by his opponents
"disconcerting."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said last month that he was closing the books on the
investigation into the district attorney's office and concluded that
no crime occurred.</TE>
<TE>   As attorney general, Lockyer has limited supervisory power over
local prosecutors.</TE>

<LD>A couple who met on the job and dreamed of retirement were found
slain late Monday in their bedroom on a tidy cul-de-sac in Santa
Paula.</LD>
<LD>   John M. Ramirez, Jr., 59, and Joann Wotkyns, 55, appear to have
been killed between 10 p.m. Sunday and Monday morning, police said.
An autopsy Tuesday determined Ramirez had been bludgeoned in the
head, Santa Paula Police Chief Bob Gonzales said. Wotkyns' autopsy is
scheduled for today.</LD>
<LD>   There is no evidence either victim had been shot, and it does not
appear one spouse killed the other, Gonzales said.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe that both died within moments of one another,"
Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have not determined a reason for the killings and
have not recovered any weapons used in the slayings. After finding
the bodies, police located Wotkyns' Chevrolet Monte Carlo in the
parking lot of a nearby Kmart store.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors were shocked that the quiet couple who gave away pottery
had died in such a manner. At Imation, the Camarillo computer tape
company where Ramirez and Wotkyns had worked for more than 30 years,
co-workers met with a grief counselor.</TE>
<TE>   After the couple failed to show up for work, police were sent to
the home in the 1000 block of Corte La Brisa. Officers arrived to
find a back door unlocked, and found Ramirez and Wotkyns upstairs on
their bed, Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   The chief said blood was on the bed, walls and carpet. Otherwise,
the house was pristine.</TE>
<TE>   In the couple's Las Pasadastract, neighbors could not recall any
major crimes since the homes started going up in the late 1980s. The
last time one detective could recall visiting the neighborhood was a
decade ago, to investigate an annoying phone call.</TE>
<TE>   Slayings are so rare in the farming town that the police chief can
recite where they occurred and how the victims were killed. Ramirez
and Wotkyns were Santa Paula's third and fourth homicides of 2002.
All four of the Police Department's detectives are working the case,
along with investigators from the Ventura County Sheriff's Department
and the coroner's and district attorney's offices.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez and Wotkyns met at Imation, which makes data cartridges
for computers. They have grown children from previous marriages,
police and neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   Wotkyns, who coordinated training for Imation's workers, was
planning a work-related trip to Tucson this week. Ramirez moved
products around the warehouse. Both talked of retirement.</TE>
<TE>   They were an unusual-looking match -- Joann was about a head
taller than John -- but "they seemed to really gel well together,"
said Steve Schmitz, the plant's operations manager.</TE>
<TE>   At home, she painted ceramic angels, roosters, plates and other
pottery. They had kilns in their garage, said Richard Garland, who
lives next door.</TE>
<TE>   John Ramirez was friendly but not overbearing--"a perfect
neighbor," Garland said.</TE>

<HD>Teen Pleads Guilty in Fatal Beating</HD>
<DH>Ventura resident is the third of four people convicted of
killing a homeless man.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>A 19-year-old Ventura man has pleaded guilty to participating in the
group killing of a homeless man, who was kicked and attacked with
stones last year as he lay in a sleeping bag near the beach.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Dunham, who has been in jail since his arrest last
year, faces 15 years to life in prison when he is sentenced on Jan.
7, a prosecutor said Tuesday. He pleaded guilty to second-degree
murder.</LD>
<LD>   "We had a very good case and he had virtually no defense," Deputy
Dist. Atty. Stacy Ratner said.</LD>
<TE>   Dunham is one of four people charged in the slaying of homeless
Army veteran James Clark, who was killed June 30, 2001, at a popular
homeless encampment known as Hobo Jungle near the Ventura River.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a Superior Court jury found Dunham's friend, Robert
Coffman, 19, of Oak View, guilty of first-degree murder and robbery.
Clark's backpack and a jar of pennies were stolen before he was
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman, portrayed by prosecutors as a violent white supremacist,
faces life in prison when he is sentenced Nov. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Another defendant, Rocky Mattley, who was 14 at the time of the
slaying, was convicted in a Juvenile Court hearing of second-degree
murder and is serving time at the California Youth Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining defendant, Timothy Becker, 19, of Ventura, is
awaiting trial, which is scheduled for Nov. 4. It is possible, Ratner
said, that Becker could plead guilty before trial.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ventura police, the four teens were headed to a beach
party at Surfers Point when they came upon Clark. They allegedly
kicked and stoned Clark and, according to testimony at his trial,
Coffman later returned and continued kicking him.</TE>
<TE>   Clark died of multiple blunt force injuries, including a crushed
kidney, a broken rib and a possible skull fracture.</TE>
<TE>   Dunham will not be eligible for parole until he is 35, Ratner
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dunham's attorney was not available for comment.</TE>

<HD>14 Held in Recycling Fraud Case</HD>
<DH>The ring made millions redeeming bottles and cans from
Mexico, other states in California, authorities say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Virginia Ellis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It was a crime ring straight out of the Hollywood mold -- fast cars,
furtive trips across the border, the latest cell-phone technology,
police lookouts and a haul estimated at more than $3 million. Only
the payload was mundane: discarded bottles and cans.</LD>
<LD>   After a yearlong investigation, law enforcement officers have
arrested 14 people accused of defrauding the state's recycling
program of millions of dollars by hauling bottles and cans from
Mexico and neighboring states and redeeming them in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   State officials said the ring was purchasing aluminum cans as
scrap in states that do not require a recycling deposit and then
cashing them in at California recycling centers, where deposit money
is returned.</LD>
<TE>   The profit could be substantial. Discarded aluminum cans in
Nevada, Arizona and Utah could be had for about $950 a ton and then
sold in California for about $2,490 a ton. Plastic bottles netted
even higher profits, selling for $90 a ton out of state and bringing
in $910 in California.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests were made by the California attorney general's Bureau
of Investigations as part of a probe that involved 10 law enforcement
offices and stretched to four states and Mexico. It is the biggest
recycling fraud bust since consumers began paying deposits on
beverage containers in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Bail for each of the 14 was set at $2.5 million and all are still
in custody. As an additional condition of release, investigators said
those attempting to make bail will have to prove that they are not
using any profits from the recycling program.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jehdian, an attorney representing one of the defendants,
said all 14 will ask for reduction of the bond at a Nov. 5 hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't understand why it is that high," he said. "There's
actually no reason for it."</TE>
<TE>   The 14 were charged with conspiracy to commit recycling fraud,
filing false documents, grand theft in excess of $2.5 million and
unlawful recycling. Another suspect is still at large. Los Angeles
Deputy Dist. Atty. Diana Callaghan said the charges are punishable by
a maximum prison sentence of eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Among those arrested was Migran Changulyan, 35, an unemployed
truck dispatcher from Glendale who Callaghan said is believed to be
the ringleader.</TE>
<TE>   Changulyan and two others also were accused of collecting welfare
while they took millions from the recycling program and used it to
buy the accouterments of a middle-class lifestyle -- cars and homes.</TE>
<TE>   "We found one defendant ... and his wife ... had been collecting
welfare for 15 years while they owned a home, cars and a recycling
business," Callaghan said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests were the result of a crackdown on recycling fraud that
began several years ago when lawmakers discovered that the unique way
California had designed its program -- with deposits held by the
state and returned at recycling centers -- made it vulnerable to
fraud. Lawmakers earmarked special funds allowing the Department of
Conservation, which oversees the program, to contract with the
attorney general's office to perform criminal investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "These arrests should serve as a wake-up call for those who cheat
the system. They will face the consequences of their actions," said
Darryl Young, the department's director.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, California passed a law that required consumers to pay a
deposit on certain beverages sold in aluminum, plastic and glass
containers. The deposit is 2.5 cents for containers less than 24
ounces and 5 cents for those 24 ounces or larger.</TE>
<TE>   Shoppers can recoup the deposits at state-licensed recycling
centers where the containers are weighed and a redemption value paid.
The state then reimburses the recycling center. Deposits that are not
redeemed go into a special fund that is used by the conservation
department to help pay for local curbside recycling and promotion of
the program.</TE>
<TE>   "The state's beverage recycling program is a groundbreaking
environmental protection effort that Californians rightfully point to
with pride," said Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer. "This prosecution will
help protect the program by breaking up a criminal conspiracy which
defrauded the recycling fund of millions of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Callaghan said Changulyan was identified early as the ringleader
of the operation, but it took months of surveillance and
investigation to determine how he operated and who else was involved.</TE>
<TE>   She said investigators followed members of the ring to Nevada, a
state that does not require a beverage deposit, and watched as they
purchased scrap aluminum, loaded it onto tractor-trailers and then
transported it back to California.</TE>
<TE>   Once in Los Angeles, Callaghan said, the cans would be divided
into small lots and the ring members would fan out across the city to
collect the redemption at a variety of recycling centers. She
estimated that the ring was organized in 1998 and became more
sophisticated as each year passed without detection. By 2002, she
said, it was using cell phones to coordinate its operation and
contracting with trucking firms to transport bottles and cans from
other states.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the ring had also devised another scheme to defraud the
program, she said. Bottles and cans that had been redeemed at
recycling centers were purchased by the ring under the name of a
phony company that promised to use them in the manufacture of new
products.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of reusing the materials, they were taken to other
recyclers in the Los Angeles area and redeemed again.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, when some of the ring members who acted as runners
were arrested, Callaghan said, the ring continued its operation,
although leaders clearly suspected it might be under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   She said lookouts would be used to search the sky for police
helicopters. Cars parked near recycling centers would be checked for
police insignia. Ring leaders who thought they were being followed
would make quick turns or pull over and abandon their vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew we were looking at them," she said. "But they still
kept doing it. Greed is greed, you know."</TE>
<TE>   She said that the investigation is continuing and that more
arrests are expected.</TE>
<TE>   Until the latest arrests, the largest criminal case involving
recycling involved a $1.2-million fraud uncovered by federal
investigators in 1992.</TE>

<LD>Thunder sticks, rally monkeys hanging from the rails and $8 beers --
for Anaheim Angels fans, the only thing missing from the Arrowhead
Pond on Tuesday was a live World Series game.</LD>
<LD>   As their team played 415 miles away at San Francisco's Pacific
Bell Park, more than 500 Angels fans paid $5 each to watch Tuesday
night's World Series game on four large screens at the Arrowhead
Pond.</LD>
<LD>   "You get the stadium facility atmosphere and it's all the real
true fans," said Eddie Campbell of Whittier.</LD>
<TE>   A mix of teens, parents with young children and others looking for
an alternative to watching at home or in a sports bar spent Tuesday
night craning their necks at the arena monitors. The rowdy,
red-shirted crowd constantly clapped their thunder sticks.</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Rivera stood for most of the game, banging his thunder
sticks against the seat in front of him for every Angel hit and
stolen base. So did the majority of the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel more comfortable knowing I'm surrounded by fans," said
Rivera, a decade-long Angels loyalist visiting from Phoenix. "No one
here is distracted like they would be at a bar. They're all here for
one thing -- the game."</TE>
<TE>   About 30 students, parents and teachers from Calvary Chapel in
Anaheim filled three rows. "It's a piece of history for the kids,"
parent Kelly MacLeod said. "We can't afford to go to games, but this
is the next best thing."</TE>
<TE>   As their teams' victory appeared more and more within reach, the
fans' frenzy increased.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we're not [in San Francisco], it really feels like
we're making an impact," said Anaheim resident Maureen Miller. "Look
at the score and you can tell all our positive feelings are getting
up there."</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from the telecasts will benefit youth programs.</TE>
<TE>   The games tonight and Thursday also will be broadcast at the Pond.</TE>

<HD>A Windfall for Cal Lutheran</HD>
<DH>Millionaire Construction Firm Founder John B. Gilbert
Donates $2 Million for Sports Complex</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard millionaire has donated $2 million to Cal Lutheran
University, the second-largest gift in the private college's history,
as part of a campaign to build a sports complex on the Thousand Oaks
campus.</LD>
<LD>   The gift by John B. "Jack" Gilbert, 81, founder of the TOLD Corp.
construction firm, supports development of a gymnasium in an
$18-million sports and fitness center north of Olsen Road near Campus
Drive.</LD>
<LD>   "For the last four or five years they've talked about doing
something along these lines. Somebody had to get the ball started,"
said Gilbert, who still works four days a week in his company's
Camarillo headquarters. "I hope I've created the momentum to get this
thing done."</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of people leave money in their wills," he said. "But since
I hope to live a few more years, I'd like to see a few of these
things while I'm still alive."</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert, a Cal Lutheran regent from 1994 to 1997, has been
involved with the 2,800-student college for 17 years. It honored him
with a "doctor of laws" degree in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   A self-made entrepreneur who never finished high school, Gilbert
made his first fortune with a small sheet metal shop in Burbank,
moved to Ventura County in 1972, and flourished through construction
of about 250 office, industrial and high-tech buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert said the poor state of Cal Lutheran's athletic venues --
no pool on campus and a 42-year-old gym -- prompted him to make the
donation.</TE>
<TE>   "The facility there is not as good as they are in the average high
school," he said. "If Cal Lutheran is going to take its place as
full-fledged university, it has to have a decent athletic facility."</TE>
<TE>   Plans approved in 1999 call for construction of a two-story sports
complex that will contain a 1,500-seat main gym named after Gilbert,
a smaller practice gym, a fitness center, dance studio, sports
medicine facility, offices for faculty and coaches and a hall of
fame.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the sports complex, involving concrete, tilt-up
methods, is set to begin in 2004 and take about 12 months to
complete.</TE>
<TE>   So far, however, just $2.8 million of the $18-million cost has
been raised, including Gilbert's contribution.</TE>
<TE>   Valerie Crooks, project manager for the North Campus Athletic
Facility Complex, said the sports and fitness center is only one
component in a five- to 10-year building program on 80 acres at the
university.</TE>
<TE>   Total cost for the entire project is $44 million, she said.</TE>
<TE>   A 300-seat baseball stadium named after former major league
manager and Thousand Oaks resident Sparky Anderson is also planned.
So is an outdoor aquatic center with a 50-meter pool, and a new
running track.</TE>
<TE>   At build-out, the north campus also would have 15 new tennis
courts, a 3,000-seat football stadium, a 1,000-seat soccer stadium
and a 300-seat women's softball field.</TE>
<TE>   Also planned are a small, infield-only baseball practice area; a
400-meter track, including an area for field events; and six practice
fields for various intramural sports.</TE>
<TE>   A preschool currently on the site would be relocated along Campus
Drive and expanded to accommodate 140 children from the current 92.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the university hopes to raise $80 million to pay for
long-term building efforts, said university spokeswoman Lynda Paige
Fulford.</TE>
<TE>   Major benefactors for the $2.8 million raised so far include
Karsten Lundring of Thousand Oaks, whose family pledged $575,000, and
former regent Ronald Anderson of Fullerton, who has given $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Lutheran's largest gift is $3 million from alumnus Allan Spies
and Karen (Bornemann) Spies, a Denver couple whose families
contributed nearly half the cost of building a 23,000-square-foot
education and technology building bearing their names.</TE>
<TE>   That building will be dedicated during ceremonies Saturday
afternoon.</TE>

<HD>Simon to Lend His Campaign Up to $2 Million</HD>
<DH>Latest infusion will pay for TV ads through election day.
Candidate touts business acumen.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican Bill Simon Jr. plans to lend his gubernatorial campaign up
to $2 million this week to compete with Gov. Gray Davis in a last
round of television advertising, the Republican candidate and one of
his senior strategists said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, I'll put a little more in," Simon told reporters after a
speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council at a downtown hotel.
"It will be enough to ensure that we're going to be up" on television
through election day, he added.</LD>
<LD>   Simon consultant Sal Russo said the latest cash loan from the
candidate -- in the "ballpark" of $2 million -- will allow the
challenger to compete with the governor's television buys.</LD>
<TE>   So far, the GOP nominee has been significantly outgunned on the
airwaves by Davis, who has already spent more than $30 million on
television commercials in the general election -- substantially more
than his opponent. During the remaining days of the race, Davis'
campaign plans to run about $3-million worth of ads a week.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who has struggled to raise a fraction of the money Davis
has collected, previously lent his campaign $9 million, including $4
million last month. Russo said the candidate is making another
infusion because he believes the race is close.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been ahead some days, behind some days, but we're right
there," Russo said. "That's why we're going to max out here at the
end."</TE>
<TE>   Most public polls, however, show Davis with a solid lead over his
opponent. A poll released Monday by the independent Public Policy
Institute of California has Davis leading Simon by 10 points among
likely voters, 41% to 31%.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's newest campaign loan was not yet reflected in state
contribution reports, which showed that the GOP candidate raised
$94,200 on Monday, including $25,000 from an investment company owned
by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian and $5,000 from former opponent and
onetime Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   In his Tuesday speech, Simon promoted his business credentials --
a topic that he has addressed gingerly amid the rash of corporate
scandals this year -- and accused the governor of putting the state's
economy in "serious jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   The Republican candidate told members of the World Affairs Council
that under Davis, the state is losing its share of the export market.
He also charged that California's regulatory climate is pushing
businesses out of the state.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that I know what it takes to reverse our faltering
economy ... and I don't think it's a career politician who has spent
his entire life running for political office," Simon told several
hundred people gathered in a hotel ballroom. "I believe you need
somebody who has signed the front of the check, as opposed to Gray
Davis, who has only signed the back of the check."</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar countered Simon's bleak
assessment of the state's economy, saying it has grown from seventh
largest in the world to fifth largest during the Davis
administration. (Some economic assessments, disputed by the governor,
put it at sixth largest.) In addition, California houses many of the
country's fastest-growing businesses, Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a record I think anybody should be proud of, especially
given the difficult economic times the nation is facing as a whole,"
he said, adding: "Mr. Simon forgets that Mr. Davis was the [state]
controller and actually did sign the front of the checks in
California."</TE>
<TE>   Salazar also sought to tie Simon's pitch to the host of business
scandals this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask Californians if they would rather have a businessman like the
folks that ran ImClone or Arthur Andersen running the state
government, rather than someone who has dedicated his life to public
service," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon predicted that the budget deficit will reach $20 billion
next year, and said that if Davis is reelected, he will raise taxes
by a staggering $10 billion. Salazar scoffed at that notion, although
Davis has refused to limit his options next year.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP candidate repeated his pledge not to raise taxes, and
instead said he would balance the budget by shrinking government and
stimulating economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the kinds of things that businesspeople understand;
these are not the kinds of things that bureaucrats understand," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Simon deflected questions from reporters about whether he
would also rule out raising state fees and fines to cover the state's
budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Russo said Simon would not ask Californians to spend
any more money to cover the state's costs</TE>
<TE>   "He has committed to not raising the financial burden on our
citizens to balance the budget," Russo said. "We're not playing
games."</TE>

<LD>"Your children are not safe anywhere at any time."</LD>
<LD>   Even here, a continent away, the sniper's note was chilling.</LD>
<LD>   Our already frayed nerves, shot through by terrorists, now get
jerked by a lunatic sharpshooter. The next victim could be anyone, it
could happen any second, and there is no way to protect ourselves or
our children from a copycat.</LD>
<TE>   In other words, it's suddenly easier to imagine daily life south
of the Santa Monica Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Bullets on the fly are not a new consideration for Karen Carter,
who has raised five children in neighborhoods where the snipers are
everywhere. A year ago, when she moved from Wilmington to a
neighborhood just off the northwest edge of Compton, the risks grew,
and so did her enforcement of the house rules.</TE>
<TE>   She rattled them off for me Tuesday in her living room, where the
walls are decorated with the smiling faces of children who now range
in age from 8 to 19:</TE>
<TE>   When the street lights go on, stop whatever you're doing and get
home fast.</TE>
<TE>   If you go outside, hang out in the backyard, not the front.</TE>
<TE>   Do not ride your bike down the street.</TE>
<TE>   Do not go anywhere, not even to the corner, without telling Mom.</TE>
<TE>   Do not walk to or from school -- call Mom for a ride.</TE>
<TE>   Do not wear red, the color of the Bloods; or blue, the color of
the Crips.</TE>
<TE>   Shut the blinds at night, so no one can see into the house.</TE>
<TE>   If you see a car come by with its lights off, hit the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "You know it's out there," says Karen Carter. "It's a plague, and
it's ready to grab your children."</TE>
<TE>   And adults, too. Homicides are up across Los Angeles, closing in
on 500 for the year.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to understand the hysteria caused by the Washington-area
sniper. The killer terrorizes with randomness and coldhearted
stealth, and is believed to have taken his 10th victim in three weeks
Tuesday, when police shared the "your children are not safe"
valentine.</TE>
<TE>   But Khalid Shah, of Stop the Violence, Increase the Peace, says 25
people -- many of them minors -- have been cut down by gang-related
violence in the past two months in L.A. County's second supervisorial
district alone.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those victims were hoodlums. But many were simply in the
wrong place at the wrong time, says Shah.</TE>
<TE>   This appears to have been the case with one of Karen Carter's
children.</TE>
<TE>   "I was out back watering the grass," she says, recounting the
events of Oct. 6. She thought her children were out front, violating
one of the rules. Carter, who worked drawing blood at Daniel Freeman
Hospital until an injury put her on disability, said she found Dwayne
out front and asked where his 16-year-old identical twin was.</TE>
<TE>   Then she heard gunshots.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's Joseph?" she demanded. Dwayne confessed that his brother
had sneaked off to the corner, only a block away, to buy a snack.</TE>
<TE>   Then a little neighbor boy came running by.</TE>
<TE>   "Mama Twin," he hollered, calling Carter by her familiar name.
"You better go check on your baby boy."</TE>
<TE>   The "baby boy," who played for Centennial High's football team,
played basketball for New Mount Calvary Baptist Church, and carried a
Bible to school in his backpack, wasn't one to court trouble. It
couldn't be Joseph, Karen Carter told herself as Dwayne ran toward
the sound of the gunshots and she chased after him.</TE>
<TE>   Not Joseph, whom she and relatives had raised in the absence of
the boy's father, shuttling him from one activity to the next along
with her other four children. School, sports, church, family affairs.
One of her frequent lectures was about the dangers of an idle mind.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. County Sheriff's Sgt. Martin Rodriguez says Joseph came upon
two acquaintances and they decided to go grab hamburgers at Tom's on
the northwest corner of El Segundo and San Pedro. On the way in, they
were baited into an argument with a lone male on a bus bench. It
continued when they came out of the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "The lone male shouts out what is considered to be a gang slogan,
and immediately after that a vehicle drives up and begins firing at
the three victims," says Sgt. Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Joshua Wyatt, 17, was dead at the scene. Joseph was shot and lay
still in the street, not far from a bus bench that says, "Keep Our
City Clean and Safe. Do Your Part."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Carter knew it was Joseph when she heard his twin unleash a
wretched scream.</TE>
<TE>   "To run up and see your child lying there," Carter says, "You
can't even put it into words."</TE>
<TE>   Family members held Joseph's hand in the hospital and prayed for
him. He was not conscious, but he knew they were there, Karen Carter
believes. She saw tears on his face, and when Dwayne told him he'd
played his best football game the previous Friday, he felt Joseph
squeeze his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Lamont Carter died two days after he was shot.</TE>
<TE>   There's no indication he had any gang ties, says Martinez, but one
of the other two kids he walked into the burger shop with might have
been associated with a local crew. Whether that kid was the target is
unknown, and Sgt. Martinez asks anyone with information to call (323)
890-5500.</TE>
<TE>   It's next to impossible, Dwayne says, to avoid kids you grew up
with after they get caught up in gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what makes them such vulnerable targets," agrees Sgt.
Martinez. "You live in the neighborhood, you go to school in the
neighborhood, so how can you avoid knowing gang members? You can keep
yourself straight, but merely maintaining a tie to these people puts
you in the line of fire."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Carter is on her sofa next to Dwayne, saying there will be
even stricter rules in her house now. She repeats all the normal kid
things you can't let your children do in "a war zone," where the
snipers are an army.</TE>

<HD>State Poised to Proclaim Key Offshore Preserve</HD>
<DH>No-fishing zone would cover about 175 square miles around
the Channel Islands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Fish and Game Commission today is poised to approve
the first phase of what may become the largest no-fishing marine
reserve off the U.S. mainland.</LD>
<LD>   The commissioners, if they adopt the recommendation of state and
federal managers, will set aside about 175 square miles of waters
around the Channel Islands, creating the equivalent of a wilderness
area.</LD>
<LD>   Federal action next year is expected to expand the protected area
so that it encompasses a cluster of 13 reserves spanning 426 square
miles.</LD>
<TE>   That would make the Channel Island's cluster larger than a similar
reserve complex in the Florida Keys, but not as large as an expanse
in northwestern Hawaiian waters granted protection by Bill Clinton in
the final days of his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   The decision facing state commissioners is a radical departure
from a 132-year tradition of pursuing the restoration and
preservation of fish by setting size and catch limits or enacting
seasonal closures.</TE>
<TE>   A growing body of scientific evidence shows that those traditional
measures have failed to halt the steady decline -- and sometimes the
outright collapse -- of fish stocks.</TE>
<TE>   So the commissioners are considering an approach that protects all
sea life that makes up the marine ecosystem, from the biggest bass to
the tiniest turban snail.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of scientists recommended that 30% to 50% of the waters
around the Channel Islands be protected to allow depleted species to
recover and begin "seeding" surrounding areas with larvae and
spillover fish.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen want as little territory as possible designated as
"no-take" reserves, which means no dragging of nets, no diving for
lobster or sea urchin, no harvesting of kelp and no dangling of hooks
and lines in the water.</TE>
<TE>   The plan before the commission represents a compromise fashioned
by the state Department of Fish and Game and the Channel Islands
National Marine Sanctuary. It would protect 25% of the waters
immediately surrounding the islands.</TE>
<TE>   "This is by far the toughest and most far-ranging decision that
they will ever make," said Mary Nichols, California resources
secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols is well aware that today's meeting will be packed with
angry fishermen who fear the reserve will ruin their livelihoods.</TE>
<TE>   But once the shouting is over, Nichols said, "I'll brag that the
Channel Islands reserve will be the largest in [mainland] U.S.
waters."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some fishermen favor the reserves, including a group of
recreational fishermen in Ventura County who initially proposed the
idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I fervently believe that it will be better for fishing, if not
for me, [then] for my kids and their kids," said Steve Roberson of
Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   "I've fished the islands 30 or 40 times a year for 25 years,"
Roberson said. "We've just hammered the ocean. It's just like how we
almost wiped out the buffalo. It cannot be a free-for-all in the
ocean anymore. Marine reserves are a logical extension of what we've
done on land, such as setting up Yellowstone [National] Park."</TE>
<TE>   Only about 1% of the world's oceans have been placed off limits to
fishing. The percentage of protected California waters is less than
.02%.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scientists have called for 20% of the oceans to be turned
into protected reserves. Earlier this month, Australia created the
world's largest marine reserve, a 25,000-square-mile zone around the
McDonald Islands group in sub-Antarctic waters.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed Channel Island network of reserves is a test case for
a statewide plan to establish similar no-fishing zones up and down
the coast of California and off other states as well.</TE>
<TE>   "California has opened the door for other places to consider
reserves," said Jane Lubchenco, a marine ecologist at Oregon State
University. "I get e-mail from scientists and politicians all over
the world asking, 'What's happening with the Channel Islands?' "</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have studied the one small area near the Channel
Islands that is currently off-limits to fishing. Sea life inside that
37-acre reserve next to Anacapa Island is considerably more abundant
than in the surrounding waters.</TE>
<TE>   Lobster are six times more numerous. Sheephead, a type of fish,
are three times more plentiful. Giant kelp grows five times more
densely and weathers the seasons better than in unprotected waters.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are counting on a Channel Islands network of reserves
to help restore at least a portion of Southern California's
fast-shrinking kelp forests.</TE>
<TE>   The kelp is prime habitat for many sea creatures, providing hiding
places for juvenile fish and food for abalone. Scientists believe
that excessive harvesting of lobster and sheephead, which eat sea
urchins, have resulted in an explosion of kelp-munching purple
urchins.</TE>
<TE>   They have observed these spiny creatures carpeting the sea floor,
turning kelp forests into sort of an oceanic desert called "urchin
barrens."</TE>
<TE>   The Anacapa Island reserve shows how balance can be restored,
according to a new report by the Partnership for Interdisciplinary
Studies of Coastal Oceans, in which four universities are involved.</TE>
<TE>   "Lobster and California sheephead protected inside this reserve
feed on sea urchins, thereby keeping urchin numbers in check," the
report said. "Reduced numbers of urchins allow stands of kelp to
flourish, which in turn support many other species.... "</TE>

<HD>2 Witnesses Refuse to Testify in Slaying</HD>
<DH>Their reluctance is a hurdle for prosecutors during a
preliminary hearing involving the 1999 death of a Rio High football
player.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Blanchard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two key prosecution witnesses refused to testify Tuesday during the
preliminary hearing of an El Rio man charged with killing a high
school football player in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors struggled to build their case against Marcus Moralez,
21, who is accused of repeatedly shooting Frank Miramontez, 17, as
the Rio High School student sat in his car near his home.</LD>
<LD>   The two potential witnesses -- Louie Gutierrez and Jorge Navarro
-- are thought to have witnessed the crime, prosecutors said. But
Gutierrez cited his constitutional right against self-incrimination
and refused to testify, prompting Superior Court Judge Roland Purnell
to find him in contempt and order his arrest.</LD>
<TE>   Navarro said he would testify, but only with his lawyer present.
The lawyer is on vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Aramesh questioned several reluctant
witnesses, including Jesus Mendoza, 18, who told detectives four
months ago that Moralez confided that he shot Miramontez in an
attempt to steal a car stereo.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday, Mendoza said he had lied in an attempt to get out of
jail, where he was being held for car theft.</TE>
<TE>   "I was making things up just to get out," he said. "All I was
thinking about was me, me, me, and getting out. I thought they were
going to help me get out, so I made a mistake and lied to the
police."</TE>
<TE>   Aramesh suggested Mendoza fears retribution if he cooperates.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing did provide some new details.</TE>
<TE>   Miramontez was probably shot six times, according to testimony by
Janice Frank, county assistant chief medical examiner. Frank also
testified the shots were fired at fairly close range and probably
came from the right rear passenger seat of Miramontez's car.</TE>
<TE>   April Mabry, a former girlfriend of Moralez, testified that she
saw Moralez riding in Miramontez's car before the teenager was shot.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was friends with both men and that they had followed
her to a bank parking lot in Oxnard, where she spoke to them. She
said Miramontez asked her repeatedly if he could accompany her on a
shopping trip that evening, but she turned him down.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say it was a desperate attempt by Miramontez to avoid
being alone with his passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Mabry said five people were in Miramontez's car and that Moralez
was in the front passenger seat, not in back, from where the shots
supposedly came.</TE>
<TE>   Aramesh suggested that Mabry changed details of her statement to
avoid incriminating a longtime friend.</TE>

<HD>Lethal Outbreak Threatens Poultry</HD>
<DH>Newcastle disease has spread rapidly in the Southland since
September. More than 6,000 infected birds have been destroyed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Malnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An outbreak of Newcastle disease in Southern California is
threatening the state's $2.5-billion poultry and egg industry, state
officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The outbreak, which was discovered Sept. 27 in a backyard flock of
chickens in Compton, has spread rapidly through Los Angeles and
Riverside counties, the state Department of Food and Agriculture
said.</LD>
<LD>   About 70 backyard flocks in Los Angeles, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties have been quarantined, and more than 6,500
chickens, turkeys, ducks and pet birds have been destroyed in an
effort to curb the outbreak. Newcastle disease, though lethal to all
birds, does not affect humans and poses no public health threat.</LD>
<TE>   Thus far, no commercial flocks have been infected. But Leticia
Rio, a spokeswoman for the agriculture department, warned that the
viral disease, which hammered California's poultry industry in the
early 1970s, could continue to spread.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge concern to our industry," said Bill Mattos, president
of the California Poultry Federation, an industry group representing
most of the state's major producers, including Foster Farms and Zacky
Farms. "We are already being affected, because foreign nations,
worried about Newcastle, are starting to cut off their imports from
the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The outbreak comes at a particularly worrisome time for the turkey
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "They usually do 40% of their business between now and Christmas,"
Mattos said.</TE>
<TE>   California is one of the largest poultry states, producing about
250 million chickens, 18 million turkeys, several million ducks and
almost a million squab every year, Mattos said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the poultry producers are in the northern San Joaquin
Valley, but there are major egg producers in Riverside and San
Bernardino counties.</TE>
<TE>   A statewide outbreak of Newcastle disease 30 years ago spread to
commercial flocks and forced the destruction of more than 11 million
birds. It took two years to eradicate the disease, at a cost of more
than $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   The source of the current outbreak is unknown, but Rios said it
could have started with the illegal importation of birds such as
fighting cocks and protected species of parrots.</TE>
<TE>   The disease usually spreads bird to bird, through contact with
contaminated feces, feed, cages and other materials. Humans can serve
as carriers.</TE>
<TE>   More than 150 state and federal inspectors have fanned out through
Southern California since the outbreak began, testing flocks of every
size and ordering quarantines and the destruction of any infected
birds.</TE>
<TE>   The agriculture department has set up a hotline to provide
information on the disease and accept reports on possible bird
infections. The number is (800) 491-1899.</TE>
<TE>   Mattos said poultry and egg producers are taking exceptional steps
to keep the disease from their flocks.</TE>
<TE>   "There's big bio-security," he said. "Visitors aren't being
allowed, because they can be carrying the infection in on their
clothing and shoes. The workers have to wear coveralls and boots that
are sprayed with disinfectant before they enter the buildings
[housing the flocks].</TE>
<TE>   "We can't afford to let this disease get to our commercial
flocks."</TE>

<HD>Nurses Set for 1-Day Strike</HD>
<DH>The action today at Long Beach Memorial comes as labor
unions continue to press organizing efforts in the Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some 1,300 registered nurses at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center
are set to strike today in the largest such job action in California
in more than four years.</LD>
<LD>   In response, the hospital's management has vowed to block the
nurses from returning to work as planned on Thursday. The standoff
underscores the acrimony that has come to define labor relations at
some of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   Emboldened by a nationwide shortage that is especially pronounced
here, nurses are showing that there is a tough side to this caring
profession.</LD>
<TE>   With nursing unions firmly established in Northern California,
organizers have set their sites on Los Angeles County, where
opportunities are more plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really quite simple," said Jim Lott, executive vice
president of the Healthcare Assn. of Southern California, a hospital
trade group. "Organized labor is going where the opportunities are. I
think we've seen steady momentum in this direction over the last five
years in Southern California. It just seems like it's all coming to a
head right now."</TE>
<TE>   The nurses' labor actions come after more than a decade of
dramatic change in the health-care industry, primarily wrought by
managed care. Patients have been coming into hospitals sicker,
leaving more quickly and straining the thinning ranks of bedside
nurses.</TE>
<TE>   Many nurses have left hospitals for less demanding jobs in other
clinical or research settings, or left the profession.</TE>
<TE>   Of those who remain, an increasing number are taking a stand--not
just for themselves, they say, but for their patients.</TE>
<TE>   "I love being a nurse. It's not a job -- It's who I am," said
Margie Keenan, 53, who works at Long Beach Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like it's destroying our profession -- this pushing and
pushing and making people work harder.... We have to put our foot
down and say this is what it takes to take care of patients the right
way."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, union activity had been concentrated in smaller
hospitals in Southern California -- but now it is spreading to the
largest facilities.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,700 registered nurses at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the
largest nonprofit hospital on the West Coast, will vote in December
on whether to join the California Nurses Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The rival Service Employees International Union recently won the
right to represent nurses at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in
Burbank and Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center in Pomona. Both
hospitals, among the 10 largest private facilities in Los Angeles
County, are refusing to recognize the unions without a fight.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of nurses that have traditionally ... been timid and shy
about speaking up ... have now suffered to the point where they're
willing to do something about it," said Dan Bachar, 44, a surgical
nurse at Cedars.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cedars claims to be the best hospital in the region,
Bachar said, the hospital's salary and benefits package leave
something to be desired. "If you want the best, why not pay the
best?"</TE>
<TE>   Cedars officials say that their pay ranks in the top tier of local
hospitals, and that their nurse staffing levels exceed the minimum
standards recently proposed by the state.</TE>
<TE>   "The health care industry and health care providers, in
particular, are under tremendous pressure," said Jeanne Flores, a
hospital senior vice president. "It's understandable in some sense
that there is some frustration on the part of staff.... I think
they've been misled into thinking that a third party can do something
that we can't do on our own."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach has been the site of a nasty tug of war between labor
and management for three years. In February 2000, nurses voted 591 to
581 against joining the CNA. Nineteen months later, the nurses voted
630 to 523 in favor of the union.</TE>
<TE>   Topping the list of unresolved issues is nurses' demand for a new
pension program, followed by better staffing levels and pay increases
for veteran nurses.</TE>
<TE>   A mediator was unable to bridge the differences, prompting the
union to call for today's one-day strike.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that this strike will hurt us," said Dr.
Gainer Pillsbury, medical director at Long Beach Memorial. "But at
the same time, we cannot mortgage the future by signing a blank check
and agree to a [pension] plan that we can't even evaluate ahead of
time."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital said it will spend $1 million to $2 million to hire
temporary nurses from U.S. Nursing Corp., which specializes in
finding replacements for striking workers. Because the hospital
agreed to hire the temporary nurses for a minimum of five days,
Pillsbury said, officials will not allow the striking nurses to
return to work until Monday even if they want to.</TE>
<TE>   The nurses' union compares the action to the Pacific Maritime
Assn.'s recent lockout of port workers in Long Beach and along the
West Coast because of a contract impasse.</TE>
<TE>   "What they're going to see is that the resolve of the nurses is
phenomenal here," said Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the
California Nurses Assn. "They've really just had it with bad
decision-making in that hospital."</TE>
<TE>   In general, said Luisa Blue, president of the SEIU Nurse Alliance
in Southern California, nurses are overworked. A growing body of
evidence, including a study released today in the Journal of the
American Medical Assn., shows that having fewer nurses on staff
increases the risk of patient deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gotten to the point where nurses are feeling that unless
improvements are made with staffing, what's the sense of staying?"
Blue said.</TE>
<TE>   Some hospital officials say unions have crossed the bounds of
decency to attract members. A Pomona Valley spokeswoman, Kathy Roche,
said that the union engaged in threats and intimidation, and even
keyed several cars.</TE>
<TE>   Roche also said the hospital has questioned the "unauthorized
videotaping" of the voting process in September.</TE>
<TE>   SEIU denies those claims. A pro-union nurse at Pomona Valley,
Julia Smeirat, agreed, however, that the fight became very personal
because the hospital "pretty much tried to set nurse against nurse."</TE>

<LD>A 59-year-old Westminster woman accused of helping her husband commit
suicide to end years of debilitating illness was released from jail
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The district attorney's office said the possibility of charging
her will depend on the results of toxicology tests. The tests screen
for alcohol, drugs and medications and will help determine what
killed Mariano Lopez, said Deputy Coroner Larry Esslinger. The
results could take about four weeks, he said.</LD>

<HD>Police Shoot, Wound Carjacking Suspect in West Los Angeles</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Los Angeles Police Department officers shot and wounded a
carjacking suspect in a stolen car Tuesday after he allegedly tried
to run them down in a narrow West Los Angeles alley, department
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   It was the 25th time this year LAPD officers shot at and hit
suspects.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified man driving a stolen Hyundai was shot multiple
times by officers Chiquita Brown and Robert Lockhart about 10:15 a.m.
in a driveway at the south side of an apartment building in the 1700
block of Beloit Avenue, Deputy Chief David Kalish said.</LD>
<TE>   "Officers ordered the suspect to stop the vehicle. The suspect
attempted to run over the officers in a very narrow driveway. The
officers directly in the path of the vehicle fired several shots,"
Kalish said. "The vehicle after the shooting collided with the side
of the apartment building."</TE>
<TE>   The suspect is expected to survive. Officers found a
semi-automatic pistol in the car.</TE>
<TE>   The wounded man matched the description of a carjacker who stole a
vehicle at gunpoint from a woman in the Mar Vista area about 7:20
a.m. Tuesday, Kalish said. The woman was loading her Hyundai in the
4300 block of Berryman Avenue when the man, armed with a
semiautomatic pistol, demanded her car keys and then drove away, he
said. The woman was not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Officers located the car using the LoJack system. The man, seated
in the car, saw the approaching officers and tried to pull out of the
narrow driveway.</TE>
<TE>   The incident is being investigated by the LAPD, the district
attorney's office and the Police Commission's inspector general,
Kalish said.</TE>

<HD>Jose Ernest Ortega, 82; Co-Founded Tribal Board</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jose Ernest Ortega, grandson of the last Native American to speak the
Fernandeno dialect, has died at his San Fernando home. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Ortega died Saturday of cancer, said his nephew, Rudy Ortega Jr.</LD>
<LD>   Better known as "Ernie," Ortega was born Dec. 10, 1919, in Los
Angeles and raised in San Fernando, where he lived his entire life.
Ortega was a plumber by trade who, along with other family members,
became interested in the late 1960s in establishing a board for the
Fernandeno-Tataviam tribe, which helped build the San Fernando
Mission.</LD>
<TE>   During Ortega's nearly 25 years as a board member, in which he
planned cultural events, the tribe's rolls grew from about 300 to
940. Ortega's grandfather, Antonio Maria Ortega, was the last person
to speak the tribe's dialect.</TE>
<TE>   Ortega is survived by his wife of 62 years, Della; sons Ernest and
James, both of San Fernando; brothers Rudy Ortega Sr. of Palmdale and
Richard "Jimmy" Ortega of San Fernando; nine grandchildren and 14
great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A graveside service will be held at 9 a.m. Friday at San Fernando
Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills.</TE>

<HD>One Sure Thing -- The Bet Is Illegal</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Today we turn our attention to a wholly unanticipated scenario of the
Giant-Angel World Series matchup: several politicians, as well as the
bishops of the Orange County and San Francisco dioceses, landing in
jail.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, it sounded funny when Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly won successive
bets from the mayors of New York and Minneapolis and when, on the eve
of the World Series, Daly and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown staked
their claims: if the Giants win, Daly would wear a fedora with Giants
colors; an Angels win and Brown would don a cowboy hat.</LD>
<LD>   Two members of Orange County's congressional delegation got into
the act. U.S. Reps. Christopher Cox and Loretta Sanchez jointly put
up Disney tickets against a wine-and-chocolate offer from their San
Francisco counterparts, Nancy Pelosi and Tom Lantos. Cox also agreed
to sing "I Left My Heart in San Francisco" while sporting flowers in
his hair and wearing a tie-dyed shirt. His news release noted that by
doing so, "Rep. Cox upped the ante ... " of the original wager. Those
words may come back to haunt him.</LD>
<TE>   The gambling bug also bit Orange County Bishop Tod Brown, who
referred to himself and San Francisco Archbishop William Levada in a
news release as "passionate fans" of their respective teams who had
engaged in a "World Series wager."</TE>
<TE>   Brown agreed to treat Levada to lunch or dinner at Club 33 at
Disneyland. Should Levada lose, he'll entertain Brown at the opera in
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   I ask Whittier Law College professor I. Nelson Rose, an
acknowledged gambling expert, why people do things like that. He says
it's probably human nature and that it goes way, way back.</TE>
<TE>   He then mentions that these local wagers are probably illegal.
"Hold on," Rose says, "let me get the penal code statute."</TE>
<TE>   He returns with 337a of the state code, which says in part that
anyone "who lays, makes, offers or accepts any bet or bets, or wager
or wagers, upon the result or purported result of any ... contest, or
purported contest, of skill, speed or power of endurance of man or
beast, or between men, beasts, or mechanical apparatus" has committed
a crime punishable by as much as a year in jail or prison.</TE>
<TE>   If the Giant-Angel best-of-seven series doesn't pit men in a
contest of skill, speed or power of endurance, I don't know what
does.</TE>
<TE>   Rose, who teaches at Whittier's Costa Mesa branch, doesn't want to
come across like Cotton Mather, but, hey, he didn't write the law.</TE>
<TE>   I ask Rose (no relation to Pete Rose), what's wrong with bishops
or politicians betting on baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "If the defenders of morality in society, which is government and
religion," he says, "are running games themselves -- or in this case
betting -- how can they tell other people, 'No, you can't do it, it's
a sin, it's wrong.' " It certainly sends a message that, with these
anti-gambling laws, you can ignore them."</TE>
<TE>   Gambling, Rose says, "is part of our society and probably part of
human nature. It's going to exist, anyway, so it probably should be
legalized but made difficult."</TE>
<TE>   In olden days, gambling probably started as wagers between two
people racing and then evolved to include animals and "to groups of
people."</TE>
<TE>   Like Angels and Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Cox and Sanchez pleaded ignorance. "But if it's me and the
bishop," Sanchez quipped, "I'll finally have time for confession."</TE>
<TE>   Betting involves risk and America was settled by risk-takers, Rose
says. That probably rubbed off on society's leaders. "I do believe
almost every successful human being in our culture, who made it to
the top, probably is a risk-seeker."</TE>
<TE>   I didn't ask him if they all have smart lawyers.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Under heavy police surveillance, hundreds of mostly
young people marched peacefully through downtown Los Angeles as part
of an annual day of protest against police brutality. Police
estimated 300 demonstrators participated in the march from Olympic
Boulevard and Broadway to Los Angeles police headquarters at Parker
Center. The black-clad marchers, led by a troupe of Aztec dancers,
carried signs, chanted anti-police slogans, and played drums and
flutes. Hundreds of officers with clubs and riot masks and on
motorcycles and bicycles lined the march route as police helicopters
hovered overhead and rush-hour traffic snarled.</CP>

<HD>Santa Ana Schools Set Recall Vote</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana school board members late Tuesday set Feb. 25 as the date
for the recall election of fellow trustee Nativo V. Lopez, in what is
expected to be the final round in a battle for control of Orange
County's largest school district.</LD>
<LD>   The recall movement, which began with the circulation of petitions
in March, has evolved into a referendum on the school board majority,
which includes trustees Nadia Maria Davis and John Palacio. Both face
reelection Nov. 5 and are opposed by many of the same people who seek
Lopez's ouster.</LD>
<LD>   Critics blame the board majority for what they call failures in
the 62,000-student Santa Ana Unified School District, including
delays in new school construction.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate vote, the board also granted $24 million in
construction contracts for expansion projects at Washington,
Roosevelt, Jackson and Lincoln elementary schools. Work could begin
within a month, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Ryder Trial Gets Its Close-Up</HD>
<DH>Real-life drama surrounding actress' shoplifting arrest at
Saks Fifth Avenue draws intense media attention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Winona Ryder's shoplifting arrest has inspired television
skits, "Free Winona" T-shirts and even a comic play.</LD>
<LD>   Now, 10 months later, the Oscar-nominated actress is about to star
as the criminal defendant in a real-life drama featuring a varied
cast: hawk-eyed Saks Fifth Avenue security guards, employees from
other high-end department stores and Beverly Hills police officers
who handcuffed America's most famous accused shoplifter. The witness
testimony may be supplemented by snippets from a 90-minute video
featuring Ryder's now-infamous December shopping trip.</LD>
<LD>   Ryder's trial is scheduled to begin Thursday in Beverly Hills at
the same courthouse where Zsa Zsa Gabor was convicted 13 years ago of
slapping a police officer and of possessing an open flask of Jack
Daniels. Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox, who will preside over
Ryder's case, prosecuted Gabor's case while serving as a deputy
district attorney. Reporters from around the world have requested
seats for the trial, which is expected to last a week or two.
Prosecutors allege that Ryder shoplifted about $6,000 worth of
designer purses, clothes and hair accessories and that she snipped
anti-theft sensor tags off merchandise. She is charged with three
felonies: grand theft, burglary and vandalism.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorney Mark Geragos has insisted that his client went on
a legitimate shopping spree and has the receipts to prove it. He has
said she never cut off security tags and never left Saks with the
unpaid-for merchandise. So why the criminal prosecution?</TE>
<TE>   "I think various people had a motive to set up Winona, and I
believe I can convincingly prove that," he said. Geragos plans to
show jurors that the allegations against Ryder evolved after the
release of a store surveillance tape that does not, he said, show his
client stealing anything.</TE>
<TE>   If a jury convicts the 30-year-old actress, she could face a
maximum sentence of three years in prison. But because there is no
minimum sentence, she could be placed on probation. She is free on
$20,000 bail. Attorneys on both sides agree that jail time is
unlikely on a first offense.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations toward a possible plea bargain broke off last month
when Ryder turned down an offer from prosecutors. Deputy Dist. Atty.
Ann Rundle said her office feels "very strongly" that Ryder committed
a felony. Geragos said he would never agree to a felony plea.</TE>
<TE>   Though both sides say publicly that they are headed to trial, the
case still could be settled if the judge reduces the charges to
misdemeanors.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder's publicist, Mara Buxbaum, said, "Never say never when it
comes to settling."</TE>
<TE>   Buxbaum said Ryder would love to avoid a trial. "She wants this
behind her. She's not looking forward to any of this, except for it
to be over."</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, born Winona Laura Horowitz, was raised in Petaluma, Calif.
Her parents were friends of poet Allen Ginsberg, and her godfather
was Timothy Leary.</TE>
<TE>   She started acting as a teenager and movies in which she has
appeared include "The Age of Innocence," "Little Women" and "Reality
Bites." Her most recent movie, "Mr. Deeds," was released earlier this
year. Ryder hosted "Saturday Night Live" about the same time, poking
fun at herself and her shoplifting case.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses at the trial will include some of the same cast from the
preliminary hearing, including a Saks security investigator, Colleen
Rainey, who has said she peeked through the slats of a dressing room
and saw Ryder snip sensor tags from a purse and cut her finger.
Security manager Kenneth Evans is expected to testify that he tracked
Ryder's movements as she passed by three open registers before
leaving the store and that he later recovered four sensor tags from a
coat pocket in the store's Chanel boutique.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also plan to call three employees from Barneys and
Neiman Marcus to testify in support of a motion by prosecutors to
introduce evidence of "the defendant's commission of other acts,"
according to court papers.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors filed the motion under seal and have declined to
elaborate. Fox has yet to rule whether that testimony will be allowed
in trial. Ryder has no prior police record.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills police arrested Ryder on Dec. 12 after security
officers confronted her outside the store. Officers and prosecutors
originally said that store surveillance cameras had recorded her
taking the items and removing the anti-theft devices, but they have
since backed down from those statements. The 90-minute tape, portions
of which have been shown on national television, shows a disheveled
Ryder going up and down an escalator, trying on hats, flipping
through racks of designer clothes and dropping her bags.</TE>
<TE>   The actress spent $3,700 in Saks that day, buying Gucci shoes, a
leather jacket and Yves St. Laurent blouses. The additional $6,000
worth of merchandise that she is accused of stealing includes two
black hats, seven pairs of socks, an Yves St. Laurent shirt, several
handbags and four hair accessories.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos said his game plan is to attack the credibility of the
prosecution's witnesses and tear apart the surveillance video. "It's
not going to take a whole lot," he said. "There is nothing on the
video except, surprise, Winona shopping."</TE>
<TE>   Critics have accused the district attorney's office of
over-zealousness, and treating Ryder more harshly than other suspects
simply because she is a celebrity. But Fox denied Geragos' motion,
which was based on that premise, to disqualify the office from
prosecuting the case.</TE>
<TE>   Rundle said the only difference she sees in the Ryder case is that
more people in the chain of command -- including Dist. Atty. Steve
Cooley -- have weighed in on decisions. But she insisted that she is
the only trial attorney on the case and that she is continuing to
work on several others, though she did transfer a murder prosecution,
scheduled to begin this month, to a colleague.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been no extraordinary resources put into this," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys are likely to ask potential jurors questions about their
shopping habits and their opinions of celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors should look for jurors who are still angry about O.J.
Simpson and who believe celebrities are too spoiled, while defense
attorneys should look for jurors who revere movie stars and who may
not think spending thousands on one shopping trip is unusual, Loyola
Law School professor Laurie Levenson said.</TE>
<TE>   The media hordes covering the trial will be supervised by a small
army of sheriff's deputies to keep everybody at least 10 feet from
the actress. Ryder suffered a fractured elbow when she was struck
with a television camera as she entered the courthouse in June,
prompting Fox to scold reporters and photographers. Already, the
Superior Court has taken requests for seats from 35 reporters and
photographers, including representatives of the BBC, Newsweek, the
National Enquirer and CBS International.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just some things that are constant in the criminal
justice system," Levenson said. "When there is a celebrity case, no
matter how petty it might be, everyone focuses on it. We've become
star-struck."</TE>

<HD>Gloom, Doom and Baseball Compete in City by the Bay</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Baseball-smitten Southlanders who arrived in drizzly
San Francisco Tuesday for the third game of the World Series found
themselves in a decidedly depressed town.</LD>
<LD>   The dot-com bust has the city in the doldrums. And in what may be
the first such campaign sponsored by a local hotel industry, 33
billboards on major streets urge action against the city's aggressive
panhandlers and homeless population.</LD>
<LD>   Tony Bennett may have left his heart in San Francisco but, these
days, a lot of people here are venting their spleens.</LD>
<TE>   "We're all sick of stepping over garbage and waste, averting our
eyes to people shooting up on doorsteps ... ," the influential Hotel
Council of San Francisco says in its new "We Want Change" campaign.
One billboard shows a well-dressed businessman atop Nob Hill holding
up a cardboard sign similar to those wielded by panhandlers.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to know why homelessness is still a problem after we spent
$200 million last year," the handwritten placard declares. The city
estimates that it spends between $100 million and $200 million a year
on the estimated 8,000 to 14,000 homeless people here.</TE>
<TE>   Even the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau, the tax-supported
booster organization, has joined in the bashing.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual step last week, John Marks, convention bureau
chairman, released a batch of negative letters from tourists and tour
organizers sent to the San Francisco Examiner.</TE>
<TE>   "Our group members were all very uncomfortable being on the
streets of San Francisco, especially in the evenings, because of your
large, aggressive and uncontrolled homeless population," wrote one
visitor.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, San Francisco remains passionate about its hometown
baseball heroes, playing in the World Series for the first time since
1989. City buses and the famous cable cars were festooned Tuesday
with Giants pennants. A sign on a building, visible from the Bay
Bridge, chides the Anaheim Angels mascot: "There is no monkey in
baseball."</TE>
<TE>   In his state-of-the-city speech Monday, Mayor Willie Brown raised
a baseball bat above his head emblazoned "Go Giants!"</TE>
<TE>   But Brown also registered dismay over the rampant negativism
sweeping his city. "I'm saddened by some of the great beneficiaries
of our tourist trade that are negative about our city," the mayor
said.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest contributor to the San Francisco malaise is the
depressed economy, which has suffered not only from the dot-com
collapse, but also from the post-9/11 tourism decline.</TE>
<TE>   "Back in 1999," recalled Wade Randlett, a longtime Democratic
political activist, "this city was on autopilot. Everything was going
so well that all of the discussions were about the problems of
prosperity. Now the party is over and, just like the day after New
Year's, you look around and everything looks like a mess."</TE>
<TE>   But the timing of the San Francisco establishment's attack on its
own city is tied to the Nov. 5 election. The most contentious issue
on the ballot here is an initiative that would cut cash payments to
the city's homeless individuals from $395 a month -- one of the
highest in the country -- to $59.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism industry officials and business leaders contend the
relatively high payments serve as a magnet for homeless migrants. On
Tuesday, the San Francisco Chronicle in an editorial backed the "Care
Not Cash" ballot initiative, sponsored by Supervisor Gavin Newsom.</TE>
<TE>   Another reform group, SFSOS, backed by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.), Gap founder Don Fisher and investment banker Warren
Hellman, staged its first rally on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "In the opinion of a lot of people," Hellman told the Chronicle in
an interview, "this city is just sliding."</TE>
<TE>   Famous for its moody wet weather, San Francisco plodded along on
baseball day Tuesday under overcast skies and constant drizzle.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing seemed to rain on the enthusiasm of visiting Southern
Californians, who schooled like a red tide of angelfish on
Fisherman's Wharf and on the little cable cars reaching halfway to
the stars.</TE>
<TE>   "We got up at 6 a.m. to drive up here," said Stacy Christensen,
35, of Newport Beach, standing with her husband, 2-year-old son and
two friends at Fisherman's Wharf.</TE>
<TE>   Of the five, only husband John Christensen, also 35, co-owner of a
Newport Beach delicatessen, had a ticket. He was at Edison Field in
Anaheim when Barry Bonds hit his towering home run late in Sunday
night's game.</TE>
<TE>   "It went right over my head," said Christensen, gesturing above
his Angels cap.</TE>
<TE>   Though sympathetic to the economic conditions here ("I have some
friends here who are feeling the pinch," said Christensen) the
southerners' only frustrations were the limited number of parking
spaces and the high price of lots, which cost $28 a day in many
areas.</TE>
<TE>   PacBell Park, which seats 41,503, has only 15,000 parking spaces,
mostly reserved for season ticket holders.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco newspapers published articles Tuesday instructing
visitors on how to use public transit, something largely missing in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   As the Christensens -- son Noah in a stroller -- walked along the
dock of the bay, they fielded occasional friendly jibes from San
Franciscans alerted by their bright red Angels gear.</TE>
<TE>   "Show some courage!" shouted Greg Boldt, a manager for Red and
White Fleet tourist boats. "Pitch to Bonds!"</TE>
<TE>   But Boldt, who attended Verdugo Hills High School in Tujunga, said
he had no real animosity toward Angels fans.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were the Dodgers," Boldt said, "it would be a different
story."</TE>

<HD>Norbert Schultze, 91; Composer Best Known for 'Lili
Marleen'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Norbert Schultze, German composer best remembered for the moody "Lili
Marleen," which became a World War II favorite of infantrymen in
various languages on all fronts, has died. He was 91.</LD>
<LD>   Schultze died Oct. 14 in Bad Toelz, Bavaria, of unstated causes.</LD>
<LD>   Already an established film composer in Berlin as war clouds
gathered in the late 1930s, Schultze wrote what unwittingly became
his best-known work in 1938. The song, which expresses the universal
sadness and longing of couples separated by war, was inspired by an
obscure poem called "The Song of a Young Sentry," written by a German
soldier, Hans Leip, in World War I.</LD>
<TE>   The poet-soldier sent to the front was leaving behind two
girlfriends, which in the poem became one girl named Lili Marleen,
faithfully awaiting his return in the lamplight. The song was
recorded in 1939 by cabaret singer Lale Anderson, but -- far from
becoming an immediate hit -- sold a mere 700 copies.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, however, the German Army resurrected the failed
recording to close broadcasts rallying its troops fighting in North
Africa. Nazi leaders considered the song overly sentimental and
banned it, but soldiers -- German and their British opponents alike
-- loved it, and the anthem spread through barracks, hospitals and
bunkers across Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The British, and later their American allies, made up their own
lyrics for Schultze's haunting melody -- often implying that Lili was
a prostitute rather than the sweet girl next door. British leaders
and the BBC, disapproving of the free-form translations, asked
songwriter Tommie Connor to write more suitable English lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   With an anglicized spelling, the song became "Lilli Marlene" and
was recorded in wartime England by Anne Shelton and Vera Lynn with
these words:</TE>
<TE>   Underneath the lantern</TE>
<TE>   By the barrack gate,</TE>
<TE>   Darling, I remember</TE>
<TE>   The way you used to wait:</TE>
<TE>   'Twas there that you whispered</TE>
<TE>   tenderly,</TE>
<TE>   That you loved me,</TE>
<TE>   You'd always be</TE>
<TE>   My Lilli of the lamplight,</TE>
<TE>   My own Lilli Marlene.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the song was translated into about 30 languages and
sung by soldiers on fronts throughout Europe and Asia. It became a
signature hit for Marlene Dietrich, who sang it to entertain Allied
troops in Europe and in her one-woman Broadway show more than two
decades later.</TE>
<TE>   On Schultze's 85th birthday in 1996, Reinhold Kreile, president of
GEMA, a German-language acronym for the society for musical
performing and mechanical reproduction rights, presented him with the
group's highest award. At that ceremony, Kreile called Schultze's
song "a stroke of genius which, in just a few beats expressed the
sentiments of an entire generation, and became not just a popular
song but a folk song known around the world. It was then sung by
friend and foe, and still is part of the folk repertoire of all
peoples."</TE>
<TE>   The song's unlikely journey from oblivion to international
recognition was chronicled by the 1980 film of Rainer Werner
Fassbinder called "Lili Marleen" and by Schultze's own 1996 book,
"With you, Lili Marleen."</TE>
<TE>   Schultze, ironically, never considered the song his greatest work
and even rued its amazing success. "When I hear it today," he said in
1996, "I don't have the feeling that it is from me. Musically, I had
bad luck."</TE>
<TE>   Schultze's World War II output other than "Lili Marleen" did not
endear him to Allies and other international audiences. He wrote
songs for the Nazis, such as "Bombs Against England," "Forward to the
East," "Forward With Rommel" (although by the time it was finished,
the German leader Rommel was actually in retreat), and the music that
Nazi propaganda minister Josef Goebbels played before the official
announcement of the war with Poland.</TE>
<TE>   Schultze's compositions for the Nazis so discredited him after the
war that for many years he could find work only as a gardener.</TE>
<TE>   He later apologized for supporting Hitler's regime and said
Goebbels had locked him in a room until he produced music the
minister considered acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   He also told one interviewer: "I had the choice: Be a composer or
face death, so I chose the first option." (That remark was
interpreted to mean that he could compose under duress or serve in
the German military, not that the Nazis had threatened to execute
him.)</TE>
<TE>   Born a doctor's son in Braunschweig, Germany, on Jan. 26, 1911,
Schultze studied conducting, composition and the piano in Cologne and
theater in Munich.</TE>
<TE>   He acted and composed in a student cabaret in Munich, conducted
opera in Heidelberg and Darmstadt, worked for the Telefunken record
company and in 1936 settled in Berlin, where he composed music for
more than 50 films as well as children's musicals such as "The Snow
Queen" and operettas including "The Rain in Paris."</TE>
<TE>   A few of Schultze's compositions over the years were published
under the pseudonyms Frank Norbert, Peter Kornfeld or Henry Iversen,
according to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.</TE>
<TE>   In his later years, Schultze owned a music publishing company and
worked to protect music copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   Schultze, who spent his retirement years on the Spanish island of
Mallorca, is survived by his wife, Iwa Wanja, and five children.</TE>

<HD>Valley Mayoral Foes Attack Richman</HD>
<DH>Leader in the cityhood race is assailed for simultaneously
running for Assembly reelection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy and Nita Lelyveld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tensions surfaced in the San Fernando Valley mayor's race Tuesday, as
apparent front-runner Keith Richman came under attack by other
candidates for his business practices, Republican party affiliation
and the fact that he is simultaneously seeking reelection to the
Assembly.</LD>
<LD>   The contenders on the Nov. 5 secession ballot squared off in a
debate that quickly focused on Richman, who was leading his nine
opponents in a recent Times poll and has a similar advantage in
fund-raising.</LD>
<LD>   Richman hit back after Mel Wilson questioned the Northridge
lawmaker's commitment to the mayoral race given his decision to also
run for a second Assembly term. The Valley mayor's office will exist
only if secession wins. Richman has said he would quit the Assembly
to serve as mayor.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm extremely disappointed that any of the candidates who are
working hard for a Valley city would get down in the gutter and sling
mud," Richman said after the debate, which was taped for showing on
the Adelphia cable system.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, a Woodland Hills Realtor and Democrat, also made an issue
of Richman's Republican affiliation. Democrats have an edge in Valley
voter registration.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want this city to be a good city, do you want a Democrat
and a businessman running it, or do you want a Republican?" Wilson
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Marc Strassman, a Valley Village Internet consultant,
said a medical group co-owned by Richman failed to make timely
payments to health care providers .</TE>
<TE>   He cited a February story in The Times that said state records
indicated Lakeside Medical Group did not make the payments on time.</TE>
<TE>   Strassman noted that the same story reported that Richman was
co-author of a bill that proposed a review system under which
companies such as his could challenge health maintenance organization
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "The pattern here is one of looking out for himself and his
friends, and I think we can do better," Strassman said.</TE>
<TE>   Richman called the charge of withholding payments to health
providers "ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   "I think I have been a leader in providing health care to the
uninsured in California and I don't think the health plans would call
me their friend," Richman added.</TE>
<TE>   He said he cleared all his legislation with state ethics officials
to make sure there were no conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the candidates pledged to reduce business taxes and
improve public safety as their priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Benito "Benny" Bernal, a union organizer and educator from Mission
Hills, said he would bolster gang-prevention programs and school
reforms. Journalist Leonard Shapiro of Reseda proposed regular audits
to make sure city departments are efficient.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Divina, a retired Chatsworth accountant, said he would work
to improve basic city services. Jim Summers, a Realtor associate from
Granada Hills, said he would toughen laws on campaign finance and
land development.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm finding our neighborhoods are changing for the worse because
certain special interests downtown are influencing our
decision-makers," Summers said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Boyer, an alarm company manager from Reseda, said he is the
only candidate who would challenge a requirement that a Valley city
make separation payments to Los Angeles, starting at $127 million the
first year.</TE>
<TE>   David Hernandez, an insurance adjuster from Valley Village, said
Los Angeles has squandered federal funds on downtown development --
money the Valley needs.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Roberts, a North Hollywood-area activist, did not attend
Tuesday's event.</TE>
<TE>   As the Valley candidates debated, Mayor James K. Hahn told two
Hollywood gatherings that the city has committed millions of dollars
to improving that area's business district and increasing its stock

<HD>Valley Mayoral Foes Attack Front-Runner</HD>
<DH>They assail Republican Keith Richman for simultaneously
running for Assembly reelection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy and Nita Lelyveld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tensions surfaced in the San Fernando Valley mayor's race Tuesday, as
apparent front-runner Keith Richman came under attack by other
candidates for his business practices, Republican party affiliation
and the fact that he is simultaneously seeking reelection to the
Assembly.</LD>
<LD>   The contenders on the Nov. 5 secession ballot squared off in a
debate that quickly focused on Richman, who was leading his nine
opponents in a recent Times poll and has a similar advantage in
fund-raising.</LD>
<LD>   Richman hit back after Mel Wilson questioned the Northridge
lawmaker's commitment to the mayoral race given his decision to also
run for a second Assembly term. The Valley mayor's office will exist
only if secession wins. Richman has said he would quit the Assembly
to serve as mayor.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm extremely disappointed that any of the candidates who are
working hard for a Valley city would get down in the gutter and sling
mud," Richman said after the debate, which was taped for showing on
the Adelphia cable system.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, a Woodland Hills Realtor and Democrat, also made an issue
of Richman's Republican affiliation. Democrats have an edge in Valley
voter registration.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want this city to be a good city, do you want a Democrat
and a businessman running it, or do you want a Republican?" Wilson
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Marc Strassman, a Valley Village Internet consultant,
said a medical group co-owned by Richman failed to make timely
payments to health care providers .</TE>
<TE>   He cited a February story in The Times that said state records
indicated Lakeside Medical Group did not make the payments on time.</TE>
<TE>   Strassman noted that the same story reported that Richman was
co-author of a bill that proposed a review system under which
companies such as his could challenge health maintenance organization
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "The pattern here is one of looking out for himself and his
friends, and I think we can do better," Strassman said.</TE>
<TE>   Richman called the charge of withholding payments to health
providers "ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   "I think I have been a leader in providing health care to the
uninsured in California and I don't think the health plans would call
me their friend," Richman added.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the candidates pledged to reduce business taxes and
improve public safety as their priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Benito "Benny" Bernal, a union organizer and educator from Mission
Hills, said he would bolster gang-prevention programs and school
reforms. Journalist Leonard Shapiro of Reseda proposed regular audits
to make sure city departments are efficient.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Divina, a retired Chatsworth accountant, said he would work
to improve basic city services. Jim Summers, a Realtor associate from
Granada Hills, said he would toughen laws on campaign finance and
land development.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm finding our neighborhoods are changing for the worse because
certain special interests downtown are influencing our
decision-makers," Summers said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Boyer, an alarm company manager from Reseda, said he is the
only candidate who would challenge a requirement that a Valley city
make separation payments to Los Angeles, starting at $127 million the
first year.</TE>
<TE>   David Hernandez, an insurance adjuster from Valley Village, said
Los Angeles has squandered federal funds on downtown development --
money the Valley needs.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Roberts, a North Hollywood-area activist, did not attend
Tuesday's event.</TE>
<TE>   As the Valley candidates debated, Mayor James K. Hahn told two
Hollywood gatherings that the city has committed millions of dollars
to improving that area's business district and increasing its stock
of affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only one threat to all of this great progress that I've
been talking about on the horizon, and that's the threat that we
might break up this great city," Hahn said at a Hollywood Chamber of
Commerce luncheon.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke of city-subsidized projects such as the Hollywood &amp;
Highland mall and an upcoming housing and retail development at
Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street.</TE>
<TE>   He also mentioned the city's $100-million housing trust and its
plan to build 500 units of affordable housing in Hollywood during the
next three years.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the luncheon, Hollywood secession leader Gene La Pietra
and others who are running for city council in a proposed Hollywood
city staged a protest. They said the mayor should pay attention to
problems such as the trash and abandoned mattresses piled on the
street just blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   After the luncheon, the mayor joined Hollywood council members
Eric Garcetti and Tom LaBonge at an anti-secession news conference at
the newly renovated Cinerama Dome on Sunset Boulevard. Garcetti
called the Dome project "a perfect example" of the city working with
business to revitalize depressed areas. The complex's garage was
built and operated with public money.</TE>
<TE>   Theater security officers barred the Hollywood secessionists from
moving their protest onto the Dome property.</TE>
<TE>   At both Hollywood events, Hahn praised the secessionists for
pushing the city to reform.</TE>
<TE>   "People have the right to be squeaky, to make that wheel squeak
when they aren't getting the attention that they need," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Bus Riders Union announced Tuesday that it opposes
secession, labeling the movement "racist at its core."</TE>
<TE>   The union said in a statement that secessionists are "trying to
build a movement of white flight, appealing to white people who think
somehow that they can 'escape' the multicultural, multiracial society
that is L.A.'s strong suit."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Brain, president of Valley VOTE, denied the charge, noting
that Latinos would be the largest ethnic group in a new Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   And as if to ensure no issue escapes debate, the Public Links Golf
Assn. scheduled a forum Tuesday night on how secession could affect
the Valley's four city golf courses. Secessionists say not at all.</TE>

Officer Leland Tang said. While trying to avoid oncoming traffic, she
apparently lost control of her car, he said.</LD>

<HD>Funds Denied for Some Snowmobile Trails in Sierra</HD>
<DH>State panel cites usage conflicts and pollution. Critics
fear effect on tourism, wildlife.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Cart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state commission concerned about winter air pollution and
recreational conflicts has denied funding for 413 miles of snowmobile
trails in the Sierra Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   According to officials of the state agency that administers
off-highway vehicle recreation programs, the decision by the
California Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Commission will close 20%
of state-maintained trails used by snowmobilers, cross-country skiers
and others and will cost rural communities that depend on winter
tourism $6.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   The affected trails are in four national forests: the
Humboldt-Toiyabe, Eldorado, Lake Tahoe Basin and Sequoia. Funding was
denied for the first three. The issue was tabled for the Sequoia
forest, and state officials doubt that the grant will be approved.</LD>
<TE>   The commission approved funding for trails in nine other national
forests.</TE>
<TE>   National forests routinely request grants from the commission for
winter trail grooming and related law enforcement and conservation
programs. State officials said that without properly maintained and
monitored trails, snowmobiling and cross-country skiing in the
affected forests will be unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   "What's disturbing about all of this is that law enforcement is a
critical part of this," said Barry Jones, who administers the
$16-million off-highway vehicle grant program under the jurisdiction
of California State Parks. "Search and rescue is going to be tough.
In some of these areas the only way to get injured people out is on
groomed trails."</TE>
<TE>   Critics contended that the seven-member commission's actions are
politically motivated and will do unintended harm to wildlife,
watersheds and wilderness areas.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's an agenda by a group of people -- three appointees
who micromanage the commission based on their anti-off- highway
vehicle beliefs," said Ron Rawlings, former president of the
California-Nevada Snowmobile Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The three members who voted against funding said they have no
agenda other than better management of forest resources. The three
prevailed because of the absence of one member, and a tie vote denied
funding.</TE>
<TE>   The opponents said their votes were based mainly on three
concerns: the effect of high-polluting snowmobiles on the air around
Lake Tahoe; conflicts with other trail users, especially
cross-country skiers; and inequities in the funding program that
allow snowmobile users to get more money back in state services than
they put in.</TE>
<TE>   Harold Thomas, a Sacramento attorney, voted to deny funds in the
Lake Tahoe area, where he said snowmobile engines exacerbate an
existing environmental problem: fallout from air pollution that is
stimulating the growth of algae and changing the color of the
famously blue lake.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we want to be spending state funds to worsen the
clarity problem in Lake Tahoe by encouraging more snowmobiles in the
airshed," Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   The state's Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Program began in 1971
and is funded by a fuel tax on four-wheel-drive vehicles and other
off-road machines. David Widell, deputy director of the program, said
it was rare for winter grants to be declined.</TE>
<TE>   Some commissioners said the problem lies with the U.S. Forest
Service. They said national forests have grown accustomed to the
yearly grant money and thus don't budget for winter trail
maintenance, making it difficult to find money should grants from the
commission be denied.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are seeing is that federal agencies are using this fund
to support their core operations, which was not intended," said Paul
Spitler, who voted against the grant requests. "It puts us in a bad
situation, but it makes the federal agencies look irresponsible. If
these programs are such a priority for the forests, how come the
federal government doesn't fund them?"</TE>
<TE>   California's national forests have 1,900 miles of groomed trails.
The packed snow on those trails makes travel easier for novice
snowmobilers; the trails also are sought out by some cross-country
skiers, dogsledders and snowshoers. Without maintained trails,
critics said, snowmobilers could get trapped in deep snow or
inadvertently wander into wilderness areas, where vehicles are
prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   State parks are not open to snowmobiles.</TE>
<TE>   Critics countered that groomed trails are no deterrent to the
growing number of snowmobilers who ignore wilderness prohibitions.</TE>
<TE>   Grooming grants also are used to clear parking lots and maintain
restrooms and warming huts. Some revenue from the fuel tax is used
for watershed and wildlife protection and for law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   For John Frazier, who has run a snowmobiling resort in Pioneer
near the Kirkwood ski area for 25 years, no trails means no
customers.</TE>
<TE>   "This could put me out of business. I'm going to lay off at least
50% of my employees," Frazier said. He said he will lose his contract
to groom trails with the Eldorado National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone here is talking about it," he said. "It's our livelihood
they're messing with."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the state's off-highway vehicle program said it is
possible that the commission could reconsider its actions at its
December meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "We truly have a problem on our hands," said David Widell, deputy
director of the off-highway vehicle program. "We still don't know
what happened. At the end of the day this vote may have been
inevitable, but I don't think it was responsible."</TE>

<HD>Slaying Victim Feared for His Life, Friends Say</HD>
<DH>Former investigator is arrested in the stabbing death of
prosecutor Stephen Tauzer, who tried to help his troubled son.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Arax and John Johnson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>BAKERSFIELD -- In the days before his murder gripped this oil and
farm town, Stephen M. Tauzer walked in fear for his life. But Tauzer,
the No. 2 man in the Kern County district attorney's office, didn't
request police protection or even share his concerns with colleagues.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the 58-year-old prosecutor told a friend that he had
received a phone call warning him that Chris Hillis, a former
Bakersfield cop and district attorney investigator, was going to kill
him. Tauzer and Hillis had been arguing over Hillis' son.</LD>
<LD>   "If you find me drowned in my pool or something," the overweight
prosecutor confided to Hillis' former wife on Sept. 12, "you'll know
who did it."</LD>
<TE>   Three days later, Tauzer was found face down in a puddle of blood
in the garage of his well-tended house in northwest Bakersfield. He
had been dead for at least a day from stab wounds. One of the knives
recovered from the scene was still protruding from his head.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Hillis, 47, was arrested in the slaying after his DNA
was found on one of the knives, sheriff's officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The rift between the prosecutor and the former D.A. investigator
is a story of two men struggling over the fate of a 22-year-old drug
addict, a young man who happened to be Hillis' oldest son and
Tauzer's roommate.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer, who friends say was gay but kept it hidden, had risked his
reputation as a prominent prosecutor to save Lance C. Hillis, a kid
he had watched grow up in his neighborhood. Tauzer opened his
pocketbook and home to the young drug addict. He even gave him a job
as a clerk in the D.A.'s office.</TE>
<TE>   But Tauzer's involvement did not sit well with Hillis' father. The
two men had argued violently over Lance, officials said. Chris
Hillis, a hard-nosed law and order type, thought the only way his son
would get clean was by going to jail.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer, though, believed otherwise. After Lance was arrested in a
second bust, Tauzer convinced the Kern County courts that Lance
belonged not in jail but in a drug treatment center 300 miles north
in El Dorado County.</TE>
<TE>   Then in August, five weeks before Tauzer's slaying, Lance Hillis
was killed in a car crash on a lonely stretch of Highway 49, an
addict on the run from rehab.</TE>
<TE>   After Lance's death, Tauzer feared Chris Hillis would hold him
accountable.</TE>
<TE>   As he drove to El Dorado County last month to survey the road
where Lance had died in a head-on collision, Tauzer seemed troubled.
He confided his fears in the presence of his three passengers: Lance
Hillis' mother, Connie Clagg, and Lance's two sisters, Ricci and
Kaycee Clagg.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer told Connie that if anything should happen to him, she
should suspect her former husband, according to Ricci. Then Tauzer
confided something else:</TE>
<TE>   He said he had received a phone call from Donald Hillis, Lance's
grandfather who was also a former Bakersfield cop. According to
Ricci, Tauzer said the grandfather had warned him that Chris Hillis,
his son, had a plan to murder him.</TE>
<TE>   "Promise me you won't let him get away with it," Tauzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Connie Clagg confirmed that Tauzer discussed his fears "three to
four times" during their trip, but she refused to go into details.
Ricci Clagg said her mother has provided those details to sheriff's
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   In a news conference announcing Hillis' arrest Tuesday, Sheriff's
Cmdr. Martin Williamson said the motive appeared to be Chris Hillis'
continuing rage over Tauzer's dealings with his son.</TE>
<TE>   Hillis, who pleaded not guilty to one count of murder and is being
held without bail, has denied any role in Tauzer's death. His
attorney questions the reliability of the DNA evidence and the
alleged motive.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris has given his life to the Lord," said his attorney, Kyle J.
Humphrey. "He doesn't blame Steve [Tauzer] for Lance's death."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the murder, the case has raised questions of favoritism in
the office of Kern County Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels. Despite Jagels'
reputation for aggressive, unyielding prosecutions, the way his
office dealt with the drug crimes of Lance Hillis was anything but
tough.</TE>
<TE>   Because the case involves such public figures, each with ties to
the prosecutor's office, the murder has uncorked all sorts of
serpentine conspiracy theories in this land of Pentecostal churches,
country music parables and parades that celebrate private property
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Because Tauzer was a veteran who spent 30 years locking up violent
criminals, his murder would seem to be a whodunit of infinite
possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Some thought it could be tied to his decades-old handling of an
alleged satanic molestation ring whose defendants have been freed
from prison because of prosecutorial misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Others suggested it might be linked to his more recent
investigation of civic corruption in the small town of Arvin, where
he had indicted the police chief and a city councilman.</TE>
<TE>   Or was it like the murders of other prominent men, who were forced
by Bakersfield convention to lead double lives and meet younger men
in parks along the Kern River?</TE>
<TE>   "Tauzer's murder reminds me of so many others in Bakersfield,"
said Norm Prigge, a retired Cal State Bakersfield professor who is
gay. "This is a place like a lot of places where gay or bisexual men
in public office have to express themselves in the most clandestine
ways.</TE>
<TE>   "They do stupid things like go to parks or pick up male
prostitutes, and they're vulnerable to the worst kind of hustling and
blackmail."</TE>
<TE>   For example, there was the 1998 stabbing death of 63-year-old Sid
Sheffield, a well-known hospital administrator who hid his gay
lifestyle from his wife, children and colleagues. Police believe the
murder, which remains unsolved, was linked to one of Sheffield's gay
liaisons.</TE>
<TE>   There was the 1984 stabbing death of 49-year-old Marshall
Jacobson, a prominent attorney who, like Tauzer, was found dead in
his garage. Jacobson concealed from family and friends his sexual
relations with young males. Two youths, 14 and 19 years old, who told
police that Jacobson was like a father to them, were convicted of the
murder.</TE>
<TE>   And there was the 1981 murder of Edwin Buck, a government
administrator who did all the hiring and firing in Kern County. Buck,
55, was having an affair with a teenage male hustler he met at Beach
Park, along the river. This was the same delinquent teen who had been
sleeping with the then-publisher of the Bakersfield Californian, who
later died of AIDS, and a well-known political consultant.</TE>
<TE>   The illicit relationships with a minor, documented in court
testimony, were known to authorities, but they took no legal action.
Buck was later beaten to death with a hammer and his body cremated in
the back of his car. The young hustler was convicted of murder.</TE>
<TE>   It is Tauzer's relationship with Hillis, the timing of the car
crash and the murder that Tauzer's family now focuses on. But they
say Tauzer, who never married and worked long hours, took only a
fatherly interest in young Hillis.</TE>
<TE>   "After Lance became addicted to drugs, Steve thought he could help
turn his life around," said Tauzer's sister, Patt Pavao. "It had
nothing to do with him being gay or not."</TE>
<TE>   Pavao said she feared that Hillis' father was still nursing a
grudge after striking her brother two years earlier in an argument
over Lance.</TE>
<TE>   "We questioned Steve about it. We were concerned. But even if
Steve saw the dangers, he wouldn't necessarily change if he thought
what he was doing was right."</TE>
<TE>   Among some in the tightknit legal community here, Tauzer was
viewed as a tireless prosecutor and a private man who concealed his
homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone here is skirting the issue, using euphemisms to describe
the relationship between Tauzer and [Lance] Hillis," said Tim
Lemucchi, a defense attorney who considered Tauzer a fine public
servant.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants to come out and say that Tauzer was gay and involved
in a 'sugar daddy' relationship with Hillis."</TE>
<TE>   Connie Clagg, Lance's mother, said her son told her that Tauzer
was gay. But she said Lance had plenty of girlfriends and doubted
that he and Tauzer were involved in a sexual relationship. "Steve
Tauzer was the most unselfish man I ever met," she said. "There were
no strings attached" to Tauzer's generosity.</TE>
<TE>   To know Lance Hillis as a boy, family members said, was to both
love and fear for him. He could not squash a bug without mourning it.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew from when he was young he would go all good or all to the
bad," said his grandmother Betty Clagg, sitting in her ranch house at
the edge of the Mojave Desert. "He was too sensitive. He couldn't
cope with reality."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up, Lance split time between his divorced parents. His
mother and stepfather, Connie and Rick Clagg, lived in Tehachapi. His
father, a veteran cop, lived in an upscale section of northwest
Bakersfield, just down the block from Tauzer.</TE>
<TE>   Lance's freshman picture at Centennial High shows a handsome boy
with a broad smile and tousled brown hair. He joined the debate team
and, with his gangly frame filling out, played football.</TE>
<TE>   "Debate was difficult for him, but he got better," said forensics
teacher Bud Davis. "He was just a sweet kid, very considerate. And I
never saw the earmarks of any alcohol or drug abuse."</TE>
<TE>   Lance found himself whipsawed at home. Connie and Rick Clagg were
anything but disciplinarians, said Betty Clagg. Then Lance would stay
with his father, a taskmaster, and find himself plunged into a world
of rigid order. It is unclear just when drugs entered Lance's life,
but methamphetamine became his high of choice. He was arrested for
grand theft in August 2000, court records show, and that same month,
his father's fears about his addiction were confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Hillis had gone to his son's apartment in east Bakersfield
and pounded on the door. Inside, he found a small amount of meth and
some syringes. He cuffed his son and called police. Lance enrolled in
a drug treatment program, stayed clean for a while, then went on a
binge and got kicked out.</TE>
<TE>   Family members say Chris Hillis, despite his sometimes strict
child rearing, loved his son. To better understand Lance's addiction,
Hillis went back to school and became a drug treatment counselor. He
believed Lance needed to "hit bottom" before he could change. And
hitting bottom meant going to jail for a long enough time to scare
him sober.</TE>
<TE>   But Hillis watched in frustration as his son flunked one drug
program only to be enrolled in another, thanks to the intervention of
Tauzer. If Hillis was a proponent of tough love, Tauzer believed in a
more indulgent approach.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer went to extraordinary lengths to help the younger Hillis.
He kept track of Lance's movements through the court system. He
wasn't shy about addressing judges on Lance's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "Lance had a difficult and, I believe, abusive childhood," Tauzer
wrote in one letter to the court.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer's interest raised ethical questions inside the prosecutor's
office. Through five terms in office, Jagels had taken a firm stance
against drug abuse. Prison, not treatment, was his policy.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview shortly after Tauzer's death, Jagels said he
thought the younger Hillis should have gone to jail, but he failed to
get his top prosecutor to back off.</TE>
<TE>   Jagels and Tauzer had been friends for 27 years and lived together
for a time after Jagels divorced his first wife, according to former
co-workers. Tauzer was known inside the office as Jagels' "loyalty
cop," coming down hard on any employee who criticized the boss.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer's ties to Lance forced Jagels to declare a conflict of
interest and hand over the prosecution of Lance's drug case to the
California attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   But Tauzer continued to intervene to the point that the deputy
attorney general handling the matter described his participation as
"inappropriate" in a court document.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer took in Lance as a house guest and gave him his 1993 Ford
Explorer. He let him use his $1,200 Ibanez guitar with inlaid
mother-of-pearl, which Lance tried to pawn for $25.</TE>
<TE>   More than once, Betty Clagg said, she expressed concern about her
grandson's involvement with Tauzer because of his sexual orientation.
"He's gay, and I don't like him helping Lance," she recalled telling
family members. But every time she raised the matter, she said, she
got nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter-in-law, Lance's mother, Connie, remained in Tauzer's
corner. It didn't matter to her if Tauzer was gay. He cared enough to
shelter her son. Tauzer also was generous to her. Whenever Connie
needed financial help, Lance went straight to Tauzer for the money,
relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that Tauzer was concerned that Lance would
never get well in his hometown. So he took him to Placerville, to a
treatment facility called Progress House.</TE>
<TE>   But Tauzer didn't get permission from Lance's probation officer to
take him out of Kern County. Still, at Tauzer's behest, Judge Lee
Felice allowed Lance to seek treatment up north.</TE>
<TE>   Eager to show how well Lance was doing, Tauzer wrote a June 29
letter to Felice after visiting Lance at Progress House. "I am happy
to report that Lance looked healthy, happy and, more importantly,
drug-free."</TE>
<TE>   If so, he wasn't clean for long.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-July, while driving under the influence in El Dorado
County, Lance lost control and hit a telephone pole, barely escaping
injury and totaling Tauzer's car, according to a California Highway
Patrol report.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks later, Lance stole a car from outside a Kentucky Fried
Chicken restaurant in Placerville and sped off down Highway 49. As he
crossed the American River, he swerved into oncoming traffic and
struck another car head-on. The occupant of the other car escaped
serious injury, but Lance was killed on impact.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, on Sept. 12, Tauzer drove to the crash site to
figure out what happened. He was accompanied by Lance's mother and
his two half-sisters, Ricci and Kaycee. Together, they visited
Lance's friends at Progress House, and Tauzer offered to contribute
money for a plaque to remember Lance.</TE>
<TE>   It was during this trip that Tauzer confided his fears about Chris
Hillis, Ricci recalled. He told Connie that he had received a phone
call from Donald Hillis, Lance's grandfather, warning him that Chris
planned to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Hillis, who declined to be interviewed, found Tauzer's
battered body in his garage the following Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Hillis, in a brief interview with The Times last month,
denied any role in the killing and insisted he had put aside any bad
feelings toward Tauzer after his son's death.</TE>
<TE>   Still, family members recalled, Hillis put the word out that
Tauzer was not to be allowed to attend his son's funeral.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer's funeral was as close to a state occasion as you will find
in Bakersfield. St. Phillip's Catholic Church was packed. Friends and
family spoke about Tauzer's fairness as a prosecutor and his decency
as a man.</TE>
<TE>   Until his arrest, Chris Hillis continued to help addicts try to
beat drugs. In honor of Lance, he had renamed his drug rehabilitation
center in east Bakersfield "Lance's Haven."</TE>
<TE>   Hillis said he never gave up hope for his son and once made a
promise to him. "[I'm] going to be here when you return from your
horrific journey," he said. "He never returned."</TE>

<HD>College District Board Decides to Buy Out Westin's Contract</HD>
<DH>Investigation into the chancellor's spending practices
turns up no wrongdoing. Taxpayer advocates and faculty union still
unsatisfied.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Community College District will buy out Chancellor
Philip Westin's contract -- rather than fire him -- because an
internal investigation of his questionable spending practices found
no wrongdoing, college board President Norman Nagel announced late
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, which pays Westin his full $203,000 annual salary
until next July and a reduced amount for four months after that,
would end Westin's six-year tenure and gives him the right to seek
employment elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Westin, 56, has resigned as part of the deal.</LD>
<TE>   "We conducted a confidential investigation into the allegations,
and the investigation concluded that the claims have no merit at
all," Nagel said. "The board wishes him well on his future
professional endeavors."</TE>
<TE>   Trustees also granted Westin the title of chancellor emeritus, an
honorary designation he had requested, but he has no official duties.</TE>
<TE>   Even in settlement, however, the trustees were divided. Nagel, Al
Jacobs and Bob Gonzales voted for it, while the two trustees on the
Nov. 5 ballot for reelection -- Art Hernandez and John Tallman --
voted against it without comment.</TE>
<TE>   The internal investigation by a Los Angeles law firm found Westin
broke no laws nor district rules when he spent $119,000 over four
years on car repairs, computer equipment and expensive meals. But
critics of the college board said the buyout is too little, too late.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to know if this was the best decision because we've
been cut out from the process," said community activist David Maron.
"I think it's clear the investigation was very limited in its scope
and did not fit the spirit of what we were promised back in July. The
buyout reflects what happens when a public board is concerned only
with its own self-interest, as opposed to the community's."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Miller, president of the Ventura County Federation of
College Teachers, which has had its own legal disputes with Westin,
said: "I don't like it at all. I think he should go to jail."</TE>
<TE>   The decision brings to an apparent end an ongoing financial
scandal that has rocked the 35,000-student district since last spring
and inspired a bevy of candidates seeking to reform the five-member
board. Three board seats are being contested in the election.</TE>
<TE>   Westin first came under fire in March, when the Camarillo law firm
of Wood &amp; Bender presented trustees with a report detailing his
expenditures from 1997 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees initially sought Westin's resignation but dropped the
effort after an auditor hired by the district cleared him of criminal
violations.</TE>
<TE>   In May, trustees voted to renew his contract through 2006 and
raised his salary by 16%, saying he had done a good job and was
instrumental in securing voter approval of a $365-million
construction bond.</TE>
<TE>   But taxpayers and faculty union members were livid when they
learned of Westin's spending and his new contract. As public anger
rose, two county residents filed a lawsuit against the district on
behalf of county taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   In the Ventura County Superior Court suit, residents Gerard
Kapuscik and Gerald Levin outlined a number of allegations against
Westin, Deputy Chancellor Mike Gregoryk and some board members,
including claims they spent public money on rental cars and tickets
to exclusive golf tournaments and misspent federal grant money.</TE>
<TE>   Maron and political activist Hank Lacayo started an e-mail
campaign in July aimed at ousting Westin, and a conservative
Republican group launched a recall effort against Jacobs, whose term
expires in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   In response, trustees placed Westin on paid administrative leave
in July and said they would launch their own investigation. They
hired the firm of Liebert Cassidy Whitmore to conduct the probe, but
revealed little about its progress until Tuesday evening's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the latest investigation was a cynical attempt to
quell public anger. They noted that a majority of trustees stood by
Westin until it was no longer politically feasible to continue.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never been a sense of contrition from the board about its
own culpability in extending his contract when it was unnecessary and
looking the other way on his expenses," said Maron, who chairs a
county advisory committee on spending millions of dollars in tobacco
settlement money. "They've never apologized for the way they've
managed the board over the last six months."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, the faculty union president, said the buyout will not undo
the damage caused by Westin's autocratic management style. Tension
between the administration and the faculty union has contributed to a
rise in district legal fees, which climbed to nearly $1 million in
fiscal 2001-02.</TE>
<TE>   "Forget the money," Miller said. "The spending is minor compared
to what he's done to people's lives. The way Westin and [district
Counsel Jack] Lipton have conspired to attack the faculty is
criminal."</TE>

<HD>County Offers Chad-Free Voting</HD>

<LD>Got chad phobia?</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County election officials Tuesday offered an
alternative to the type of punch-card machine that threw the 2000
presidential election into chaos: touch-screen voting machines.</LD>
<LD>   Registered voters began using the machines at midday Tuesday to
cast ballots for the Nov. 5 election. The county has installed 21 of
the electronic booths at malls, libraries, city halls and community
centers throughout the area. Voters can use any of the locations,
seven days a week, until Nov. 1.</LD>
<TE>   The county offered touch screens as part of a pilot program during
the 2000 election. Several other California counties, including
Riverside and Alameda, and a growing number of states use electronic
voting.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the wave of the future," Conny McCormack, L.A. County's
registrar-recorder, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, including some political scientists and technology
security experts, call the system unreliable and prone to mechanical
mishaps. Others noted that California does not require that the
touch-screen computers leave a paper trail, meaning there is no
backup in case the computer memory fails.</TE>
<TE>   "I have serious concerns," said Kim Alexander, president and
founder of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit based in
Davis. "There's no other transaction that is completely paperless, so
why count on touch screens for the one thing that matters more than
anything else?"</TE>
<TE>   The system has already caused problems. In South Florida, the
epicenter of the 2000 presidential debacle, electronic voting caused
problems during the gubernatorial primary last month.</TE>
<TE>   There are six touch screens at each polling site in Los Angeles
County. They resemble a desktop computer and cost about $3,000 each.
About $675,000 has been spent on the program.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles and other California counties are poised to spend
millions of dollars on electronic voting systems by 2004, the
deadline set earlier this year by a federal judge who ruled that the
state must replace outmoded punch-card voting machines. In March,
voters approved a $200-million bond measure to buy new election
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   McCormack said L.A. County's 4 million registered voters will use
the touch screens and a paper-based scanner system in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Electronic voting locations and times are available at
www.lavote.net or by calling the county at (800) 815-2666.</TE>

<HD>College District to Buy Out Chancellor</HD>
<DH>Probe of spending by the Ventura County educator finds no
wrongdoing. But the controversy spurred taxpayer outrage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Community College District will buy out Chancellor
Philip Westin's contract -- rather than fire him -- because an
internal investigation of his questionable spending practices found
no wrongdoing, college board President Norman Nagel announced late
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, which pays Westin his full $203,000 annual salary
until next July and a reduced amount for four months after that,
would end Westin's six-year tenure and gives him the right to seek
employment elsewhere. Westin, 56, has resigned as part of the deal.</LD>
<LD>   "We conducted a confidential investigation into the allegations,
and the investigation concluded that the claims have no merit at
all," Nagel said. "The board wishes him well on his future
professional endeavors."</LD>
<TE>   Trustees also granted Westin the title of chancellor emeritus, an
honorary designation he had requested, but he has no official duties.</TE>
<TE>   Even in settlement, however, the trustees were divided. Nagel, Al
Jacobs and Bob Gonzales voted for it, while the two trustees on the
Nov. 5 ballot for reelection -- Art Hernandez and John Tallman --
voted against it without comment.</TE>
<TE>   The internal investigation by a Los Angeles law firm found Westin
broke no laws nor district rules when he spent $119,000 over four
years on car repairs, computer equipment and expensive meals. But
critics of the college board said the buyout is too little, too late.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to know if this was the best decision because we've
been cut out from the process," said community activist David Maron.
"I think it's clear the investigation was very limited in its scope
and did not fit the spirit of what we were promised back in July. The
buyout reflects what happens when a public board is concerned only
with its own self-interest, as opposed to the community's."</TE>
<TE>   The decision brings to an apparent end an ongoing financial
scandal that has rocked the 35,000-student district since last spring
and inspired a bevy of candidates seeking to reform the five-member
board. Three board seats are being contested in the election.</TE>
<TE>   Westin first came under fire in March, when the Camarillo law firm
of Wood &amp; Bender presented trustees with a report detailing his
expenditures from 1997 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees initially sought Westin's resignation but dropped the
effort after an auditor hired by the district cleared him of criminal
violations.</TE>
<TE>   In May, trustees voted to renew his contract through 2006 and
raised his salary by 16%, saying he had done a good job and was
instrumental in securing voter approval of a $365-million
construction bond.</TE>
<TE>   But taxpayers and faculty union members were livid when they
learned of Westin's spending and his new contract.</TE>

<HD>2nd Ex-Hospital Worker Guilty in Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Former mental health counselor at private Pine Grove
facility in West Hills admitted to a charge involving a 15-year-old
patient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A second former employee of Pine Grove Hospital has been prosecuted
for having sex with an underage patient he met at the mental
institution, which is under investigation by county officials because
of a number of other sexual misconduct allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Former mental health counselor Angel Vargas, 38, pleaded guilty in
September to one count of unlawful sexual intercourse with a
15-year-old girl he propositioned while she was being treated at the
private West Hills facility, according to court documents.</LD>
<LD>   The incident is the fourth police have investigated since 2000
involving former Pine Grove employees accused of sexually molesting
patients or former patients.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health launched a
probe to determine whether the hospital is safe after a separate
incident in August in which a 17-year-old patient raped a 13-year-old
girl in her room in the adolescent ward.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas' sexual encounter did not occur on hospital grounds, but he
told his victim he wanted to have sex with her while she was being
treated at Pine Grove in August 1999, according to the girl's account
to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas gave the girl his pager number, and a few months after her
release from Pine Grove the two met at a Santa Clarita park and had
sex in Vargas' car, the sheriff's report said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the incident, the girl, who has been diagnosed as
bipolar, was a patient at another area mental institution, staying
there five days a week and going home to Santa Clarita on weekends,
according to police reports and her mother.</TE>
<TE>   The girl told her parents and authorities about the incident in
March 2001. Vargas was arraigned the following month. He is now
serving a four-month sentence in Los Angeles County Jail, and faces
three years' probation after his release.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a serious issue of breach of trust involved in this,"
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Warren Greene said at Vargas' Sept.
24 sentencing. "While [Vargas] may not have been actively working as
a counselor at the time the sexual relationship occurred, [the trust]
clearly was there at some earlier point in time, in that capacity
through which he met the victim."</TE>
<TE>   Pine Grove administrators told sheriff's investigators that Vargas
was terminated on June 25, 2000, but said the firing had nothing to
do with allegations of sexual misconduct, according to court
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Pine Grove Administrator Larry McFarland declined to comment on
the case, but said the hospital has made a number of rule changes
since 2000, including instituting stricter background checks for
prospective employees.</TE>
<TE>   State records show the hospital also imposed new rules limiting
contact between male staff members and female adolescent patients
after the 2000 arrest of mental health worker Quincy Crawford, who
was later convicted of having sex with a 13-year-old girl in a Pine
Grove bathroom. He is serving three years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   That girl's mother is suing Crawford, the hospital and its parent
company, Doctors Community Healthcare Corp., alleging administrators
failed to adequately protect patients. The suit also claims the
hospital failed to conduct adequate background checks and training of
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Ryan, an attorney for the hospital and its parent company,
denied the allegations, but declined further comment. A trial date is
set for January.</TE>
<TE>   Two other Pine Grove male employees were accused of sexually
molesting patients in 2000, according to depositions and hospital
documents produced during the discovery phase of the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police detectives investigated the men, but
prosecutors declined to file charges--in one case due to insufficient
evidence, in the other because the victim did not want to revisit the
incident in interviews. One of the employees was fired and the other
resigned during separate internal investigations, according to
hospital documents.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Police Don't Take the Issue of Occupational
Safety Sitting Down</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm ashamed to say I initially felt some relief when I read that an
occupational safety group is going to publish research suggesting
that bicycle riding may cause sexual problems for some men. You see,
I haven't ridden since my bike was stolen outside Doheny Library
while I was attending USC. (Now I can thank the thief.)</LD>
<LD>   Then again, some of the complaints about erectile dysfunction and
numbness were made a few years ago by members of Long Beach's Marine
Patrol bicycle unit (more details on www.cdc.gov/niosh/bikeofficer.
html). I think we can all agree that numb officers are not good for a
community.</LD>
<LD>   I contacted the Long Beach Police Department and was told that it
had replaced the old-fashioned seats that put pressure on the crotch;
new designs have wedges cut out to relieve the pressure on sensitive
areas. I asked one former Long Beach bicycle officer something I
never envisioned asking a policeman back when I was in journalism
school: whether he'd had any sexual problems. Keeping it on a
scientific plane, he answered that he hadn't, adding the new seats
had been in place when he started cycling.</LD>
<TE>   Have it your way: Tom Willard of L.A. sent along a sales receipt
from McDonald's that showed the wide range of toppings available for
one ice cream selection (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: Visiting the L.A. Zoo, Elizabeth Johnston
of Chatsworth saw a sign warning against the transporting of a
hard-to-grasp item (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of removals: I wasn't aware that some people apparently
require devices to help them take off their footwear until Mark
Zeavin of Altadena showed me one ad.</TE>
<TE>   On the road: Bob Patterson of Alta Loma found evidence of a
movement in Michigan to make death and tax cuts inevitable (see
photo).</TE>
<TE>   What in tarnation? Stan Spero of Westlake Village, sales manager
of the Angels when the team was formed in 1961, recalls how President
Nixon often sat in owner Gene Autry's luxury box at Anaheim Stadium.
"One day, Mr. Autry gets a letter from the president," Spero told the
Ventura County Star, "and it says, 'Dear Gene, I enjoy watching the
baseball games with you. Thank you for being so hospitable. Please
give my best to Trigger and Dale -- President Nixon.' "</TE>
<TE>   Oops. Wrong cowboy. Trigger was Roy Rogers' horse and Dale Evans
was Rogers' wife.</TE>
<TE>   Spero added that Autry was so amused by the letter that he framed
it and hung it in his luxury box.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Weird-song historian Dr. Dimento will lead a hearse
procession through the streets of Costa Mesa on Sunday, then conduct
two live shows at the Costa Mesa Fairgrounds. You can be sure he'll
play such favorites as Oingo Boingo's "Dead Man's Party," Warren
Zevon's "Werewolves of London," The Who's "Boris the Spider," and
"Werecow" by Flippy T. Fishhead and the Mighty Ground Beeve.</TE>

<LD>San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies met with their Los Angeles
counterparts and launched an investigation into the killing of a
15-year-old East Los Angeles girl who disappeared Friday morning as
she walked to a friend's home.</LD>
<LD>   Brenda Sierra's body was discovered Saturday in a remote wooded
area in the San Bernardino Mountains near Crestline and Lake
Arrowhead.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities were awaiting results of an autopsy late Tuesday, said
San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department spokesman Chip Patterson.
The body had signs of injuries, Patterson said, but officials
declined to reveal what the injuries were. There was no obvious cause
of death, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Officials were also investigating whether Sierra was sexually
assaulted., He said authorities had made no arrests and had no
information about a possible suspect or motive. He also said it
remains unclear whether a stranger or an acquaintance was responsible
for the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "We're open to any possibility right now, until and unless we get
some more concrete information," Patterson said. "It's just very
open-ended, and in the early stages. We're going to be working
backward, piecing her life together."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities know so little about the case that they aren't even
sure where they will formally locate the crime scene. For now, San
Bernardino County and Los Angeles County have joint jurisdiction over
the case, Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   It appears that the body was dumped in the wooded area, Patterson
said.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't know anything at all about what transpired before
that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra left her house on South Leonard Avenue at 7 a.m. Friday.
She was en route to a friend's house a few blocks away, and then
planned to ride to Schurr High School in Montebello.</TE>

<HD>Sister Held in Murder-for-Hire Case</HD>
<DH>She and a co-worker are suspected of arranging a hit on the
Buena Park businessman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben and Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The slaying of a Buena Park businessman has taken a strange twist
with the arrest of his sister on suspicion of hiring a hit man to
commit the killing.</LD>
<LD>   Police initially suspected road rage or robbery in the Oct. 2
fatal shooting of David Montemayor, a 44-year-old father of three who
owned a Compton trucking business. Three members of the Pacoima Flats
street gang were arrested the day of the shooting. Two other gang
members were arrested Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But on Saturday, authorities arrested the victim's sister, Deborah
Ann Perna, 46, and a co-worker, Edelmira Corona, 25, on suspicion of
hiring the gang members to kill Montemayor. Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan
Schroeder said all seven defendants are being held without bail at
the Orange County Jail.</LD>
<TE>   Charges against all seven defendants have been enhanced based on
allegations that the killing was gang-related and committed in the
commission of a robbery, Schroeder said. The special-circumstance
allegations make the defendants eligible for the death penalty.
Charges against each include murder, conspiracy to commit murder and
kidnap for robbery in which death resulted.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, investigators believe Perna arranged
on Aug. 1 for Anthony Navarro, 35, to kill her brother. In exchange
for the murder, Perna told Navarro--one of the men arrested
Friday--that he could rob Montemayor and keep the cash.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in shock," Susan Montemayor, the victim's wife, said Tuesday.
"I'd never imagine that she'd orchestrate all of this."</TE>
<TE>   Darren Montemayor, the victim's brother, also was surprised to
hear of the charges against his sister.</TE>
<TE>   "She's innocent," Darren Montemayor, 37, said. "I'm her brother. I
know how she is."</TE>
<TE>   Police say Perna gave her brother's address and phone number to
Corona, who passed it to Navarro. He, in turn, arranged for three
other gang members--Armando Macias, 26, Alberto Martinez, 24, and
Gerardo Lopez, 17--to kidnap Montemayor, they contend.</TE>
<TE>   Though the exact sequence of events is unclear, investigators
believe the attackers shot Montemayor after an argument about a mile
from his home in Buena Park. His body was found in the street.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have not explained what motive they suspect. But the
victim's wife said he was about to gain sole control of the business
with the retirement of his father. And though his father was
tolerant, David Montemayor was critical of his sister's performance
at work, Susan Montemayor said.</TE>
<TE>   Perna, divorced with three teenage sons, has worked about two
years as the company's office manager, Susan Montemayor said.</TE>

<HD>Teacher Put on Leave Over Letter About Black Students</HD>
<DH>Most misbehavior at Pasadena school is by African
Americans, he says in predicting low API scores. Inquiry on his
actions is planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jose Cardenas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Pasadena high school teacher has been placed on administrative
leave for disseminating a letter stating that, at his campus, most
students who misbehave and are low academic achievers are African
American.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Phelps, a 12-year science teacher at John Muir High School,
denied in an interview that his comments in the letter he placed in
teachers' mailboxes were meant as racial insults.</LD>
<LD>   Phelps, 39, said he was trying to predict that bad student
behavior -- which, in this case, he said applies to many in Muir's
large African American population -- will be responsible for the
school's low Academic Performance Index scores next year.</LD>
<TE>   The letter was also meant as a counterattack to the bad rap he
said teachers in his district get from administrators about low
student achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "My intent was to get the district to stop blaming teachers or
holding them solely responsible for performance," he said. "Different
ethnicities are radically different.... I'm saying the behaviors are
radically different, so we need to look at that. Nothing I said is
false."</TE>
<TE>   Phelps was put on administrative leave with pay and benefits,
pending the results of an internal investigation, said Erik
Nasarenko, a Pasadena Unified School District spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, what the district will do is look at the material
... in the context of district policy and state law, to make a
determination to what other action might be necessary, or whether Mr.
Phelps should return to the classroom," Nasarenko said.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiry -- which the district aims to complete within a week
-- will, among other things, consider whether the letter created an
offensive and hostile environment for the students.</TE>
<TE>   Phelps, a Caltech graduate and outspoken teacher, first posted the
letter in an Internet chat room where the school district is
frequently criticized.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday he also placed copies of it in his colleagues' boxes.</TE>
<TE>   The somewhat rambling letter touches on several points.</TE>
<TE>   * It states that this year the school's improvements in its API
scores were aided by two "good cohorts": the sophomore and senior
classes.</TE>
<TE>   * But then it warns that next year the school won't meet its goal
because two "bad cohorts" -- this year's freshmen and juniors -- will
hold back the scores.</TE>
<TE>   * The reason why the two classes are bad cohorts, the letter says,
is bad behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "But overwhelmingly," part of the letter reads, "the students
whose behavior makes the hallways deafening, who yell out for the
teacher and demand immediate attention in class, who cannot seem to
stop chatting and are fascinated by each other and relationships but
not with academics, in short, whose behavior saps the strength and
energy of us that are at the front lines, are African American."</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually," the letter continues, "someone in power will have
the courage to say this publicly."</TE>
<TE>   The letter also says many African American students, those whose
parents are involved with school, are well-behaved. It says that
because Muir is almost half African American, most of the badly
behaved students are African American.</TE>
<TE>   The district acted after some teachers who received the letter
complained, Nasarenko said.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the community, rejecting Phelps' correlation of bad
behavior and learning, took offense to what they saw as a racial
sideswipe.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're an African American student in Mr. Phelp's class and
you read this, are [you] going to go up or down?" asked Bert
Voorhees, a civil rights attorney and past president of the NAACP's
Pasadena chapter. "Mr. Phelps contributes with his racism to some of
the problems he says he wants to tackle."</TE>

<HD>UCI Enrollment at Record Level</HD>
<DH>Biggest jump is in graduate students, lured by recruiters,
grants and greater opportunities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enrollment at UC Irvine has hit record levels this fall, jumping by
the largest number of students since the university opened in 1965.</LD>
<LD>   The increase was propelled by an 11.7% gain in graduate students
over last year, the result, in part, of efforts by campus officials
to raise their numbers and the trend for people to seek advanced
degrees when the job market is tight.</LD>
<LD>   Total UCI enrollment increased 8.7%, to 23,779, university
officials announced Tuesday. Undergraduate numbers rose 8.6%, to
19,401.</LD>
<TE>   UCI's increase ranks it third in rate of growth among University
of California campuses generally regarded as expecting the greatest
expansion in the next few years as the number of college students
grows. UC Riverside enrolled 10.4% more students this fall than last,
and UC San Diego grew 9.1%.</TE>
<TE>   UCI has been projected to gain about 1,000 students a year until
2010, when enrollment is expected to hit 30,000. UC Riverside is
planned to grow from its current enrollment of almost 16,000 to
21,000.</TE>
<TE>   Adding graduate students has been a goal of all UC campuses. A
commission appointed by UC President Richard Atkinson and the regents
last year said the system needed to add 11,000 graduate students and
to spend an additional $215 million annually to remain competitive
with major research campuses around the nation.</TE>
<TE>   UCSD increased its graduate student population by 10.7%.</TE>
<TE>   UCI's 11.7% marks the second year of substantial growth in
graduate students; last fall saw an 8% increase.</TE>
<TE>   "Actions of the last couple of years are beginning to pay off,"
said William Parker, UCI dean of graduate studies.</TE>
<TE>   He also credited expanding graduate opportunities, such as a new
program in biomedical engineering and increased recruiting.</TE>
<TE>   Another key, he said, was adding $7.5 million for teaching and
researching assistantships and for fellowships, helping the school
lure promising students away from other institutions. This is in
addition to $4.5 million added last year.</TE>
<TE>   The number of graduate students at UCLA also increased this year,
but the numbers were unavailable Tuesday. Jim Turner, UCLA's
assistant vice chancellor for graduate studies, said that the number
of applicants increased 22% and that he expected 150 to 200 more
students than last year.</TE>
<TE>   UCI's increase in students is the highest percentage since 1973,
when the then-8-year-old campus increased its student body 13.3%.</TE>
<TE>   This year's enrollment growth surprised UCI officials, who
expected a gain of 5% to 6%, said Manuel Gomez, vice chancellor of
student affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the undergraduate gain came from an increase in community
college transfers, nearly 9% more than the previous year. The
university has long had partnerships with local community colleges,
guaranteeing acceptance to students who completed their first two
years at the two-year schools.</TE>

<HD>Hopefuls Aiming to Improve Services</HD>
<DH>Six from the mostly Latino, blue-collar 4th district seek
voice on a Valley city council.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nita Lelyveld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Rebecca Galvan first heard about San Fernando Valley secession a
few years ago, the elementary school teacher didn't know how she felt
about the idea. But as a lifelong Pacoima resident, she knew one
thing:</LD>
<LD>   "I figured that if this comes to pass, we need somebody Latino in
our corner."</LD>
<LD>   She took up the challenge herself as one of six candidates for the
proposed Valley city's 4th council district, which will only exist if
secession passes Nov. 5. The population of the district, which
includes parts of Arleta, Pacoima, North Hollywood, Sun Valley and
Panorama City, is more than three-quarters Latino.</LD>
<TE>   Galvan, 44, said if she represented the area, she would push for
better city services -- the central theme of 4th district campaigns
-- from faster police response times to more frequent street paving.</TE>
<TE>   Galvan, who over time has become a passionate secession advocate,
teaches second grade at San Fernando Elementary School. In the
independent city of San Fernando, which is not involved in the
secession movement, she sees the sort of civic attention to detail
missing in the rest of the northeast Valley. There, she said, streets
get swept every week and the police arrive quickly when called.</TE>
<TE>   "Pacoima, it's the Watts of the Valley, and everything gets dumped
here," said Galvan, who still lives in the house where she grew up.
"Every open space, things get dumped."</TE>
<TE>   Complaining to Los Angeles city officials is useless "unless you
know someone," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Bonilla, 50, former president of the Arleta Chamber of
Commerce &amp; Residents Assn., said 20 years of fighting graffiti, crime
and other problems in Arleta make him qualified to represent the
proposed district. The city neglects the northeast Valley because its
blue-collar residents "don't pay the big campaign contributions," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has a right to be given the same level of service,
regardless of what kind of money they make," said Bonilla, a computer
company program director who briefly entered the Los Angeles City
Council race won last year by Wendy Greuel. Bonilla dropped out after
failing to collect enough valid petition signatures.</TE>
<TE>   He said he has visited 8,900 households so far. He hears the same
concerns everywhere -- about rutted streets, inadequate streetlights,
streets that "become lakes when it rains" because of a lack of
sewers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to live with no sidewalks," he said. "When it rains, our
families have to walk through the mud. Give me a break here.</TE>
<TE>   "We elect people to represent us and then they spend all their
time downtown. They rarely put in a full day's work or a half a day's
work or even an hour's work in the community. We need to be
proactive."</TE>
<TE>   Like other candidates, Bonilla said he is not raising money, just
getting his message out through face-to-face discussions and homemade
pamphlets.</TE>
<TE>   Jose San Miguel, 59, a former machinist and a marathon runner, is
walking and running door to door to get his message out. The 32-year
resident of Pacoima said his neighbors have improved the area since
he moved there by helping to reduce crime. "But there are actually no
improvements from the city itself," he said.</TE>
<TE>   An activist who worked to get bathrooms and more parking at the
Hansen Dam Recreation Area, where he regularly runs, Miguel said
residents are tired of bad schools, crumbling streets and a lack of
police officers.</TE>
<TE>   "Many other areas are much worse than this," he said. "But the
leaders, they do not lead anymore. They do not help the people. One
thing I can guarantee if I get this position: I will be walking the
streets with my people every day."</TE>
<TE>   Another candidate, Sam Sarkis Solakyan, 21, lives right on the
edge of the proposed district, in North Hollywood. Some parts of the
area seem abandoned by the city, said Solakyan, the owner of a
medical transportation company who has lived in the Valley for about
10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very highly minority populated--Latinos, Armenians, people
from Thailand. "They're doing the best they can, but there are
streets where it's just pitch black, no light," he said. "Don't
[officials] in the city ever drive around and see this?"</TE>
<TE>   Solakyan also said he would focus on improving basic services. He
believes his age would help him get young people involved in their
community, steering them away from crime, he said.</TE>
<TE>   His wants to create a Valleywide mentoring program that would pair
youths with professionals, who could show them better options for
their future.</TE>
<TE>   William Godfrey Davis, 59, said his concern about young people is
one reason he became a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a lawyer who lives in the Hansen Hills area, said the 4th
district needs after-school programs that would keep teenagers out of
gangs. "We're not getting our fair share of our tax dollars by way of
services and attention," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis said he is not campaigning because he believes that, at
least this time around, secession has no chance of passing and the
14-seat council will not exist.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe that this is a start and that it will build up the
momentum," he said. "But nobody has poured the kind of money into
secession as the Los Angeles community has poured into the fight
against it."</TE>
<TE>   Candidate John Maddalo, 49, a Sun Valley real estate broker, also
has spoken out about poor services in the area. He plans to push to
create an 800-number that people could call to report problems --
from a busted streetlight to a stray dog. The operator would forward
the complaint to the appropriate council member, the department
responsible for fixing the problem and the mayor, and follow-up would
be swift, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maddalo said he believes both the Valley and Los Angeles would
benefit from secession.</TE>
<TE>   "They're dragging us down and we're dragging them down," he said.</TE>

$570,000 a year from the general fund.</DH>

<LD>Ventura County supervisors Tuesday approved a $1-per-vehicle fee to
pay for updated fingerprinting technology at police departments
across the county.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors rejected the proposal two weeks ago because it had
been presented as a routine, automatically approved item, and they
wanted details on how the $570,000 a year would be spent. The funds
will be put into a trust fund.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Frank Schillo, the dissenter in the 4-1 vote, said
people who get fingerprints should pay the full cost of the services.</LD>
<TE>   "I really can't see taxing everyone for that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the majority said that if they didn't approve the levy, which
will be tacked onto motorists' annual vehicle license fee, the county
would have to dip into general funds to cover the cost of buying and
maintaining the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Justice has mandated that local
governments begin collecting fingerprints electronically, using
scanning equipment, instead of inked prints on paper. Under state
law, the $1 fee will end in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Judy Mikels praised the legislation and said the county
should not waste the opportunity to collect the revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't institute this, we're going to end up paying for
[upgraded equipment] anyway," the Simi Valley supervisor said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department will buy upgraded machines that capture
images of palms as well as fingers, Chief Deputy Dante Honorico told
board members. Machines will be added to police agencies in
Camarillo, Santa Paula, Ojai and Fillmore, and larger departments
will install a second scanner, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous education, child care, business and social service
organizations require fingerprinting of employees. The additional
machines will make the process faster and more efficient, Honorico
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety percent of fingerprints are of criminal suspects. The rest,
about 16,000 each year, are done for employment-related purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Although it costs at least $75 for each set of prints, the county
by law can charge only $10, he said. The trust funds will be tapped
to make up the difference, Honorico said.</TE>
<TE>   About two-thirds of the state's 58 counties have adopted similar
fee increases, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe this is the most equitable way to finance this
important public safety program," the chief deputy said.</TE>

<HD>Supervisors Agree to Accept Mexican IDs</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors unanimously agreed Tuesday to accept a
Mexican-issued identification card as valid ID for residents
conducting business at county government offices.</LD>
<LD>   "It really makes me proud of the board to see this vote," said
board Chairman John Flynn, who brought the proposal to his
colleagues. Flynn's Oxnard-based district has the county's largest
immigrant population.</LD>
<LD>   Mexican Consul Fernando Gamboa of the Oxnard consulate said
acceptance of the card, called a matricula consular, is vital because
officials are looking more closely at identification cards since last
year's terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Ventura County supervisors also unanimously agreed Tuesday to
lower -- to 20% -- the percentage of in-home care providers who must
agree to be represented by a labor group before a union can begin
collective bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Hammitt, leader of Service Employees International Union
Local 998 had argued the county's earlier requirement of 30% was too
high because home workers are a hard-to-reach group.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Stenslie, a Human Services Agency director, recommended that
supervisors agree to the change so the union can begin negotiating
wages and benefits for the estimated 1,600 workers affected
countywide.</TE>

<HD>New County Poll System Offers Chad-Free Voting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Got chad phobia?</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County election officials Tuesday offered an
alternative to the type of punch-card machine that threw the 2000
presidential election into chaos: touch-screen voting machines.</LD>
<LD>   Registered voters began using the machines at midday Tuesday to
cast ballots for the Nov. 5 election. The county has installed 21 of
the electronic booths at malls, libraries, city halls and community
centers throughout the area. Voters can use any of the locations,
seven days a week, until Nov. 1.</LD>
<TE>   The county offered touch screens as part of a pilot program during
the 2000 election. Several other California counties, including
Riverside and Alameda, and a growing number of states use electronic
voting.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the wave of the future," Conny McCormack, L.A. County's
registrar-recorder, said Tuesday. "It's becoming more and more
popular."</TE>
<TE>   Critics, including some political scientists and technology
security experts, call the system unreliable and prone to mechanical
mishaps.</TE>
<TE>   Others noted that California does not require that the
touch-screen computers leave a paper trail, meaning there is no
backup in case the computer memory fails.</TE>
<TE>   "I have serious concerns," said Kim Alexander, president and
founder of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit group based
in Davis. "There's no other transaction that is completely paperless,
so why count on touch screens for the one thing that matters more
than anything else?"</TE>
<TE>   Banks store and save data from automatic teller machines, but
Alexander said electronic voting machines fail to offer that kind of
security.</TE>
<TE>   The system has already caused problems. In South Florida, the
epicenter of the 2000 presidential debacle, electronic voting caused
problems during the gubernatorial primary last month, ranging from
workers shutting down the system at the wrong time to delays in
setting up the computers.</TE>
<TE>   Studies show that electronic voting does not seem to affect voter
turnout, McCormack said. "They show it's more a matter of
convenience," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There are six touch screens at each polling site in Los Angeles
County. They resemble a desktop computer and cost about $3,000 each.
About $675,000 has been spent on the program.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles and other California counties are poised to spend
millions of dollars on electronic voting systems by 2004, the
deadline set earlier this year by a federal judge who ruled that the
state must replace outmoded punch-card voting machines. In March,
voters approved a $200-million bond measure to buy new election
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   McCormack said Los Angeles County's 4 million registered voters
will use the touch screens and a paper-based scanner system in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The early-voting option ends Nov. 1 to allow the county time to
provide pollsters with a list of those who have already voted, just
as it does with the absentee voters.</TE>
<TE>   McCormack acknowledged that "there's always a chance" the system
could fall prey to voter fraud. However, she said there is also a
risk with the punch-card method.</TE>
<TE>   San Fernando Valley secessionists were among the first to use the
system Tuesday. They gathered at the Panorama City Mall to cast votes
in favor of Measure F, the Valley cityhood proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a great experience," secession leader Jeff Brain said of
the touch-screen system. "I'm very proud to have made such a historic
vote."</TE>
<TE>   Electronic voting locations and times are available at
www.lavote.net or by calling the county at (800) 815-2666 (option 5).</TE>

<LD>A look at some memorable moments in World Series Game 3 history:</LD>
<LD>   1969 -- New York's Tommie Agee made two spectacular catches to
save five runs and secure a 5-0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles as
the Mets took a 2-1 lead in the Series.</LD>
<LD>   1975 -- The Cincinnati Reds took a 2-1 lead in the Series with a
controversial 6-5, 10-inning victory over the Boston Red Sox in
Cincinnati. In the 10th, Red pinch-hitter Ed Armbrister attempted a
sacrifice bunt and bounced the ball in front of the plate. Catcher
Carlton Fisk collided with Armbrister and threw the ball into center
in an attempt to force Cesar Geronimo at second. Geronimo went to
third -- and later scored the game-winning run -- and Armbrister
moved to second. Home plate umpire Larry Barnett ruled there was no
interference despite heated protests by the Red Sox.</LD>
<TE>   1978 -- New York third baseman Graig Nettles put on a fielding
clinic, making several great plays as the Yankees beat the Dodgers,
5-1.</TE>
<TE>   1981 -- In the year of Fernandomania, the Dodgers beat New York,
5-4, to narrow the Yankees' lead to 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   1989 -- Minutes before Game 3 between Oakland and San Francisco,
an earthquake hit the Bay Area. The game was postponed and the Series
was resumed 10 days later.</TE>

<TE>   Heaven and Fox have mercy on us. I may be retro, but I do not

<TE>   As some of your sportswriters have noted, to call Fox's coverage
of the baseball playoffs terrible is generous. But the writers get
free passes to the games. For fans who can't shell out $350 and up
for a nosebleed seat, we're stuck with TV (using radio for the audio
still doesn't block out the annoying polls and graphics that hide the
game).</TE>
<TE>   Does anyone have an idea how the fans can keep Fox from saddling
us with this kind of hideous presentation again?</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Cain</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm incredibly tired of all the Tom Lasorda interviews at the
World Series. Does he really believe Mike Scioscia and Dusty Baker
(whom he claims to have predicted managerial success for decades
ago), are his proteges and would be nothing without him? Sure,
Scioscia and Baker have picked up a few things from the old manager
along the way, but the credit for their success must be attributed to
their own intelligence, experience and character.</TE>
<TE>   Where was Tommy when he allowed Dusty to be cast aside by damaging
innuendo and when the Dodgers unfairly fired Mike? Tommy, the
perpetual hypocrite, also is quick to remind us of former players and
associates he no longer speaks to because of past petty issues. Will
a pennant, batting title or other notable accomplishments put them
back in good graces so Tommy can jump on their bandwagon and continue
to have a forum to deliver his self-promoting message?</TE>
<TE>   Sports journalists and reporters who have been intimidated seldom
confront these flaws in Tommy's character.</TE>

<TE>   *I am hoping The Times can get the word out to Fox that Anaheim is

<TE>   As an avid Angel fan, I don't expect them to understand that we
don't want to be associated with L.A. or whatever promotional items
they put on TV to boost ratings. I cheer for the Angels for better or
worse and I live 50 miles to the south, where skies are clearer, our
freeways less congested and our team is in the World Series.</TE>

<LD>The World Series? How about the Pacific Coast Highway Series?</LD>
<LD>   A trip around the world would span just shy of 25,000 miles. A
trip from Edison Field in Anaheim, home of the Angels, to Pacific
Bell Park in San Francisco, the Giants' turf, goes about 420 miles.</LD>
<LD>   Call it what you want, but Major League Baseball's championship
series has never been very worldly.</LD>
<TE>   Unless, of course, the focus is on the hometowns of the players
rather than the teams.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 50 players on the World Series rosters, 11 -- six from the
Giants, five from the Angels -- were born outside the United States.
And major league baseball is wont to miss an opportunity to bring its
product to hometown fans -- even if the town is Montecristi in the
Dominican Republic, or Fukuoka, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the international telecast of the World Series had an
audience estimated to be more than 100 million, generating more than
$50 million for baseball in television rights. This year's Series is
being televised in 224 countries and in 14 languages. And 225 of the
1,200 credentials issued to media covering the games went to foreign
press representing 13 nations besides the U.S. -- although the
Jerusalem Post has been a no-show.</TE>
<TE>   Where it's not being televised, baseball is offering streaming
video over the Internet at a cost of $4.95 a day, or $19.95 for all
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly we've become a global game," said Paul Archey, president
of Major League Baseball International. "Having the diversity of
players we have in baseball is what really drives the interest."</TE>
<TE>   On opening day, 26% of players on major league rosters were born
outside the U.S., including Sammy Sosa, Ichiro Suzuki and Pedro
Martinez, some of the biggest names in the sport. Indeed, at July's
All-Star game the percentage was even higher -- 23 of 60.</TE>
<TE>   So while a World Series between California teams a freeway drive
apart might not be of any interest in Beijing, or even New Jersey,
it's of prime interest in Japan and Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, the games might best be remembered as "The Shinjo
Series," in honor of Tsuyoshi Shinjo, reserve outfielder, part-time
designated hitter, most-times
cheering-from-the-top-step-of-the-dugout member of the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Shinjo is the first Japanese player to appear in the World Series,
so even though his role has been minimal in the first three games,
his every move is footnoted for posterity by the 15 newspapers and
four television stations from Japan that are covering the event.</TE>
<TE>   National broadcaster NHK's coverage of the first game was
dominated by Shinjo footage, with Japanese commentators breathlessly
providing updates such as: "Here's the first Japanese to bat in a
World Series," "Shinjo made the first swing by a Japanese in the
World Series" and "Shinjo made the first World Series hit by a
Japanese."</TE>
<TE>   Japan's largest daily newspapers, Yomiuri Shimbun and the Asahi
Shimbun, both published photographs of him on their front pages the
next day. Various sports pages gave his hit -- in his second at-bat,
Shinjo lined a single to right-center -- prominent coverage under
such headlines as "Shinjo Beats the Pressure," "Magnificent First
Battle" and "Hit Fires Up Teammates."</TE>
<TE>   "We Envy You, Shinjo" gushed a headline in the sports tabloid
Nikkan Sports. "First Hit By Japanese in the World Series!"</TE>
<TE>   Although Shinjo is a reserve, the spike in his popularity can be
traced to relatively low expectations for him -- in stark contrast to
their hopes for national hero Suzuki, who many expected to lead the
Seattle Mariners to the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't expect much from Shinjo, but when he actually achieves
something it's impressive," said Yasushi Ishibe, a tour guide. "When
Ichiro doesn't do well, it's very disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   Across the globe in Venezuela, young Francisco Rodriguez's
surprising rise to a starring role for the Angels has become a
welcome distraction for a nation overwhelmed by a general strike and
seemingly ever-increasing political turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   The 20-year-old right-hander, who has been the winning pitcher in
five of the Angels' nine postseason victories, was a relative unknown
until a month ago when he was first called up to the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in the Caracas sports sections, details of his exploits get
prime play beside accounts from games between the Venezuela Lions and
the La Guajira Sharks, longtime bitter rivals in the Venezuelan pro
league.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, which has produced many major leaguers, sports sections
trumpet the showdown between Los Gigantes de San Francisco vs. Los
Serafines de Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   In the capital, Tuesday's edition of Reforma carried the headline,
"Latin American Duel," previewing the Game 3 pitching matchup of the
Giants' Livan Hernandez, a Cuban, against the Angels' Ramon Ortiz, of
the Dominican Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for Hernandez, who was hit hard by the Angels, Cuban
newspapers aren't covering the Series. However, outlets from
Australia, Canada, the Dominican Republic, England, Germany, the
Netherlands, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Panama and Puerto Rico are.</TE>
<TE>   While that leaves plenty of real estate that still doesn't know of
a rally monkey, or that Salmon is an outfielder as well as a fish,
there are many in baseball who believe the major leagues will one day
span the world.</TE>
<TE>   When he imagines what baseball might be like in the future, former
Dodger president Peter O'Malley sees leagues in Japan, South Korea
and Taiwan, and maybe in places such as Ireland, Italy and China.
There would be working relationships between the leagues and
eventually, he said, "a true international league."</TE>
<TE>   "It will probably have a different name, World Baseball," he
added, "and with supersonic travel, teams won't be coming from New
York to L.A. to play baseball, they will be going from New York to
L.A. to Tokyo."</TE>
<TE>   His vision is shared by, among others, Don Fehr, head of the
players' union.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably not terribly likely in the next several years, but
if you stretch it out far enough, sure, I would hope so," Fehr said
of the likelihood of an international league.</TE>
<TE>   Added Judy Heeter, director of business affairs and licensing for
the union: "We see fans all over the world following major league
baseball on TV, the Internet, and wireless. We can all imagine. We
have all been working on a World Cup concept for baseball. We would
very much like to see major league players in the Olympics. Growth in
any sport often follows participation in Olympic sports because the
national federations will develop programs."</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger manager Tom Lasorda, who is familiar with strides
being made in the Far East, says to watch out for China, which he
predicts will come a long way in the six years they have before
hosting the Olympics in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   "Once [the Chinese] get adapted to playing, they are going to be
good players," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually," he added, "you're going to see a real World Series."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Richard Boudreaux, Gary Klein, Mark Magnier
and Larry Stewart contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- It is beyond dizzy, beyond Babe, beyond belief.</LD>
<LD>   ErstaddoubleGlaussingleSpieziotriple.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels' intermittent showers of early October have become a
full autumnal downpour, raining line drives and bloops and despair,
leaving the San Francisco Giants choking wet.</LD>

<TE>   Everyone at this World Series should stop talking about the juiced
ball and start worrying about the invisible tee.</TE>
<TE>   WitasickreplacedbyFultzreplacedbyRodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' 10-4 victory over the Giants in Game 3 at Pac Bell
Park Tuesday was, once again, one long gasp.</TE>
<TE>   For two consecutive games, a parade of Angel hitters have calmly
stepped to the plate, aimed their bats at the increasingly wide and
childlike eyes of Giant pitchers, and laid a real Dr. Seuss on them.</TE>
<TE>   Balls in gaps, balls off walls, tall balls, small balls, every
ball falls.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully they hit themselves out," said a weary Dusty Baker, the
Giant manager.</TE>
<TE>   Two games, 21 Angel runs, 32 Angel hits, a two-games-to-one lead
over a team that is now slumped in a corner with its head in a
bucket.</TE>
<TE>   Nah. Feels like there's more.</TE>
<TE>   Watch the Angel team bus drive up to the stadium five hours before
today's Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   Notice how, even though there will be later buses, all the
regulars will be on the early express.</TE>
<TE>   Notice how they will file into the clubhouse and head for the
indoor batting cages, steamy work, boring work, hitting balls off
tees and strings and soft tosses.</TE>
<TE>   "Who does it?" asked David Eckstein with a surprised grin. "Well,
um, we sort of all do it."</TE>
<TE>   They do it so much, the Angels have the only batting coach in the
league whose job entails telling players when to stop hitting.</TE>
<TE>   "I usually only get 25 swings in there before Mickey [Hatcher]
chases me out," said Eckstein. "It's the same with everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, there's probably more.</TE>
<TE>   And when it ends, the Angels could be the greatest hitting team in
baseball postseason history.</TE>
<TE>   The new Big Red Machine.</TE>
<TE>   Already they have become the first World Series team to send the
entire batting order to the plate twice in consecutive innings.</TE>
<TE>   Already, they have become only the fourth team to score 10 or more
runs in consecutive World Series games.</TE>
<TE>   And today, they could remind up of the 1932 New York Yankees and
1990 Cincinnati Reds on their way to the most impressive team hitting
record of all. Those teams share the mark for hits in a four-game
series with 45.</TE>
<TE>   After three games, the Angels already have 41.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the series, the players were aware of what happened to me
in 1988, and I told them the same thing could happen here," said
Hatcher, surprise hitting star for the Dodgers world championship
team that year. "I told them to leave it on the field, show them who
you are, don't let anybody intimidate you."</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by reporters late Tuesday, Hatcher glanced down at a
St. Christopher medal that was appropriately adorned with the picture
of a hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "But I never dreamed we'd do it like this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At first blush, you want to say, wake up, this is only happening
because the last two Giant starting pitchers have come up tiny.</TE>
<TE>   After all, hasn't it been Russ Ortiz and Livan Hernandez who have
really started it all, throwing only 12 out of 36 first-pitch
strikes, falling behind and allowing the Angels to swing easy?</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, that would be true, if this had only happened the last two
nights and only to those two tormented souls.</TE>
<TE>   But what about Roger Clemens. David Wells? Andy Pettitte? Rick
Reed? Joe Mays?</TE>
<TE>   During these playoffs, the Angels clubbed at least eight hits in
less than six innings against each of them.</TE>
<TE>   During these playoffs, an Angel has just tied the great Derek
Jeter with a 12-game postseason hitting streak, and his name is Darin
Erstad.</TE>
<TE>   During these playoffs, another Angel already has 16 RBI, three
short of the postseason RBI record, and his name is ... Scott
Spiezio?</TE>
<TE>   Then came Tuesday night, when a third Angel became the first
player at his position in World Series history to reach base five
times in a game.</TE>
<TE>   A player who, in his previous seven series at-bats, had not
reached base once..</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, Bengie Molina.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if he now felt part of the offense, Molina bristled.</TE>
<TE>   "I am always part of this offense," he said. "We all are. That's
how it works."</TE>
<TE>   It works because the Angels, not yet popular enough or rich enough
to be influenced otherwise, collectively shorten their swings and
submerge their egos and really attempt to hit as a team.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have an answer right now," said Dave Righetti, Giant
pitching coach. "But I have a long drive home."</TE>
<TE>   At this rate, he better live somewhere east of Denver.</TE>

<KH>GAME 3 AT PACIFIC BELL PARK ANGELS 10, SAN FRANCISCO 4</KH>
<HD>Leaders of the Pac</HD>
<DH>Relentless Angels pile up 16 more hits and take a 2-1
advantage over Giants</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- The rally monkey, not invited to perform on enemy
property, must have sneaked into Pacific Bell Park and commandeered
the sound system. There can be no other explanation for the bizarre
musical selection during the sixth inning of Game 3 of the World
Series Tuesday, when out of the speakers suddenly blared the song
"Seein' Red."</LD>
<LD>   Oh, the San Francisco Giants saw red all right, all night. The
Giants saw the men in red get hit after hit after hit. They saw the
men in red circle the bases again and again. They saw the men in red
bat around in the third inning, and again in the fourth, becoming the
first team in World Series history to bat around in consecutive
innings.</LD>
<LD>   The men in red are halfway to the World Series championship. With
16 hits, including three from Darin Erstad and at least one from
every starter except their pitcher, the Angels pummeled the Giants,
10-4. The rout was so thorough that, by the end, the Giant fans
resembled nothing so much as Dodger fans. Beat the Angels? No? Well,
then, beat the traffic and leave early.</LD>
<TE>   "They just kicked our butts, no two ways about it," San Francisco
shortstop Rich Aurilia said. "They beat us every way they could. At
this point, I would say I've never seen a better-hitting team."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, batting .353 in the World Series and .335 in
postseason play, lead the best-of-seven series two games to one. Now
come their two hottest pitchers -- John Lackey in Game 4 tonight and
Jarrod Washburn in Game 5 Thursday -- so they could win the World
Series without returning to Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys are making it look easy," Washburn said. "I'm happy for
them. If they keep hitting the ball like that for two more games,
they can take a nice long break."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are 0-3 in playoff openers this fall and 9-0 in all
other playoff games. In October, the month in which offenses are
traditionally hampered by cool weather and hot pitchers, the Angels
are averaging seven runs per game. In 12 postseason games, they have
batted around six times.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what you're shooting for," Erstad said, "but it doesn't
work like that very often."</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds hit his nightly home run, a majestic shot estimated at
437 feet -- some 48 feet less than the one he hit Sunday in Anaheim.
He is the first player to hit a home run in each of his first three
World Series games. At this point, his feats are those of a cartoon
superhero.</TE>
<TE>   But the team that hit no home runs Tuesday is the team within two
victories of winning rings. They weren't supposed to win without the
designated hitter in their lineup, but they did. They weren't
supposed to be able to score runs during these cool, damp Bay Area
evenings, but they did. San Francisco starter Livan Hernandez never
had lost a postseason game, but he did.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels battered him for six runs before excusing him in the
fourth inning. Erstad's three hits moved him within three of the
record for a single postseason. First baseman Scott Spiezio drove in
three runs, moving him within three of the record for a single
postseason. Bengie Molina became the first catcher in World Series
history to reach base five times in a game without making out, on two
singles and three walks, two of them intentional.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels did not score until the third inning, but they weakened
Hernandez in the second, forcing him to throw 26 pitches. In the
third, he threw 41 pitches. By the time he departed, with two out in
the fourth, he had thrown an astounding 92 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels don't walk much. They don't strike out much. They
simply hit.</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein started the third inning with a walk, forcing
Hernandez to throw six pitches. Erstad followed with a double, on the
fifth pitch. Tim Salmon reached safely on an error, on a ground ball
on the fifth pitch, with Eckstein scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Glaus singled home a run, on a hit-and-run. Spiezio tripled
home two more, on a line drive that kept on rolling, in the endless
space that is right-center field at Pacific Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won not only with their bats, but with their legs and
smarts too. In the fourth inning, with Erstad on second and Salmon on
first, Erstad called his own double steal, figuring that Hernandez
might throw a breaking ball to Garret Anderson. The double steal
worked, and three hits later the Angels had themselves another
four-run inning.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't supposed to be easy, you know, this October baseball
stuff. The Angels know too.</TE>
<TE>   Hitting coach Mickey Hatcher, the man responsible for the offense,
simply shakes his head in wonder. Not even the best strategies work
this well.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't explain what's going on," he said. "The guys can't even
find me right now. I'm afraid I might tell them something wrong."</TE>

<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- Tony Bennett sang the National
Anthem. And did you notice he was not wearing a Giant jacket, but a
neutral World Series jacket? Did he leave his heart in Anaheim,
perhaps? David Eckstein lined a shot back to Livan Hernandez, who
caught it. Darin Erstad grounded to third. Tim Salmon struck out
swinging. No runs, no hits.</LD>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 1, Angels 0 -- So let's get this straight. Taco
Bell has decided that if a player hits a ball that lands on a target
in McCovey Cove, everyone in America gets a free taco. Old Navy has
decided that if a player hits a ball into McCovey Cove, it will give
a children's fund in San Francisco the whopping sum of $500. How much
doesn't Old Navy pay Morgan Fairchild to appear in those awful "Green
Acres" rip-off commercials? Can't they give them that money instead?
Kenny Lofton walked. Bengie Molina picked Lofton off first, but the
umpire blew the call. Rich Aurilia struck out while Lofton stole
second. He was actually out again, but the second-base umpire blew
this call. By the way, today's first-base and second-base umpires are
Willie Mays and Willie McCovey. Jeff Kent hit a check-swing
comebacker that deflected off Ramon Ortiz's glove. Lofton stopped at
third. Barry Bonds was walked intentionally, depriving Americans
everywhere the chance for a free taco. Benito Santiago hit a
check-swing grounder to second, Lofton scored. Runners on second and
third. J.T. Snow grounded to the pitcher. One run, one hit, two left.</TE>
<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 1, Angels 0--How about this: If someone hits a ball
into McCovey Cove, Tim McCarver has to be quiet for 30 seconds.
Garret Anderson grounded to first, pitcher covering. Troy Glaus flied
to center. Scott Spiezio walked. Adam Kennedy hit a ground-rule
double inside the left-field line, Bonds could have caught if he
dived for it, but that might have messed up his uniform. Spiezio had
to stop at third. The ground-rule double cost the Angels a run.
Bengie Molina was walked intentionally. Why aren't they playing the
"Chicken Dance" now? Ramon Ortiz, 0 for 14 in his career, struck out
swinging. Ortiz took off his shinguard before the at-bat. He must
have realized he had no chance of making contact. Ogilvie from "The
Bad News Bears" looked more comfortable at the plate. No runs, one
hit, three left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 1, Angels 0--Reggie Sanders struck out swinging.
David Bell walked. Livan Hernandez sacrificed. Lofton grounded to
first, unassisted. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Giants 1--Eckstein walked. Robin Williams is at
the game. He doesn't have a beard, so his next film must be a comedy.
Erstad doubled to right. Eckstein was running on the pitch, but the
ball was hit so hard, he had to stop at third. Salmon grounded to
third, it took a bad hop and Bell misplayed it, Salmon beat the throw
to first, Eckstein scored. Runners on first and second. Anderson
flied to left. With the runners going, Glaus singled to left. Erstad
scored, Salmon to third. With Glaus going on the pitch, Spiezio
tripled to right-center, Salmon and Glaus scoring. Mike Scioscia must
be related to Kreskin, because he always picks the perfect time to
call the hit-and-run. In a "Sounds of the Game," Dave Righetti
reminded Hernandez to "back up home plate." Now that is showing
confidence. He might as well have told Hernandez to save him a
sandwich when he gets to the clubhouse. Kennedy struck out. Molina
was walked intentionally again. That's two intentional walks for
Molina, one for Barry Bonds. Ogilvie, I mean, Ortiz, grounded to the
left side of the mound, Hernandez threw wide to first and Snow made a
tough play look easy to retire Ortiz. Snow could fall down and still
make the play. Four runs, three hits, one error, two left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 4, Giants 1--Aurilia singled to left. Kent fouled
to first. On three pitches, Bonds struck out. Santiago grounded to
third. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 8, Giants 1--Eckstein grounded to short. Erstad
singled to center. Salmon walked. With Anderson at the plate, Erstad
and Salmon pulled off a double steal. Anderson grounded to first,
Erstad scoring. Jay Witasick pitching. Glaus walked. It looked like
he swung for strike three, but the umpire said no. Spiezio singled to
right, Salmon scoring, Glaus to second. Kennedy lined a shot off
Witasick's right elbow. That had to hurt. The ball deflected into
left field for a single, Glaus scoring, Spiezio to second. Molina
singled to right, Spiezio scoring, Kennedy to third. The Pac Bell
crowd is very, very quiet. Ortiz struck out. Four runs, four hits,
two left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 8, Giants 1--Snow grounded to first, unassisted.
Sanders fouled to first. After fouling off several two-strike
pitches, Bell walked. Pedro Feliz, batting for Witasick, flied to
left. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 8, Giants 1--Aaron Fultz pitching. Eckstein
grounded to short. Erstad singled to left. Salmon flied to left.
Anderson singled to right, Erstad to third. Glaus flied to right. No
runs, two hits.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 8, Giants 4--By the way, the ceremonial first pitch
tonight was thrown by Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Juan Marichal and
Orlando Cepeda. You probably missed it because the geniuses at Fox
never showed it. Lofton flied to right. Aurilia homered to left. So,
if we get lucky and everyone in America gets a free taco, how will
they know who comes back for a second free taco? I mean, you have to
figure Mo Vaughn will get in line 10 times. Kent singled to left.
Bonds homered to deep center, and basically walked around the bases.
The Giants are still trailing by four, Barry. Santiago grounded to
short. Snow flied to left. Three runs, three hits, none left.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 9, Giants 4--Spiezio grounded to short. The fans
are chanting "Beat L.A.!" which would be like fans in Anaheim
chanting "Beat Oakland!" Kennedy was hit by a pitch. Molina walked on
four pitches. Shawn Wooten, batting for Ortiz, popped to first.
Eckstein singled to center, Kennedy scoring, Molina to second. I take
it back, Eckstein does not have the worst throwing arm ever, Lofton
does. He barely reached the cutoff man. A T-Rex could make a stronger
throw. Erstad hit a looper to short. One run, one hit, two left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 9, Giants 4--Brendan Donnelly pitching. Sanders
flied to right. Bell walked. Shawon Dunston, batting for Fultz, flied
to left. Lofton popped to short. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 9, Giants 4--Felix Rodriguez pitching. Salmon
doubled down the left-field line. Anderson flied to center. Glaus
flied to center. Spiezio flied to right-center. No runs, one hit, one
left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 9, Giants 4--Fox finally showed the ceremonial
first pitch. Way to go. Most of the East Coast is asleep. Aurilia
flied to center. Kent flied to center. Bonds walked on four pitches.
After his last walk around the bases, they should have just hit him
with a pitch and been done with it. Santiago popped to short. No
runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 10, Giants 4--The game is now over three hours old.
Game 1 lasted 3:44, Game 2 last 3:57. Coincidentally, next season on
"24", Kiefer Sutherland will track every hour of this World Series.
Scott Eyre pitching. Kennedy flied to left. Molina singled to center.
Benji Gil, batting for Donnelly, singled to left. Eckstein beat out a
grounder to first, loading the bases. Erstad grounded to the pitcher,
but Santiago dropped the throw, so Molina scored. Gil slipped
rounding third and was tagged out in a rundown. Runners on second and
third, two out. Salmon was walked intentionally. Anderson flied to
center. One run, three hits, one error, three left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 10, Giants 4--Scott Schoeneweis pitching. J.T. Snow
singled to left. Sanders hit a looper to second. Bell grounded into a
6-4-3 double play. No runs, one hit, none left.</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 10, Giants 4--Glaus singled to center. Spiezio
grounded into a 6-4-3 double play. Kennedy struck out. No runs, one
hit, none left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 10, Giants 4--Ramon Martinez, batting for Eyre,
struck out. The Giants have a weak bench. Lofton flied to center.
Aurilia struck out. No runs, no hits.</TE>

<HD>Game 3 Winner Ortiz to Have Wrist Examined Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Ramon Ortiz, in line to start a possible Game 7 of
the World Series, is scheduled for examination today after
complaining of stiffness in his right wrist Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ortiz earned the victory Tuesday, pitching the first five innings
of the Angels' 10-4 victory over the San Francisco Giants in Game 3
of the World Series. During the fourth and fifth innings, catcher
Bengie Molina said he noticed that the velocity on Ortiz's fastball
had dropped from 94-95 mph to 88-89 mph, and he asked the pitcher
what might be wrong.</LD>
<LD>   "He told me his wrist was bothering him a little bit," Molina
said.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Angels' medical director, said Ortiz would be
examined today. He said Ortiz already is on anti-inflammatory
treatment routine to pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Ortiz said his wrist felt fine and declined to
discuss the matter further. Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said a wrist
injury would not necessarily explain a drop in velocity and in any
case said he was not overly concerned about Ortiz's wrist.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little stiff," Scioscia said, "but I don't think it's an
issue."</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Donnelly and Scott Schoeneweis followed Ortiz to the
mound, with each pitching two innings of scoreless relief.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Benji Gil expected to start ahead of Adam Kennedy at second
base tonight, a Barry Bonds shift will be particularly pronounced.
Gil has an exceptional arm, so he can play very deep -- at times,
close to right fielder Tim Salmon -- and still be able to throw Bonds
out at first.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie John Lackey has not batted in the major leagues, but he has
hit a game-winning home run in the World Series -- in the National
Junior College World Series, in 1999. As a first baseman-pitcher at
Grayson County College in Texas that year, Lackey hit .428 with 15
home runs. Lackey will start tonight and, with National League rules
in force, he will bat.</TE>
<TE>   He turns 24 today, becoming the third pitcher to start a World
Series game on his birthday. Johnny Podres of the 1955 Brooklyn
Dodgers won on his birthday; Brickyard Kennedy of the 1903 Pittsburgh
Pirates lost on his birthday -- to Cy Young.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the designated hitter benched in an NL ballpark, Scioscia
moved Kennedy from ninth to seventh in the lineup, ahead of Molina.
Scioscia said he believed Kennedy could better protect Scott Spiezio,
who batted sixth. Kennedy is hitting .367 in the playoffs, Molina
.194.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have set a record for home runs in postseason play --
21, and counting. During the regular season, no Angel hit more than
30 home runs. Only three AL teams -- the Detroit Tigers, Kansas City
Royals and Tampa Bay Devil Rays -- hit fewer homers than the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Mickey Hatcher, the Angel hitting coach, recalled playing for the
Dodgers in 1988, when he hit one home run during the regular season
and two during the World Series. "You feel so good about being here,"
he said, "and all that energy gives you a little extra boost."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Darin Erstad has hit in all 12 playoff games, tying the New York
Yankees' Derek Jeter for the longest hitting streak in a postseason.</TE>

<HD>Erstad, Spiezio Help Chill Giants With Hot Hitting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- The Angels filed onto the field for batting practice
before Game 3 of the World Series in Pacific Bell Park on Tuesday
night looking more like the Green Bay Packers coming out of the
tunnel for a December game in Lambeau Field.</LD>
<LD>   Several players donned heavy parkas and knit caps covering their
ears to shield against the chilly conditions, which registered all of
57 degrees. Not first baseman Scott Spiezio, who grew up in Morris,
Ill., and considered this T-shirt weather.</LD>
<LD>   Spiezio, wearing his usual warmup jersey and nothing that could be
purchased in a ski shop, looked at all the cold-weather gear, shook
his head and offered this one-word assessment of his teammates:
"Wimps."</LD>
<TE>   Spiezio looked right at home in the cool, breezy and sometimes
drizzly conditions, and so did teammate and North Dakota native Darin
Erstad. The pair basked in all the elements China Basin had to offer,
combining for five hits, three runs batted in and three runs scored
to help the Angels defeat the San Francisco Giants, 10-4, before
42,707.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad doubled and scored during the Angels' four-run third
inning, and Spiezio highlighted the rally with a two-run triple to
right-center field.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad, the Angel center fielder, singled and scored in the
Angels' four-run fourth, and Spiezio knocked in a run during the
rally with a single, giving him 16 RBIs in the postseason, three shy
of Cleveland catcher Sandy Alomar's record of 19, set in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have played 12 playoff games this month, and Erstad has
at least one hit in every game, the longest hitting streak since New
York Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter hit safely in 12 consecutive
playoff games in 1999. Erstad also has 22 playoff hits, three shy of
Marquis Grissom's record of 25 in a postseason, set for Atlanta in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   "I had long sleeves on too -- I'm not stupid," Erstad said. "But
it does help that you grew up in that type of environment, to deal
with those things."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio, the son of Ed Spiezio, a utility player for the St. Louis
Cardinals, San Diego Padres and Chicago White Sox from 1964-72, was
raised in similar conditions. There were two mounds in the yard of
their Illinois home, and frigid temperatures weren't an excuse to
take a day off.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day it wasn't snowing, we took batting practice," Spiezio
said. "And when it was snowing, we had hitting stations set up in the
basement. That was from the time I was 3 years old right through my
minor league days."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of most hitting sessions, Ed would conduct situational
drills with Scott.</TE>
<TE>   "Then we'd go bases loaded, two outs, bottom of the ninth, full
count, down one, Game 7 of the World Series," Spiezio said. "I'd need
to get on base some way. My whole career, I would think of that
during the regular season, and if you can handle it then, you can
handle it now. But this is the first time I'm using that for a
purpose."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio may not get a chance to reenact those Game 7 situations
against the Giants if he, Erstad and the Angels continue an offensive
onslaught that has resulted in 24 runs on 41 hits for a .353 average
in three games.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad followed David Eckstein's leadoff walk in the third Tuesday
night with a laser of a double down the right-field line. The Angels
tied the game, 1-1, when Giant third baseman David Bell couldn't
cleanly field Tim Salmon's grounder and took a 2-1 lead on Troy
Glaus' RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio then sent a perfectly placed liner to right-center that
rolled all the way to the 421-foot sign, the deepest part of the
park, for a two-run triple.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad sparked the Angels' fourth-inning rally with a one-out
single, and Tim Salmon walked. With pitcher Livan Hernandez paying
Erstad little mind, Erstad took off for third, stealing the base with
a head-first dive while Salmon took second.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad scored on Garret Anderson's groundout, Glaus walked, and
Spiezio came through in the clutch again, banging an RBI single to

Angels a comfortable 8-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to keep pressing, to keep pouring it on as much as
you can, regardless of the score," Erstad said. "It's like playing
prevent defense in football. It's not a good thing to do."</TE>

<HD>Devil Rays Await Word From Piniella</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lou Piniella was offered the job as manager of the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays on Tuesday and now must decide if he wants to work at home or
merely closer to it.</LD>
<LD>   Details of the deal were not disclosed, but it was believed to be
a three- or four-year offer with an average salary that is more than
the $2.5 million Piniella was to earn as manager of the Seattle
Mariners in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Piniella lives in Tampa in the off-season and wants to work closer
to his family. He is also being pursued by the New York Mets.</LD>
<TE>   A ban on major announcements during the World Series forced the
Devil Rays to cancel an afternoon news conference at Tropicana Field,
where General Manager Chuck LaMar planned to give an update on the
club's pursuit of Piniella.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Chicago White Sox general manager Ron Schueler was
interviewed for the same position with the Boston Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Team President Larry Lucchino said the interview with Schueler was
"very positive."</TE>
<TE>   Schueler stepped down as general manager of the White Sox two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 15-year-old boy who ran on the field with his father to attack
a Kansas City Royal coach pleaded guilty and was released to his
family.</TE>
<TE>   The boy and William R. Ligue Jr. were charged in the September
beating of coach Tom Gamboa during a game between the Royals and the
Chicago White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Public Defender Vincent Akers said the boy pleaded
guilty to one charge of aggravated battery and two counts of mob
action for striking Gamboa and an off-duty state trooper who was
working security at the game. At his sentencing Nov. 7 he could face
probation or incarceration until he is 21, Akers said.</TE>

<LD>THE BIG PLAY</LD>
<LD>   There are a couple of candidates, but Scott Spiezio's triple up
the right-center alley gave the Angels a 4-1 lead and control of the
game. Everyone talks about Glaus and Salmon, but Spiezio has
delivered several key hits in the postseason, has five RBIs in the
World Series and has played great defense.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   THE BIG LETDOWN</TE>
<TE>   If you're a Giants' fan, you had to expect a better performance
from Livan Hernandez. The pitcher who had never lost a postseason
game gave up six runs and five hits in 3 2/3 innings. He walked five
and never seemed comfortable on the mound. Now the Giants have to
rely on Kirk Rueter to even the Series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOT IN BOX SCORE</TE>
<TE>   It seemed every time Mike Scioscia called for the hit-and-run, the
batter came through with a hit. In the third, Eckstein was running
and Erstad doubled to right. Later in the inning, he sent Salmon and
Erstad, and Glaus singled. Then he sent Glaus on Spiezio's triple.
Aggressive baserunning is one reason the Angels score so many runs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DID YOU NOTICE?</TE>
<TE>   The fans in Pacific Bell Park waved their rubber chickens and
grooved to the "Chicken Dance" when the Angels intentionally walked
Barry Bonds in the first. But that was a smart move, as the Giants
scored only one run in that inning. The Giants then issued two
intentional walks in the game. As they say, birds of a feather flock
together.</TE>

<KH>BETWEEN THE LINES DEAN CHANCE</KH>
<HD>Angel Offense Worth Watching</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEAN CHANCE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>(Right-hander Dean Chance was an Angel for the team's first six
seasons, then pitched five more seasons with the Twins, Indians, Mets
and Tigers. His finest year was 1964 when, at age 23, he won the Cy
Young Award by going 20-9 with a 1.65 earned-run average, 11 shutouts
and 15 complete games. He was also a 20-game winner with Minnesota in
1967. His career record was 128-115. Chance, now a boxing promoter,
is guest analyst for The Times for this World Series.)</LD>
<LD>   I think this was the biggest game of the playoffs for the Angels,
plain and simple.</LD>
<LD>   They keep that offense going, shut the Giants down when they have
to, guarantee that, at the worst, they'll be going back to Anaheim
and, at best, can win the whole thing in San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   I have seen an awful lot of baseball in my time, but I don't think
I have ever seen an offense quite like this Angel offense. They do
everything. Everybody contributes, everybody does their thing, top to
bottom. And they've really got their confidence going now, too,
because they feed off each other. It's really something to watch.</TE>
<TE>   But I'll tell you something, with all those hits and all those
runs, two plays that might not have gotten a lot of notice were the
keys to the game.</TE>
<TE>   The first came in the first inning. The Giants had runners at
first and third with one out and Barry Bonds coming up.</TE>
<TE>   And the Angels walked him.</TE>
<TE>   You see a great hitter walked all the time with runners at second
and third, but Manager Mike Scioscia went ahead and walked him with
runners at first and third. That takes courage. It was a gamble, a
hunch. It was not the percentage move, but I think it was a smart
move.</TE>
<TE>   And I think it turned out to be a key play because the Angels got
out of that inning allowing only one run. You saw what Bonds did
later on. If he does that early, it's a different game</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the fourth inning. The Angels are leading 4-1, but they
know they are going to need more. They've got [Darin] Erstad at
second and Tim Salmon at first. And Erstad leads the way on a double
steal.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, a key play.</TE>
<TE>   They put the heat on the Giants with aggressive play and they go
on to score four more runs and break the game open.</TE>
<TE>   I love this Erstad. He's like an old-time ballplayer. He hits, he
hustles, he's aggressive and he's smart.</TE>
<TE>   As for the pitching, [Ramon] Ortiz wasn't in there long, but the
biggest thing he did was to shut down the Giants in the third inning
and the fourth, both times after the Angels had scored four.</TE>
<TE>   That just took the heart out of the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, when the Giants came up with their big inning
in the fifth and Bonds hit that big home run, the Angels came back
with a run in the sixth. Just the opposite message: No matter what
you do, we will respond.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE CITY THOMAS BONK</KH>
<HD>It's Baseball, and Foghorns, at Baghdad by the Bay</HD>

<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With apologies to the late, great Herb Caen, newspaper columnist and
Bay Area icon, Thomas Bonk reports on the scene in San Francisco with
the World Series in town.</LD>
<LD>   SAN FRANCISCO -- The World Series is back here this week and it
appears that weather is totally up to the task. The morning of Game 3
was covered by a thick layer of fog. Either that or they started
cooking the garlic fries a little early over at Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<LD>   Anyway, it was so gray outside that everything looked like the
Angels' road uniforms. Whether that's a good sign for a governor
named Gray is unknown, but we do know the state of the weather is
always a lively topic around here, especially when it involves
tourists. It's almost a rite of passage for visitors. They step down
gaily from cable cars, camera straps around their necks, maps shoved
in their back pockets and decked out in their finest summer resort
wear only to be greeted by a whoosh of cold air that freezes the
linings of their lungs and inspires desperate acts to acquire those
fleece sweaters with the nifty SF embroidery. There are hall closets
all over the country full of those things.</LD>
<TE>   This is the tourist uniform, standard issue, but it is not the
style of choice here this week. This is a Giant town, and in a case
of truly impeccable timing, they just happen to be one of the teams
playing in the World Series. People wearing Giant caps and stuffed
inside Giant uniforms, lugging along those huge foam fingers and
carrying baseball gloves, pry their way into the ballpark, eager to
deliver huge wads of cash for tickets in exchange for the opportunity
to swill chardonnay, suck down Krispy Kreme doughnuts, wade through a
forest of garlic fries and watch baseball at the same time. Is
America great or what?</TE>
<TE>   ROVING EYE: At 9:30 a.m., waiters in crisp, white aprons set up
the tables on the sidewalk on Kearney at Cafe Neibaum Coppola.
Double-long buses and cars wrestle for space on Stockton, the most
mercenary of streets in Chinatown, where shoppers compete for room to
walk, jostling Giant caps as they search for fresh fish or fowl. The
best latte in town, at Caffe La Piazza at Columbus and Filbert, is
served up by owner Tony Rivera, a fireman who became famous for
something other than coffee when he escaped injury falling off the
firehouse roof during a skit entertaining neighborhood kids while
dressed as Santa Claus. Next time, book Prancer for that job.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK SHOTS: Who is this Francisco Rodriguez and why was the city
named after him? Of course, it's not. St. Francis of Assisi has that
honor; he is also the Patron Saint of animals. Just wondering ...
does that include the rally monkey? Which brings up ... John Coss
owns a fine restaurant in Vallejo with his partner, Cheryl Stotler.
He is a Giant fan and she is an Angel fan, which can mean only one
thing: They refuse to sit together for the games this week. An
undercurrent of deep resentment runs through the kitchen. "She
ordered a rally monkey and I'm going to kidnap it and deep fry it,"
he said. Can we get a side of garlic fries with that?</TE>
<TE>   Tickets are more valuable than parking spaces this week. It is
believed that no one has ever read those exact words in a sentence
before. Last week, fans dragged their lawn chairs and hauled sleeping
bags to the sidewalk outside the ticket office at Pacific Bell Park
in the faint chance they might acquire a precious ticket to a World
Series game. Giant ticket officials passed out wristbands so the
faithful would not have to stand in line. But others took their place
right away and this ignited a comical interlude. What about handing
out wristbands to those of us without official wristbands, fans said.
No, said the Giant ticket gods, because fans without unofficial
wristbands would then demand wristbands too. Can anyone follow that
logic without a map? A better way to solve the problem in the future
is to pass out fleece sweaters. Everyone is official in those things.</TE>
<TE>   Money experts, and we must always listen to them, say that the
World Series may mean as much as $30 million to the local economy.
Not all that money is derived from ticket sales, of course, but with
tickets fetching as much as $6,000, it is possible that some fans
would then weigh the very heavy dilemma of whether to buy a ticket to
a baseball game or pay the mortgage for three months. This is a
real-life situation, in the opinion of Keith McGregory, a waiter at
Redwood Park, who noted that the restaurant was about two-thirds
full. "They spent all their money on tickets," he said. However,
novelist Danielle Steel had made her choice and dined at a corner
table. Obviously, she had no problem finding a parking space.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants hosted a gala ball Monday night at the Ferry Building,
an event attended by several thousand and such glitterati as Mayor
Willie Brown, former Mayor Frank Jordan, various Giant executives and
former Secretary of State George Schultz. Also on hand was
87-year-old Jessie Foyle from Philadelphia, wearing a floor-length
cloak covered with her tickets from every World Series since 1964. It
was an impressive cloak, not only for its presentation, but also
because it wasn't fleece.</TE>

<KH>GIANT NOTES</KH>
<HD>Jack Snow Is Thrilled to Catch His Son's Act</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>--Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Two games after his son showed up, Jack Snow made his World Series
debut Tuesday, showing up behind the batting cage at Pacific Bell
Park to cheer son J.T. while wearing a Giant jacket.</LD>
<LD>   "I played in two NFC championship games, and neither one compares
to watching your son in the World Series," said Snow, who missed the
first two games in Anaheim because he was busy as a broadcaster for
the St. Louis Rams.</LD>
<LD>   Snow said when the Giants defeated the St. Louis Cardinals to win
the National League pennant, he celebrated more than he ever did as a
Los Angeles Ram receiver.</LD>
<TE>   "I jumped up and down in my living room shouting, 'My son is going
to the World Series,' " he said. "I've never had a feeling like that
before."</TE>
<TE>   Snow, who left Southern California with the Rams and now lives in
St. Louis, confirmed that he and J.T. have patched up old
differences.</TE>
<TE>   "There comes a time when every son gets mad at his dad, only you
don't hear about the other ones," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we went through was very normal. But we're through it now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two Giants, Jeff Kent and Snow, had the same role model: former
Angel second baseman Bobby Grich.</TE>
<TE>   Snow, who grew up in Seal Beach, got his first autograph from
Grich.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have that ball," J.T. said.</TE>
<TE>   Kent, who grew up in Costa Mesa, remembers his father, Alan,
pointing out Grich as the shining example of how to play the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be like him," Kent said, "a guy who got down to the
nitty-gritty, got his uniform dirty, a grinder."</TE>
<TE>   Told of the remarks of Snow and Kent, Grich, an Angel from 1977 to
1986, said, "It gives me goose bumps. I am glad to hear they liked
the way I played the game. I was never afraid to get my uniform
dirty. That was just instinct."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds hopes the Giants retain Manager Dusty Baker, and Hall
of Famer Willie Mays does too.</TE>
<TE>   Mays joined his godson in praising Baker, whose contract expires
after the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had my choice, I would definitely bring him back," Mays said
before Game 3. "If you look at the guys on the team, they respect
Dusty, they know what their job is, they know their roles. Even the
guys that are not playing seem to understand their role."</TE>
<TE>   Mays said Baker's communication skills set him apart from the
pack.</TE>
<TE>   "Dusty is the type of guy ... he'll tell you what's on his mind,"
said Mays, third on the all-time list with 660 home runs. "He can
relate to the guys without any problems. But is Dusty going to be
back? I don't know because that's up to the management. I have no
control over that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bonds and Bobby Bonilla were inseparable as teammates on the
Pittsburgh Pirates and have remained close.</TE>
<TE>   Bonilla, retired and working for the union, spoke with Bonds
during batting practice and said he had never seen him so focused.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really soaking it all in," said Bonilla, who played briefly
for the Dodgers in 1998. "He's stayed away from celebrating because
he wants the ultimate thing. The ultimate thing is the ring and he
definitely has that in focus."</TE>

<HD>Giants' Rotation Keeps Spinning Out of Control</HD>
<DH>Hernandez is the latest San Francisco starter to be knocked
around by the Angels, allowing six runs in 32/3 innings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Livan Hernandez said he wasn't especially upset
about his performance Tuesday night in Game 3 of the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Giant right-hander pitched only 3 2/3 innings in
the Angels' 10-4 victory before 42,707 at Pacific Bell Park, losing
for the first time in seven career postseason decisions.</LD>
<LD>   It was clearly a bad night for Hernandez and the Giants, who now
trail the best-of-seven series, 2-1, but there was only so much he
could do against the Angels.</LD>
<TE>   "They've got a good team and I know that," said Hernandez, who
threw only 47 strikes in 92 pitches. "Those guys are hot, I had to
throw a lot more strikes and I didn't do it.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost my first game, but that's going to happen. You can't win
all your games in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez came close before Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Cuban defector is one of only five pitchers to win his first
six postseason decisions. As a rookie with the Florida Marlins in
1997, Hernandez was selected the most valuable player of the National
League championship series and World Series.</TE>
<TE>   He entered Tuesday's start 6-0 with a 2.84 earned-run average in
eight postseason appearances, including an 8 1/3-inning effort in a
victory over the Atlanta Braves in the division series.</TE>
<TE>   It appeared Hernandez would have a similarly strong outing at the
start against the Angels after he breezed through a 1-2-3 first
inning and escaped a bases-loaded jam in the second when Angel
starter Ramon Ortiz struck out swinging. But again in their stirring
October run, the Angels were only getting started.</TE>
<TE>   They scored four runs in the third and chased Hernandez while
scoring four in the fourth, blowing the game open, 8-1. He gave up
five hits and six runs (five earned) while walking five, and knew
exactly what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised because good teams hit the ball," Hernandez
said. "They wouldn't be here unless they are a good team. I lost the
game and I'm not happy about that. I always want to do [well] for my
team, but those guys hit good pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Well, some of them weren't so good, the Giants conceded.</TE>
<TE>   "Livan pitched a pretty good game but ... some of his pitches were
off a little," said catcher Benito Santiago, who seemingly would
know. "Those guys know how to hit, they wouldn't be here if they
didn't, so if you're off a little that can hurt you."</TE>
<TE>   And umpire Tim Tschida's strike zone could have been better,
Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not a regular strike zone for me," he said. "The umpire
... I think he was a little tight tonight. I threw a lot of good
pitches he called balls."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez's batterymate reiterated that the Angels posed the
biggest problem.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't pitch bad, but those guys hit everything," Santiago
said. "You know that they can do that. We've seen them do that the
other night."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels also pounded starter Russ Ortiz in an 11-10 victory in
Game 2, chasing him after only 1 2/3 innings. Getting only 5
1/3-innings combined from starters in consecutive games isn't a
formula for winning a World Series title, and now the Giants turn to
left-hander Kirk Rueter in Game 4 tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels hit .292 against left-handers during the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Russ didn't throw the ball good and I didn't throw the ball good,
but there's nothing you can do about that now," Hernandez said. "You
just have to win three in a row now. I've seen it happen before and
we can do it. That wouldn't surprise me."</TE>
<TE>   Losing to the Angels didn't either.</TE>

<HD>Historically, Bonds Is a Giant Among Giants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>There is not much more he can do when the Angels allow him to do what
he may do as well as anyone ever.</LD>
<LD>   There are also not many more ways he can affect decisions on
pitching and strategy than he already is and does.</LD>
<LD>   Barry Bonds is having a postseason for the ages after another
season for the ages, but in the context of the World Series there is
this key question:</LD>
<TE>   With the Angels judiciously deciding when and where to pitch to
him, can he get enough help from his colleagues in the San Francisco
Giant lineup or will he be simply out-manned by the deep and
versatile Anaheim offense?</TE>
<TE>   In Game 3, as the Angels continued their October onslaught, Bonds
required so much help that he would have been justified calling in
the Delta Force.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels took a 2-1 lead in the Series with a 10-4 victory in
which they out-hit the Giants, 16-6, and took the Giants and a
Pacific Bell Park crowd of 42,707 out of it early.</TE>
<TE>   It was much later, as he stood at a locker protected from the
media rabble by his black leather lounge chair and personal
television, that Bonds was asked if he could take any satisfaction
from the home run records he is in the process of setting or tying in
this Series and postseason?</TE>
<TE>   "No," he responded cryptically, turning then to what has been his
mantra: "I just want to win, I just want a World Series ring."</TE>
<TE>   Asked then if he could take any satisfaction in the fact that he
is responding to the critics and redeeming his previous postseason
performances -- a .207 average for two division series appearances
before this year and .191 for three trips to the league championship
series?</TE>
<TE>   "What critics?" he said. "You guys? You guys don't bother me."</TE>
<TE>   Little does, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Emerging from the first World Series game in San Francisco in 13
years with a two-run homer, two walks and a strikeout, this is where
Bonds stands:</TE>
<TE>   * His seventh postseason homer set a record for a postseason, and
he became only the second player in World Series history, joining
Hank Bauer of the 1958 New York Yankees, to homer in each of the
first three games and the first in Series history to do it in the
first three games of his career.</TE>
<TE>   * With his two walks, one intentional and one unintentionally
intentional, he tied Gary Sheffield's 1997 record of 20 walks in a
postseason.</TE>
<TE>   With Angel Manager Mike Scioscia reluctant in the first inning
Tuesday night to give Bonds "a chance early in the game to break it
open," he ordered Ramon Ortiz to walk him intentionally (his eighth
intentional walk of the postseason) even though there was a runner
already at first and another on third with one out.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been intentionally walked since 1990," Bonds would say
later. "I've been pitched around for 17 years. There's nothing new in
it and nothing I can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz would get out of the bases-loaded jam with minimal damage,
giving up only a run on two infield grounders.</TE>
<TE>   He then struck out Bonds in the third before grooving a fastball
in the fifth that Bonds drove over the fence in center for a
437-foot, two-run homer.</TE>
<TE>   "If he gets good wood on it," said Angel shortstop David Eckstein,
"the only reason to look is to see how far it goes."</TE>
<TE>   This one didn't go as far as that 485-foot homer in the ninth
inning of Game 2 at Edison Field, but it went far enough for Bonds to
do what comes natural, which is to stand at the plate for a moment
and admire it.</TE>
<TE>   He was at the plate again with two outs in the seventh when
Brendan Donnelly got behind in the count and walked him on four
pitches before getting Benito Santiago on a pop up for the third out.</TE>
<TE>   Said Donnelly, who spent so many years in baseball outposts, so
many years watching the World Series on television:</TE>
<TE>   "You throw him inside and he hits it out, you throw him outside
and he hits in out, you throw him down the middle and he hits it out.
What the hell are you going to do?"</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly added that he was pleased to get the opportunity to go
against "one of the best hitters ever" in the seventh, but "the only
thing is he gets a lot of calls that he shouldn't because he's Barry
Bonds. I was disappointed with a call early in the count, but all you
can say is, 'go to first, big guy, I'll just get the next guy out.' "</TE>
<TE>   Was the big guy frustrated by the results of Game 3?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't get frustrated," Bonds said. "I'm disappointed we didn't
pitch better and didn't play better. When you get behind in the count
like our pitchers did, any team can beat you, and we just weren't
patient at the plate. But you can't take anything away from the
Angels. They took advantage of our mistakes, and you just have to tip
your cap, dress up again tomorrow and try to correct it."</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that won't be easy.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are assured of taking the Series back to Anaheim for a
Game 6, if it's necessary. Their victory in Game 3 should ease some
of the pressure on John Lackey, who starts tonight.</TE>
<TE>   They are batting .353 in the World Series after entering Tuesday
night's game with a .331 average for the postseason, and their
assault in Game 3 came at the expense of a pitcher (Livan Hernandez)
who had been 6-0 in the postseason</TE>
<TE>   "They're good," Bonds said. "They put the ball in play and there's
not many holes in their lineup. We thought we had an advantage with
the pitcher having to bat, but they have a lot of National League
type players and they have guys like Mike Scioscia and Bud Black to
tell them how the game should be play, how it's played in the
National League."</TE>
<TE>   For Scioscia, Bonds doesn't have to say or do anything more ...
please.</TE>
<TE>   "You can talk about any superstar you want, Barry's the guy,"
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's saying a lot when you're talking about guys like A-Rod and
some incredible players in our league. To rank Barry a notch above
... well, I think that says something."</TE>

<KH>Mike Penner SOUND AND VISION</KH>
<HD>McCarver Gets Lost in All the Details</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: What do Troy Percival, Robb Nen and Joe Buck have in
common?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: They are invaluable, irreplaceable stoppers for their
respective World Series teams.</LD>
<LD>   Buck pitches for Fox, meaning he faces the most daunting
assignment of all: putting out the fires set ablaze by partner Tim
McCarver, verbal pyromaniac.</LD>
<TE>   McCarver is sportcasting's equivalent to a 10-run inning --
interesting to a point, invariably too much of a good thing -- and he
was at it again as Tuesday's World Series Game 3 settled in for the
third inning.</TE>
<TE>   Goaded on by Fox's relentlessly roving celebrity-tracking camera,
also known as the Bicentennial Man Sham Cam, McCarver couldn't resist
commenting on a crowd shot of Robin Williams wearing a pair of
sunglasses apparently won in a card game from Elton John.</TE>
<TE>   "How about those glasses Robin Williams had on?"</TE>
<TE>   Uh-oh.</TE>
<TE>   Time to get Buck warming up in the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "Mindy and Mork glasses," McCarver said, sounding a little mixed
up, sounding like he was about to discuss, in exceedingly elaborate
detail, the upcoming confrontation between Hernandez Livan and
Eckstein David.</TE>
<TE>   "Or 3-D glasses," McCarver continued. "For those of you who do not
know what 3-D glasses were, three-dimensional movies came in about 30
years ago ... "</TE>
<TE>   Help! S-O-S!</TE>
<TE>   In heroic fashion, Buck answered the call.</TE>
<TE>   "Just stop!" Buck ordered. "Just stop right now! Just don't! Don't
do it!"</TE>
<TE>   How many thousands of Americans rose to their feet right then to
call out Buck for a standing ovation?</TE>
<TE>   Buck sounded like an exasperated parent -- you could just picture
him shaking his head, or burying it in his hands -- as he sighed and
muttered, "Explaining 3-D glasses ... "</TE>
<TE>   That's McCarver. Usually useful to have around because he knows so
much, often a royal pain in the ears because he knows so much.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, he and Dennis Miller would have made the perfect tandem
-- the two smartest kids in class, Miller talking over everybody
else's head and McCarver providing translation, in exceedingly
elaborate detail.</TE>
<TE>   (Although McCarver needs to brush up on his cinema history. Monday
Night Football came in about 30 years ago; 3-D movies were popular in
the 1950s, shortly before McCarver began his career as a big-league
catcher flashing signs to pitchers. One finger means fastball, which
is a type of pitch, usually delivered at three-quarters overhead
trajectory, with significantly more force and velocity than a
changeup, which can be an effective strategic deception deployed at
times when I show you two fingers ... )</TE>
<TE>   Game 3 was a textbook example of the pros and cons of having
McCarver on hand to narrate the evening's entertainment. During his
pregame comments, McCarver described the Angels as having a more
National League-type playing style than the NL champion Giants.
Moments later, the Angels unleashed their double-stealing,
run-and-hit approach at Pac Bell Park, slapping together 16 hits and
batting around in consecutive innings en route to a methodical 10-4
decision over the swing-from-the-heels Giants.</TE>
<TE>   McCarver broadcasts 20 games a year for the Giants, but didn't let
those ties get in the way when watching a replay of Kenny Lofton
being credited with a stolen base when it appeared Angel second
baseman Adam Kennedy had applied the tag in time. "He was out,"
McCarver declared. "The Giants got [a favorable] call right there."
Rex Hudler, please note.</TE>
<TE>   McCarver gets himself into trouble because he doesn't know when to
quit. He can be a workout for Buck, who knows what Pat Summerall went
through, reining in John Madden's bull-in-the-broadcast-booth all
those years. Sometimes, you have to elbow him off a topic before he
pulverizes it into sawdust. When that fails, you just have to yell at
him to stop it, just stop it.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, McCarver is the ideal baseball analyst for Fox, Fox
being the industry leader in overkill. From the ceaseless
self-promotion to the annoying crowd-and-dugout cutaway shots, Fox
simply doesn't know when to let up.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: Fox showed seven shots of Robin Williams during the
top of the third inning. Either Fox needs to show more restraint or
San Francisco needs more movie stars.</TE>
<TE>   So, how many celebrities will Fox be flying in for Game 4?</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The World Series came to Pacific Bell Park. There was wind and mist
and eerie quiet. There was the thick smell of garlic fries and the
smooth voice of Tony Bennett singing "I Left My Heart In San
Francisco."</LD>
<LD>   But there was no heart in San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   There was no rally here. No monkey either.</LD>
<TE>   Thunder was missing. The sticks were hiding.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the thing about the rally monkey and the noise sticks that
received so much attention and some ridicule when the World Series
started at Edison Field -- without enthusiastic, uninhibited,
excited, ecstatic fans, the monkey would have been a pitiful stuffed
simian and the sticks would have been inflatable chew toys, good for
the family pets to puncture and spit out.</TE>
<TE>   At Pac Bell on Tuesday night, you could talk to your neighbor. And
the guy in front of you. And five rows away. Ten rows away even. You
could talk on your cell phone and hear the other person talk back.</TE>
<TE>   You could hear, loud and clear, the idiot out in left field who
shouted, twice, to Angel left fielder Garret Anderson, "Baboon." And
you could hear the silence, hear that nobody told the idiot to shut
up. Twice.</TE>
<TE>   You could hear one man chant "Beat the Angels, beat the Angels,"
and hear nobody pick up the cheer.</TE>
<TE>   You could see a few people waving orange towels. When only a few
people wave orange towels they are just orange towels. They aren't
Homer Hankies. They are Giant Jokes.</TE>
<TE>   If the World Series comes to Pac Bell and all you hear is silence,
is it really a World Series?</TE>
<TE>   "Our fans have been great," Angel right fielder Tim Salmon said.
"We've had a great atmosphere at home."</TE>
<TE>   There has been a lot of national mocking of Angel fans and the
extra stuff they've used.</TE>
<TE>   Real fans don't need noisemakers, sniffed Eastern columnists. Real
baseball games don't need stuffed toys. It was somehow a
Disney-concocted sacrilege, the rally monkey and red noise sticks.
"Save my hearing," wailed the stuffed-shirt critics. "Ban the
sticks!"</TE>
<TE>   But what seems to have been missed is that noisemakers don't make
noise if nobody bangs them.</TE>
<TE>   What seems to have gone unmentioned is that Angel fans, nearly
every one of them, have been wearing red to games for over a month.
Red shirts, red hats, red pants. And it isn't all newly purchased
Angel paraphernalia. It is just red, right from the closet. It is
spontaneous. And it is universal at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what's wrong with you people," shouted a man with
his face painted Giants' orange on one side and black on the other.
"Get some spirit. We're pitiful." He was standing in line outside the
men's room and the other men in line looked at him. Some shrugged.
Some rolled their eyes. Some didn't do a thing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is embarrassing," said the man, who didn't want to give his
name but who did want to let loose about the sedated fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched how things were in Anaheim," he said. "Those guys were
great. They were noisy whether the Angels were winning or losing. I
noticed how even when the Angels were getting beat in the first game,
their fans never shut up. I don't know what's up here. I can't
believe how dull it is."</TE>
<TE>   Even in the first inning, when the Giants scored first and
actually led, there was polite applause and some perfunctory
shouting.</TE>
<TE>   But the media sitting in the left field auxiliary press area who
worried that the fans in front of them, who stood for Bennett's
singing, would be standing all during the game and blocking the view
were happy to be wrong. As soon as the first pitch was thrown,
everybody sat down. Apparently on their hands. And they stayed down.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, we didn't give our fans anything to cheer about," Giant
third baseman David Bell said. "It's not fair to compare Anaheim to
here. If we give them something to cheer, they'll cheer. We need to
do our part."</TE>
<TE>   That's the difference between Anaheim and San Francisco so far,
though. The fans in Anaheim didn't need the team to get them
involved.</TE>
<TE>   They are involved from the time they hit the parking lot, three or
four hours before the first pitch.</TE>
<TE>   They are involved when they put on the red clothes and eat red
food. There was a tailgating party Sunday at Edison Field, four women
who had brought only red food (tomatoes, tomato soup, red licorice,
frosting on cake and cookies). Appetizing? Maybe not. Addled?
Absolutely.</TE>
<TE>   Such enthusiasm is not to be underrated.</TE>
<TE>   "I've said it before this season," Salmon said, "that our fans
have been great and it does make a difference. The atmosphere
matters. You can get a boost from the noise."</TE>
<TE>   "At first I thought Angels fans were acting silly," Hank Quigley
said. Quigley, 29, from Santa Rosa, was not wearing any black or any
orange, the colors of the Giants. His face wasn't painted. He was
even leaving the game early in the eighth inning. He had, he
admitted, given up.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the Angel fans needed to act like they'd been here
before," Quigley said. "But you know, maybe that's the cool thing.
Those people don't seem to care about how they look. They're just
having fun, win or lose."</TE>

<HD>This Female P.A. Announcer Is a Giant Annoyance to Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The punishment, of course, should fit the crime, so we're probably
all in agreement it should be something cruel and inhumane like
making Andy Rooney sit in Pacific Bell Park and listen to the only
female public-address announcer in Major League Baseball take us from
World Series batter to batter.</LD>
<LD>   Rooney doesn't believe women should be walking the sidelines at
football games, but like most of you, I believe Melissa Stark not
only belongs on the sideline at football games, but anywhere she can
be seen, and even heard if she insists.</LD>
<LD>   In fact the only (Rooney-like) thing that bugs me right now is the
woman they have upstairs on the P.A. at Pac Bell who doesn't know
when to stop chirping.</LD>
<TE>   Now before the name calling starts, or continues in the case of
the female reporter from San Jose who called me a "misogynist"
Tuesday night for asking her the name of the annoying public-address
announcer, let me say that, for the last 30 years, the first voice I
awake to every day is a woman's and the last voice I hear before
going to sleep is a woman's because the wife usually never shuts up.</TE>
<TE>   I also have two daughters who are always asking for money, and one
of them is going to marry a Grocery Store Bagger, so there's no
relief in sight, and I still accept their collect calls.</TE>
<TE>   I've got nothing against a female's voice. You have Demi Moore or
Debra Winger announce the World Series lineups, or put Elizabeth
Hurley on the big-screen scoreboard urging the fans to get excited,
and I might start throwing dollar bills toward the field. Hire Mimi
Rogers, and I'll buy Giant season tickets.</TE>
<TE>   I have no problem with women. My problem is this woman's voice,
every name announced as if she might scream, "Bingo!" and the Giants
are losing by seven runs. A man would be just as annoying. In fact,
if I had a voice like Barry Bonds', I would never speak publicly
again.</TE>
<TE>   I know you've been listening to Tim McCarver and don't have much
sympathy, but imagine listening to Fox's broadcast in its entirety
without using the mute button, or changing channels.</TE>
<TE>   They consider it a San Francisco treat here, of course, a woman
working as announcer at Giants' games, beginning with Sherry Davis in
Candlestick Park, and now continuing here with a local radio
personality, Renel Brooks-Moon, who according to a story in the Press
Democrat, was a cheerleader in high school. And I'm sure a very good
one, which means she got an early start on being annoying.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FRANKLY, I don't know how these people do it. I took my position
as a fan Tuesday night, sitting in the left-field stands, which have
been converted into a holding pen for the press, and I found myself
wishing I was home and watching Fox. That's how miserable the
conditions are here.</TE>
<TE>   I know, I know, you'd give anything to be sitting in my place, a
beer in your hand, clapping and yelling like crazy for the Angels,
and they'd throw you out of the stadium because there's no cheering
allowed in the press area.</TE>
<TE>   Now you know why I never say anything nice about USC -- I'm not
allowed.</TE>
<TE>   As much as you like to think you'd act differently if given the
chance to sit in my place at the World Series, you'd probably put
down $20 for a Giant stocking cap, too, to keep your ears from
freezing and to identify yourself as a "friendly," in the event the
locals started throwing batteries or bottles.</TE>
<TE>   I'm telling you, the baseball experience here stinks. There's the
smell of Gilroy Garlic Fries everywhere. The baseball park is brand
new, and the place reeks, and it obviously has started to take its
toll on the Giants, who stink as well.</TE>
<TE>   We're getting ready to have a parade, and these people have to
come back tonight, hold their noses, watch the Angels whack the
Giants again and</TE>
<TE>   listen to Miss Perky insist everyone make more</TE>
<TE>   noise.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MY FAVORITE sign: "Lucifer was an Angel."</TE>
<TE>   I guess no one told him Lucifer was no good, and had to be sent
down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in several e-mails:</TE>
<TE>   Michael Beatrice: "I went to my first SC game in years. Is it
wrong that the sections of Washington fans were louder than the
entire Coliseum? One alum even asked me to sit down during a crucial
drive. I told a friend we could make a lot of money selling cardinal
and gold thunder sticks. Then I read your article about [Mike]
Garrett banning them. [I don't get it]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jay Foster: "You should've been at the Coliseum back in '98 for
the UCLA vs. USC game. The Bruins had beaten USC eight straight years
and Garrett was desperate to stop the streak. What do you think he
did? He cranked up the sound system and piped in all kinds of noise
to disrupt the UCLA offense, it worked and UCLA hasn't won since. It
sure is funny how [noise] doesn't suit his purposes now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joe Stumpf: "I find myself in an unusual position -- a USC fan who
agrees with you. Conventional wisdom says all great programs have one
thing in common: stability, and not just in coaching and the athletic
administration, but also in its fan base. Garrett is such a divisive
force at USC. As long as he continues to be AD, we'll have a highly
divided fan base....This past weekend we were standing and cheering
on the defense on third down, and some idiot in Section 20, Row 37
had the gall to yell, 'down in front.' He should have his ticket
revoked for behavior like that."</TE>
<TE>   If you had a thunder stick, you could've just bopped him on the
head.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig addressed several issues before
Tuesday's game.</LD>
<LD>   On the reportedly juiced baseball: "If I could let my sarcastic
nature come out, I would. But I can't, so I will say that I have
talked to [Vice President ] Sandy Alderson, talked to everyone
involved, and I am convinced these are the same baseballs we have
used during the year."</LD>
<LD>   On the number of World Series players who disagree with him on
this issue: "With all due respect, this is America, and everybody is
entitled to their own opinion."</LD>
<TE>   On his refusal to allow teams such as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and
New York Mets to fill their managerial vacancies during the World
Series: "We have had a memo in place about this issue for the last
four or five years, and I just wanted to enforce it. These two teams
worked hard to be here and the focus should be on them, on this World
Series, instead of somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   'STICK MEMORIES: Angel Manager Mike Scioscia, when asked to recall
his most vivid memory of Candlestick Park's fans and weather: "The
atmosphere of the fans was incredible. I mean, it was electric.
Sometimes it really was electric if some batteries came at you. And
the weather ... it was incredible.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, at Candlestick, from the time we took batting practice,
it would be beautiful, 70 degrees. We'd go in for a half-hour, a
little after 6 p.m., we'd come back out for the game and you thought
you walked into the Twilight Zone, it felt like it was 30 degrees
below zero with the wind chill. That was the beauty of Candlestick
Park."</TE>
<TE>   MONKEYSHINES: Who says the rally monkey is an Edison Field
phenomenon?</TE>
<TE>   Replica monkeys were being sold outside Pacific Bell Park before
Game 3 for $20.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they came with gallows ropes around their necks, and
several would be seen hanging from the upper decks during the game.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a "CAGE THE MONKEY" pullout from the San Francisco
Examiner was distributed to anyone thinking the celebrated simian's
power extended beyond the Anaheim city limits.</TE>
<TE>   SPIRIT OF GIVING: First baseman Jim Thome of the Cleveland Indians
won the Roberto Clemente Award, given for exemplary behavior on and
off the field.</TE>
<TE>   Thome has helped raise more than $400,000 for the United Way and a
children's hospital in his hometown of Peoria, Ill. Also, he and his
wife, Andrea, dress up as Santa and Mrs. Claus every year and deliver
toys to needy youngsters throughout the Cleveland area.</TE>
<TE>   GET IN THE BOX: Giant managing general partner Peter Magowan
wasn't happy with the outcome of Game 2 of the World Series. And not
just because the Giants lost.</TE>
<TE>   Magowan, who is a big advocate of speeding up baseball, bemoaned
the length of the game, which ran nearly four hours,</TE>
<TE>   "One of the biggest problems," Magowan said, "is that batters keep
getting out of the batter's box. Some guys are doing it on every
pitch. You never see Barry Bonds get out of the box. If he doesn't
have to, why would other guys need to?"</TE>
<TE>   GETTING IT STRAIGHT: Most assume that Bobby Bonds asked Willie
Mays to be godfather to his son, Barry.</TE>
<TE>   Not so, Mays revealed Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Mays and Bonds became friends while they were teammates on the San
Francisco Giants from 1968 to '72, but it was actually Barry's
mother, Pat, who made the request.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted me to be the godfather; I don't think Bobby said
anything to me about that," the Hall of Famer said. "Barry was always
in my locker when I played, he was the type of guy that would eat a
lot of candy, chew a lot of gum, and I had it in my locker all the
time.</TE>
<TE>   "We would go out on the field and play catch. Actually, he was
around me more than [Bobby and Pat]. Maybe that rubbed off on him a
little bit."</TE>
<TE>   APPETIZING TARGET: Taco Bell has installed a 15-foot diameter
floating target in McCovey Cove. If any player hits it with a home
run ball, everyone in America is entitled to a free taco. That's
right, everyone in America. The target will remain in place through
Game 5.</TE>

<HD>Throw Out the Records When Kona Gold Runs</HD>
<DH>Back for a fifth time in Sprint, the 8-year-old could
become oldest winner of a Breeders' Cup race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. -- Kona Gold, the remarkable gelding, will
grab a record-book paragraph all by himself just for showing up for
Saturday's Breeders' Cup Sprint at Arlington Park. But if the
8-year-old wins the Sprint for a second time, they'll need an entire
page to catalog the achievement.</LD>
<LD>   By running, Kona Gold will be making his fifth Breeders' Cup
appearance, which shunts aside the only other four-timers --
Precisionist, Pleasant Tap, El Senor and Affirmed Success -- in the
18-year history of the series. Kona Gold can add distinction to
longevity with a second victory. The only other dual winners in the
Breeders' Cup have been Miesque, who won the Mile in 1987 and '88;
Bayakoa, the 1989 and '90 Distaff winner; Lure, Mile winner in 1992
and '93; Da Hoss, Mile winner in 1996 and '98, and Tiznow, who won
the Classic in 2000 and '01.</LD>
<LD>   None of those repeat winners, however, was 8 years old, or even
close. Horses of Kona Gold's vintage seldom run in these races, and
the oldest Breeders' Cup winners have been Cardmania and Elmhurst,
7-year-olds who were Sprint victors , in 1993 and 1997.</LD>
<TE>   Kona Gold might be heard from in one other category: the layoff
time between a horse's last prep race and a Breeders' Cup win. In
what is arguably the best Breeders' Cup training job ever, Ross
Fenstermaker ran Precisionist on June 23, 1985, and 131 days later
won the Sprint with the versatile colt. Kona Gold hasn't run since
July 6, meaning there will be 111 days between races. A win Saturday
moves trainer Bruce Headley's horse into second place on the layoff
list.</TE>
<TE>   The oddsmakers are suggesting that Headley is asking too much of
Kona Gold this time. The Daily Racing Form's early line for the
six-furlong race has the horse at 8-1, the fourth choice behind
Orientate, Xtra Heat and Swept Overboard. Orientate has never been
better, having notched four convincing wins at six or 6 1/2 furlongs
in the last four months. Xtra Heat, a $5,000 auction purchase two
years ago, has won 24 of 31 starts, earned $2.2 million and ran
second to Squirtle Squirt in last year's Sprint. Swept Overboard,
while unable to win at the Sprint distance this year, was fourth,
beaten by just a length, in the Breeders' Cup last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The filly [Xtra Heat] scares me," Headley said. "She's a very
honest horse. But there's a lot of speed in this race, and that
should keep her busy early. And don't forget, I'm running another
horse [the 6-year-old mare Kalookan Queen] in this race. I look for
Kalookan Queen to hook up with Xtra Heat on the [far] turn, and Kona
Gold should be coming on late."</TE>
<TE>   Since Headley bought Kona Gold at a Keeneland auction for $35,000
in 1995, the son of Java Gold and Double Sunrise, a Slew o' Gold
mare, has won 13 races, run second seven times and third once in 25
races, earning $2.1 million for Headley, Irwin Molasky and his son
Andrew. That's not much running for an old-timer, but Kona Gold
required knee surgery and Headley didn't get a chance to run him
until May 1998, when he was a 4-year-old. Five months later, Kona was
off to the races with his astonishing Breeders' Cup run. He won the
Sprint in 2000, after a third in 1998 and a second in 1999, and he
was seventh, four lengths behind Squirtle Squirt last year. Here's
the way those races played out:</TE>
<TE>   Churchill Downs, 1998--Kona Gold was an unknown quantity, so
undistinguished in fact, that Headley wasn't sure they would get into
the race until a few scratches moved them up off the also-eligible
list. Kona Gold's trip from California to Kentucky was late and not
exactly first class -- he arrived in Louisville on a freight plane
hired just a couple of days before the race. Reraise led all the way
to win, with Kona Gold losing by slightly more than two lengths.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an unseasoned horse," Headley said. "How many career races
had he had? [Five.] He did quite well, considering he was awful short
on experience."</TE>
<TE>   Gulfstream Park, 1999--The ground broke out from under Kona Gold,
causing him and jockey Alex Solis to bump the horse inside them, and
Solis had to check his mount behind horses heading into the stretch.
Artax had to reach the wire in a blazing 1:07 4/5 -- matching the
track record -- to beat Kona Gold by half a length.</TE>
<TE>   Churchill Downs, 2000--Kona Gold sat just off Caller One, who was
sizzling through the opening half-mile in 43 2/5 seconds. Caller One
gave up the lead a sixteenth of a mile from the finish, then Kona
Gold had enough left to withstand the filly Honest Lady by half a
length. Kona Gold finished in 1:07 3/5.</TE>
<TE>   "He not only broke the Breeders' Cup record," Headley said, "he
also broke Churchill's for six furlongs. This was sure a race to
remember."</TE>
<TE>   Belmont Park, 2001--Raising concerns that his best races were
behind him, Kona Gold never threatened as he finished worse than
fifth for the first time. Three weeks before, he had finished second
to Swept Overboard in the Ancient Title Handicap at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Monday-morning quarterbacking," Headley said, "but I think
the Ancient Title took a lot out of both horses. We both bounced in
the Breeders' Cup."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Headley skipped the Ancient Title, run on Oct. 5, with
Kona Gold, but won the stake with Kalookan Queen as she convinced her
owner, Luis Asistio, that she belonged in Saturday's race. Headley
hadn't planned to bring the mare here, but he's not kicking and
screaming.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the Ancient Title took a lot out of her, just like it
did Kona the year before, but I could be wrong. You can't deny the
man what might be his one chance to win a Breeders' Cup race."</TE>
<TE>   Kona Gold has run only twice this year, winning the Los Angeles
Handicap at Hollywood Park on June 2 and finishing sixth in the
Triple Bend Handicap at Hollywood Park on July 6. Headley would have
liked one more race -- at Del Mar -- for Kona Gold, but the horse's
legs were badly cut in the Triple Bend. Headley blames jockey Pat
Valenzuela -- who was aboard second-place finisher D'Wildcat -- for
crowding his horse into the fence that day.</TE>
<TE>   "The cuts were significant," Headley said. "I had to make sure
they didn't get infected and missed a lot of training time."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Headley believes his horse has one more big race in him.</TE>
<TE>   "He runs well fresh, and he's a great workout horse," the trainer
said. "He worked [three furlongs] in 34 [seconds] flat the other day,
and before that he had a series of great works -- three 57s [for five
furlongs] and a couple of 58s. I think I've got quite a 1-2 punch in
this one."</TE>

<LD>Grant Hill and Christian Laettner, NBA players and former teammates
at Duke, are lending a hand to a New Jersey Catholic high school in
need of financial aid.</LD>
<LD>   Hill, of the Orlando Magic, and Laettner, of the Washington
Wizards, each have contributed $50,000 to Jersey City's St. Anthony,
a longtime basketball power that has won 23 state parochial
championships.</LD>
<LD>   The players were teammates of former Sacramento King Bobby Hurley
on the Duke teams that won national championships in 1991 and 1992.
Hurley's father, Bob, has coached St. Anthony for several seasons,
and is among those trying to raise $500,000 to keep the school open.</LD>
<TE>   The elder Hurley said Hill and Laettner were not asked for the
donations, but sent money after learning of the school's plight.</TE>
<TE>   Early retirement? Five players in their 40s have won on the PGA
Tour this year, and none has mentioned retirement. Then there's Colin
Montgomerie.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie, a seven-time top-money winner on the European Tour,
will turn 40 in June and told the Sunday Times of London that he
might quit the next time he wins one of Europe's top tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few players get better in their 40s -- very few," he said.
"If I can stay in the top 15 in the world, or even get back into the
top 10, I'd be thrilled."</TE>
<TE>   He said a victory in a top event, such as the season-ending Volvo
Masters in Spain, would be the perfect way to end his career.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Montgomerie threatened to pull out of the Ryder Cup
because of an aching back, then went 4-0-1 at the Belfry last month,
leading Europe to victory over the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the record for World Series career home
runs?</TE>
<TE>   The whiz kid: The legend of Angel rookie reliever Francisco
Rodriguez, who has won five postseason games, is stretching across
the country.</TE>
<TE>   "He is Mariano Rivera in 1996, when John Wetteland was closing for
the Yankees," writes Bud Shaw of the Cleveland Plain Dealer. "What
Rivera and Rodriguez share is an uncommonly direct approach that
suggests they have early dinner reservations and mean to keep them."</TE>
<TE>   This dog can bite: Florida State football Coach Bobby Bowden
wasn't thrilled when oddsmakers made the Seminoles 10 1/2-point
favorites over sixth-ranked Notre Dame, which comes calling Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really hard for me to understand," Bowden said. "Of
course, Notre Dame loves that. I heard one of their players last week
on television saying, 'I hope we're underdogs again.' I don't know
how many times they've been underdogs ... but they just keep
winning."</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth: BetWWTS.com lists the Lakers as 13-10
favorites to win the 2002-03 NBA championship. Sacramento is next at
3-1, followed by Dallas at 29-4. The Clippers are tied with Seattle
and Houston at 50-1.</TE>
<TE>   For those hunch betters out there, Golden State brings up the rear
at 300-1.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Mickey Mantle, New York Yankees, 18.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: From Bill Simmons, ESPN.com: "My favorite NHL
Division is the Southeast: Washington, Tampa Bay, Florida, Carolina
and Atlanta. Lotta history there."</TE>

<HD>Team Looks Sharper, From One Perspective</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The glass is half full:</LD>
<LD>   The Mighty Ducks have looked sharper on offense this season,
creating more chances, applying more pressure. A simple reason: They
have the puck more.</LD>
<LD>   They have won at least 55% of faceoffs in each of their six games.
This is hardly a fluke, considering the Ducks are deeper at center
than they have ever been.</LD>
<TE>   "Your power play and your penalty kill have no chance to be
successful if you don't win faceoffs," Coach Mike Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of free agent Adam Oates and Steve Rucchin's return
from injury give the Ducks quality throughout four lines, and beyond.
Marc Chouinard, Andy McDonald  and Matt Cullen are all skilled at
winning draws.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The glass is half empty:</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks getting an overtime victory and a tie in their last two
games were vital, yet the disturbing fact remained that they gave up
2-1 third-period leads.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver scored with five minutes left to get a 2-2 tie Friday.
Colorado scored with 10 minutes left, only to lose in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "The big thing that happens when you become a good team is, you
continue to do the same things in the pressure situations," Babcock
said. "You fall back on your foundation and your foundation is
stability, not panic."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks did not panic in either game, but they gave up two iffy
goals. Vancouver's Todd Bertuzzi came from behind the net to bank a
shot off goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere on Friday. A Duck turnover led
to Joe Sakic's game-tying goal Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Martin Gerber will start in goal when the Ducks play at
Vancouver on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "He won [Sunday]," Babcock said. "You got to get some candy for
that."</TE>

<BD>Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northwestern's Randy Walker is the latest Big Ten coach to complain
about officiating.</LD>
<LD>   He called Penn State's holds "significant and blatant" and
suggested officials ignored four clips in the Wildcats' 49-0 loss to
the Nittany Lions on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know how you don't see them. It's just real
disappointing," Walker said.</LD>
<TE>   Criticism of league officials has mounted this season. Penn State
officials called for a comprehensive review of officiating after the
Nittany Lions' Oct. 12 overtime loss at Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Jim Delany has said he'll consider a number of
measures, including instant replay, to help officials do their job.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State freshman tailback Nick Turner was suspended from
the team after being charged with possession of counterfeit money.
Turner turned himself into police and was released on $5,000 bail.
The charge carries a maximum prison term of 15 years, a fine or
both.... Louisville offensive lineman Jonta Woodard, who pleaded
guilty to receiving 15.1 ounces of marijuana in the mail and
possessing steroids, will not serve time behind bars under an
agreement with prosecutors. Woodard remains with the team.... Georgia
will be without running back Musa Smith (broken left thumb), receiver
Fred Gibson (ligament damage, left thumb) and offensive tackle Jon
Stinchcomb (cartilage damage, left knee) against Kentucky.... Ohio
State offensive tackle Shane Olivea had an appendectomy and will not
play against Penn State.... Texas El Paso quarterback Orlando Cruz
tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in the Miners'
victory over Rice and will not play again this season.... North
Carolina defensive end Will Chapman will have wrist surgery Friday
and won't play against Wake Forest.... Troy State fired offensive
coordinator John Shannon after the team scored a total of 15 points
in its last two games.</TE>

<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least a couple of weeks every month, Ed Lalau  conducts his daily
football practices until the sun sets at Wilmington Banning High.</LD>
<LD>   Lalau isn't a drill sergeant -- a lot of the time is spent walking
through plays and discussing opponent tendencies -- but the three-
and sometimes four-hour practices are out of necessity.</LD>
<LD>   On two Tuesdays every month, the third-year coach attends
mandatory professional development meetings with the rest of
Banning's faculty and cannot meet with his players.</LD>
<TE>   On these days, staffs at schools throughout the Los Angeles
Unified School District get together after a minimum-day teaching
schedule, to plan strategies, share techniques and discuss programs
aimed to improve student performance in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   The 16 days were negotiated in the current contract between the
district and United Teachers-Los Angeles and are part of a mandate by
Superintendent Roy Romer to improve test scores.</TE>
<TE>   No after-school extracurricular activities are allowed on these
days, including football practice.</TE>
<TE>   But missing a Tuesday afternoon of practice doesn't help coaches
prepare their football teams to play on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "On Monday, we go through conditioning and explaining what the
opponent will do," Lalau said. "But [during weeks when there are
development meetings] we have to go through the game plan, through
conditioning and get them ready to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they have a day off. These are kids. If it's not consistent
and in their face each day, they come back on Wednesday forgetting a
lot of stuff. We find ourselves teaching everything again."</TE>
<TE>   From a scholastic standpoint, the development meetings have proven
beneficial.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Academic Performance Index report released last
week, of the 44 LAUSD high schools that reported their results to the
California Dept. of Education, 29 showed improvement this year over
last.</TE>
<TE>   The API scores are based on results from the Stanford 9 exam and
other standardized tests linked to new academic standards in
English-language arts.</TE>
<TE>   Merle Price, the deputy superintendent of instructional services,
said the development meetings are "critical when we have 70% of our
students that cannot pass the high school exit exam."</TE>
<TE>   The exit exam is a statewide test that will be mandatory for
graduation beginning with the Class of 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson football Coach Doi Johnson, who is president of the L.A.
Football Coaches Assn., understands the need for such meetings, but
also knows what missing a day of practice means.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to fight it," Johnson said of the restriction against
practicing on development days. "As an association, we definitely
miss that day of extra preparation.</TE>
<TE>   "In our sport, more than any other, it is vital that our kids are
prepared as much as they can be, mentally and physically. To say that
it's a huge issue is really an understatement."</TE>
<TE>   The remaining staff development days during the football season
are Nov. 5 and 19 and Dec. 3 and 10. An exception is being made to
allow practices on Nov. 19, because the opening of the City playoffs
begin only two days later. The December dates are during the weeks of
the semifinal and championship games.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Bill Coan had only two days to prepare his Chatsworth
team for its game Thursday against Woodland Hills Taft, which also
had limited preparation time but is No. 6 in The Times' rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Coan, whose team lost, 41-0, in a regionally televised matchup,
said he tried, unsuccessfully, to get district officials to waive the
rule.</TE>
<TE>   "We were told flat-out no by the district," he said. "Even though
we tried to highlight two City schools [on TV], even though we're one
of the most high-profile activities for the school district, we still
have things taken away from us."</TE>
<TE>   City Section Commissioner Barbara Fiege said the ruling, mandated
by the district, went into effect in October of the 2001-02 school
year. "Is it ideal? Absolutely not," Fiege said. "But when we're
talking about a district whose primary objective is instruction and
teaching, we need to be able to work within that."</TE>
<TE>   Price, a former Palisades High principal, said the main reason
teams are not allowed to meet on these days is the inequity involved
in transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "There are schools where no kids were bussed in," he said. "But at
a school such as Taft or Granada Hills, half or two-thirds of the
kids on their teams live 20 or 30 miles across town.... We didn't
want to jeopardize them being in private vehicles or riding buses and
getting home at 8 p.m."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was Upset Friday during Week 6 of the football season:</TE>
<TE>   * Sepulveda Monroe stunned Valley Mission title contender San
Fernando, 25-24, for its first victory of the season.</TE>
<TE>   * Sun Valley Poly, which hasn't had a winning season in 10 years,
put itself into Sunset Six title contention by taking down North
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   * Locke shocked Dorsey, 8-7, in the latest in a string of losses
for the City Section champions.</TE>
<TE>   * Tujunga Verdugo Hills beat Canoga Park and could move to .500
this week with a victory over winless Hollywood.</TE>

<LD>Thanks to a parade of longshots Saturday and Sunday, there will be
heightened interest today at Santa Anita, where a two-day pick six
carryover of $520,536 spices an eight-race program that needed a
boost.</LD>
<LD>   The pick six includes a $25,000 claimer for 2-year-olds, a $32,000
maiden claimer for 2-year-olds, a $12,500 claimer for older routers,
a turf race for maiden 2-year-old fillies, an optional claimer for
older routers, and a sprint for $10,000 fillies and mares.</LD>
<LD>   The most likely single would seem to be Alashir's World in the
sixth. A daughter of 1997 Breeders' Cup Mile winner Spinning World
out of the Alysheba mare Alashir, the chestnut figured to improve
when moved to turf. She ran a creditable second in her first try on
the surface last month at Del Mar.</LD>
<TE>   Race of the day: The $100,000 Discovery Handicap is the
opening-day feature at Aqueduct. Contenders include Saint Marden,
Strive, No Parole and Regency Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: John Velasquez. He was the runaway leader in the jockey
standings at Belmont Park, winning 50 races with only 194 mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Paul Toscano and Jose Espinoza. Those two riders went
five for 127 at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Pool Music, Ben Saw San and
Sky Strider in the fifth, Alashir's World and Xocolata in the sixth,
Sombrio, J.T.'s Song, Golden Bonus and Kedington in the seventh, and
singling Castlebright in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/38. Money: Previous day/meet

<HD>Taylor Gets Three-Year Contract Extension</HD>

<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Dave Taylor, a cornerstone of the franchise for more than a
quarter-century, was rewarded Tuesday with a three-year contract
extension that will carry him through the 2005-06 season as the
Kings' general manager.</LD>
<LD>   A veteran of 17 seasons as an NHL player, all spent with the Kings
in a career that spanned the L.A. tenures of former teammates Marcel
Dionne and Wayne Gretzky, Taylor, 46, is in his sixth season as
overseer of the club's hockey operations.</LD>
<LD>   The former team captain, implementing club owner Philip Anschutz's
"fiscally responsible" philosophy, hired Coach Andy Murray before the
1999-2000 season and engineered the trades that brought most of the
Kings' top players, among them Jason Allison, Ziggy Palffy, Adam
Deadmarsh, Aaron Miller and Felix Potvin.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings have reached the playoffs each of the last three
seasons, putting together three 90-point seasons for the first time
in their history.</TE>
<TE>   "He's obviously got a great eye for talent," President Tim Leiweke
said Tuesday from Los Angeles. "He's made great deals. He clearly has
understood that we've got to live within a system that makes sense
for the rest of the league, that we can't be selfish and ultimately
do what some teams do, like Dallas, which is spend stupid money and
then announce that they're selling the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Dave's lived within a pretty good format here and he's
done a very good job of balancing this out with some long-term
vision.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a great development system. I think he did a great job in
his choice of Andy as coach. He's built a good organization on and
off the ice."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, one of four Kings to have his jersey retired, retired in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been real fortunate," he said Tuesday night while driving to
Ann Arbor, Mich., to scout a college exhibition. "In this business,
you like having a little security and having the contract extension
means a lot to me."</TE>

<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Detroit, 4:30 PDT, Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Joe Louis Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KAVL (610), KIIS (1220).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Kings 3-1-1-0, Red Wings 4-2-0-0.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Red Wings -- 1-0-0-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Jason Allison scored two goals to lead the Kings to a
3-2 victory over the Red Wings at Staples Center earlier this month.
The Kings have lost three in a row at Detroit and have not won a
regular-season game at Joe Louis Arena since Feb. 18, 2000. The Kings
assigned forward Derek Bekar to Manchester of the American Hockey
League.</TE>

<DH>Kings won't spend much time at home the next month, with
two long trips almost back to back.</DH>

<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Alongside their laptops and Zagat guides, the Kings made sure to
include family photos when they packed their bags this week.</LD>
<LD>   They'll live out of their suitcases for most of the next month.</LD>
<LD>   Aboard a Sky King charter out of Los Angeles International Airport
on Tuesday morning, they embarked on one of the most demanding
stretches in franchise history, a 31-day adventure that will allow
them only three full nights in their own beds.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the trip from, I don't know where you'd want to call it
from," Coach Andy Murray said. "I don't know if there's ever been a
tougher trip in NHL history."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it's two trips that kind of run together into a
marathon.</TE>
<TE>   It starts tonight at Joe Louis Arena against the defending Stanley
Cup champion Detroit Red Wings, the opener of a five-game trip that
also will take the Kings to New York, Columbus, Ohio, and Atlanta
before ending Oct. 31 at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   From Chicago on Halloween night, they'll arrive home in the wee
hours of Nov. 1, about 40 hours before they're scheduled to play the
first of two games in three nights at Staples Center on Nov. 2.</TE>
<TE>   After the second game, Nov. 4 against the Minnesota Wild, they'll
head back out on the road, boarding a late-night flight to San Jose,
where they'll play the Sharks on Nov. 5 to open an eight-game trip,
their longest in 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   They'll arrive home from that one -- after stops in Ottawa,
Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton, St. Paul and St. Louis -- in
the early hours of Nov. 22.</TE>
<TE>   All told, that's 15 games in 14 cities, including the two-game
stopover in Los Angeles, and 14 flights covering nearly 15,000 miles.
Add to that some two dozen bus trips, among them a late-night,
100-mile ride from Ottawa that will drop them in Montreal about 16
hours before they play the Canadiens.</TE>
<TE>   "It's crummy scheduling," defenseman Mathieu Schneider said.</TE>
<TE>   It could be a lot worse. The Kings, whose longest trip was nine
games, used to make trips like these on commercial flights. These
days, they charter everywhere, often busing right onto the tarmac and
spending precious little time in airports. They travel aboard jets
equipped with nothing but first-class seating.</TE>
<TE>   Some things, however, haven't changed: They usually make four or
five trips into the Eastern time zone each season, typically playing
no more than five or six games; they prefer to make one Eastern trip,
usually the longest, early on.</TE>
<TE>   Like all NHL teams, the Kings are required to submit a minimum 56
potential dates for their 41 home games, "and we normally do not
submit a lot of dates early in the season," General Manager Dave
Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Their reasoning: They draw better at home later in the season;
they like to get the most difficult trip out of the way while they're
still fresh; and they believe a long journey early in the season
brings the team closer together.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating matters this year: The WTA Championships will
be played Nov. 6-11 at Staples Center, eliminating six potential home
dates.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Kings were surprised to see two long trips almost
strung together. They pleaded for mercy from the NHL after seeing an
early draft of the schedule, but the one change that was made
actually made things worse, Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of opening the second trip at Denver on Nov. 6, which
would have given them an extra day to recover from their Nov. 4 game
and left them with a shorter flight into Ottawa for their next game,
they play at San Jose on Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings also objected to crisscrossing the continent on the
second trip, which will take them as far east as Montreal, then all
the way back to Vancouver before they turn around again and wind up
in the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   But what's done is done. The Kings hope to make the best of it.</TE>
<TE>   Like the toddlers many of them will leave behind, Schneider said,
"our main focus is on eating, sleeping and playing" over the next
four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, who once organized a team curling tournament in Calgary,
has a few ideas on how to relieve the tedium. A basketball tournament
has been discussed, and he has tentatively scheduled a practice at
Shattuck-St. Mary's Academy in Faribault, Minn., the prep school
where he coached before joining the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun just to put smiles on people's faces," the coach said.
"Obviously, it becomes more significant depending on how you're
doing. If you're doing really well, you probably don't need to do
anything."</TE>
<TE>   The activities that most effectively bind the team, he said, are
not the ones suggested by the coach but those initiated by the
players.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the guys have young families," said team captain Mattias
Norstrom, who probably will organize a team dinner, "so we don't have
a chance to do any of that when we're home. This is a great time to
get everybody together, maybe sit at a table with some guys you
usually don't go out to eat with."</TE>
<TE>   Trips like these, Schneider suggested, can't help but unite the
players. All but a small number have roommates on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing that needs to be forced," he said. "On the road
you're living together, basically -- eating together, back to the
hotel at the same time, a lot of hours on the plane together. It just
comes naturally."</TE>
<TE>   The hardest part, Norstrom said, is leaving family behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing a lot of games in a limited number of days, I love that,"
the veteran defenseman said. "I don't mind the travel. I think that's
part of the trial of playing in the NHL. It's not only how you play
when you're well rested; it's how you perform when you're tired and a
little banged up.</TE>
<TE>   "But my daughter's 18 months old, and so many things are happening
at this age. The rest of it, I'm looking forward to it."</TE>

<HD>Last Effort Turns Tragic</HD>
<DH>La Verne quarterback Rollie Dykstra remains in a coma after
suffering head injury against Redlands, the school that was his first
choice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rollie Dykstra just wanted to play one more season of football.</LD>
<LD>   Ideally, that would have been at the University of Redlands. It
was his hometown college, a perennial power in the Southern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, and Bulldog Coach
Mike Maynard had pursued Dykstra since his time as Redlands High's
quarterback in 1995 and '96.</LD>
<LD>   "Rollie was trying to finish up some spring and summer classes to
get in here, but our admissions [process] closed before he had
everything done," Maynard said.</LD>
<TE>   "It just didn't work out. I wish it had. He's a terrific
competitor. I liked the way he ran the team -- his field generalship,
the way he managed his teammates and the way his teams responded for
him. I continued to be impressed about that in him at La Verne. His
last drive was a length-of-the-field march. It was obvious he still
had that never-say-die spirit."</TE>
<TE>   The last play of Dykstra's last drive was an option run Saturday.
Instead of pitching back to University of La Verne teammate Justin
Wolfchief, he kept the ball and charged toward the goal line, hoping
he could ignite a rally. La Verne was down, 14-0, in a rivalry game
packed with personal significance. The opponent was Redlands.</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra, 24, was stopped less than a yard short of a touchdown.
The Redlands defender who stopped him made a clean but hard tackle
that took a devastating toll far beyond the quarterback's lost
fumble. Dykstra needed the help of two trainers to reach the
sideline. Once he got there, he collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked in his eyes and it looked like all the lights went out,"
a teammate said.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, Dykstra suffered violent convulsions and was taken
to Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra remains there in critical condition with a severe head
injury. He is comatose and on a respirator. His parents, two
brothers, and his 3-year-old daughter, Kayley Marie, keep vigil.</TE>
<TE>   "They are searching for answers," La Verne Coach Don Morel said.</TE>
<TE>   Morel disputed a rumor that Dykstra had suffered a concussion in a
previous game. Dykstra reported a headache to coaches two days after
the Leopards' 30-6 SCIAC loss at Cal Lutheran on Oct. 5. Morel said
that because of injuries to other players, he'd ordered no-contact
practices for two weeks before the Redlands game.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Dykstra underwent a procedure that relieved pressure
and swelling on the brain, but a source close to Dykstra's family
said, "This situation remains real fluid. The family is taking it
hour by hour and they aren't sure what to expect. Right now, they
just want their privacy."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Garcia, a hospital spokesman, described Dykstra's condition
as "guarded."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, La Verne and Azusa Pacific announced the cancellation
of their scheduled nonconference game Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Our players and coaching staff are not yet ready to participate
in a competitive event at this time," La Verne Athletic Director Jim
Paschal said.</TE>
<TE>   On campus, trees are wrapped in green and gold ribbon and notes
posted around the university encourage students to send their
thoughts to Dykstra. La Verne coaches, players and trainers met with
school crisis counselors Monday.</TE>
<TE>   One of Dykstra's many shaken friends is Jonathan Best, a Redlands
High security guard whose eyes moistened as he said, "I just talked
to Rollie three weeks ago, and he was telling me how excited he was
about playing again. He was telling me he was going to be getting
quality minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Morel designated Dykstra his starting quarterback after
Dykstra's performance in a hard-fought 34-17 loss to
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps on Sept. 28. Dykstra was sacked eight times in
relief of two-year starter Gabe Lujan, but he threw for 218 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "Rollie and Gabe had grown to be close friends, but they knew only
one of them could be the starter," Morel said. "Gabe came to us after
the Claremont game and said he thought he could help the team more by
playing wide receiver. He was right."</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra began playing football at Redlands High, where he directed
the Terriers to CIF Southern Section Division I first-round playoff
victories in 1995 and 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "Rollie was a driven, quality-type of kid," Best said. "He was
always motivated to get on the field and compete. That attitude
transcended to the way he lived his life. He was always full of life,
always so happy to see you. "After Redlands High, Dykstra spent two
years playing at San Bernardino Valley College, leading the junior
college team to the Foothill Conference championship, a Southern
California Bowl victory and a 9-2 record in 1997 while earning
all-conference recognition.</TE>
<TE>   After his sophomore season, Dykstra and some of his San Bernardino
Valley teammates went to Division I-AA Florida A&amp;M. He played in two
games in 1999, one a 57-3 loss to Miami, but left school after the
season to return home.</TE>
<TE>   "He was going to become a new father and he was not very happy
being so far from his home," said Maynard, the University of Redlands
coach.</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra and Kayley Marie's mother never married, but he later told
friends he loved being a parent, although he remained attracted to
the idea of completing his college education and playing a final
season.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're an athlete and you have the desire, like Rollie did, of
course you would want to get back into it," Best said. "The game
becomes a part of you."</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra took seven math and science courses at San Bernardino
Valley to satisfy admission requirements, Morel said.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted one more shot at football," veteran Redlands High Coach
Jim Walker said. "He didn't want to go wrap meat at the grocery
store. He wanted his education, and he wanted to play again. That
says a lot about who he was."</TE>
<TE>   Said Maynard: "I was interested. He sees the field well. He has
good feet. He's a good athlete. The best thing is his whip of an
arm."</TE>
<TE>   When the admissions problem at Redlands arose, however, Maynard
and other university officials discussed the alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I'd have to play [against] him, and I was concerned about
that, but we told him about La Verne," Maynard said. "Sometimes, you
have to do the right things for the right people, and Rollie is a
great kid."</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra was relishing his life at La Verne, Morel said. Morel
allowed him to skip some morning practices so he could spend time
with his daughter. A history major, Dykstra told Morel, "For so long,
I wanted to be a pro football player. Now, I want to teach."</TE>
<TE>   Said Morel: "He handled college, football and parenthood all at
the same time as well as any 24-year-old could have.</TE>
<TE>   "He proved his character and that he's a natural leader."</TE>

<HD>Shaq to Go on Injured List</HD>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal will start the season on the injured list, Coach
Phil Jackson said Tuesday night, and therefore will not be eligible
to play until the Lakers' sixth game, at the earliest.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal, who had surgery on his right big toe six weeks ago today,
could return Nov. 7 against the Boston Celtics. Jackson, however,
said he figured O'Neal would miss at least two more games.</LD>
<LD>   Having O'Neal on the injured list would let the Lakers have
another player active, presumably Soumalia Samake. Once on the
injured list, O'Neal must stay five games -- in this case, against
San Antonio, at Portland, at the Clippers, against Portland and at
Cleveland. The Lakers finish that trip in Boston and Washington.</LD>
<TE>   O'Neal met Monday with Dr. Robert Mohr, his surgeon, and
representatives from his shoe company, ACI, regarding the fit of his
shoes. Mohr won't examine O'Neal until Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "If everything's OK, I'll be cleared to run," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers lost, 102-101, to the Cleveland Cavaliers in an
exhibition game at the San Diego Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant scored 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Devean George, suffering from back spasms, did not make the trip
to San Diego. George apparently felt a pull as he got out of his car
Tuesday morning, and was much improved later.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Madsen (hamstring) and Brian Shaw (groin) did not suit up.
Madsen, like O'Neal, could start the season on the injured list.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the various injuries, it appears the Lakers will carry
Samake and guard Jannero Pargo into the season for at least a short
period.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson insisted Tuesday that Samake continued to be pushed for a
roster spot by Guy Rucker.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Brown</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers play their final exhibition tonight against the
Milwaukee Bucks at Staples Center. Under normal circumstances, Coach
Alvin Gentry would use the game as a tune-up before the season opener
Oct. 30 against the Cleveland Cavaliers.</TE>
<TE>   However, Gentry continues to fret about injuries to some of his
top players. Several, including forward Elton Brand, center Michael
Olowokandi and sixth man Quentin Richardson, practiced Tuesday for
the first time in more than two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Brand underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Sept. 26
and isn't expected to be sound for at least another week or so.
Olowokandi has a sore left knee and Richardson has a sprained right
knee. Their availability also is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really frustrated with all the injuries," Gentry said. "We
haven't had all our guys out there for one single [exhibition] game.
We can't walk out there on opening night and expect that everything
is going to click."</TE>
<TE>   Brand, Olowokandi and Richardson each indicated to Gentry they
hope to play, but Gentry couldn't say for certain Tuesday whether any
of the three would face the Cavaliers.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott Teaford</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland Cavalier rookie guard Dajuan Wagner had surgery to
remove a blood clot from the tube connecting his left kidney and
bladder. Wagner, hospitalized for more than a week, was first
admitted with stomach cramps before it was discovered that he had a
bladder infection. The team is expected to update his status today.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto Raptor forward Lamond Murray will be sidelined at least
eight weeks because of a sprained ligament in his right foot suffered
in Friday's exhibition against New Jersey.... Guard Chris Childs was
suspended indefinitely by the New Jersey Nets for failure to be in
playing condition.</TE>

<LD>Hal Sutton has agreed to be the Ryder Cup captain for the United
States in 2004 after serving as the team's emotional leader as a
player.</LD>
<LD>   Sutton met with PGA of America executives last week during the
Disney World Golf Classic, according to a PGA Tour source who spoke
on condition of anonymity. He decided to accept the job after talking
it over with his family, the source said.</LD>
<LD>   The PGA of America said the captain will be announced Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   The 2004 matches will be played at Oakland Hills Country Club
outside Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Sutton will be in charge of bringing the Ryder Cup back to the
United States after the Americans lost to Europe at the Belfry by the
largest margin in 17 years. Europe has taken the Ryder Cup home after
six of the last nine meetings.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. captain Curtis Strange was criticized for putting his best
two players -- Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods -- at the bottom of the
lineup, although Mickelson wound up losing a critical match to
Phillip Price, ranked 119th.</TE>
<TE>   Reached on his cell phone Tuesday, Sutton declined to confirm his
selection.</TE>

<TE>   The NCAA wants to change eligibility requirements for incoming
student-athletes by lowering the emphasis on standardized tests and
increasing the weight of classroom work.</TE>
<TE>   In a sweeping package of academic reforms approved, the Management
Council increased the number of core courses high school students
must take and extended the "sliding scale" that helps determine
freshmen eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   Student-athletes must now score at least 820 on the SAT, but the
changes would allow freshmen to become eligible with lower test
scores -- with a higher corresponding GPA. The minimum GPA of 2.0 in
core courses remains unchanged although high school students would
now have to complete 14 core courses, one more than the current rule.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by the NCAA's Board of Directors on Oct. 31, the
changes would take effect next year.</TE>

make room in the budget for female athletic programs to meet quotas.</TE>

Both were hurt in the second half of their 28-10 victory Monday night
over Indianapolis, and Hartings' injury was initially thought more
serious.</LD>
<LD>   Tests showed Bettis sprained his left medial collateral ligament
and Hartings injured left knee cartilage, but did not tear any
ligaments.</LD>

<LD>Goalie Evgeni Nabokov agreed to a two-year, $7.15-million contract
with the San Jose Sharks on Tuesday, ending his holdout after five
games.</LD>
<LD>   Nabokov, the franchise's career victories leader with 71 over his
first two NHL seasons, sat out all of training camp and the first two
weeks of the regular season while seeking a dramatic increase from
the $575,000 he earned last season.</LD>
<LD>   Without Nabokov and holdout defenseman Brad Stuart, the Sharks
have started 1-4.</LD>
<TE>   "Who we kidding here? To say that the performance of the team does
not factor into the urgency of your analysis is just not being
truthful," General Manager Dean Lombardi said. "It forced us to do
something in our evaluation planning that maybe we would have put
off."</TE>

<HD>Rongen Selects Eight Pros for Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coach Thomas Rongen on Tuesday named eight professional players, six
from Major League Soccer and two from clubs in Europe, to the United
States under-20 national team that will try to qualify for the FIFA
World Youth Championship in the United Arab Emirates March 25-April
16.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. plays Haiti, El Salvador and Canada in a round-robin
tournament Nov. 13-17 in Charleston, S.C., with the top two teams
advancing to the world championship. Mexico and Panama already have
qualified from the CONCACAF region. The full U.S. team:</LD>
<LD>   Goalkeepers: Steve Cronin, Santa Clara, and Ford Williams, North
Carolina.</LD>
<TE>   Defenders: C.J. Klaas, Washington; Frank Simek, Arsenal, England;
Chad Marshall, Stanford; Ryan Cochrane, Santa Clara; Jordan Harvey,
UCLA, and Chris Lancos, Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielders: Ricardo Clark, Furman; Bobby Convey, D.C. United; Ned
Grabavoy, Indiana; David Johnson, Willem II, Netherlands; Justin
Mapp, D.C. United, and Jordan Stone, Dallas Burn.</TE>
<TE>   Forwards: Devin Barclay, San Jose Earthquakes; Knox Cameron,
Michigan; Eddie Johnson, Dallas Burn, and Santino Quaranta, D.C.
United.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley Takes Over</TE>
<TE>   Bob Bradley officially took charge of the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars, becoming the unsettled MLS team's seventh coach in as
many seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The 44-year-old Montclair (N.J.) native was under contract to the
Chicago Fire, which received Brazilian forward Rodrigo Faria and a
conditional 2004 draft choice from the MetroStars for giving Bradley
his release.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey Chosen</TE>
<TE>   World Cup semifinalist Turkey was selected to round out the field
for the eight-nation FIFA Confederations Cup, to be played June 18-29
in the French cities of Paris, Lyon and Saint-Etienne.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, as CONCACAF champion, will play three of the
seven other teams in the first round, meaning that it could be up
against World Cup champion Brazil, African and Olympic champion
Cameroon, South American champion Colombia, European champion France,
Asian champion Japan, Oceania champion New Zealand or Turkey, the
third-place finisher at Korea/Japan '02.</TE>
<TE>   Champions League</TE>
<TE>   Home-field advantage meant little in European Champions League
play, since not one of the eight home teams won.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Real Madrid squandered a two-goal lead that
Steve McManaman had provided and was tied, 2-2, by AEK Athens at
Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid. Costa Rica international Walter
Centeno scored the tying goal for the Greek team after Costas
Katsouranis had cut Real's lead in half.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest upset of the day was in London, where English champion
Arsenal was beaten, 2-1, by French league leader Auxerre, which got
first-half goals from Olivier Kapo and Khalilou Fadiga.</TE>
<TE>   Nwankwo Kanu scored for Arsenal, which lost again only days after
its seven-month, 30-game unbeaten streak in the English Premier
League had ended Saturday when it was beaten by Everton.</TE>
<TE>   Spartak Moscow's hopes of advancing to the final 16 ended when it
was trounced, 3-1, by Liverpool in Moscow, where Michael Owen had a
hat trick.</TE>
<TE>   In Switzerland, Spanish champion Valencia gave up a late goal and
had to settle for a 2-2 tie against FC Basel in a game in which
Basel's Ivan Ergic scored the 2,500th goal since the Champions League
was launched in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Olympique Lyon and Inter Milan swapped goals with some abandon in
a match that ended 3-3, with Sonny Anderson scoring twice for the
French team and Hernan Crespo scoring twice for the Italian team.</TE>

<HD>It Looks More and More Like Moore Will Start</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quarterback Drew Olson was 15 yards closer to recovery Tuesday,
playing catch from 20 yards instead of the five-yard tosses he made a
day earlier.</LD>
<LD>   But that's still a long way from being ready to play Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Olson, who has a slightly separated right shoulder, is Coach Bob
Toledo's first choice to replace the injured Cory Paus. However, Matt
Moore, who like Olson is a freshman, is quickly gaining stature
because he is practicing.</LD>
<TE>   "We put him through the game plan and made the throws, reads and
checks he needs to make," Toledo said. "It's not a complex plan, it's
one he can execute."</TE>
<TE>   Moore said it would be helpful if he knew whether or not he was
going to start.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's Coach Toledo's job, that's why he makes the big
money," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   John Sciarra, a freshman who played the fourth quarter Saturday
against California, will back up Olson or Moore. Ideally, a healthy
Olson would allow Moore to continue to redshirt, but that possibility
is becoming increasingly remote.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nate Fikse has all but locked up the kicking duties after a second
day of blasting long-range field goals in practice.</TE>
<TE>   "He was pretty impressive again," Toledo said. "I'm going to wait
one more day before making a decision but he deserves an
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruin defensive tackle Ryan Boschetti served as a Stanford ball
boy for one game during his junior year at Carlmont High in Belmont,
but he never had any intention of becoming a Cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like red," he said. "I like blue. My high school and
junior college colors were blue, so it was UCLA all the way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Marcedes Lewis, a 6-foot-6 tight end, wore No. 5 instead
of his usual No. 19 because he simulated 6-5 Stanford receiver Teyo
Johnson in drills against the first-team defense.... Receiver Ryan
Smith missed practice because of a migraine headache.... Running back
Manuel White did not practice and probably will miss a third
consecutive game because of a hamstring injury .... UCLA's Nov. 2
game at Washington will begin at 4 p.m. and be televised on TBS.</TE>

<LD>Mike Williams was hungry and homesick last summer as he made his way
to Los Angeles International Airport for a red-eye flight back to
Tampa, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, an incoming freshman receiver at USC, was heading home
for a brief visit after two trips to L.A. -- one spent working out
informally with his future teammates and another that included
workouts and freshman orientation.</LD>
<LD>   At the airport, as they waited to board, Williams and his mother
ventured into a burger restaurant for a bite to eat.</LD>
<TE>   "I looked up, and there's Keyshawn Johnson," Williams recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The former USC All-American, now a multimillionaire receiver for
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, spent the next 30 minutes chatting with
Williams as they waited for the same flight to depart.</TE>
<TE>   "He basically told me that when I got out here for school and the
season started, the homesickness would totally go away," Williams
said. "And he was 100% right about that."</TE>
<TE>   Williams looked right at home -- and more and more like Johnson --
last Saturday against Washington. The 6-foot-5, 223-pound Williams
caught nine passes for 159 yards and three touchdowns in the Trojans'
41-21 victory that kept them in the race for the Pacific 10
Conference title. It was the third consecutive 100-yard receiving
game for Williams, who broke from the mold when he spurned Florida,
Florida State and Miami for what Trojan coaches sold as a golden
opportunity out West.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael was looking for something different and he was willing to
branch out and not just follow the routine and the norm," USC Coach
Pete Carroll said. "When we saw him, we thought he could do all this
stuff and maybe have a chance to be this and be that. He is all of
that."</TE>
<TE>   Williams has caught 37 passes for 593 yards and seven touchdowns
for the 15th-ranked Trojans, who play No. 14 Oregon in a key Pac-10
game Saturday at Eugene. Duck Coach Mike Bellotti is not looking
forward to facing a Trojan receiving corps that already featured
senior wide receiver Kareem Kelly and junior flanker Keary Colbert
before Williams upgraded it to a triple threat.</TE>
<TE>   "[Williams] runs well, he's a big target and he can catch the ball
and make the run after the catch," Bellotti said. "It's just another
weapon in that arsenal where you can't double anybody because they're
all very, very dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, like Colbert, did not overwhelm statistically as a high
school senior. He caught 38 passes for 789 yards and 12 touchdowns
and also played safety for Plant High.</TE>
<TE>   But Florida State, Miami and Florida still came calling before
falling out of favor for different reasons:</TE>
<TE>   Florida State? "They went out of the picture when I actually read
their media guide," Williams said. "Knowing the guys they had playing
on their scout team that already had a year under their belt was
enough for me to know it wasn't the place for me."</TE>
<TE>   Miami? "They came in kind of late. They kind of asked if they had
a chance. I said, 'You're Miami! Of course.' But when one of my AAU
basketball teammates, Ryan Moore, committed, there was no way I was
going to the same school.</TE>
<TE>   Florida? "I was on the verge of committing when [Coach Steve]
Spurrier left. At one point after that, the offensive coordinator
told my mom that they could see me playing in games against
Vanderbilt and stuff like that, but that they couldn't picture me
making plays against Florida State and Miami because I wasn't fast
enough. Something crazy like that."</TE>
<TE>   USC receiver coach Lane Kiffin, whose brother-in-law played
quarterback for Plant High, led the Trojans' pitch for Williams.
Kiffin won over Williams' parents by stressing academics. He piqued
Williams' interest with a pencil and paper.</TE>
<TE>   "He was drawing all kinds of plays and saying, 'This is what Keary
can run, this is what Kareem can run, and this is what you can run,'
" Williams recalled. "I could see where I was going to fit in.
Everyone else was like, 'If you come here, you can run the fade.' "</TE>
<TE>   Williams was the only recruit on an official visit last November
when the Trojans routed UCLA, 27-0, before 88,588 at the Coliseum. In
January, he chose USC over Purdue.</TE>
<TE>   "The more I heard, the more USC had to offer," Williams said.
"There was a clear picture of what I could do here."</TE>
<TE>   Williams impressed during training camp and caught four passes for
56 yards in the opener against Auburn. He had seven receptions for 90
yards in a blowout victory over Colorado, but also dropped several
passes, a problem that got worse in a 27-20 loss at Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   "We were there for that game," said Williams' mother, Kathy. "We
got to talk to him before he got on the bus. He said he's had bad
games before -- but never on national TV."</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, Williams said, the Kansas State drops provided a
dose of humility. He rebounded with four catches and his first two
touchdowns against Oregon State. He caught six passes and scored on a
55-yard play the next week against Washington State, then also scored
against Cal, setting the stage for the performance against
Washington. Williams shook off a few early drops and a fumble against
the Huskies to tie Kelly's record for receptions in a game by a
freshman. He also tied the school record for touchdown catches in a
game.</TE>
<TE>   "After the game, the first thing he said to me was, 'I can't
believe I fumbled,' " Carroll said. "That's the kind of focus I think
big time players have. They are never satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   Williams does not consider himself a pioneer, but he might be
regarded as one if the Trojans continue to mine Florida talent. A few
weeks after Williams chose USC, safety Mike Ross from St. Petersburg
also signed with the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   "I already was thinking of coming here, or going to some other
schools not in Florida," Ross said. "When I found out Mike was going
to come out here, I thought, 'Cool, I won't be the only Florida guy
out there.' "</TE>
<TE>   Williams would not mind returning to Florida one day as an NFL
receiver. He vividly recalls boarding the plane to Tampa last summer
with Johnson, who was on his way to training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in Row 38 and he was up in the nice leather seats,"
Williams recalled. "Maybe one day, I'll be up there too."</TE>

<LD>As a high school senior in Tampa, Fla., Mike Williams chose USC over
Florida, Florida State, Miami and Purdue.</LD>
<LD>   However, if he had received a phone call from Eugene, Ore., he
might be playing against the Trojans on Saturday instead of for them.</LD>
<LD>   "If you asked me, during high school, which school I was most
interested in, I would have said Oregon," Williams said.</LD>
<TE>   "They were just a fun football team to watch and I could see
myself there. If they had offered me, I would have committed, based
on what I'd seen and how they played."</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Focus Is on Kickoff Defense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC spent a good part of practice Tuesday going over kickoff return
coverage -- and with good reason.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 15-ranked Trojans play No. 14 Oregon at Eugene, Ore., on
Saturday and they do not want a repeat of last year's performance at
Autzen Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   USC surrendered 228 yards on six kickoff returns, resulting in
superior field position for the Ducks throughout the game. Oregon
won, 24-22, on a 32-yard field goal by Jared Siegel with 12 seconds
left.</LD>
<TE>   "We weren't executing what we were told to do," safety Jason Leach
said. "This year, kick coverage is going pretty good. We had one bad
one against Washington, but overall we're better."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are giving up 20.8 yards per return. The average would
be lower if not for a 45-yard return by Washington's Charles
Frederick on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon is averaging 23 yards per kickoff return. Allan Amundson,
who returned four kickoffs for 181 yards against USC last year, is
averaging 23.5 yards per return.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to give them any extra incentives," cornerback
Darrell Rideaux said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reserve quarterback Matt Leinart, third on the depth chart behind
Carson Palmer and Matt Cassel, said he will continue to make extra
throws after practice, especially after seeing UCLA turn to its No. 3
quarterback last week against California after the top two were
injured.</TE>
<TE>   "Carson could go down on one play and Matt on the next," Leinart
said. "Hopefully, it doesn't happen, but the UCLA situation shows why
all quarterbacks have to be ready. None of the coaches has talked to
me about it, but they know I know."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior tackle Jacob Rogers, who sat out against Washington because
of a bruised right knee, performed some agility drills and said he
will practice today and play Saturday. "It's too big of a game to
miss," Rogers said. Coach Pete Carroll said Rogers could start if he
gets through Thursday's workout unscathed.... Freshman tackle Winston
Justice sat out part of practice after a bone in his right shoulder
popped out of its socket. Justice said he will practice today.
Receiver Kareem Kelly did not take part in most drills because of a
sore right ankle, but said he would be ready to play Saturday. Kelly
is looking forward to the bye week following the Oregon game. "I need
the bye week to get 100% to go up to Stanford and be full blast," he
said.... Sophomore defensive tackle Shaun Cody said he will undergo
surgery Thursday morning for a torn ligament in his left knee. Cody
was injured against California on Oct. 12.</TE>
