<HD>Kidney drugs aid blacks</HD>
<DH>A type of medication for blood pressure may help them avoid
transplants or dialysis.</DH>

<LD>A major class of blood-pressure medication works as well in black
patients as their white counterparts and could spare kidney function
in those who take it, doctors reported last week. For years, ACE
inhibitors have been studied in large populations, but few blacks
were ever included among the thousands of patients in clinical
trials.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers, led by a team at Case Western Reserve University's
medical school in Cleveland, counted only 53 blacks in a major study
of the drug conducted in the 1990s, for instance. This despite higher
rates of high blood pressure and kidney failure among that
population. Blacks make up more than 25% of the nearly 400,000 people
on kidney dialysis.</LD>
<LD>   Writing in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Assn., Dr.
Jackson Wright Jr. of Case Western said black patients are six times
more likely than whites to develop end-stage kidney disease, a
condition that leaves patients with few options other than dialysis
and kidney transplantation.</LD>
<TE>   With the new results culled from a study called the African
American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, Wright said, many
black patients may be able avoid those fates entirely. "This was an
exciting finding," said Wright, lead investigator of the medication
analysis in 1,094 black patients between the ages of 18 and 70.</TE>

<HD>Antidepressants treat anxiety too, but disorder can be hard
to define</HD>
<DH>Mental health experts worry that a burst of advertising for
mood-lifting drugs is causing people with normal angst to ask for
medication they don't need.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Marsa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ads seem to be everywhere, on TV, in magazines, doctors' offices,
the Internet: Are you feeling tense? Having difficulty sleeping?
Scared of criticism?</LD>
<LD>   If so, they suggest, the answer could be a pill -- an
antidepressant, to be exact.</LD>
<LD>   The drugs that revolutionized the treatment of depression a decade
ago now are increasingly used to treat anxiety disorders, mental
illnesses that can cause paralyzing worry or intense fear of social
situations. Caused by a deficiency in brain chemistry, the disorders
can indeed be remedied by potent mood-altering medications such as
Paxil and Effexor.</LD>
<TE>   Drug companies commonly seek new uses for their drugs; it's a way
of expanding their market and getting a greater return on the money
spent doing research. But now it appears they could be capturing a
new segment of patients -- those with less serious disorders, such as
occasional anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   Since the federal government approved the drugs for generalized
anxiety disorder and social phobia, prescriptions for the medications
have soared. Doctors and other health experts, meanwhile, report a
marked increase in the number of patients claiming anxiety disorders
and seeking relief.</TE>
<TE>   Just about everyone has experienced situational anxieties -- when
personal or professional stress keeps us keyed up and disturbs our
sleep -- and it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when life's
mundane worries escalate into a full-blown psychiatric disorder.
"There are few conditions where there's a black and white cutoff,"
said Dr. Franklin Schneier, a psychiatrist at Columbia University in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, some mental health experts say, people with normal
angst may get powerful medications they don't need, sometimes
suffering from side effects such as agitation, insomnia, loss of
libido and, when they try to quit the drugs, withdrawal. At a time
when managed-care companies are cutting expenses, this marketing of
the drugs also ratchets up consumer demand for costly, name brands
when generics, or even counseling, may do the job just as well.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and psychologists say the broad push to prescribe
medications for anxiety is further indication we're medicalizing
normal variations in temperament. The advertising is "a double-edged
sword," said Dr. Michael Brase, medical director for behavioral
services for WellPoint Health Networks Inc., the parent of Blue Cross
of California. "It's helped some people realize they need to be on
medication, but others may be just going though a bad patch in their
lives. And that's what muddies the waters."</TE>
<TE>   GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Paxil, says the advertising
campaigns de-stigmatize anxiety disorders in the same way that
publicity surrounding the introduction of Prozac brought depression
out of the closet 15 years ago. "Our intention is to educate the
public about the symptoms of these disorders" so that people with
serious mental illnesses will seek treatment, said Dr. Philip Perera,
a psychiatrist and group director for clinical psychiatric research
at GlaxoSmithKline in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the publicity that has caused many mental health experts
to suspect that many people are getting medications for mental
disorders that were once believed to be relatively rare.</TE>
<TE>   For example, after Paxil was approved to treat social phobia in
1999, the company nearly tripled its advertising spending, from $31.5
million in 1999 to $91.7 million in 2000. In April 2001, the FDA
approved the drug for generalized anxiety disorder as well. In the
first six months of 2002, advertising for the drug topped the
$60-million mark, according to figures compiled by CMR, a market
research company.</TE>
<TE>   Prescriptions are rising accordingly. Last year, 26 million
prescriptions for Paxil were dispensed. This year, more than 16.9
million prescriptions were filled in the first half of the year, a
projected spike of more than 25%. Similarly, in 1999, when Effexor
was approved to treat generalized anxiety, 5.5 million prescriptions
were written for the drug; the following year, that figure rose to
8.7 million, according to IMS Health, a health-care information
company in Fairfield, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   "Advertising definitely induces demand for these products," said
Steven Findlay, director of research for the National Institute for
Health Care Management, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit. "But we don't
know what percentage of these prescriptions are being written
inappropriately."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Kabic is one Paxil user who believes he shouldn't have been
given the drug. The 31-year-old marketing manager from San Jose said
he started taking Paxil two years ago when he was suffering from
insomnia. His sleeping pills were no longer working and, he said, "my
doctor thought anxiety was causing my sleeping problems."</TE>
<TE>   But the medication made Kabic feel worse, he said. His weight
plummeted, he lost interest in sex, he felt like a zombie -- and he
still couldn't sleep. "It really interfered with my life," said
Kabic, who's been weaning himself off of Paxil.</TE>
<TE>   One out of every five people will suffer from an anxiety disorder
at some time, according to Ronald Kessler, a researcher at Harvard
Medical School in Boston. Such disorders include obsessive-compulsive
disorder, panic attacks, post-traumatic stress syndrome and the two
most common -- social phobia and generalized anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   Generalized anxiety disorder afflicts about 4% of the population,
the 10 million worrywarts who are paralyzed by irrational fears.
Unlike people who are socially phobic, they don't fear human contact;
they fret constantly about everything.</TE>
<TE>   "They're like 'worry machines,' " said Jerilyn Ross, president of
the Anxiety Disorders Assn. of America in Silver Spring, Md. "They
can't eat, they can't sleep, they're irritable and jumpy, and you
can't calm them down with facts."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, anywhere from 3% to 13% of the population is crippled
by social phobia, or social anxiety disorder, in which people are
filled with intense dread and avoid everyday social situations.
Social phobics fear public humiliation or being judged by others, and
may turn down a promotion, quit their jobs, or avoid leaving the
house rather than deal with people. But the line between generalized
anxiety disorder and normal fears is not as clear as it may seem.
Almost half of all Americans -- 40% to 45%, according to recent polls
-- consider themselves shy, which is not a psychological disorder.
Here again, it's tricky determining when shyness is debilitating
enough to require pharmaceutical interventions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's to the advantage of the drug companies to blur that line,"
said Bernardo J. Carducci, a professor of psychology and director of
the Shyness Research Institute at Indiana University in New Albany.
"All of a sudden, that gives them a tremendous market."</TE>
<TE>   Family physicians dispense about 60% of the prescriptions for
antidepressants, but they spend an average of only seven minutes with
a patient, so there often isn't enough time to do an adequate
psychological assessment, Brase said. Consequently, when patients
insist they want a particular drug, doctors often cave in, rather
than reviewing other therapeutic options.</TE>
<TE>   "Patients come in with a perception that this medication is going
to work for them, and if physicians take the time to challenge that
assumption, there's often a credibility issue -- almost like the
patients don't believe them," said Martin Fornataro, the West Coast
director of pharmacy for Cigna HealthCare in Glendale. "So physicians
end up capitulating to their demands."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, some doctors must spend so much time clarifying
whether a drug is warranted that the discussions can "crowd out more
important things that need to be discussed," said Dr. Les Zendle,
associate medical director for Kaiser Permanente Southern California
in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Managed-care companies such as Kaiser Permanente and Cigna have
begun educating physicians and patients about the pros and cons of
direct-to-consumer advertising. And at Kaiser, patients are
encouraged to seek counseling and learn better ways of managing
stress.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, people may just need some reassurance that their
reactions are normal," Zendle said.</TE>

<HD>New study adds fuel to the Atkins fire</HD>
<DH>The latest word on the low-carb, high-fat diet is
intriguing, but it's likely to be far from the last.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when many dieters are shedding pounds by indulging in great
plates of steaks, bacon, eggs and butter, even doctors are seeing
some positives in the regimen that flies in the face of conventional
nutritional wisdom. Trouble is, no one yet knows whether favoring fat
over carbohydrates makes people healthier in the long run.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Eric C. Westman, an internist at Duke University, stepped into
the lion's den last week when he presented data to the American Heart
Assn.'s annual scientific meeting showing that overweight people on
the high-fat, low-carbohydrate plan lowered their triglycerides and
boosted their good cholesterol while taking off more weight than
those on a low-fat diet.</LD>
<LD>   His results, while provocative, were hardly the last word in an
ongoing debate fueled by the faddishly popular diet first proposed by
Dr. Robert Atkins in the 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   "We need to study it further," said Westman, a staff physician at
the Duke Diet and Fitness Center, whose findings have been submitted
for publication and aren't yet peer-reviewed. Westman's research
stemmed from his curiosity about a diet followed by many of his
patients, family and friends. He asked the nonprofit Robert C. Atkins
Foundation, created by the diet doctor, for funding.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the American Heart Assn. continues to advise
avoiding saturated fats and basing meals on fruits, vegetables, lean
meats, whole grains and low-fat dairy products.</TE>
<TE>   Westman studied 120 overweight volunteers, half randomly assigned
to follow the Atkins plan and take an Atkins dietary supplement
consisting of fish oil, flaxseed oil and borage oil (all rich in
heart-healthy Omega-3 fatty acids), and half assigned to a low-fat
diet.</TE>
<TE>   After six months, members of the low-carb group lost an average of
31 pounds, compared with 20 pounds for the low-fat group. The Atkins
followers (only 36 of whom finished the study) had higher levels of
good cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, than the 27
who completed the low-fat diet.</TE>
<TE>   The low-carb dieters also posted larger reductions in
triglycerides--another blood fat linked to heart disease, and bigger
reductions in levels of very low-density lipoprotein, or VLDL, part
of bad cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   Critics noted that Westman studied only a small group of people,
and that six months was too short a time to know whether the diet
could improve health in the long term.</TE>
<TE>   "What we don't know is whether these lipid changes and the weight
loss itself over the long term are going to continue to look as
favorable," said Dr. Ronald M. Krauss, director of atherosclerosis
research at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Krauss said some of the improvements among the Atkins followers
could be explained by known phenomena. For example, losing weight and
limiting carbohydrates can lower triglycerides, and "when
triglycerides go down, the HDL does tend to go up." That response is
"not specific to any particular diet," Krauss said. He noted that
paradoxically, HDL rises when you eat lots of saturated fat and
cholesterol. "If you're loading the body with cholesterol, HDL going
up is a way of protecting against cholesterol."</TE>
<TE>   At the same meeting, researchers from the University of Washington
in Seattle and University of Cincinnati presented results from a
six-month study of low-fat and low-carb diets, in which the low-carb
dieters lowered their levels of C-reactive protein, considered a
better marker of heart disease risk than cholesterol, according to a
study that appeared in the Nov. 14 New England Journal of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   For people inclined to try the Atkins plan, Krauss has a reminder:
"Any diet that restricts food choices, particularly over the short
term, is going to succeed, be it high-carb or low-carb."</TE>

<HD>Fitness chains step outside familiar territory</HD>
<DH>Some clubs are opening shop in low-income areas that they
had shied away from. Neighborhoods say their arrival fills an
important need.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Evergreen Cemetery in Boyle Heights is an unlikely place to find
fitness buffs. But that's where they gravitate, turning the 1.5-mile
sidewalk that circles the cemetery grounds into a makeshift track.
There are few other good places in the neighborhood to go for a jog.</LD>
<LD>   Fitness clubs have long stayed away from areas such as East L.A.,
Inglewood and Crenshaw, believing that income levels were too low,
crime rates too high and people just didn't care that much about
fitness. They preferred more affluent neighborhoods, places like West
Hollywood, which has a glut of gyms. It was left to the YMCAs, Boys &amp;
Girls Clubs, city parks department, hospitals and the occasional
small private gym to serve other communities' needs.</LD>
<LD>   Even though that perception is changing, there are still areas
sorely lacking in safe, affordable, accessible fitness facilities for
adults and children. For some, a lack of fitness clubs would not seem
a big priority when there are other issues, such as education and
crime, to tackle. But these are also neighborhoods with predominantly
African American and Latino populations, both of which have high
rates of obesity and weight-related diseases, such as diabetes.</LD>
<TE>   Big fitness chains, including Bally Total Fitness and 24 Hour
Fitness, are beginning to stake claims in previously underserved
areas. Bally plans to open a 30,000-square-foot gym in June in
Inglewood's Hollywood Park Marketplace. And 24 Hour Fitness and Magic
Johnson, which have partnered to open gyms in communities such as
Richmond, Calif., and Santa Fe Springs, are considering a new
location in the Crenshaw district, though no definite plans are set.</TE>
<TE>   "We've heard industry leaders talking about moving into markets
that an independent entrepreneur couldn't afford to venture into,"
says Bill Howland, director of research for the International Health,
Racquet and Sportsclub Assn., a Boston-based industry group. "The big
chains are maybe the best to serve this market since they have
working capital and a working business plan." Some gyms in these
areas, he adds, offer discounts or scholarships for individuals and
families who can't afford the average $35-a-month membership fee.</TE>
<TE>   In Boyle Heights, gyms are scant while the need is great. During
peak hours between 6 and 9 p.m at the Weingart-East Los Angeles YMCA,
there is often a 10- to 15-minute wait for the 16 cardiovascular
machines, the aerobics classes are crowded and the pool is busy, says
Mike Castillo, executive director.</TE>
<TE>   "The need is definitely there," says James Santa Maria, deputy
chief of staff for L.A. City Councilman Nick Pacheco, whose district
includes Boyle Heights. "There's been a glaring absence of health and
fitness types of services .... Public parks are crowded to the point
where they're struggling, and there's less and less recreation
space." The city is spending $800,000 to convert the sidewalk around
Evergreen Cemetery into a jogging track, with a spongy, track-like
surface and better lighting.</TE>
<TE>   With a bottom line to consider, not all fitness chains are eager
to step outside their familiar territory.</TE>
<TE>   Venice-based Gold's Gym, a national chain with more than 600
outlets, for example, prefers to target highly educated, upper-income
members, 18-to-49 years old, who are already "in a fitness
lifestyle," says Derek Barton, senior vice president of marketing.
The gym does operate in areas with a mixed demographic, such as its
home base of Venice, but it doesn't seek out locations in low-income
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Uretz, chief executive of World Gym International, a
Marina Del Rey-based chain, explains that his company hasn't expanded
into low-income neighborhoods because he's "waiting for the right
person to walk in" and propose a franchise. "We have a guy in New
York," he says, "who's hunting down a suitable location in Harlem."</TE>
<TE>   Even before partnering with Magic Johnson, 24 Hour Fitness started
to explore areas with varied incomes, like Cathedral City. "There
were a few concerns as to whether or not those communities were
concerned about fitness," says Daniel De La Rosa, division president
for the San Francisco-based chain. "But as time went on, we saw that
all communities were looking at fitness as a bare necessity instead
of a luxury." The company also stopped using an area's income levels
in determining locations, relying instead on high population density.</TE>
<TE>   Bally Chief Executive Lee Hillman says his company's gyms in
low-income communities in New York, Michigan and Miami are "doing
quite well" financially, and adds that a number of factors, including
income, demographics, employment and traffic, are involved in
choosing locations. His bottom line: Building gyms in lower-income
neighborhoods can be good business.</TE>
<TE>   Bally's move is part of a larger trend of national retailers
finding gold in previously untapped areas, says Hilda Kennedy,
director of the office of economic and business development for
Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   "In urban communities, minority communities, many national retail
establishments are moving in in ways they were not before," she says.
"They're finding that there is disposable income because there is a
high population density."</TE>
<TE>   And although Kennedy says residents are ecstatic about the big
Marketplace development, she believes the gyms' motivations "have
less to do with the need for fitness or whether YMCAs were meeting
the needs of the community, and more about the economics of the
community."</TE>
<TE>   But the community has definite needs. Obesity levels in the
general population have been rising steadily for years, but are even
higher among Latinos and African Americans. A study by the national
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that among whites,
18.5% of the population is obese, contrasted with 29.3% of African
Americans and 23.4% of Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Related health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and
heart disease plague many who have limited resources for health care
and fitness. And in many inner-city neighborhoods, fast-food
restaurants are seemingly everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, of the East L.A. YMCA, believes that to succeed in the
inner city, the fitness chains will have to tailor their facilities
to the specific needs of the community, with special programs and
services such as child-care facilities. "They're going to have to be
really sensitive about the area," he says. "The key here really is to
have swimming lessons for the kids, and then have Mom and Dad working
out. You need to provide for the whole family."</TE>

<HD>Eating less for longevity</HD>
<DH>A strict regimen that slashes calories has been shown to
give animals healthier and longer lives. The radical approach is
being tested on humans for the first time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Rosenblatt</AU>
<BD>Special To The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It works with worms, rats, mice and monkeys. Reduce an animal's
intake of calories by 30% and it will live 30% longer than those on
an ordinary diet.</LD>
<LD>   Now scientists want to know if the same severely restricted diet
that has produced dramatic results in laboratory experiments in
animals will work in humans. In September, the National Institute on
Aging began scientific trials involving about 200 people at three
locations in Louisiana, Massachusetts and Missouri. The volunteers
are eating low-calorie diets to see if a significant reduction in
calorie consumption will improve their health and enhance the
likelihood of a longer life span. The institute's trials are
noteworthy because the latest government figures show that a
disturbing 61% of American adults are overweight, increasing their
risk of heart attacks, strokes, diabetes and arthritis. Finding a
diet that delivers maximum nutrition while sharply reducing calories
-- and that people will stick with -- is a key goal of the research
project.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, the public's appetite for remedies to slow the aging
process is voracious. From memory pills to hormone shots and
anti-wrinkle creams, the business of anti-aging is booming, but these
products often make claims that are unsubstantiated by rigorous
science. There is no pill or potion that has been proved to extend
the human life span. The only scientifically demonstrated tool for
increasing longevity is caloric restriction -- and it remains
unproved in humans.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot guarantee the fountain of youth," said Dr. Charles
Hollingsworth, the institute's chief of clinical trials in the
geriatrics and gerontology program. But the payoff should be better
health and the longer life that comes with a stronger immune system.</TE>
<TE>   In the institute studies, some volunteers will try calorie
restriction alone, while others will combine fewer calories with an
exercise regimen. The scientists want to know if independent,
impulsive human beings can get the same results with a highly
disciplined diet as do laboratory animals who have no choice in the
matter. The results of those on the special diet will be compared to
a control group of similar people who are not changing their dining
habits.</TE>
<TE>   Because the human life span is so much longer than that of
laboratory rodents, researchers won't know for a generation or more
whether the calorie-restricted diet actually helps humans live
significantly longer. For now, the scientists hope that the result of
the highly disciplined diet will be better health into advanced old
age.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to stop heart attacks and strokes, but I would
much rather trade for a heart attack at age 85 than age 50,"
Hollingsworth said.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists and nutrition experts at Louisiana State University,
Tufts University in Massachusetts and Washington University in St.
Louis will be trying to get their human subjects to do something
millions of Americans have attempted and failed: finding a good diet
and sticking to it. This means a volunteer in the study must trim 25%
of the usual consumption of calories. Someone who has been consuming
a daily diet of, say, 2,000 calories will be asked to cut back to
1,500, without veering off course.</TE>
<TE>   It's a hard task: The recidivism rate for dieters is more than 90%
-- that's the percentage of people who go on diets but gain all the
weight back within five years. Scientists have long known that the
miracle cure that works in animals doesn't always work in humans. It
is relatively easy to control the habits and extend the lives of
caged lab rats, with food doled out carefully each day by a
researcher. It is much harder to imagine controlling the caloric
intake of human beings, bombarded as they are by marketers' images of
humongous hamburgers, super-size sodas and fatty desserts.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers in aging say that if calorie restriction worked in
human beings as it has in animals, people who now live into their 80s
would routinely live until age 110 or beyond. And those extra years
would be healthy ones. They would eventually succumb to cancers,
strokes and heart attacks just as people do now, but at a more
advanced age. As the body goes through normal aging, it must work
harder, putting more strain on the various organs and the immune
system. When we take in a surplus of calories, the body must cope
with processing more nutrients than are really needed. If you can
reduce calorie intake, you keep the body in better balance and it
needn't work so hard, said Hollingsworth.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows for sure why reducing caloric intake leads to
increased longevity. One theory is that it is part of the natural
survival mechanism of successful species. When the organism senses
less food is available, it slows down to conserve energy. Metabolism
goes into low gear, reducing the production of toxic waste materials.
A slower rate of activity translates into a longer life span. In
simple worms, called nematodes, caloric restriction results in
dramatic changes. The worms become immune to heat and chemicals that
would otherwise kill worms on a more normal diet. In higher animals,
there are different reactions.</TE>
<TE>   The monkeys on caloric restrictions, who have a diet fortified
with extra vitamins and nutrients, live a longer and healthier life
than their lab mates who get a fuller diet, said Donald K. Ingram,
acting chief of the laboratory of experimental gerontology at the
institute.</TE>
<TE>   The institute's studies on humans are looking at various methods
of reducing caloric consumption. One approach will be to reduce
caloric intake in the diet by 25%; another is a combination of
partial caloric reduction and exercise. Different age groups, ranging
from 25 to 60, have been enrolled in the studies. The approach that
has the best results will then be used in larger trials with
thousands of people.</TE>
<TE>   If scientists can figure out how caloric restriction slows down
the aging process, perhaps someday they can find a magic pill to
increase human longevity. But that's a dream for another day.</TE>

<HD>A change in routine for Pap testing</HD>
<DH>Instead of annual screenings, the American Cancer Society
says healthy women ages 30 to 70 can have them every two or three
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, women have known that beginning at age 18 -- and every
year for the rest of their lives -- they were supposed to get a Pap
smear. In many cases, that test was the only reason they visited a
doctor.</LD>
<LD>   The annual ritual was effective, making the Pap smear one of the
great cancer-fighting successes. Because the test catches cell
changes before they become deadly, it has cut cervical cancer deaths
by more than 70% in the last 50 years.</LD>
<LD>   About 13,000 women are diagnosed each year in the United States
and 4,100 die -- often because they weren't screened and their cancer
was advanced by the time it was discovered.</LD>
<TE>   But the routine soon may change for some women. Based on evidence
that slow-growing cervical cancers are infrequent in the very young
and the very old, new guidelines from the American Cancer Society
recommend that women start getting the annual tests at age 21 or
three years after they've become sexually active. They may choose to
stop having Pap smears at age 70 as long as they've been screened
regularly up until that age. And, the guidelines say, women who have
undergone hysterectomies that included removal of the cervix don't
need the tests.</TE>
<TE>   Although women should continue undergoing annual Pap screenings
throughout their 20s (or new liquid-based Pap tests every two years),
the guidelines say, a woman older than 30 who has had three normal
tests in a row should then be screened every two or three years.</TE>
<TE>   "What's driving this is that overscreening is actually doing harm
to people," said Debbie Saslow, director of breast and gynecological
cancer for the American Cancer Society. Some mildly abnormal results
or false positives often lead to expensive, invasive follow-ups, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The new guidelines, published in the November-December journal CA:
A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, say some women may need more
frequent screenings, including those with HIV, those whose mothers
took the drug diethylstilbestrol, or DES, in pregnancy, those with
cervical cancer history, and sexually abused teens.</TE>
<TE>   The first revision in the guidelines since 1987 represents a
consensus by a panel of specialists in obstetrics-gynecology,
gynecological cancers, adolescent medicine and the human papilloma
virus, or HPV. Infection with the virus is the top cause of cervical
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Saslow said that although 70% of college-age women are infected
with the human papilloma virus, it generally creates only minor
abnormalities on Pap smears that often go away by themselves in young
women. It takes three to five years for any pre-cancerous cervical
cells to become cancerous, so waiting until age 21 or three years
after young women begin having sex leaves time to catch any problems
without overtreating the patient, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Aware that Pap smears are often the sole reason women visit
doctors, Saslow said that easing Pap smear requirements shouldn't
mean letting up on ob-gyn care. "We need to get rid of this fallacy
that the only reason you go to the ob-gyn is to get a Pap smear,"
Saslow said. Sexually active women still need to discuss birth
control and be screened for sexually transmitted diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Eric Book, chief medical officer for Blue Shield of
California, which insures about 1 million women, said the
recommendations for less screening won't change coverage for Blue
Shield subscribers. The health plan follows guidelines from the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force, which recommends annual screenings
beginning at age 18 or earlier if a young woman is sexually active;
and at least every three years once she has two consecutive normal
tests.</TE>

<HD>Life with depression, or life with dull feeling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elissa Ely</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I know a psychiatrist who took antidepressant medication (plenty of
us do, though few admit it). When at his best, he imagined himself a
poet, someone who wore a white coat in sunlight and composed
quatrains by candle.</LD>
<LD>   Then, in the mysterious way that depression descends, he became
ill. Still, the poems were passionate.</LD>
<LD>   For years, he had been prescribing Prozac and its many cousins:
Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, Luvox. He knew how the drugs worked, and that
they worked well. Within weeks of starting one himself, his sleep and
concentration improved: Circular worries grew quiet, despair
disappeared and old energy returned. He remembered what it was to
think well of himself.</LD>
<TE>   A few months into treatment, he noticed -- doubtfully at first --
that he no longer felt like writing. The words did not seem worth
laboring over. Without fanfare, without farewell, the desire to put
words to paper had just disappeared. So had deep emotion of almost
any kind. It was a quiet shock. He had heard of such a thing
happening, but there is nothing like experience to vitalize any
theory.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen years ago, Prozac was marketed as a medication with a
single, elegant mechanism and no side effects to speak of.
Professionals, and their patients, greeted it with wild hope. Prozac
promised permanent renovation of the self in four to six weeks -- no
money down, with custom-made cabinets and granite counter tops. The
drug quickly became a celebrity; a book with Prozac in the title was
nearly as sought after as a prescription.</TE>
<TE>   It worked for depression, was less toxic to the heart than older
classes of drugs and was so simple to prescribe that even surgeons
could take credit for psychiatric cures.</TE>
<TE>   The first side effects, when they finally emerged, were bothersome
but bearable -- insomnia, nausea, sweating. Next, patients began to
complain, in office whispers, of sexual problems. You could have
granite counter tops, it turned out, if you traded them for libido,
erections and orgasm. (In a fine example of smashing lemons into
lemonade, this led to a new marketing strategy: Prozac as a remedy
for premature ejaculation.)</TE>
<TE>   It now appears as though a majority of patients on antidepressants
experience sexual side effects to some degree. Some of the sexual
side effects were treatable by dose reduction, adding other
medications, switching antidepressant class or using herbs. Other
patients decided to forego sex as they once had known it. Life
without the devastation of depression was worth the price.</TE>
<TE>   Then the next generation of side effects came into view -- or
rather, they disappeared from view, for they are identified more by
their absence than presence. On Prozac and its family members, some
patients began to notice a lack of joy as well as sadness. They
noticed in themselves a strange emotional denseness; not a black hole
(as depression is) but a wall so thick that only the strongest
stimulation could penetrate it. If depression is a kind of
excruciating hypersensitivity, this was an indiscriminate
desensitization, a bland state of being.</TE>
<TE>   Writers were uninspired to write, nature lovers complained that
they no longer could enjoy colors in the woods, and people of
formerly passionate opinion just did not care enough to argue.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers got right on the explanation. While Prozac (and others
in its class of antidepressants) increases specific chemical
transmissions (or neurotransmitters) in some parts of the brain, it
inhibits others elsewhere: More serotonin here is balanced by less
dopamine there, and less dopamine, particularly in the frontal lobes,
decreases motivation, drive, pleasure, intensity. The cursed feelings
are gone, but so are the blessed ones.</TE>
<TE>   Psychopharmacologists tried to create balance artificially. They
added medications to broaden, and enrich, the antidepressant's action
and to compensate for the dopamine deficit. For those who had hoped
to relieve their depression with a single pill, it was discouraging.
Sometimes the polypharmacy worked, but other times -- and there was
no predicting -- the muses remained mute and the colors continued to
bear dull resemblances to former colors. It was like existing less.</TE>
<TE>   Which state of being is more to be feared: life with depression,
or life without nuance and feeling? When you cannot see to the next
day, when the very concept of future is intolerable, no price seems
unreasonable. Long before Prozac, classic psychoanalysts worried that
medication allowed patients to cheat the process of recovery by
offering relief without self-reflection; they thought drug treatment
was too easy. In fact, patients freed from the weights of depression
have more energy for insight. The graybeards were simple-minded -- or
perhaps, had not suffered enough themselves. Any path away from pain
has merit, and Prozac saves lives. But sometimes -- and here is where
the cheating occurs -- it goes on to lessen them.</TE>
<TE>   My colleague (against the advice of his own psychiatrist) has
stopped his antidepressant and hopes for the return of the muse.
Someday, there will be another class of medication that does not
force him to make this particular choice, though it probably will
force a different one. Meanwhile, no one can advise him on the way to
make peace with his life. We only have options, more and more of
them, and all are equally imperfect.</TE>

<LD>Moses was on to something. Whether you wander in the wilderness for
40 years or 40 minutes, walking sticks make hiking a faster, fitter
and safer exercise. A simple staff pared from a tree branch can add
stability on steep, uneven terrain and allow arms and shoulders to
lighten the load on hip, legs and back. New aluminum hiking poles,
long used in pairs by Europeans, are helping to popularize in this
country the outdoor aerobic activity known as trekking. Below, the
latest models, from high-trek to low-tech.</LD>
<LD>   One way to travel light</LD>
<LD>   Leki Ultralite Ti Air Ergo PA AS hiking poles: The Maserati of
hiking poles. Top-end model from the market leader, designed for
speed, with aluminum/titanium shafts and features to speed your
journey.</LD>
<TE>   Likes: Very light. 17.6-ounce weight (per pair) is said to lessen
"swing weight" fatigue for high-speed hikers and backpackers.
Built-in shock absorbers lessen jarring. The bent handle allows
better push-off and reduces risk of wrist injury. Telescoping shaft
accommodates anyone from children to adults up to 6-foot-5.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: Foam-covered handle is comfortable but too soft to
maintain a solid grip. And there's that steep, El Capitan-like price.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $149 for a pair. (800) 255-9982; www.leki.com</TE>
<TE>   Built for comfort</TE>
<TE>   Masters Kompressor Top hiking poles:</TE>
<TE>   A real bargain with Mt. Everest features, Mt. Wilson price.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: Built-in shock absorbers can be switched on and off. Very
comfortable, 1.5-inch-wide strap is nearly twice the width of others.
Bent, hard-rubber handle for fast push-off, high-performance.
Three-section telescoping shaft that is similar to Leki's.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: 24-ounce weight, though typical, is too heavy for
gram-counting, adventure-racing</TE>
<TE>   fanatics.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $85-$90 a pair. (800) 425-7462; www.alpinasports.com</TE>
<TE>   It's also a unipod</TE>
<TE>   Tracks Compact Travel Staff: Fold-up pole with screw-off walnut
knob -- and a camera mount.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: Easy conversion to a unipod makes it ideal for bird
watching and travel photography. Three-section, 11-ounce staff
collapses down to 20 inches. Push-button mechanism allows easy length
adjustment, from 3 1/2 feet to 4 feet. Rubber foot, great for street
walking, can be removed to expose a trail-worthy carbide tip.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: You have to buy a second pole to do hard-core trekking.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $65 each. (800) 531-9531; www.cascadedesigns.com/tracks</TE>
<TE>   Helping hikers stick with it</TE>
<TE>   Whistle Creek Hickory Compass hiking stick: Varnished hickory with
a rubber foot and a tiny compass burrowed into the top.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: This 3-pound mini-telephone pole makes you feel fearless
and connected to history -- think of Charleton Heston's Moses in "The
Ten Commandments." This pole is great for leisurely strolls on
streets as well as on well-groomed trails.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: Without a real handle to grip and a metal tip to dig in,
it isn't suitable for true aerobic hiking, especially in rough
terrain. The compass is fun, but so small (a half-inch in diameter)

<KH>GETTING BETTER</KH>
<HD>One step back, and two forward</HD>
<DH>When bunions become unbearable, surgery that requires
months of recovery is often considered. For one woman, the demanding
procedure was worth it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benedict Carey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vanity alone didn't deform Yong-Yong Tam's feet. As a young woman,
she had danced ballet, leaping high and landing on tender toes. Over
the years she'd spent entire days stuffed into ski boots or swim
fins. Then there was the 25-year hospital career, working 10 to 12
hours a day, sometime without more than a minute to sit down.</LD>
<LD>   But a woman who owns 100 pairs of pumps, boots, sling-backs and
other shoes knows the wages of fashion. "I happen to love high-heel
shoes, and I didn't want to give them up," said Tam, 52, an emergency
room doctor living in Oakland, "so I admit that vanity did play a
part in my problem with bunions."</LD>
<LD>   At a time in her life when she'd earned the right to some
indulgence and leisure, Tam found herself considering bunion surgery
-- a last resort that doesn't always repair the problem, and requires
a lengthy, difficult recuperation that deters many sufferers.</LD>
<TE>   The most common chronic foot complaint, bunions are bony lumps
that form at the base of the big toe when the toe tilts toward its
neighbor, pushing the joint outward. Some people are born with their
big toes leaning over; but usually the deformity develops over years,
and mostly in women. Often it's narrow shoes that cause the problem.
"With some fashionable shoes, the heels are so high and the fronts so
narrow, it's like the ancient Chinese practice of foot-binding," said
Tam's physician, Glenn Pfeffer, an orthopedic surgeon in San
Francisco. "The foot is rectangular, and the shoe is triangular.
You're stuffing a square peg into a triangular hole."</TE>
<TE>   Tam was well aware of the consequences. She also knew that once
the big toe angle got beyond a certain point -- between 15 and 30
degrees off center, doctors estimate -- it won't bear much weight.
Without the help of its strongest member, the foot's other toes have
to take up the slack, and people begin walking on the outsides of
their feet. In Tam's case, this duck-walk caused sore knees, hips and
lower back; she was moving like a 90-year-old, and in constant pain.
"The feet are unique in that if they swell up and hurt, they can
affect your entire body," Tam said. "If your feet hurt, you're
transferring weight around and trying to compensate and your whole
body gets fatigued, it affects your overall sense of well-being."</TE>
<TE>   She tried padded socks, bigger shoes; she bought clogs for work,
which helped a little. She spent thousands of dollars on special
prosthetic shoes built to protect her toes. But nothing stopped the
pain or reversed the slope of her toe. Meanwhile, her work never let
up: She was on her feet for 10 to 12 hours at a time. And when she
went out, she went straight to her shoe closet. "They're the only
thing that goes with a nice, long, svelte gown, with off-the-shoulder
straps," she said of her high heels. "I'm not going to wear clogs
with something like that."</TE>
<TE>   By late last year, after she'd exhausted all other options, Tam
decided it was time for surgery. Her feet had acquired a more
pronounced shape, they hurt constantly, and she couldn't get them
into ski boots or fins. Finesse wasn't the answer: Brute force was.
In bunion surgery, the big toe is fractured, the deformed joint
surfaces are shaved off, and screws are inserted to hold the newly
straightened bones together. It's not cheap: With doctor's expenses,
anesthesia and follow-up, the bill can range from $5,000 to $15,000
per toe. Tam's insurance brought her cost down to about $1,500 for
each foot. After meeting with Pfeffer, Tam elected to do one foot at
a time. "You need to be able to get around," she said, "so doing both
at once was out of the question."</TE>
<TE>   After a few hours in Pfeffer's office, Tam was back home, with a
bottle of prescription painkillers.</TE>
<TE>   She could not put weight on the foot for the first month and half,
however; and having to wear a clunky plastic shoe to protect her toe,
she couldn't return to anything near regular activity for three
months. "I read a lot of books," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Only now -- after the second surgery, done four months after the
first -- has Tam been able to work, part time.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're dependent on your wages, like most of us, then you
really need to be somewhere that has a disability policy," Tam said.
"I've had to take a lot of time off."</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Pope, 44, a dancer living in Huntington Beach who had
bunion surgery on one foot a month ago, has set aside about six
months for full recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "I may be able to do some limited moves after a couple of months,"
she said, "but it's going to be much longer before I can get back to
what I was doing before."</TE>
<TE>   Foot surgery often gets a bad rap because of expectations, Pfeffer
said: "People think they're going to get this done during lunch break
and be back at work in a week. This is not minor surgery; the bone
usually needs about six to eight weeks to heal."</TE>
<TE>   Foot doctors say the best way to avoid bunions is to choose shoes
for comfort as well as style. Surveys have found that many American
women wear shoes that are more than a size too small. High heels are
particularly harmful. According to Pfeffer, a three-inch heel puts
seven times more pressure on the toes than a one-inch heel. Shoes
that stretch; shoes with heels no more than 2 1/2 inches high; shoes
with wider fronts -- all will help prevent bunions. "It used to be
comfortable meant ugly when it came to women's shoes," Pfeffer said,
"but that has changed."</TE>
<TE>   For Tam, the surgery has paid off: She has more energy at work,
she's no longer in pain, and she can soon step out in her favorite
shoes, if sparingly. "I really want to stress this: It was worth it,"
she said. "I had emotionally given up on all my precious shoes, but
recently I tried on a pair of bright red sling-backs -- and they fit.
I literally cried out for joy."</TE>

<LD>To stretch out the front of your body, try this move on a large
stability ball. It is ideal after strength-building exercises for
your chest and shoulders, or as a way to stretch out and lengthen
your spine after long periods of sitting.</LD>
<LD>   1 To begin, sit upright on a large stability ball. Slowly walk
your feet away from the ball and lie back to position yourself atop
the ball. Balance your middle back on top of the ball and extend your
legs in front of you.</LD>
<LD>   2 Once you find your balance, reach your arms overhead and
elongate the front of your body. Inhale deeply and, on each exhale,
focus on feeling your ribs stretch away from your hips. You should
feel a gentle stretch across the front your chest. Relax and hold
this position for 30 seconds or longer. To come out of the stretch,
bend your knees, walk your feet in toward the ball. Curl your torso
forward to return to the seated position.</LD>

<HD>Let holiday guests give thanks for local gyms</HD>
<DH>When out-of-towners finally push away from the dinner
table, you can steer them to visitor-friendly health clubs that
charge a small fee for the day.</DH>

<LD>Your friends and relatives coming into town for the holidays are
poised to consume a load of food and drink. After a few days of
shameless revelry, however, they might want to go work off some of
those calories. If you belong to a gym or health club, have them tag
along (beware, guests may have to pay). But even if you don't have a
membership, many places around town allow nonmembers, most for a fee
of $10 to $20 per day.</LD>
<LD>   Members of national chains such as Gold's Gym, Bally Total Fitness
or 24 Hour Fitness can usually work out at an affiliate club for no
charge. It's a good idea to check first to find out the company's
policy. Most of these gyms also have Web sites with club locators.</LD>
<LD>   Many hotels have fitness centers, but facilities vary widely, from
circa-1950s stationary bikes to state-of-the-art cardio equipment,
pools and classes. When making reservations, ask what the facilities
include and the hours. If the hotel lacks a fitness center, find out
if it's affiliated with a nearby gym. Also, some hotels with sizable
gyms allow anyone -- not just hotel guests -- to work out for a fee.</LD>
<TE>   Spending time at the gym over the holidays is the perfect way to
have your pumpkin pie and eat it too, says Shannon May, spokeswoman
for San Francisco-based 24 Hour Fitness. "By working out over the
holidays you don't have to pass on your traditional favorites," she
says. "A lot of people around this time increase their cardio
workouts or throw in an extra session with their personal trainer."</TE>
<TE>   The holiday rush starts right after Thanksgiving, May adds, and
goes through early January. "We see a steady flow of traffic in that
time, people working off some of the treats they've indulged in."</TE>
<TE>   Here's a partial list of gyms, studios and hotels around the Los
Angeles area. In the case of some huge chains, such as Bally Total
Fitness, not all area clubs could be listed, so check the Web site or
call.</TE>

<HD>For damaged hearts, some added muscle</HD>
<DH>In a new take on cardiac care, doctors are testing cell
transplants that regenerate tissue after a patient suffers an attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas H. Maugh II</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New drugs and medical procedures are sharply increasing the number of
people who survive heart attacks and congestive heart failure, but
they have an unfortunate side effect. Survivors' mobility and
lifestyles are often severely restricted because their heart tissue
has been extensively damaged and can no longer pump adequate
quantities of blood throughout the body.</LD>
<LD>   A growing number of researchers are attempting to circumvent such
problems by regenerating heart muscle, and reports last week at the
American Heart Assn. meeting in Chicago provided some tantalizing
glimpses into where these efforts might be heading.</LD>
<LD>   All of the trials are still "very, very early," cautioned Dr.
Timothy Gardner of the University of Pennsylvania, "but what is
exciting is that they have opened a treatment pathway that was not
tried before."</LD>
<TE>   About 7.5 million Americans will suffer heart attacks this year,
according to the American Heart Assn. Two-thirds of them will survive
-- a much higher rate than in the past -- but many will have severely
debilitated hearts that make them candidates for regenerative
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Heart tissue has a limited ability to regenerate on its own, so
the loss of extensive amounts of tissue in a heart attack is
catastrophic. Some cardiologists have attempted to replace the lost
muscle by wrapping muscle tissue from the back around the heart and
training it to contract along with the heart tissue, but that has
produced only limited successes.</TE>
<TE>   Now cardiologists are attempting to make use of new developments
in stem cell technology to augment heart tissue. Researchers remove
bone marrow or stem cells from an arm or thigh in a patient's body,
grow them in a laboratory dish to increase their numbers from a few
million to a billion or more, then inject them into a heart.</TE>
<TE>   The hope is that the injected cells will become transformed into
heart cells and integrated into heart tissues. By using the patient's
own cells, surgeons avoid the need for drugs to suppress the immune
system, without running the risk of rejection.</TE>
<TE>   A study by Dr. Francis Pagani of the University of Michigan
indicates that is indeed a possibility. Pagani and his colleagues
injected cells into the hearts of five patients awaiting heart
transplants. Because three of them have since received their
transplants, Pagani was able to study their old hearts.</TE>
<TE>   He found that the injected cells not only survived in their new
environment, but also began to form muscle fibers. The areas where
they were injected also had an increase in the formation of new blood
vessels.</TE>
<TE>   "These results give us the first indication that muscle cell
transplants, even from an entirely different kind of muscle, could
one day be used to help repair damaged, failing hearts," Pagani said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts estimate that about 50 people worldwide have received cell
transplants in their hearts since the procedure was first attempted
two years ago by Dr. Philippe Menasche of the Georges Pompidou
European Hospital in Paris. Most transplants in the United States
have been performed by a team headed by Dr. Nabil Dib of the Arizona
Heart Institute in Phoenix. The team has injected the cells extracted
from thigh muscle into 11 patients during coronary artery bypass
surgery and into five during implantation of a left ventricular
assist device.</TE>
<TE>   "We found that the transplanted [cells] survived and thrived in
patients," Dib said. "Areas damaged by heart attack and
cardiovascular disease showed evidence of repair and viability," as
measured by PET scans, MRI and echocardiograms. Ejection fractions --
the proportion of blood pumped out of the heart on each beat --
increased 58%, from 22.7% to 35.8%. Normal is about 60%.</TE>
<TE>   One beneficiary of the new procedure is Barry Bucchione, a
53-year-old auto mechanic who was treated at the Cleveland Clinic
Heart Center in Ohio. Forty years of smoking caught up with Bucchione
in 2001, when he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure.
Weakened by the disease, he could barely walk and was forced to stop
working.</TE>
<TE>   He received the cell injection in June of that year during bypass
surgery and three months later was well enough to return to his job
repairing taxicabs. Doctors do not attribute his recovery to the
transplant because he also received bypass surgery, but it is clear
that the cells did him no harm. "I have no shortness of breath," he
told meeting attendees. "I can run up the hill, and before, I had a
problem walking half a block. It's worked out really well."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Manuel Galinanes of the University of Leicester in Britain
performed a similar procedure on 14 heart attack survivors using bone
marrow cells isolated from the breast bone, injecting the cells
during bypass surgery. Within six weeks after the treatment, the
physicians noted that the heart pumped more strongly and that the
walls of the heart had less abnormal movement.</TE>
<TE>   The team has not yet demonstrated that the injected cells have
become integrated into the heart tissue, but "that is the only
possible explanation," Galinanes said.</TE>
<TE>   But Menasche cautioned that there is a potential for problems with
the procedure. He said four of the 10 patients he has treated
developed ventricular tachycardia, a potentially fatal rapid
heartbeat.</TE>
<TE>   All were successfully treated for the problem, he said, but a
separate European study by other researchers was halted earlier this
year when similar problems developed and one patient in Italy died.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers still have much to do.</TE>
<TE>   Most patients have only been monitored for about 10 months or so,
and physicians need to follow their progress much longer to see what
happens to the transplanted cells. Researchers would also like to
find ways to insert the cells without opening the chest, perhaps by
pumping them into the heart through a catheter of the sort used for
angiography.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the questions may be answered in a major new trial headed
by Menasche that will implant cells in 300 patients in Europe and
North America. That trial is sponsored by the Public Assistance
Hospital in Paris and by Genzyme Biosurgery, which has developed
techniques to grow the cells in the laboratory.</TE>

<HD>Picking a poison for cancer</HD>
<DH>A compound derived from a toxic mushroom shows promise
against various forms of the disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Marsa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During World War II, the development of penicillin was credited with
saving thousands of Allied lives. Afterward, battalions of scientists
swarmed over swamps, marshes, jungles and forest underbrush looking
for other fungi that could combat infection. Researchers screened
thousands of compounds, leading to the discovery of streptomycin and
other early antibiotics.</LD>
<LD>   But others didn't pan out. Among them was a toxin from the
jack-o'-lantern mushroom. Although it showed promise as an
antibiotic, it was too poisonous to be used on humans. Half a century
later, however, this mushroom may soon be added to our
cancer-fighting arsenal.</LD>
<LD>   A chemical derived from this toxin, irofulven, is being tested as
a possible therapy for difficult-to-treat cancers, such as advanced
ovarian, prostate, breast, liver, gastrointestinal and brain cancers.
Early studies also suggest irofulven may be even more potent when
used in combination with such standard chemotherapies as cisplatin
and taxotere.</LD>
<TE>   The original studies of the jack-o'-lantern mushroom's poisonous
compounds, known as illudins, were abandoned because the substances
were extremely toxic. Consequently, the orange and yellow mushroom,
which glows in the dark and causes vomiting and gastric distress if
eaten, became a forgotten laboratory curiosity until the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   It was rescued from obscurity by Trevor McMorris, a chemist at UC
San Diego in La Jolla, who began studying the mushroom's chemical
constituents when he was a researcher at the New York Botanical
Garden in the 1960s. McMorris submitted the compounds for an analysis
by the National Cancer Institute. That analysis found illudins to be
powerful anti-tumor agents.</TE>
<TE>   Once McMorris deciphered illudins' chemical structure, the next
step was to figure out a way to change the structure of the compound
so that it still killed tumor cells but wasn't poisonous. His aim was
to "reduce the toxicity but retain the anti-cancer activity."</TE>
<TE>   The work went slowly; it wasn't until the late 1980s that his lab
devised a compound, irofulven, that was effective. He sent the
substance to his collaborator, Dr. Michael Kelner, a UC San Diego
pathologist, who tested it on mice with leukemia and lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Kelner found that the compound killed tumors known as
adenocarcinomas, deadly malignancies of the lung, breast and colon
that have few effective treatments. "Since it had an affinity for
these type of cancer cells, our thought was to exploit it as a drug,"
said Kelner. "We still haven't quite figured out the exact mechanism
of how this works, but it is very lethal."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists do know irofulven is rapidly absorbed by cancer cells,
making it a more precisely targeted drug than current treatments,
which often kill healthy tissue as well as malignancies. Once inside,
the compound latches on to the cell's DNA and proteins, preventing it
from reproducing. This prompts tumor cells to die off, instead of
replicating wildly out of control, which is the hallmark of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Irofulven traveled a long road, however, from the laboratory bench
to a patient's bedside. It was tested extensively on animals before
the first tests on humans, in people with advanced pancreatic cancer,
began in 1995, more than 30 years after McMorris had begun his
research.</TE>
<TE>   The drug has side effects like those of traditional chemotherapy,
including nausea, vomiting, fatigue and bone marrow suppression; a
test on patients with advanced pancreatic cancer was halted because
irofulven was no more potent than standard treatments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unclear what it's role in pancreatic cancer may be," says
Dr. J. Randolph Hecht, an oncologist at UCLA's Jonsson Cancer Center
who tested irofulven on pancreatic cancer patients. "But it's an
interesting drug, and clearly there are people who've had responses
in other cancers."</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary results of recent research in a wide variety of other
cancers have been encouraging. In a 2000 trial of 15 women with
recurrent ovarian cancer, five patients experienced at least a 50%
reduction in tumor size, while two others' disease was stabilized.
And in an ongoing test of 14 patients with inoperable liver cancer,
one patient experienced a 74% reduction in tumor size, and three
other patients' tumors didn't grow any larger.</TE>
<TE>   "If it proves as effective as we hope," Kelner said, "it will open
up a whole new front in the fight against cancer."</TE>
<TE>   Testing the power of mushrooms</TE>
<TE>   Other mushrooms may also prove powerful in the fight against
cancer. Pure extracts of exotic mushrooms such as shiitake, enoki,
maitake and oyster have shown promise in research conducted in China,
Japan and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have indicated they may be able to shrink tumors,
stimulate the immune system to fight disease and reduce side effects
from radiation and chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Experts caution, however, that some of these studies may not have
used rigorous scientific standards. In the U.S., scientists at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York are studying the
maitake mushroom, and are gearing up for tests of the mushroom's
extract on breast-cancer patients.</TE>

<HD>That coffee buzz may not be from caffeine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dianne Partie Lange</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If that shot of espresso revs you up even though you ordered decaf,
don't accuse the server of giving you the real thing. A Swiss study
has found that occasional coffee drinkers get a buzz from decaf --
their systolic blood pressure (the first number) goes up and their
nervous system is stimulated. One of the other components of coffee,
not the caffeine, is the likely cause, conclude University of Zurich
researchers. Regular coffee drinkers don't get the same lift in blood
pressure even after drinking the real thing, probably because they've
developed a tolerance.</LD>
<LD>   The blood pressure, heart rate and nervous system activity of six
coffee drinkers and nine people who drank the brew from time to time
were measured before, during and after drinking a triple espresso and
a decaf triple espresso, and before, during and after receiving
intravenous caffeine and an intravenous placebo of saline. The
systolic blood pressure of those who don't usually drink coffee
jumped an average 12 millimeters of mercury an hour after drinking
the triple espresso and after the decaf. The blood pressure of those
with a coffee habit barely budged.</LD>
<TE>   "Those with heart rhythm disturbances, high blood pressure, or
both, and those who have been told to avoid coffee and
caffeine-containing beverages should continue to do so," says Dr.
David A. Meyerson, a cardiologist and a spokesman for the American
Heart Assn. The research appeared in the Nov. 19 online version of
Circulation.</TE>
<TE>   Depression in pregnant women may raise risk of premature births</TE>
<TE>   One in five women suffers from depression, and the first bout with
the blues often occurs during pregnancy. But little is known about
how depression affects pregnancy. Now a study has found that it
significantly increases the chances of premature delivery in African
American women, who have about double the rate of preterm births as
white women.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers followed more than 1,000 African American women who
were evaluated for depression at four Baltimore clinics that serve
low-income areas. Nearly 13% of the women who had high scores on the
depression scale gave birth prematurely, compared with 8% of those
who had low scores.</TE>
<TE>   When the researchers took into account the effects of known risks
such as low weight gain during pregnancy or drug use, the depressed
women were nearly twice as likely to have a spontaneous preterm birth
as those who weren't depressed.</TE>
<TE>   Treating the mood disorder with therapy and antidepressants that
can be safely taken during pregnancy may help reduce the risk of
preterm birth, says Suezanne T. Orr, lead author of the study and
associate professor of health education at East Carolina University
in Greenville, N.C. The report was published in the November issue of
the American Journal of Epidemiology.</TE>
<TE>   Unanswered questions about fiber and cancer</TE>
<TE>   Although fiber is believed to protect against colorectal cancer,
the effect has never been proved -- and new research has failed to
resolve the issue.</TE>
<TE>   University of Arizona researchers took a second look at data from
a study several years ago showing that high-fiber supplements didn't
prevent the recurrence of polyps, benign tumors that can become
malignant. But that study didn't answer questions about how much
fiber the participants were consuming in food. So the researchers
analyzed information about fiber-rich foods from participants'
dietary questionnaires. They found that fiber from fruits, vegetables
and grains had no effect on polyp recurrence.</TE>
<TE>   But don't forgo your bran cereal just yet.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Schatzkin, chief of the Nutritional Epidemiology Branch of
the National Cancer Institute, points out that fiber may not prevent
the polyp from forming, but it might prevent it from becoming
malignant.</TE>
<TE>   The research was published in the Nov. 6 issue of the Journal of
the National Cancer Institute.</TE>

<LD>Due to a chronic illness, 17-year-old Claudia Partida spends months
at a time at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Los Angeles, far
from her parents and friends. Recently she has been able to break
this social isolation using a PC Pal, a computer donated by the
Starlight Children's Foundation, an international charity devoted to
assisting children living with serious disease.</LD>
<LD>   The colorful computer provides welcome company -- the ability to
e-mail friends and family, and access the Web and a supply of
challenging games such as Chessmaster, Math Blaster, Planet Discovery
and Magic School Bus.</LD>
<LD>   In studies of chronic illness, psychologists have found that
regular social contact can significantly lift patients' moods, which
often helps reduce discomfort, and may actually extend people's
lives. The mental challenge of games and puzzles can help preserve
mental acuity in people forced to spend long periods confined to a
bed, researchers say.</LD>

<HD>The doctor behind the spartan diet</HD>
<DH>Roy Walford, with his theories on aging and nutrition, has
long been regarded as eccentric, but science is giving his dietary
claims a closer look.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For nearly three decades, Dr. Roy Walford has lived in a red-brick
industrial building a half-block from the daily carnival and weekend
hucksters of Venice Beach.</LD>
<LD>   And for much of that time, Walford, a UCLA professor who pioneered
the concept of a severely calorie-restrictive diet as a path to human
longevity, was commonly viewed as a bit of an oddball, even in a
neighborhood known for eccentric behavior. His unconventional
lifestyle, be it studying with yoga masters in India or living for
two years as the chief physician at the Biosphere 2 experiment, did
little to enhance his image as a serious scientist.</LD>
<LD>   "I think at UCLA, Roy was regarded as the bald guy doing the aging
work," said Rick Weindruch, who was mentored by Walford and now runs
a gerontology lab at the University of Wisconsin. "He wasn't very
mainstream."</LD>
<TE>   Although his notions of living to 120 years aren't mainstream yet,
Walford's groundbreaking gerontological research linking a
calorie-restrictive diet to prolonged life in laboratory animals has
been gaining wider acceptance. Now many scientists believe that
Walford has been onto something all along, though many years of study
will be needed to test his anti-aging theories in humans.</TE>
<TE>   The colorful 78-year-old author of "Maximum Life Span" and other
books may never know for sure whether his theories passed muster in
human clinical trials. He was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's no cure for the disease, I certainly won't reach 120,"
said Walford. "I probably won't reach 90."</TE>
<TE>   Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
or ALS, is a fatal affliction of the nervous system that eventually
causes patients to lose their ability to move, to swallow and
eventually to breathe. Patients typically live two to five years
after diagnosis, although roughly 10% survive another decade or more.</TE>
<TE>   Walford, whose mind is as sharp as ever, is prepared for the next
question -- should the disease claim him within a decade, does that
somehow discredit his life's work? Absolutely not, he replied, it
would be like conducting an experiment on a single mouse.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he believes it's his spartan diet that has slowed the
progression of ALS within his body. That's why his low-calorie,
nutrient-rich diet, despite the diagnosis, remains largely as it has
for the last two decades when he originally took it up. He still eats
mostly vegetables, some fruits, some whole grains and a little bit of
meat.</TE>
<TE>   "The diet didn't bring this on," said Walford, who says his daily
caloric intake is roughly half of what the average American eats. The
1,600 calories that he eats in a day is less than a Big Mac, large
fries and vanilla shake at MacDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   Walford's near obsession with diet and aging began in the early
1970s when he embarked on what has become essentially a 30-year study
into the biology of aging. Among his first and most important
findings came in his UCLA laboratories where he discovered that mice
who were deprived of regular food rations outlived their normally fed
counterparts by as much as two years -- nearly doubling the normal
life span. In addition, the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease
was lowered and there seemed to be little impact upon mental and
physical function.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to appreciate the world of gerontology 25 years ago when
there were about 10 labs in the country focusing on the biology of
aging and Roy's was one of them," said Weindruch, who is conducting
calorie-restrictive diet experiments on monkeys. "Today there are
hundreds of such labs. Roy's work was very creative and way ahead of
its time."</TE>
<TE>   Lived in Biosphere 2</TE>
<TE>   Another Walford endeavor that may well have been ahead of its time
was his participation in Biosphere 2, an experiment inside a
self-contained ecosystem meant to test whether humans could one day
colonize the moon or Mars. The two-year experience that sealed eight
crew members, including Walford as chief medical officer, inside a
3-acre glass dome complex unexpectedly became the first controlled
study of physiological changes in humans on low-calorie diets.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly into the experiment, often derided as more show than
science, the team quickly learned that it wouldn't be able to produce
as much food as originally believed. Walford seized the opportunity
to study the effects of his diet.</TE>
<TE>   Although not long enough to be conclusive for humans, the results
seemed to confirm the diet's healthy benefits. Men lost nearly 20% of
their body weight, women dropped around 10%. Blood pressure, blood
sugar, cholesterol and triglycerides all fell by 20% or more to
extremely healthy levels. And all team members demonstrated an
enhanced capacity to fight off common illnesses like colds and flus.</TE>
<TE>   But even if the diet is eventually completely validated, is it
worth it? critics ask. Ignoring the practical issue that
calorie-restrictive dieters risk malnutrition if they aren't
extremely careful, critics question whether longer life is worth
being on a diet that even Walford admits is near starvation level.</TE>
<TE>   "Human beings are not only concerned about longevity, but also
about the quality of their lives," said Joanne Ikeda, a professor in
the department of nutritional sciences at UC Berkeley. "What Walford
really doesn't consider is the impact of constant caloric
restrictions on the psychological well-being of the individual and
society as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   Humans can become irritable, withdrawn and obsessed with food when
placed on a super-sparse diet like Walford's, said Ikeda. During
World War II, a group of American conscientious objectors volunteered
for a study to probe the psychological impact of a semi-starvation
diet.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, the men who wanted to do something for their country
had a great feeling of camaraderie, that they were in this thing
together," said Ikeda. "In fairly short order, they became isolated,
friendships broke apart and the men spent most of their days reading
cookbooks and planning meals they were going to have when they left
the study."</TE>
<TE>   Calorie-restrictive dieters concede that hunger can be a problem,
but surprisingly not the most lasting or pressing one. Peter Voss,
48, of Marina del Rey, says he felt hungry during his first few
months on the diet, which he started seven years ago. As his body
adjusted to the new regimen, however, the hunger pangs faded away.
More problematic was the need to find high-quality foods and
reasonably easy ways to prepare them. Since calorie-restrictive
dieters eat so little, they must be certain their food contains the
proper nutrients. But that requires deliberate shopping and dietary
information that often is unavailable in America's supermarkets and
restaurants, Voss said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I travel, I frequently can be miserable because I can't find
my healthy food," said Voss.</TE>
<TE>   As for the holidays, dieters say they do just fine. Since they are
accustomed to eating much less than the average American, it's not a
big deal to resist the temptations of the Thanksgiving table. Also,
their bodies simply often can't tolerate foods high in sugar or fat
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to be on the diet every ... meal, just on
average," says Walford. "You eat too much one today, you eat less
tomorrow. What's important is keeping your weight down."</TE>
<TE>   Largely because he has stuck to his low-calorie diet in spite of
his disease, Walford has had little trouble keeping a weight of about
130 pounds on his 5-foot, 8-inch frame. But his diet can only do so
much.</TE>
<TE>   The man who once captained his college wrestling team and was an
accomplished gymnast now navigates his expansive loft apartment
mostly via wheelchair. When he rises, he balances himself by leaning
on a series of crossed mountain climbing ropes attached to opposite
ends of his walls. In the last year, he's begun to wear a neck brace
to steady his head. The volume of his voice, too, has been damaged by
the disease and he sometimes must wear a microphone to be heard only
a few feet away.</TE>
<TE>   Walford presses ahead with his research despite his declining
health. Research assistants at UCLA continue his ongoing experiments
on dietary restrictions and aging. He works in his home office to
complete a book and a documentary about Biosphere 2.</TE>
<TE>   Danger is 'useful'</TE>
<TE>   He is understandably concerned that his physical limitations may
cause him to violate a personal philosophy nearly as important as his
diet that he developed more a half-century ago.</TE>
<TE>   He calls it his "Signpost Theory of Life."</TE>
<TE>   "If you spend all your time in the laboratory, as most scientists
do, you might spend 35 years in the lab and be very successful and
win a Nobel Prize. But those 35 years will be just a blur," said
Walford who once hitchhiked across central Africa. "So I find it
useful to punctuate time with dangerous and eccentric activities."</TE>
<TE>   Later, he added: "I have to get well first before any more
adventures. Right now, my only adventures are talking and walking."</TE>

<LD>At-home defibrillators -- A story in last Monday's Health section on
at-home defibrillators said that Dr. Vinay Nadkarni, chairman of the
emergency cardiovascular care committee of the American Heart Assn.
in Dallas, recommended contacting the Red Cross for training in the
use of defibrillators. Although Nadkarni recommended training, he did
not recommend a specific organization. People who want training,
however, may get it through the American Red Cross or the American
Heart Assn.'s Heartsaver CPR course.</LD>

<LD>With warnings that hormone replacement therapy may be unsafe for
long-term use, women are turning to natural remedies for relief from
menopausal symptoms. The most popular supplement, an herb called
black cohosh, was used by Native Americans for kidney ailments,
malaria and women's reproductive problems. White American settlers
learned of it in the 1800s; it was the key mystery ingredient in the
popular, turn-of-the-century Vegetable Compound tonic.</LD>
<LD>   Uses: Today, black cohosh is used primarily to relieve menopausal
symptoms, particularly hot flashes; premenstrual symptoms; and pain
during menstruation. Some scientists have suggested black cohosh may
have anti-inflammatory properties.</LD>
<LD>   Dose: Typically, 40 milligrams a day.</LD>
<TE>   Precautions: The herb appears to be safe for up to six months and
doesn't appear to interact with drugs, but little is known about
long-term use. It sometimes causes mild gastrointestinal discomfort.</TE>
<TE>   Research: German studies have shown black cohosh to be effective
for the short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms. The U.S.
government is conducting a study on black cohosh and hot flashes.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplement makers are not required by the U.S. government
to demonstrate that their products are safe or effective. Seek a
health-care provider's advice on selecting a brand.</TE>

<HD>Walking to better health comes with impediments</HD>
<DH>It's one of the best overall ways to keep fit, but
pedestrians often find themselves at a safety disadvantage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ridgely Ochs</AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as we learn more about the health benefits of moderate exercise
such as walking, we're finding that such a common everyday activity
may not be as easy, or as safe, as it seems.</LD>
<LD>   A study published earlier this month in the Journal of the
American Medical Assn. found that post-menopausal women who walked
four or more hours a week had a 41% lower risk of hip fractures
compared with those who did little or no exercise. The study found
that among women who exercised the most, eight or more hours a week,
the reduction in the risk of a hip fracture was essentially the same
as taking hormone replacement therapy.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, any exercise -- even standing, as opposed to sitting --
reduced the risk of hip fracture, said the study's lead author, Diane
Feskanich, an assistant professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston.</LD>
<TE>   The study, part of the ongoing Nurses Health Study, included
61,200 post-menopausal women ages 40 to 77 who were followed from
1986 to 1998. Those women who stood 55 hours a week or more had a 46%
lower risk of hip fracture compared with couch potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   "One could say that doing anything rather than sitting and
watching TV will help," Feskanich said. "The point is, you get more
benefit the more you do."</TE>
<TE>   Standing 55 hours or more a week sounds a little tough, but
walking or some other form of exercise isn't. And it's good for so
much else: It reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke by
lowering blood pressure and raising HDL, the so-called "good
cholesterol." It helps with weight control and reduces the risk of
Type 2 diabetes. It helps with balance and flexibility. It helps
reduce the pain from joint problems. It can improve the quality of
sleep. It often reduces the symptoms of depression, and a recent
study showed it helps keep older people mentally sharper.</TE>
<TE>   There's no down side to moving your body "unless you overdo it,
and we're not talking about that," Feskanich said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts admit one of the reasons more people don't walk or
exercise is that many of us live in places where it's not easy to do.
Many communities today are designed to accommodate travel by car
rather than by foot or bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   Census figures show that the number of people living in sprawling
suburban areas -- where there may be no sidewalks, and shopping areas
and schools can be miles away -- grew by 18% in the last decade,
while the number of people living in cities -- which have sidewalks
and shopping that encourages walking -- grew by 8%. That can lead to
safety problems too. About a quarter of all people killed in traffic
accidents are pedestrians, according to the Surface Transportation
Policy Project, a coalition of national groups working to increase
alternatives to driving.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Vanderslice, president of America Walks, a coalition of 48
groups, said that although a 1991 transportation act increased the
amount of funding that could go to building more pedestrian-safe
areas, actual funding patterns -- and philosophies -- have been slow
to change.</TE>
<TE>   "There needs to be places for people to walk, to cross the street.
Those are things that are often overlooked by engineers," she said.
Planners still too often see pedestrians as impediments to traffic,
which, she said, is ironic, considering "impediment" means "hindering
the foot."</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Transportation and the National Safety Council
have put together a checklist you can use to assess your own
neighborhood's walkability: Do you have room to walk? Is it easy to
cross streets? Is your walk pleasant or unsafe? Is it full of scary
dogs or litter? (You can find the checklist at
www.nsc.org/walk/wkcheck.htm.)</TE>
<TE>   Once you have assessed your neighborhood, the department offers
things you can do to improve it, ranging from telling your city's
engineering or public works department about problems to speaking up
at government board meetings about the need for safe places to walk.</TE>
<TE>   There are also government and volunteer groups that can provide
information. The point is to get out there and move. Here are some

<HD>A quartet for knives and pans</HD>
<DH>In 'Cookin',' four frenzied Korean chefs tell a madcap
story using kitchen tools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Boehm</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Cookin' " comes billed as the first long-running, internationally
popular theater piece concocted in South Korea. And it might be the
first show anywhere for which the initial research and development
took place in a kitchenware emporium.</LD>
<LD>   Without dialogue -- but with much polyrhythmic banging of knives
and gonging of pots and pans -- "Cookin' " tells the story of four
stressed-out, madcap Korean chefs who have been given a mission
nearly impossible: Prepare a multi-course wedding banquet from
scratch, with dinnertime just an hour away. While tackling this
culinary challenge with a mixture of comic bumbling and acrobatic
flair, the kitchen crew also manages to sort through a romantic
triangle involving three of the foursome. The gustatory payoff,
prepared on stage, is then shared with some lucky audience members.</LD>
<LD>   "Besides being virtuosos with knives and drumsticks, the
performers create charming characters without having to speak more
than a few words of highly accented English," a Boston Globe reviewer
wrote in September 2001 -- five days before the first U.S. tour of
"Cookin' " was aborted because of the terrorist attacks, just three
northeastern cities into an itinerary that was to have brought it to
the Wadsworth Theater that October.</LD>
<TE>   Now "Cookin'," whose producers say it has played to more than a
million people, is back. Its West Coast premiere is this weekend at
the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. (Drastically truncated
versions of the 90-minute show have been presented at Florida's
Disney World and during a recent outdoor festival in L.A.'s
Koreatown.)</TE>
<TE>   Seung Whan Song, a veteran South Korean stage and television actor
and producer, says he conceived the show in 1996 from two major
inspirations: sounds recalled from the family kitchen of his
childhood, and the rhythms of samulnori, a tradition-steeped style of
Korean percussion music that harks back to centuries-old rhythms of
the agricultural countryside. In "Cookin'," those folk rhythms --
which have reached the West in purer form through frequent touring by
the Korean group SamulNori -- get juiced with modern rock beats.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so used to listening to my mother's cooking sounds in the
kitchen," Song said in an interview from Seoul, with "Cookin' "
company manager B.I. Kim serving as interpreter. "When she chopped
vegetables on a wooden cutting board, it sounded musical. My father
used to play with his chopsticks on the table. That kind of image I
kept from my childhood, and there was no doubt that kitchenware was
the perfect musical instrument."</TE>
<TE>   Before moving ahead with a production, Song, 45, decided to test
his conviction -- and relearn what every 3-year-old knows -- at a big
kitchenware store. "Everybody -- the shop owner, myself and the
colleagues who went there together, were amazed at the sound kitchen
utensils could produce," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The show premiered in October 1997 as "Nanta" -- a popular Korean
expression that Kim says means "reckless strike," as in a slugfest at
a boxing match. "Nanta" still runs daily in Seoul. The producers last
spring opened a second, 400-seat theater to accommodate the overflow
from the 300-capacity venue where it originated.</TE>
<TE>   By 1998, Song was looking to export "Nanta" worldwide. He turned
to outside experts to help make sure its humor and storytelling would
translate in the West. Producer Simone Genatt, who had brought
touring Broadway shows to Korea, became a collaborator. "Nanta"
struck her as an MTV-style, high-energy percussion show, she says,
"but because it was rooted in cultural aspects of Korea, I thought it
had something special to offer."</TE>
<TE>   Genatt recommended more emphasis on the distinctively Korean
rhythms and on telling a single, cohesive story.
Choreographer-director Lynne Taylor-Corbett ("Swing") was the first
of three American theater and circus experts who went to Korea to
help hone "Nanta" for export. Song, says Genatt, had final say on all
creative issues.</TE>
<TE>   The Western debut came in 1999 at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in
Scotland. Song says he was worried that "Cookin' " might be dismissed
as an Asian knockoff of such wordless rhythm-driven shows as "Stomp"
and "Tap Dogs." But he was relieved when audiences found something
fresh in the Korean rhythms and in the attempt to tell a story as
well as display flashy percussive technique.</TE>
<TE>   There is a moment in "Cookin' " in which the four actors, each
wielding two large knives, bang on cutting boards with the velocity
of a surf-rock drummer pummeling "Wipe Out." During the course of the
evening, Kim says, four onions, five carrots, five cucumbers and six
or seven heads of cabbage go under the knife. An expert from the
Seoul branch of the Benihana Japanese restaurant chain trained the
actors in the art of theatrical slice and dice.</TE>
<TE>   "We are dealing with real sharp knives," Song acknowledges.
"Sometimes misfortunes happen, but not big ones. Minor cuts and
bruises -- and only during the training period. I believe in the
skill of our performers, so I don't worry about it much. And we are
well insured."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor-Corbett says that at one rehearsal in Korea, a knife went
whizzing past her head as she sat at the front of the house. "It was
kind of funny, and we all laughed," she recalled. "I don't want to
emphasize anything negative so the audience stays away or sits 10
rows back."</TE>
<TE>   Fire concerns in the U.S. and Europe have been a bigger challenge
than knife safety, says Kim, the "Cookin' " company manager. In
Scotland, early on, he said, wags joked that the show was "Cookin'
without cooking" because of rules against onstage pyrotechnics. Since
then, the troupe has found ways, he says, to turn on the burners and
produce flaming effects without running afoul of fire marshals.</TE>
<TE>   In their travels -- 20 countries so far, according to co-producer
Genatt -- the "Cookin' " creators have learned, among other things,
that not all cucumbers are created equal.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know that each country has different vegetable sizes and
colors," said Kim. "We want them big and long so audiences can see
clearly. What we call a cucumber in Korea, you don't have in America
and Europe. Their cucumber is short, a pickle kind of thing. But we
can improvise. If we can't find the right type of cucumber, we can
use zucchini."</TE>

<HD>A private investigator under investigation</HD>
<DH>Anthony Pellicano has made a name for himself in Hollywood.
Now he finds himself in legal hot water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Lieberman and Louise Roug</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among those who seek the moniker "Hollywood detective," Anthony
Pellicano, who was arrested last week, has set the standard for two
decades -- even the rivals who portray him as a greedy,
self-promoting bully concede that much.</LD>
<LD>   John Nazarian, a fearsome-looking former San Francisco cop who has
done private-eye work for the likes of Dean Martin and Peggy Lee,
tells of going to the Lalique store in Beverly Hills a few weeks ago
to buy a $3,000 piece of crystal for a client who has given him a
good deal of business, the gift being one of those gestures that
keeps up the mystique, like wearing a Rolex. So what did the clerk
say when he handed her his business card?</LD>
<LD>   "She said, 'Oh, you must know Mr. Pellicano,' " Nazarian recalls.
"Mr. Pellicano comes here all the time." There's a grudging respect
in such stories, even as a competitor like Nazarian points out how
Pellicano did not come from the ranks of law enforcement, but started
back in Chicago as a "skip tracer" for the Spiegel catalog.</LD>
<TE>   "Image in this town is everything," Nazarian says. "I don't know
how he does what he does, but he's very good at it.... Everybody
wants to be in that little select club."</TE>
<TE>   Pellicano established his image long before the latest incident --
the discovery of weapons at his office as part of an investigation
into whether he orchestrated a threat against a Times reporter --
landed him in the news.</TE>
<TE>   He's the P.I. with the arms-folded, stare-you-down look, a
trademark logo -- a pelican, of course -- and a motto for clients,
"Your problem becomes my problem." But part of his image, too, has
been that he's one detective who does not need a gun to deal with the
enemies of such celebrity clients as Michael Jackson and Sylvester
Stallone. He might use a little dirt, sure -- or a lot of dirt. And a
bat too -- his signature Louisville slugger. But not a gun. "I always
start out by being a gentleman," he said once. "I only use
intimidation and fear when I absolutely have to." Another time, he
described his approach as appealing to someone's sense of values
first, and only then, "if they don't have any, then I have to
counter-blackmail 'em." Or as he put it on another occasion, "Anybody
who wants to malign one of my clients, I dig into their pasts. So
they gotta take the same heat that they dish out."</TE>
<TE>   That's been the image -- built on tough talk, dirt and a bat --
that has helped the 58-year-old father of nine win both business and
headlines for 20 years now in Los Angeles. And in a city whose own
image was crafted in part by a line of fictional private eyes -- from
Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe to Jack Nicholson's Jake Gittes in
"Chinatown" -- the Hollywood detective is almost expected to play the
loner walking an ethical tightrope, even if the image has only a
marginal relationship to reality.</TE>
<TE>   But now the detective who supposedly didn't need a gun will have
to explain why federal authorities stumbled on far more than that
last week when they searched two safes in his Sunset Boulevard
office. The FBI agents were there to investigate allegations on an
FBI informant's tape recordings that Pellicano may have orchestrated
a threat in June against Times reporter Anita M. Busch, perhaps at
the behest of actor Steven Seagal -- an allegation both men deny. The
FBI agents said they found two loaded guns and 15 to 20 bundles of
cash, "the majority of which bore $10,000 wrappers." But what's cost
Pellicano his freedom, at least until a hearing Wednesday in U.S.
District Court, is the discovery of two practice hand grenades,
allegedly "altered for the specific purpose of rendering them
lethal," and plastic explosives "consistent with military C-4,"
according to an affidavit by special agent Stanley E. Ornellas.</TE>
<TE>   Pellicano is said to have told another agent at the scene that
"the items in the safe were from an old case of his and that he had
forgotten they were there." "I don't like to talk about defenses
before I have to use defenses. But I think there's a reasonable
explanation," Pellicano's attorney, Donald M. Re, said over the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The defense attorney promised an explanation this week that would
at least suggest a "mitigating circumstance" for why the city's most
famous private detective had the favored weapons of terrorists. "The
explosive could easily be used to blow up a car," Ornellas said, "and
was in fact strong enough to bring down an airplane."</TE>
<TE>   High school dropout</TE>
<TE>   Anthony "The Pelican" Pellicano learned the value of myth-making,
and even a touch of scandal, before he came to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   He takes pride in having transformed himself from a high school
dropout off the streets of Cicero, Ill., raised by a divorced single
mom, into a detective able to command, as an "ultimate problem
solver," $25,000 retainers. He used the name Tony Fortune during his
days collecting debts for the Spiegel catalog, then went into
business for himself in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   He won appointment to the Illinois Law Enforcement Commission,
which distributed federal crime-fighting funds, but resigned in 1976
in the wake of news reports that he had accepted a $30,000 loan from
the son of an underworld figure. Pellicano said the son was a
childhood friend and his daughter's godfather, "just like any other
guy in the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   He made a splash again in 1977, for finding not a missing person
but missing bones -- the remains of movie producer Michael Todd, who
was married to Elizabeth Taylor when he died in a 1958 plane crash.
When Todd's remains vanished from an Illinois cemetery and local
police couldn't find them, Pellicano did, saying an informant had
told him to search under leaves and dirt near the grave. His
detractors whispered, but it was a perfect noir moment -- who could
say where the truth lay?</TE>
<TE>   What competitors did not dispute, then or now, was that Pellicano
had some real skills beyond the ability to garner publicity. The most
notable was his ability to analyze recordings, and to enhance the
quality of surveillance tapes used by private detectives and the
government alike. That's what brought him to Los Angeles in 1983; he
was hired by attorney Howard Weitzman to assist in the defense of
carmaker John Z. DeLorean, who was caught in a government sting and
charged in a bizarre scheme to raise millions of dollars selling
cocaine. Pellicano helped dissect the prosecution tapes and Weitzman
won an acquittal for DeLorean. Weitzman went on to use the detective
in "a great number of cases afterward" and to this day remains one of
Pellicano's fans, saying over the weekend that he did "a great job as
an investigator." These days, even the government sometimes uses
Pellicano's technical skills. Pellicano also began offering the
"damage control" services that made him a P.I. of choice for a
coterie of lawyers with the sort of celebrity clients who have to
fend off stalkers, extortionists, the tabloids, paternity claims --
or combinations of the above.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a time when a male celebrity I was representing was
getting really threatening letters," recalls one of those lawyers,
Bertram Fields. "No police agency could find [the culprit]. The
letters were being mailed from a small town in New York. The FBI had
worked on it, even some foreign intelligence agency. Within 24, maybe
48 hours, Anthony called me and said, 'I'm across the street from the
guy who's sending the letters. What do you want me to do?' " A decade
after the DeLorean case, Pellicano became a full-fledged celebrity in
his own right, when he surfaced as a defender and spin-master for
singer Michael Jackson, who faced career-threatening molestation
allegations from the family of a young boy. In more recent years,
Pellicano represented actor Mike Myers, when he was sued by Universal
Pictures for allegedly breaching his contract to write and star in a
movie called "Dieter.''</TE>
<TE>   For all the attorneys who use Pellicano, and swear by him, there
are others who question how he works, like the Beverly Hills lawyer
convinced that Pellicano's men are the ones now watching one of his
clients, a nanny to a wealthy family, though he admits: "I can't
prove it."</TE>
<TE>   One on-the-record critic is criminal defense attorney Leslie
Abramson, who has become famous for her work for the Menendez
brothers and others. She says Pellicano charged a client of hers
$80,000 but did little for that fee. "He's a joke," she says, "except
he's not funny."</TE>
<TE>   Nazarian, the Encino-based investigator, likes to joke that "there
are only two types of people who use private investigators: crazy
people and rich people. In our business, if you get a crazy rich
person, that's a good day."</TE>
<TE>   One private investigator who says he has worked a couple of cases
with Pellicano said "there's a little bit of envy in the community"
over the big fees and publicity Pellicano draws. He said Pellicano is
"a loose cannon ... a big show," an investigator who has "done very
well in the perception business."</TE>
<TE>   Company he keeps</TE>
<TE>   Now the public perception of L.A.'s best known private
investigator is at a crossroads, caught up in some of the very things
that have brought him cases over the years: a blood feud, informants
and lots of taping.</TE>
<TE>   The feud is between Seagal, the martial arts instructor turned
action star, and his former producing partner, Julius R. Nasso. The
pair split two years ago and Nasso filed a $60-million lawsuit
against the actor this spring for refusing to appear in four movies.
Then the seemingly routine Hollywood squabble became anything but --
due to a Mafia investigation in Staten Island, where Nasso lives.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, FBI bugs at mob hangouts there picked
up conversations between Nasso and the local capo, Sonny Ciccone.
Nasso was seeking help in dealing with an "entertainment figure," and
Ciccone spoke of demanding $150,000 for each movie Seagal made.</TE>
<TE>   The filing of extortion charges last May against Nasso, Ciccone
and others set off a slew of new accusations between the Nasso and
Seagal camps, and publicity neither needed. In June, Busch, one of
two L.A. Times reporters investigating the relationship between
Seagal and Nasso, discovered a bullet hole in her car, along with a
dead fish and rose, and a note warning, "Stop."</TE>
<TE>   A federal search warrant application later outlined how a man then
began calling Busch, claiming to know who did it, and how federal
agents and Los Angeles police then confronted the informant. He
agreed to wear a wire at meetings with the man he said carried out
the vandalism, ex-convict Alexander Proctor.</TE>
<TE>   In a July 3 conversation, Proctor confided that he had set out to
terrorize the reporter for one "Anthony," who was "a big investigator
in Los Angeles," according to the FBI document. On Aug. 13, "Proctor
acknowledged that the Anthony who hired him was the private
investigator Anthony Pellicano."</TE>
<TE>   Though Proctor was arrested Oct. 16, federal authorities said
there still was no independent evidence to prove who had ordered the
attack, just his "uncorroborated statements." So FBI agents showed up
Thursday at Pellicano's offices, looking for that evidence -- only to
find something else.</TE>
<TE>   Pellicano now will have to answer the weapons charges even if he
is never linked to the June threat against Busch.</TE>
<TE>   His standing seems secure, however. As Pellicano was arraigned
Friday on the weapons charges, an official sitting in the holding
area for prisoners gave Pellicano a newspaper with the story of his
arrest, according to Re, the detective's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "The other inmates," the official told Re, "will consider him a
celebrity now."</TE>

<HD>India.Arie connects with genuine life lessons</HD>

<LD>India.Arie calls herself shy, the "least likely" person to spend an
hour performing "experiments" onstage for an adoring crowd drawn to
her songs of folk and earthy soul music. But Friday at the Universal
Amphi- theatre, the singer-songwriter was proud and loose, strong and
unpretentious.</LD>
<LD>   Chatting easily between songs, Arie assumed the freedom to dabble
in human beat box, duel with her guitarist and attempt a flute solo
that was raw but evocative. In a flowing white dress, and with a big
yellow flower behind an ear, Arie floated around the stage during her
band's early instrumental passages. Not the usual sign of a shy
person.</LD>
<LD>   Performing songs from her largely acoustic new album, "Voyage to
India," Arie offered simple life lessons with a warm and forceful
soul sound in the tradition of classic Stevie Wonder. Likewise, much
of her set had her virtually alone on acoustic guitar, including a
version of Minnie Ripperton's "Loving You" that was true to the
original, even the aching high notes, while making the song her own.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier, the three rappers of Slum Village performed with an often
spare, jazzy vibe, though the big beats sometimes overpowered the
other music in the mix. Floetry, a London female duo, performed a
soul sound that was romantic and sometimes cutting. The two
singer-rappers sent voices in all directions, both disciplined and
utterly free to roam, following traditions from Ella Fitzgerald to
Wonder to Lauryn Hill.</TE>
<TE>   With bass grooves that were deep and embracing, the voices were
backed by a powerful, if quietly emotional quartet that would be
worth hearing even without the voices out front.</TE>

<HD>A blazing Smoke Out, a blase crowd</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Baltin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By most measures, the fifth annual Smoke Out concert was a success at
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where it moved after four years in
San Bernardino.</LD>
<LD>   The daylong affair, which attracted more than 21,000 fans on
Saturday, came off without any major hitches, save co-headliner Snoop
Dogg's taking the stage at 1:45 a.m., nearly an hour after his
scheduled start time. The bill also included co-headliner and show
organizer Cypress Hill, as well as up-and-coming rockers such as
Mudvayne and Taproot.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the strong lineup, however, the audience never seemed to
fully embrace the day.</LD>
<TE>   The mostly teenage throng waved hands in the air some, especially
for guest performers Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, and chanted with many of
the hip-hop performers. However, nearly every performer, from L.A.
rap-metal hybrid 3rd Strike to Cypress Hill, had to repeatedly
implore the crowd to make some noise or jump around.</TE>
<TE>   Fans seemed remarkably blase about much of the scene despite the
best efforts of the promoters, who set up the grounds as a
European-style festival, including two stages, a dance tent, a wide
array of vendors and a skateboard and bike demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the day, a crowd gathered in a circle in front of the
vendors while a group of boys took turns showing off their dancing
prowess.</TE>
<TE>   There may have been more excitement in that circle than from the
thousands pressed in front of the main stage. Which goes to show,
maybe in the days of "American Idol" and so-called reality TV, it's
not enough to put on a show for kids; they need to be the show.</TE>

<KH>NEW YORK, N.Y.</KH>
<HD>Taking a golden opportunity without the aid of a silver
spoon</HD>
<DH>It has been the same noble story for a remarkably long
time. An ambitious young immigrant enrolls in New York's fabled City
College on a hill in Harlem and in a few years becomes a middle-class
American, accomplishing in no time at all what once took generations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is Fatima El Shibli's story, too, only as the daughter of a
Sudanese doctor and German accountant, she had a leg up on many of
her poor predecessors. Still, that hill was not an easy climb, and
the other day, the university rewarded Fatima and 66 other students
with $1,000 scholarships in recognition of their talent and
determination. Listening to Fatima's story, the alumni -- mostly
older Jewish men and black women -- who gathered in a Manhattan
ballroom to honor these young people could not help misting up.</LD>
<LD>   But what could have been a shopworn tale of the American dream
sounded instead quite refreshing -- a salve for a hardened city that
registered actual shock from another tale of striving and social
mobility achieved through education but accomplished in the most
unseemly of ways.</LD>
<TE>   A recent criminal investigation of Wall Street analyst Jack
Grubman has focused on allegations that he may have sold out AT&amp;T
shareholders in 1999 to get his twins into an exclusive nursery
school on the Upper East Side. Grubman is said to have upgraded
Salomon Smith Barney's rating on AT&amp;T from "dump" to "buy" to help
his boss, Citigroup Chairman Sanford Weill, who, in what the Wall
Street Journal called a "Kid Pro Quo," apparently used his influence
to get the Grubman twins into preschool. As shareholders must not
have been thrilled to learn, Citigroup pledged a $1-million donation
to the school.</TE>
<TE>   Now, there are plenty of reasons to ridicule the New York City
private school admission process. Ask any parents who have spent
anxious nights worrying about how their 4-year-old was going to
weather a 40-minute interview with a school admissions officer. Then
there are the essays on school applications with questions like: "If
your 4-year-old was a fruit, what would he/she be? Explain." Or ask
the admissions directors who get strong-armed by members of their
haute boards of directors to take this moneybag's son or that
powerful real estate agent's daughter.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Grubman may not be the best symbol of avarice and
scheming in this city. He is, after all, not to-the-manner born.
Raised in blue-collar Philadelphia, he had no real experience in
uppity private schools and apparently even lied on his official
Salomon biography, claiming he had graduated from MIT when Boston
University was his alma mater. So it's no surprise that once he
became a $20-million-a-year man, he wanted his children to go the
royal route.</TE>
<TE>   What is bracing is the social fear embedded in the education part
of this tale -- that Grubman's children might suffer if he didn't get
them properly tracked to go from brand-name school to brand-name
school and on to brand-name jobs. Still, just a few miles uptown in
Harlem, there are dreamers like Fatima El Shibli who remind us of
another kind of social ambition that has given City College a good
name for most of 155 years, one that makes a room full of alumni
swell with pride.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the early immigrant students at City College -- many shtetl
Jews -- Shibli's father had already made the great leap from poor to
middle class when he left his religiously conservative family in
Khartoum to become a doctor abroad. And before he died when Fatima
was 10, her father surrounded her with Arabic music and African
culture, instilling in her the desire for a world-class education.</TE>
<TE>   In high school, she visited New York several times, once picking
up a brochure for the prestigious Juilliard School of Music. "I sat
down in Central Park with the brochure," she told the alumni in the
ballroom, "and cried. I wanted to pursue my dreams so much: to
acquire a profound education in jazz and to perform in New York."</TE>
<TE>   But there was something else in New York she had to have: "In
Germany I wasn't that strong in my identity. I spoke German but I did
not look German or have a German name. But I was also not Muslim
really. My family in the Sudan would never approve of a woman who
wanted to perform. In New York, I could be anything."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, at 22, Fatima made it to New York with $1,000 in
savings that she hoped would last her six months. One bagel became an
entire day's meal; a tiny room in the East Village became her home;
catering gigs at jazz clubs where she would listen to the music were
her new source of income. She also joined the African Gazelles, a
traveling dance corps, and got gigs with her own small band, FaFa's
World of Music. But she wanted college: "If I gigged, the audience
would shout its approval, 'Yeah, great.' But I wanted to get real
feedback."</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, when she found a one-bedroom apartment in Harlem,
she also found City College with its $3,000 tuition, its stone
buildings and spires and impressive jazz department. "I thought I
knew a little about music but after the first year I realized how
much I needed to learn." She was not impressed, however, with basic
English, science and philosophy courses.</TE>
<TE>   "I had harder studies in the eighth grade in Germany," she said.
"The tests here are multiple choice. There, I took high school
courses where we had three- and four-hour written exams." The City
College that between 1920 and 1970 produced more Nobel Laureates
(nine) and more PhDs than any other public institution in America
over the last 30 years has not been gathering up the best of the
urban poor. The change to open admissions in the late 1960s was
intended to make the school accessible to blacks and Latinos in the
neighborhood with little money and few opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   But the college couldn't transform their lives because they often
didn't have the basic skills to survive freshman year. City, which
used to be free, lost prestige. But in recent years it reinstituted
admissions standards, and its reputation is improving.</TE>
<TE>   Fatima will get her bachelor's degree in February and is thinking
about graduate school. A couple of days after the scholarship
ceremony, she sat cross-legged on a wooden chair in the living room
of her $600-a-month walk-up. The room, painted the cream color of the
desert, is decorated sparely but lovingly with photos of African
children and wooden sculptures. Behind her are stacks of demo tapes
and an electronic piano. She played a tape for a visitor.</TE>
<TE>   As she listened dreamily to herself sing "Summertime" in German
accompanied by her band, she smiled. Here was a woman who had the
confidence, without a push from anyone, to make her way in a
brand-name city and it opened its arms to her.</TE>

<HD>Loves, lies of a modern Don Juan</HD>
<DH>'Cringe,' which has a strong cast but needs some editing,
follows one man's descent into Hollywood's dark side.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Philip Brandes</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Modern-day Hollywood is enough to make anyone, well, "Cringe" -- and,
naming his play accordingly, playwright Peter Nieves seeks to do
exactly that. Completing the Evidence Room's "Hollywood Stories"
trilogy of Tinseltown-themed new plays performed in repertory,
"Cringe" is Nieves' raw, sardonic re-envisioning of the Don Juan
story set against the excesses of the film biz.</LD>
<LD>   What begins as a Steve Martin-esque parody of power lunches
(replete with air kisses and mass fumbling whenever a cell phone
rings) gathers darkening malevolence as we follow the skyrocketing
career of Jack Cringe (convincingly played by Christian Leffler), a
screenwriter who finds that the more badly he behaves, the higher his
star rises. A path of betrayal (especially of the women he uses and
discards) leads Jack to the same place as his literary predecessor --
only Jack's hell (a crimson-lighted pool party) is even harder to
distinguish from his normal milieu.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood is an easy target for co-directors Nieves' and Bart
DeLorenzo's Moliere-inspired jabs at hypocrisy, but for all of their
obviousness, the blows connect with devastating force, thanks to
superb ensemble performances.</LD>
<TE>   Topping the charts is Dan Butler's hilariously savage portrait of
an imperious film producer whose ethics never rise above the level of
his bodily functions. Other standout caricatures from the large cast
include Lauren Campedelli's self-absorbed actress, Don Oscar Smith as
the producer's gravelly chauffeur, Patricia Scanlon as David's loopy
secretary, and Pamela Gordon as an indie film producer desperate to
break into the big leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Without recourse to nudity, the play's merciless, edgy staging
effectively conjures the depths of squalid hedonism, amid an
increasingly surreal tone reminiscent of a David Lynch film.</TE>
<TE>   However striking, the play's excesses also define its limitations.
As events become further removed from recognizable reality, their
emotional impact dulls. The eager availability of Jack's victims
removes any art of seduction (and any sense of an assault on
propriety) from his sexual conquests. Although teeming with
memorable, well-played scenes, the whole is less than the sum of its
parts. Seriously in need of tightening, this road to hell is paved
with repetitious intentions.</TE>

<HD>Program showcases Osorio and Long Beach Symphony</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Cariaga</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the more elegant and accomplished pianists on the planet,
Jorge Federico Osorio has been playing with our local orchestras over
the past two decades. He always brings new insights, eloquent
readings and an effortless virtuosity to all his assignments.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday night he came to the Long Beach Symphony and played not
one, but two concertos. In the first, essaying the atmospheric solo
in Manuel de Falla's "Nights in the Gardens of Spain," he created
mellow sounds and magical arpeggios. He had the full collaboration of
Long Beach music director Enrique Arturo Diemecke and an orchestra
that had never played the piece.</LD>
<LD>   In the second, Ravel's daunting Piano Concerto for the Left Hand,
Osorio's natural subtlety commanded and outlined the passion in the
work without making it the life-or-death affair it can be. One still
admired greatly this well-considered performance by pianist and
orchestra. And one still waits in vain to hear the Mexico City-born
pianist in a solo recital. In a city full of boastful entrepreneurs,
are there no budding impresa- rios?</LD>
<TE>   For the second half of this colorful program, Diemecke put
together two of Claude Debussy's three orchestral Nocturnes, "Nuages"
and "Fetes," with the French composer's "La Mer." The combination
showed off Debussy and the orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   The wide contrasts and colorful instrumental writing in these
pieces displayed this ensemble's growing achievement.</TE>
<TE>   The conductor, as he had earlier in the program, created
transparent textures and a prismatic clarity, thus bringing to life
Debussy's descriptive writing.</TE>

<HD>Ferry still getting by nicely on old charms</HD>
<DH>The former Roxy Music frontman has not forgotten how to
assemble the elements for a familiar, crowd-pleasing show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Cromelin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Almost a decade ago, Bryan Ferry came to town without much fanfare or
momentum, a glitter-era veteran presumably going through the motions.
Those were the expectations anyway, but the English singer turned
them on their head with a rousing show at the Pantages that imbued
his vintage material with charm and heart.</LD>
<LD>   Ferry's basic profile hasn't changed much in the interim. He
remains a solid cult hero for a certain rank of art-rock follower,
but he has little commercial presence in the U.S., and he isn't
moving in any new or surprising directions. His most recent album,
"Frantic," follows form, combining original songs with a mid-'60s
Drifters obscurity and takes on Dylan, Leadbelly, Don Nix et al.</LD>
<LD>   But when Ferry played the Kodak Theatre on Saturday, there was one
added wrinkle -- the luster of the much-acclaimed Roxy Music reunion
tour in 2001. Maybe that created an unfair comparison, but for
whatever reason, the concert never transcended the level of what
you'd expect from a classy, meticulously mounted Bryan Ferry show</LD>
<TE>   You could find pleasures in any of its segments, from the low-key
opening sequence with Ferry alone on piano, then with violin and
harp, to the Roxy- revisited finale of "Love Is the Drug" and "Do the
Strand," with the crowd on its feet, large band blazing and two
dancers in full, pink Vegas-showgirl plumage. His most inspired
programming came in the encore's unlikely juxtaposition of Bob Dylan
and Sam the Sham.</TE>
<TE>   As long as he maintains these production values, Ferry can
probably keep this going for a while -- the old wounded-romantic
persona still fits this almost-60 performer as well as the series of
sharp suits he donned on Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Saving the world with Bond may be just the start for Berry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Desowitz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OK, it may not win her a second Oscar, but Halle Berry wants everyone
to know she did some homework on her first post-Academy Award role:
playing opposite James Bond as his true opposite number, the secret
agent Jinx.</LD>
<LD>   With struggling MGM hoping for a hit in "Die Another Day," Berry
has been enlisted, along with star Pierce Brosnan and director Lee
Tamahori, to help bring the 40-year-old "Bond" franchise into the era
of "XXX" and "The Matrix."</LD>
<LD>   As research, Berry revisited "Dr. No," the first Bond film, which
she watched as a child on TV, because her entrance in the new movie,
coming out of the water wearing an orange Honey Rider-style bikini,
paid homage to actress Ursula Andress. It's one of several winks and
nods to Bond-mania in the film, including the "Thunderball" jet
packs, the "Goldfinger" laser and the diamond-studded satellite/super
laser from "Diamonds Are Forever."</LD>
<TE>   As she does for every role, Berry said she also developed her own
personal back story for Jinx, though she won't divulge the details.
"It's my own life for her, my own personal tools for the job. I mean,
I even wrote it down. You'll never, ever know it, but that affects
the way you talk, the way you walk, where you're really from. And
understanding what your character really wants."</TE>
<TE>   Berry actually took the role of Jinx before her star turn in the
2001 film "Monster's Ball" landed her the best actress Oscar -- the
first ever for an African American woman.</TE>
<TE>   "When the offer came in, it was take it or leave it, which was the
first time that's happened in my career," Berry said. "I had to say
yes. I found her to be my kind of Bond girl -- smart, tough,
physical, mysterious and independent."</TE>
<TE>   Although she wasn't used to shooting a work in progress (typical
for a Bond film, in which scripts routinely are retooled on the set),
Berry said she found the experience stimulating. "Actors offered
ideas and came up with lines -- everybody was always percolating. The
'Yo mama' line was spur of the moment and I didn't think it was going
to stay in the movie, but I was glad to bring a part of myself to
it."</TE>
<TE>   There already are plans to spin off Jinx into her own movie
franchise. "Die Another Day" screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert
Wade currently are developing a treatment. "If she could stay the
character I've come to know and love, and would evolve even further
... then I'm absolutely interested. [And] now that I find myself on
the brink of this, I'm thinking this is just weird, how this is
happening."</TE>
<TE>   Bond co-producer Michael Wilson said he is open to the idea as
well. "For somebody to win an Academy Award for a dramatic piece and
then to do this with the same enthusiasm, and not feel it is a step
down, is wonderful. And if she has a back story for Jinx all worked
out, well, I'd like to hear about it."</TE>
<TE>   MGM, the smallest of the seven major studios, could use another
franchise a la Bond, whose brand-name identification virtually
guarantees that the films become hits in country after country.</TE>
<TE>   And MGM could use a few hits. From late last year through this
summer, the struggling Santa Monica-based studio saw a string of
high-profile, big-budget films stumble out of the starting gate,
including "Windtalkers," "Rollerball" and two Bruce Willis vehicles,
"Hart's War" and "Bandits." One recent bright spot: Its warmhearted
urban comedy "Barbershop" premiered in first place at the box office
with $21 million in September.</TE>
<TE>   With "Die Another Day," the studio is counting on Berry's role as
Bond's new love interest to appeal to female audiences as well as to
men (who'll also get their quota of high-octane action sequences and
state-of-the-art gadgetry).</TE>
<TE>   Over drinks recently at the Hotel Bel-Air, Brosnan said, "Halle
has a maturity, sexuality and sensuality that makes men and women
feel so at ease." Now in his fourth outing as Bond, Brosnan said "Die
Another Day" is a step into the new era.</TE>
<TE>   "To see Lee pull [producers] Barbara [Broccoli] and Michael
[Wilson] into the 21st century, to get them to use CGI
[computer-generated imagery] and get them to put Bond in tougher
situations is so satisfying," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Tamahori, who's known for Ken Loach-like realistic
pictures in his native New Zealand ("Once Were Strangers") and David
Fincher-like thrillers in America ("Along Came a Spider"), said
making a Bond film was a fan's fantasy. "This film is made very much
with great reverence for the old Bond movies," Tamahori said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Halle's Jinx, she was Tamahori's version of Modesty Blaise,
the cultish comic strip spy. "I said to Halle, 'No matter what you
think, this character has got to be as kick-ass as Bond.' If you look
carefully at the love scene, she actually takes him to bed and leaves
him in the morning. And she's on top and she's got a knife in her
hand during the lovemaking scene. Pierce and Halle loved that."</TE>

<HD>With 'The Beverly Hillbillies' slot machines, Jethro might
strike pay dirt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Jethro Bodine intends to prove he's no fool.</LD>
<LD>   Max Baer Jr., who once played the burly, doltish character on the
sitcom "The Beverly Hillbillies," recently signed a deal with
International Game Technology of Reno to produce hundreds of penny
slot machines featuring the show that once drew millions of loyal
viewers.</LD>
<LD>   "It's so obvious it's not a gamble," Baer said in a recent
interview at his Las Vegas home. "It fits in. It meshes with the
characters and the show."</LD>
<TE>   If Baer, 64, hits his jackpot in the casinos, he wants to strike
gold in supermarkets with bakery goods, such as Elly May's buns,
Granny's lye soap and perhaps Jethro's sausage.</TE>
<TE>   Tapping into "The Beverly Hillbillies" has been a long time coming
for Baer, who left the movie and TV business in 1979 and moved to
Lake Tahoe, where he now has a second home.</TE>
<TE>   He obtained certain licensing rights to "The Beverly Hillbillies"
from CBS in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, IGT approached him about a deal to make the hillbilly
slot machines and an agreement was reached.</TE>
<TE>   Now 65 machines sit in 10 Station casinos around Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the slot machines seem to be attracting new customers and
probably a few people who grew up watching the show during the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Roy, Station's vice president for slot operations, said the
machines are creating a buzz.</TE>
<TE>   "They are doing good," Roy said. "We need a little time, but the
early numbers indicate that they should be a success."</TE>

<HD>A tribute to legacy of Mingus</HD>
<DH>An inspiring program at the Luckman marks a year in which
the brilliant composer would have turned 80.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 80th anniversary of Charles Mingus' birth has been woefully
overlooked in Los Angeles, the city in which he was reared and first
came to musical maturity.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, James Newton and the Luckman Jazz Orchestra came to
the rescue Saturday night at Cal State L.A.'s Luckman Fine Arts
Complex with "Mingus at 80 -- A Los Angeles Homecoming."</LD>
<LD>   Touching the spirit and the substance of this remarkable artist's
music, the concert -- which also featured the Los Angeles Symphonic
Camerata conducted by David Buck -- offered the sort of creatively
alive experience that was the essential characteristic of the great
bassist and composer's art.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike Duke Ellington, his acknowledged idol and influence, Mingus
rarely had the opportunity to work with a large, stable, continually
available ensemble. In addition, his highly volatile personality --
intensified by the painful realities of the segregated world in which
he spent a substantial portion of his life -- tended to place the
focus upon his polarizing public persona rather than his music.</TE>
<TE>   Which was unfortunate, since Mingus' great attribute as an artist
was his capacity to transform all of his experiences, all the aspects
of who he was as a man, into stunning creative accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   Newton's program -- with much from which to choose -- selected an
illuminating collection of Mingus' works: from the sweet lyricism of
"Celia" and the tender tribute to Lester Young, "Goodbye, Pork Pie
Hat," to the sardonic anger of "Fables of Faubus" and the layered
inventiveness of the rarely heard film score "Todo Modo."</TE>
<TE>   The last work, performed effectively by the Camerata with the LJO
rhythm section, traced to the last years of Mingus' life. Despite its
sometimes uneven qualities, it was a poignant reminder of the
unrealized potential present when Mingus died of Lou Gehrig's disease
in 1979 at the age of 56.</TE>
<TE>   Other pieces -- "Haitian Fight Song," "Boogie Stop Shuffle,"
"Pithecanthropus Erectus" -- simmered with a more fundamental jazz
feeling, propulsively driven by unerring combinations of compelling
melodies and viscerally gripping rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   The LJO, continuing to expand its importance as one of the
Southland's premier jazz ensembles, once again demonstrated how a big
jazz band can perform with the improvisational spontaneity of a small
group. A few of the standouts among the many solo offerings came from
tenor saxophonist Bennie Maupin ("Goodbye, Pork Pie Hat,"),
trombonist Isaac Smith ("Celia"), tuba player William Roper (offering
the dramatic narration on "Fables of Faubus"), and on a variety of
pieces, alto saxophonist Ann Patterson and pianist Lanny Hartley.</TE>
<TE>   Brilliantly taking the responsibility for replicating Mingus'
instrumental contributions was bassist Jeffery Littleton.</TE>

<HD>Sultry Norah Jones turns up the juice</HD>
<DH>At the Sounds Eclectic concert, the Texas newcomer, with an
assist from Beck, delivers a seductively classic performance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Norah Jones has come a long way since opening for John Mayer last
spring at the House of Blues -- 2-million album sales for starters,
along with enough acclaim to make her the odds-on favorite for best
new artist, and more, in the Grammy balloting.</LD>
<LD>   So it figured that the sultry Texan would be the center of
attention at KCRW-FM's annual Sounds Eclectic Evening benefit concert
Saturday at the Universal Amphitheatre.</LD>
<LD>   But Jones proved even more winning than expected, first with her
own set, then showing a new, playful side in a duet with Beck on an
old country ballad, "Sleepless Nights."</LD>
<TE>   That highlighted an engaging sequence that brought a much-needed
sense of edgy vitality and even a touch of pop anarchy to the 4
1/2-hour event.</TE>
<TE>   We all love KCRW (89.9) and Nic Harcourt, its excellent musical
director, but the Santa Monica-based public radio station's strength
-- showcasing music that is unerringly tasteful and, to varying
degrees, cerebral -- can also be a weakness when nine of its acts are
placed back to back in concert.</TE>
<TE>   The lineup was certainly eclectic, stretching from the positive
rap of Blackalicious to the percussion-driven rock en espanol of
Kinky on through the soulful electronica of Zero 7 to an SUV-ful of
singer-songwriters, including Aimee Mann, Beth Orton, Ramsey Midwood
and Pete Yorn.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Beck, an unannounced guest, who brought that needed
slice of vitality. For openers, he and his buddy Wayne Coyne, leader
of the band Flaming Lips, enlivened things with ragged duets of such
songs as Sonny &amp; Cher's goofy "I Got You Babe" and Willie Nelson and
Waylon Jennings' outlaw anthem, "Good Hearted Woman."</TE>
<TE>   Beck, who plays with the Flaming Lips tonight at Universal, then
stayed on stage for three more duets. Besides the one with Jones, he
sang the Rolling Stones' "No Expectations" with Orton and then the
zesty "Grease" hit "You're the One That I Want" with Zero 7's Sia
Furler.</TE>
<TE>   Because singer-pianist Jones and her stylish three-piece group had
to follow all that, as well as Orton's stirring earlier set, you
wondered whether this pop newcomer wouldn't be upstaged.</TE>
<TE>   No way.</TE>
<TE>   Jones has some superior songs on her hit album "Come Away With
Me," but she's blessed with a sultry, seductive vocal style that
could give any good song the feel of a classic.</TE>
<TE>   When she turned to a number by the Band, she also showed artistic
daring. Instead of "The Weight" or another hit, she sang "Bessie
Smith," an obscure one that the Band recorded with Bob Dylan during
the "Basement Tapes" sessions in the '60s. Sure enough, it felt like
a classic.</TE>

<LD>TV has a long history of depicting U.S. presidents, with Sam
Waterston's soulful Abe Lincoln in 1988 standing head and stovepipe
hat above them all, and assembly lines of clay-duck John F. Kennedys
reminding us how bad screen biographies can be.</LD>
<LD>   When it came to low burlesque, though, nothing beat "An American
President," a PBS series in 2000 whose exotic choices to speak the
words of first executives may have been the worst concept in the
annals of documentarydom.</LD>
<LD>   Former Sen. Bob Dole as Herbert Hoover? Muttering radio jokester
Don Imus as Andrew Johnson? Democratic Party hit man James Carville
as Andrew Jackson? When that master thespian Carville woodenly
recited, "My reputation is dearer to me than life," it brought to
mind a line that Jack Benny made his signature:</LD>
<TE>   "Now cut that out!"</TE>
<TE>   Prime time's most famous presidents these days are fictional.
Josiah Bartlet of NBC's "The West Wing" has just been reelected, and
David Palmer is a year into his first term on Fox's tumultuous "24."</TE>
<TE>   Bartlet (Martin Sheen) is a short, white, folksy intellectual;
Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), tall, black and regal. Bartlet is effusive,
Palmer stony. Bartlet has shrewd eyes and misses nothing (because
he's a liberal Democrat, no doubt), Palmer (a Democrat whose
philosophies are not precisely defined) is a bit of a thickhead.</TE>
<TE>   Their White Houses, too, are as different as, well, white and
black. Bartlet's is as funny as it is thoughtful, Palmer's
relentlessly grave.</TE>
<TE>   Bartlet not only has health problems but this season is also
facing another crush of domestic challenges and global crises, and
already has a Middle East assassination under his belt. Just last
Wednesday, moreover, he adroitly handled a secret request from a
militant Iranian leader to allow his 15-year-old son to enter the
U.S. for life-saving surgery. After Bartlet reluctantly said yes, the
ayatollah infuriated him by still issuing a bitter harangue against
the U.S. to assuage Iranian hard-liners at home.</TE>
<TE>   That's mild, however, compared with the minefield facing Palmer in
a series whose entire season spans just 24 hours in the lives of its
characters.</TE>
<TE>   At 8 a.m. he was summoned from a fishing vacation with his son and
informed that unnamed terrorists were planning that day to set off a
nuclear bomb in Los Angeles that would cause up to 2.5-million
casualties.</TE>
<TE>   It will be noon when Episode 5 opens Tuesday with Palmer still
trying to keep the looming nuclear threat secret, and still shaken by
news that a smaller bomb blew apart the L.A. branch of the
government's Counter Terrorist Unit and killed or injured scores of
its staff.</TE>
<TE>   What's a president to do?</TE>
<TE>   For starters, Palmer immediately put on ice a nosy newspaperman
who would have panicked the city by reporting the nuclear device's
existence. Bartlet the libertarian probably wouldn't have done that.</TE>
<TE>   In Bartlet's case, also, we have a president who rarely makes
major decisions without consulting his large cadre of smart
loyalists, and his wife also delivers advice.</TE>
<TE>   But what is it with poor Palmer, who appears almost isolated? Will
someone please find this president a staff?</TE>
<TE>   He suffered major betrayals last season, one by his chief
political advisor on the eve of the election, another by his ruthless
wife (they're now divorced). The final moments of last week's hour
found him firing National Security Agency honcho Eric Rayburn
(Timothy Carhart), who had blocked presidential aide Lynne Kresge
(Michelle Forbes) from telling him of the CTU bomb threat in time to
order the place evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   Why would Rayburn do that? It's all very mysterious, although his
whole tone and demeanor scream hidden agenda. Why, also, did Kresge
refrain from ratting on Rayburn to Palmer, even though she's
presented as the president's closest aide (his chief of staff has yet
to become a factor)?</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Palmer had to ferret out this deception himself,
perceiving belatedly what viewers surely knew all along (duh): that
Rayburn was a treacherous slug. Shifty eyes were the giveaway.</TE>
<TE>   It would go differently in the Bartlet White House, where staff
fidelity to the president is a religion. Along with incessant
repartee. Here's a White House for Noel Coward.</TE>
<TE>   If Bartlet learned of a terrorist plot to obliterate L.A., the
response would be immediate-- motion. You'd see scene after scene of
him and his staff bantering wittily while striding briskly through
the White House's West Wing as a prelude to saving L.A.'s bacon. Then
they'd walk and be clever some more, because this is the wittiest,
most mobile White House crowd in history.</TE>
<TE>   Bartlet banters wittily while others trail him, and banters
wittily in his private rooms with his wife (Stockard Channing), who
banters back just as wittily. Bartlet's chief of staff (John Spencer)
doesn't banter much, but his deputy (Bradley Whitford) does,
especially with his equally witty assistant (Janel Moloney). The
president's communications director (Richard Schiff) banters wittily,
as does his deputy (Rob Lowe), who is leaving his White House job to
stake out his own witty political future. Bartlet's press secretary
(Allison Janney) banters as wittily as her colleagues. His personal
aide (Dule Hill) has progressed from plain-spoken to wittily
plain-spoken (when he's given something to say). And new to the staff
is an executive secretary (Lily Tomlin) whose potential for witty
banter appears unlimited.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, on the other hand, would break his face if he ever tried
to laugh. What he has that Bartlet doesn't have, though, is Jack
Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), "24's" dominant protagonist. As the
government's least witty man, Bauer is devoid of funny things to say.
But as last season showed, he is the most resourceful Fed in the
field (even though now retired from CTU).</TE>
<TE>   The series continues to follow equally other strands of its
terrorist-plot tangle, including the adventures of Bauer's idiot
daughter, Kim (Elisha Cuthbert). Yet count on Bauer being the one who
saves L.A. at the end of these 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   He might be less a he-man if he worked for Josiah Bartlet. But
he'd be funnier.</TE>

<HD>Fame snowballs for 'Ice Age's' Scrat on new DVD</HD>
<DH>The hapless furry creature has its own five-minute animated
adventure short.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most popular character to emerge from the computer-animated film
"Ice Age," was Scrat, the little rat-squirrel creature whose dash to
store an acorn in the frozen ground accidentally starts the Ice Age.
So on the DVD of "Ice Age" (Fox, $30), which arrives in stores
Tuesday, the hapless rodent headlines his own five-minute animated
short, "Scrat's Missing Adventure."</LD>
<LD>   In this computer-animated outing, Scrat finds a nut behind a patch
of grass and scrambles up a tree, where he has neatly arranged
thousands of nuts.</LD>
<LD>   There is just one spot remaining for the new acorn, and as he
struggles to fit it in, the ground shifts....</LD>
<TE>   Studios are always looking for "added value" elements for their
DVDs; creating new shorts seems to be the latest trend. Disney's disc
for "Monsters, Inc." has one called "Mike's New Car," and on the DVD
of DreamWorks' "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron," viewers can create
their own "Spirit" short film.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't difficult to come up with the plot for "Missing
Adventure," says Chris Wedge, who directed "Ice Age" and is executive
producer of the short.</TE>
<TE>   "During 'Ice Age,' we had a lot of Scrat ideas that never made it
into the film," he says. "At one point [during production], we were
just trying to come up with gags for Scrat because everybody was
enjoying it so much. So we had a lot of gags sitting around."</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, Scrat was never in the script of "Ice Age." But, Wedge
says, "I wanted to come up with an opening for the movie that was a
bit more comical and thematically involved with the title, because
the movie starts in autumn, so everyone's migrating and you don't see
any snow until the third reel. So I thought, let's start up in the
mountains and come down. A glacier should chase somebody down and who
could it be? The smallest guy we can find so it can be pretty funny."</TE>
<TE>   Fox executives loved the sequence so much, says Wedge, that they
used it as a teaser trailer nine months before the movie was released
in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Wedge says they have more ideas for other Scrat shorts and he will
be featured prominently in the "Ice Age" sequel, which is in the
planning stages.</TE>
<TE>   "He is just after one thing," Wedge says. "He wants to be one with
his nut and he can't quite get it. For me, it was all very
metaphoric."</TE>

<HD>New films try to make the holiday pay off</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Thanksgiving holiday weekend is traditionally regarded as one of
the biggest moviegoing periods of the year, when studios roll out
some of their major releases in hopes of attracting kids who are out
of school and adults who have a few days off from work.</LD>
<LD>   So why aren't there any guaranteed blockbusters coming out this
Thanksgiving?</LD>
<LD>   Among films being released this week, the one with arguably the
best chance at hitting box office gold is Disney's new animated
feature, "Treasure Planet." Beyond that, there is the animated movie
"Adam Sandler's 8 Crazy Nights"; George Clooney in the outer-space
romantic drama "Solaris"; the action film "Extreme Ops," starring
Devon Sawa and tennis star Pete Sampras' wife, Bridgette Wilson; and
a genre horror thriller called "Wes Craven Presents: They," which
features even lesser known actors than "Extreme Ops."</LD>
<TE>   But a look at studio release patterns for recent Thanksgivings
suggests that films that do best in the period are usually those
already in theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics compiled by the box office tracking firm Exhibitor
Relations Co. show that in the past four years, "Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone" and "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas"
topped the box office charts even though they were released before
Thanksgiving weekend. "Toy Story 2" and "A Bug's Life," which had
opened the prior weekend exclusively at the El Capitan, built on the
buzz from that one theater to top the box office their first
nationwide weekends in 1999 and 1998, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Less stellar performers that opened Thanksgiving weekend include
"Spy Games," "End of Days" and "Alien: Resurrection," none of which
came anywhere near $100 million in total box office.</TE>
<TE>   This year, look for the new James Bond thriller, "Die Another
Day," which opened Friday, to stay atop the charts going into its
second week.</TE>
<TE>   "Opening on Thanksgiving weekend doesn't guarantee you to be No.
1," said Exhibitor Relations President Paul Dergarabedian.
"Thanksgiving gives movies already in release a boost because they
are a known quantity ... and Thanksgiving gives people a chance to
catch up with them."</TE>

<HD>Like, Conceptual, dude</HD>
<DH>In "Keith Edmier and Farrah Fawcett 2000," the silent muse
finds her voice but has nothing compelling to say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Knight</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirteen years ago, a billboard went up in lower Manhattan to
advertise "Made in Heaven," a movie that didn't exist but that
Conceptual artist Jeff Koons wanted to make. The billboard pictured
Koons, boyishly buff and utterly naked, reclining on a bronze-colored
rock over the recumbent body of Ilona Staller, a former European porn
actress, a member of Italy's laugh-a-minute Parliament and Koons'
wife. Known as Cicciolina, she wore virginal white undergarments and
a Botticelli-style wreath of artificial flowers in her hair.</LD>
<LD>   "Made in Heaven" never got produced, but lots of related
sculptures and photo-based prints did. The pristine busts of Carrara
marble, cheery floral mounds of colorful blown glass and glamour-puss
sex pictures of Koons and Cicciolina coupling were too banal to
explode the vicious sexual politics then raging in the Reagan-era
culture wars. Collectively, the suite flopped.</LD>
<LD>   "Made in Heaven" represents a rare failure in Koons' otherwise
laser-sharp career, where contemporary obsessions with the labyrinth
of celebrity, the nature of mass consumption and issues of public and
private morality can leave a gleefully dumbfounded viewer wide-eyed
and gasping for aesthetic air. But now comes another New York-based
Conceptual artist, 35-year-old Keith Edmier, with a project whose
similarities to Koons' most notable fiasco are pronounced.</LD>
<TE>   There's a sculpture of another naked, boyishly buff artist leaning
back on a boulder of bronze, along with the feminine object of his
erotic desire carved in white marble on another rocky mound nearby. A
Botticelli-style clamshell with an absent Venus, two floral
sculptures (one phallic, one vulval) and several photographic prints
of the pair accompany the set.</TE>
<TE>   These objects differ in tone from Koons' brazen display: They're
rated R, not X. But the similarity also extends to the work's
failure. Edmier's project is a collaboration with actress, amateur
artist and former pinup model Farrah Fawcett, and it was unveiled
Thursday in a hapless show at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "Keith Edmier and Farrah Fawcett 2000," the suite is more
like a hipster version of Andrew Wyeth and Helga. Edmier was a
student at CalArts when the notorious Wyeth pseudo-scandal was
manufactured by an East Coast magazine, which claimed the discovery
of a "secret" group of paintings by the married, cracker-barrel
Pennsylvanian, age 69, showing his voluptuous younger neighbor in the
buff.</TE>
<TE>   Long after that smarmy media blitz, with its scandalized overtones
of illicit May-December sex, it turned out that several supposedly
clandestine Helga paintings had in fact been publicly displayed in
previous Wyeth exhibitions. By the time these cheese-ball pictures
arrived for a 1988 show at (where else?) LACMA, Edmier had quit art
school to work in a Hollywood special-effects studio.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, neither "Jeff {heart} Ilona" nor "Andrew {heart} Helga"
is the back-story on which you're supposed to cogitate at the art
museum today. Instead, it's assumed that "Keith {heart} Farrah" will
take you back to those golden days of yesteryear -- the mid-1970s --
when an ordinary Midwestern adolescent caught his first glimpse of a
mass-culture icon: a "Charlie's Angels" babe on a hugely popular
cheesecake poster.</TE>
<TE>   A period, not coincidentally, that also corresponds with the
emergence of Conceptualism as the standard for avant-garde art.</TE>
<TE>   Edmier has been making pedestrian statues related to his youthful
fancies for the last few years -- a high-school sweetheart, daredevil
teen-hero Evel Kneivel, his two grandfathers in the military uniforms
they wore during World War II. Personal memories in public forms are
memorialized in anachronistic styles.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of the LACMA exhibition, organized by curator Lynn
Zelevansky, is a pair of life-size sculptures that do the same.
Edmier designed the Farrah likeness in marble, with 19th century
sculptures by Auguste Rodin in mind. (An anomalous diamond stud in
her earlobe adds sparkle). Fawcett posed Edmier in a limp version of
Michelangelo's Adam from the Sistine ceiling. Craftsmen in Italy
carved his; hers was cast at a foundry in New York. Both are multiple
editions.</TE>
<TE>   One eminent strain of Conceptualism suppresses art's visual
qualities, to refocus a viewer's attention away from sensual
perception and toward the realm of ideas. The sculptures by Edmier
and Fawcett, devoid of any appeal as physical objects, follow this
lineage.</TE>
<TE>   If they're not much to look at, they offer even less to think
about. Pedants will note that the compositions conceal Fawcett's
"naughty bits," while Edmier's are put on display. The convention of
a May-December (or, perhaps, June-September) romance is likewise
reversed, since the woman here is the man's senior by 20 years. And
Fawcett is portrayed in her tousle-haired "Angel" period, while
Edmier looks as he does today, making the gulf between present
reality and past fantasy just a, like, awesome chasm, y'know, dude?</TE>
<TE>   What passes for an idea will be found in the first gallery, where
a small display of work by other artists means to provide historical
context for the collaboration. It includes a 1967 bronze cast of an
1880s Rodin, which shows a nude on a rock (the model for the
mythological figure was Rodin's talented and beautiful mistress,
sculptor Camille Claudel).</TE>
<TE>   There are nude photographs of Georgia O'Keeffe and Lee Miller by
Alfred Stieglitz and Man Ray, respectively, as well as a Miller
photograph. Finally, a 1984 Conceptual work by the late, obscure
Mexican expatriate Ulises Carrion recounts a film festival featuring
B-movie actress Lilia Prado, which he toured to four cities in the
Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   An evolving relationship between the artist (presumed to be male)
and his muse (presumed to be female) is the concept, starting with
Rodin's sculptural Impressionism and ending with Carrion's camp
Conceptualism.</TE>
<TE>   Edmier and Fawcett are positioned as postmodern heirs to this
problematic tradition. Further, they are claimed to represent a
noteworthy advance: At last, the once-silent muse has assumed her own
voice as an artist and equal.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that neither one has anything compelling to say is
apparently immaterial. At LACMA, an artist's muse is
indistinguishable from a teenager's wet dream. And that's an idea I'd
rather not contemplate.</TE>

<LD>"My children are not photographed and celebrated as my appendages ...
as much as they'd love to be!"</LD>
<LD>   So says Meryl Streep in the new Interview, a magazine overseen by
the genius Ingrid Sischy. Streep says her four kids "would enjoy
being photographed and on the cover of something. But I think it's
terrible to do that. They're not publicized by me, so they retain a
certain integrity as citizens of this country that I don't enjoy. I
can't sue anybody for what they say about me. But my children can.
And that's the way it should be. They should have their own lives!"
...</LD>
<LD>   I love the British press. They report that Sandra Bullock and Hugh
Grant, who have the romantic comedy "Two Weeks Notice" coming any
minute, have "driven the American media into a frenzy of excitement
about what is really going on in their relationship."</LD>
<TE>   Funny -- I haven't noticed any frenzy, have you? Bullock treats
Grant as if he were a naughty child she has to keep under control.
Both of them have constantly denied that they are anything but
colleagues. I think we can take them at their word.</TE>

<HD>This Michael Jackson is the one twisting in the wind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AL MARTINEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Jackson is in the news. Both of them. The one with a pointed
nose who dangles babies from windows, and the other who brings a
clear, articulate voice of reason to L.A. Guess which one gathers
screaming teenies and which one attracts adults concerned with their
world?</LD>
<LD>   If you said the Jackson who dangled the baby is the king of weird,
I mean pop, you're right. The other Jackson offers intelligence to a
fad-weary, hip-soaked city, which is too bad for him, because he's
being canned. KLAC-AM (570), where he's been a talk-show host for 14
months, is changing to a music format, and this Jackson doesn't sing.</LD>
<LD>   Taking the two men in order of least importance, the one who has
been undergoing cosmetic surgery for years to look like his sister
has been in the news lately because he's being sued for $21.2 million
for allegedly ducking out on two concerts. Called to testify, the
Moonwalker floated into court wearing dark glasses, a face mask and,
after removing the mask, his vague and distant trademark smile.</LD>
<TE>   A few days later, we saw him on television dangling his baby son
from a fourth-floor window in Berlin, where he had gone to receive an
award. Why did he dangle the baby? Why did he have his nose shaved to
a point? One can only guess. Maybe the effects of too many years
walking in reverse.</TE>
<TE>   Now, for the other Jackson. The real Jackson. The one who dangles
truths, not babies, and challenges us to think and wonder and debate.
Everyone I know listens to him, but our numbers apparently don't
count. He's out again. And it's not the first time.</TE>
<TE>   After three decades at KABC, Jackson spent several years bouncing
around L.A. radio stations noted for changing formats as quickly as a
diva changes lovers. He was off the air for six months in '98 until
KRLA hired him. In the two years he was there, IQs began to crawl
slowly upward within range of his voice. Then the station tossed him
aside until KLAC, abandoning a "pop-nostalgia format," brought him
back. Now it's dumping him to return to what is essentially the
nostalgia format it had in the first place. Go figure.</TE>
<TE>   We live in an age that celebrates fools and discards thinkers.
Rush Limbaugh makes millions because he represents a single, clouded
point of view. He doubts not for a moment that his opinion is the
right one, allowing no challenges to divert him from his
single-mindedness. Jackson, although essentially liberal, allows for
hesitations in thought, for reasonable debate, for questions without
answers. He treats adversaries with respect, regardless of their
political cant. "The world is made up of more than liberals or
conservatives," he says. "So much more."</TE>
<TE>   His programs over the years have been varied and expansive. His
guests have included everyone from Prince Philip to Joe DiMaggio,
from Mickey Cohen to Henry Kissinger, and every president since
Richard Nixon. No issue, large or small, has escaped Jackson's focus.
He devours books, newspapers and magazines like a kid eating candy,
never interviewing without background. War, disease, terrorism,
comedy, politics, religion, sex, traffic, crime, the weather, the
world. Jackson has deconstructed the issues of our time with the
precision of a surgeon and has been acknowledged for it over and over
again. Emmys, Golden Mike awards and honors from here and abroad fill
his walls and shelves.</TE>
<TE>   If a reason he's being silenced is due to the transitory
popularity of lock-minded conservatives, the stations are forgetting
their market. This is California, a state led by liberals, and this
is L.A., a city that doesn't concern the syndicated right-wingers.
Jackson cares deeply, and he shows it every day he's on the air.</TE>
<TE>   Bruised but unbowed, he remains amazingly unbitter after being
pushed aside again in favor of the format of the moment, although he
has no idea where he'll go next. "I've had such a lovely time in this
business," he says, then adds with a sense of optimism that has
always landed him on his feet, "And the best years are ahead."</TE>
<TE>   So we have two Jacksons in the news, one the voice of moderation,
the other the king of strange. I suspect that the Moonwalker will
ultimately vanish into a Robert Ripley collection of oddities. The
real Michael Jackson, the radio guy who searches for answers, will,
I'm afraid, face hard times. This isn't an age of reason. It's an age
of noise and threats and posturing, of violent computer games and
flatulence jokes and babies being dangled from windows. One can only
hope that though he may be swimming against the current, Jackson will
find a new home, and that the voice of civility will return once more
to teach and to enlighten.</TE>

<DH>An unusual L.A.-based philanthropy group for the arts is
aiding endangered historic properties around the globe.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATOTONILCO, Mexico</DL>
<LD>It's a sunny Saturday afternoon in San Miguel de Allende as a group
of Los Angeles philanthropists boards a chartered bus with a flashy
paint job. As the bus heads north on the Dolores Hidalgo Highway and
turns west onto a dirt road leading to the tiny village of
Atotonilco, the passengers chat about their children, the stock
market, last night's margaritas and the best places to buy Mexican
jewelry. But when they disembark, stroll down a path lined with
stalls of Catholic goods and approach the village's claim to fame, an
18th century church in a walled complex, they snap to attention.</LD>
<LD>   The time has finally come for the group -- which banded together
five years ago and calls itself the Friends of Heritage Preservation
-- to see the results of its biggest project to date: the restoration
of the Calvary Chapel of the Sanctuary of Jesus of Nazareth. An
astonishing shrine, it's austere on the outside but so elaborately
decorated inside that it's popularly known as the Sistine Chapel of
Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   It's also an extraordinary labor of love. Founded in 1740 and
built over 36 years by Father Luis Felipe Neri de Alfaro -- who hired
an otherwise unknown artist, Miguel Antonio Martinez de Pocasangre,
to carry out his imaginative plan for filling the walls and ceilings
with religious imagery and text -- the improbable monument might also
be likened to Los Angeles' Watts Towers, constructed over 34 years by
Italian immigrant Simon Rodia.</TE>
<TE>   The Atotonilco sanctuary originated as a spiritual retreat near
thermal hot springs, and it has become a major destination for
Mexican pilgrims and penitents. But by 1996 it had fallen into such
disrepair that the World Monuments Fund, a New York-based
conservation organization, put the church on its worldwide "Watch
List of 100 Most Endangered Sites."</TE>
<TE>   American Express Co., founding sponsor of the World Monuments
Watch program, donated $20,000 to kick-start the conservation at
Atotonilco. Several nonprofit organizations contributed to the
restoration of the nave and its side chapels. But the Calvary Chapel,
a wing of the church that was once its crowning glory, seemed
hopeless.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a wreck, no one would touch it," says Suzanne Booth,
a former paintings conservator at the Getty Conservation Institute
who founded the Friends of Heritage Preservation. But it was perfect
for the Friends, who gave $300,000 to restore the chapel. Although
their contribution amounts to less than half the $800,000 spent on
the project, the Friends managed the conservation and brought in
matching funds from the Mexican government.</TE>
<TE>   "This group does things differently," says computer tycoon Peter
Norton, a high-profile arts patron who joined the 20-member group
precisely because it operates informally and takes on projects that
tend to, in his words, fall between the cracks.</TE>
<TE>   A banner on the front of the church welcomes the Los Angeles
benefactors while representatives of Atotonilco, the Mexican state of
Guanajuato and the federal government form a reception line near the
entrance. When the Friends go inside, a youthful choir sings and
Father Fernando Manriquez performs a short service.</TE>
<TE>   "Art is like music," he says. "It's a universal language that
heightens the spirit. May God repay you for your generosity."</TE>
<TE>   Then comes the moment of truth. As the visitors enter the Calvary
Chapel, they break into smiles and whip out cameras.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I came here, I had tears in my eyes because I
couldn't believe we were going to spend all that money on a place
that was such a mess," says Booth's husband, David. "Now I have tears
in my eyes because it's so beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Dedicated to Holy Week, when pilgrims flock to Atotonilco, the
chapel is about 75 feet long and 45 feet wide -- nearly as large as
the main body of the church. The floor plan is shaped like a Roman
cross, and the vaulted ceiling is punctuated by small, cross-shaped
windows. Three altars, positioned where the cross-piece of the floor
plan intersects with the main shaft, are topped by simulated rock
that represents the hill of Calvary. Above the rock, in large,
scalloped niches, groups of life-size painted sculptures depict
scenes of the Crucifixion.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors who approach the altars pass a series of religious
paintings on canvas. But most of the walls and soaring, arched
ceiling are covered with hand-painted biblical text and a profusion
of fanciful imagery inspired by an odd mix of Austrian etchings and
indigenous folklore. The life, passion, death and resurrection of
Jesus are enacted by a cast of characters including cherubs, angels,
Roman soldiers, devils and grotesque demons.</TE>
<TE>   When the Friends first saw the chapel, about three years ago, the
paintings were obscured by grime. Water had seeped through the roof
and foundation and around the windows, causing further damage. The
sculptures were broken and their once-bright surfaces were pitifully
dull. Even more discouraging, Suzanne Booth says, was a section
around one of the sculptural scenes that had been slathered in muddy
brown paint.</TE>
<TE>   The first step to fixing the mess was "about $100,000 of work that
you don't see -- digging drainage ditches around the chapel, sealing
the windows and repairing the roof," says Miguel Angel Corzo, a
consultant to the Friends who directed the Getty Conservation
Institute from 1990 to 1998. He is currently president of the
University of Arts in Philadelphia and heads the nonprofit Global
Alliance for Conservation, USA.</TE>
<TE>   Corzo enlisted Augustin Espinosa, whom he calls "the best
conservator in Latin America," to restore the chapel. With a team of
20 Mexican assistants, Espinosa removed paint that wasn't part of the
original artwork and cleaned the walls and ceilings, a painstaking
process executed with cotton swabs.</TE>
<TE>   "We were surprised to find that the original work was in rather
good shape," Espinosa tells the Friends. The goal was to "respect the
authenticity of the work," he says, while bringing the paintings back
to a condition that allows worshippers to understand the message. The
conservators touched up places where they could determine what had
been lost and toned some sections to maintain a balance of color
throughout the ensemble, but added nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   The best thing about the project is that the chapel can finally be
used for its intended purpose after many decades of neglect and
several years of restoration, Suzanne Booth says. It's also a notable
accomplishment for an unusual philanthropic group that is still
forging its direction.</TE>
<TE>   Booth, who met Corzo while they were both employed by the Getty,
no longer works as an art conservator, but it's still her passion.
About six years ago, she and her husband, a founder of Dimensional
Fund Advisors, a mutual-funds management firm, consulted with Corzo
to discuss possible ways of being of assistance to the field. Instead
of sending money to a large organization with a broad agenda, such as
the World Monuments Fund, or joining a support group that is allied
to a particular country, region or site, they decided to form an
independent, flexible organization that would fund projects that
others might not tackle.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to make a difference," Suzanne Booth says.</TE>
<TE>   Corzo, whose work at the Getty Conservation Institute always
involved collaborations with groups in the countries where the
projects were located, suggested that the Booths leverage their funds
by forming partnerships. They set up the Friends as a "charitable
giving group," Suzanne Booth says. Although it does not have
tax-exempt status -- deliberately, to avoid getting mired in
bureaucracy -- it works with nonprofit organizations and thus
qualifies for tax breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Members pay $25,000 in dues every two years. The money is kept in
a holding account managed by the Jewish Community Foundation, which
sends checks to designated recipients.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Friends have joined forces with the Getty Conservation
Institute and the J. Paul Getty Museum on several projects. The group
gave $120,000 to the conservation of "America Tropical," a mural by
David Alfaro Siqueiros on Olvera Street. (The Getty has provided
major support for the $4.5-million project, expected to go on view in
2004.) The Friends also paid transportation and insurance costs to
bring European Old Master paintings from impoverished German museums
and New York's Hispanic Society to L.A., for treatment at the Getty.</TE>
<TE>   One ongoing project involves four medieval panel paintings given
to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art by William Randolph Hearst.
Although LACMA has a conservation laboratory, it doesn't have the
means to correct serious splits and expansion in the artworks' wood
structure.</TE>
<TE>   The Friends sent the panels to a wood specialist at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Upon their return, they will
be cleaned by LACMA conservator Joseph Fronek.</TE>
<TE>   What's next? That's up to the group, Booth says.</TE>
<TE>   "We like projects that have a beginning, a middle and end," she
says, noting that the most satisfying projects are relatively
contained and yield concrete results. But that leaves lots of
possibilities, including a large mosaic at the Russian Academy of
Sciences in St. Petersburg and a host of sites in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "Excitement is the key thing," Norton says, as members of the
group discuss potential projects on the plane back to Los Angeles.
Doing good work is the point, he says, "but you'll lose the group
without excitement."</TE>

<HD>New Bond film's debut is to die for</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The granddaddy of movie franchises proved it still has muscle, as the
latest James Bond thriller, "Die Another Day," landed at No. 1 with
an estimated $47.2 million, 007's biggest opening.</LD>
<LD>   The film, which stars Pierce Brosnan, skewed high among men and
women under 25, a demographic MGM executives knew they had to attract
to sustain the franchise. Nearly 55% of the audience consisted of
males younger than 25, while 53% were females in the same age group.</LD>
<LD>   The movie probably benefited from the casting of Oscar winner
Halle Berry, who as the CIA seductress Jinx introduces a new breed of
Bond girl.</LD>
<TE>   The studio's aggressive promotion of a scene with Berry emerging
from the ocean in an orange bikini -- an updated version of Ursula
Andress' entrance in "Dr. No" -- no doubt helped tantalize the male
audience, as did the Madonna-sung theme song, which is played in
regular rotation on MTV.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, many observers speculated Vin Diesel's "XXX" would
eclipse Bond. But "Die Another Day" opened with nearly the same
amount as the Diesel vehicle. The new Bond film is also reportedly
breaking records in the United Kingdom, Spain and France. In
comparison, "The World Is Not Enough" premiered three years ago at
$35.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge with any franchise is to make sure you offer
something fresh and new and that you reach out to a new audience,"
said MGM marketing executive Peter Adee.</TE>
<TE>   Among returnees, Warner Bros.' "Harry Potter and the Chamber of
Secrets" slipped to second place with an estimated $42.4 million, a
51% drop from its $87-million opener. New Line Cinema's "Friday After
Next" debuted in third at $13 million. And Disney's "The Santa Clause
2" came in fourth with $10.3 million for a four-week total of $95
million.</TE>
<TE>   Dropping 54% from last week was "8 Mile," earning an unofficial
$8.7 million to round out the top five. Despite a strong opening, the
Eminem movie has fallen precipitously on consecutive weekends. Its
total is about $97.7 million. Universal's "The Emperor's Club," which
was released on 807 screens, debuted at a respectable $4.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   New and continuing prestige films also performed well this
weekend, notably Pedro Almodovar's "Talk to Her," which played in two
theaters in New York and grossed an estimated $105,000. It opens Dec.
13 in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Phillip Noyce's "The Quiet American," from Miramax/Intermedia,
opened in six theaters and took in an estimated $111,000, averaging
$18,500 per screen. Miramax's "Ararat," which took in $112,000, and
"Frida," which earned an estimated $2.4 million, continue to do well.
"Frida" was No. 10 in its fifth weekend and has earned $12.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Goldwyn's "El Crimen Del Padre Amaro" (The Crime of Padre
Amaro) in its second weekend averaged a healthy $8,457 in 86 venues
with $727,302 and $1.5 million total.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Haynes' "Far From Heaven," took in $1.7 million, making the
total for the Focus Features release a respectable $3.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   MGM's "Bowling for Columbine" grossed $1.5 million, bringing the
documentary's total to $10.5 million. Artisan's "Standing in the
Shadows of Motown" took in $316,000.</TE>

<CX>   Movie audience demogra- phics -- A movie box office story in the Nov.
25 Calendar presented inaccurate figures about demographics of the
opening-weekend audience for the new James Bond movie, "Die Another
Day." Exit surveys showed that 69% of the audience was over 25, 31%
under 25, and that 53% was male, 47% female. The story mistakenly
said that nearly 55% of the audience consisted of males younger than
25, while 53% were females in the same age group.</CX>

<HD>No Doubt and Garbage keep things fresh</HD>
<DH>The bands play familiar favorites but display versatility,
staying power and considerable charm in their shows in the Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What did No Doubt do after selling out three arena shows and adding a
fourth near its hometown of Anaheim? Why, the multi-platinum
ska-punk-new-wave quartet went to Disneyland, where it was awarded
the key to the city on Friday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Later that night, singer Gwen Stefani and the band wowed fans at
the Long Beach Arena, where they were also scheduled to play on
Saturday as well as this Friday, before ending their tour on Saturday
at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   Headlining a bill that included techno-rockers Garbage and punk
revivalists the Distillers, No Doubt made a playfully over-the-top
entrance not unlike one of the hyper-pop entertainments at the Magic
Kingdom, which the group famously mocked in songs on its 1995 album
"Tragic Kingdom." Rising through the end of the runway extending from
their two-level stage, Stefani, guitarist Tom Dumont, bassist Tony
Kanal and drummer Adrian Young immediately cranked the energy to 11
with the emphatic "Hella Good."</LD>
<TE>   The band opened its March performance at the Universal
Amphitheatre with the same tune, from its current "Rock Steady"
album, and much of the 90-minute set recalled that show.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Garbage's 45-minute turn was a familiar grab bag from
its three albums, although the players subtly changed some
arrangements to keep listeners (and, doubtless, themselves)
interested. Despite the lack of surprises, both appearances were
powerful reminders of each band's versatility, staying power and
considerable charm.</TE>
<TE>   Frisky and revved-up, Garbage singer Shirley Manson played the
punk-rock girlie-girl in her black capri tights with pink pleated
skirt and pink high-tops, her short red hair spiked in rumpled Sid
Vicious style. She sang tunes from last year's "Beautiful Garbage"
and other works with the effortless command of one used to leading
the sonic juggernaut driven by drummer Butch Vig and
guitarists-keyboardists Duke Erikson and Steve Marker.</TE>
<TE>   The beats and self-recriminations of "Stupid Girl" ricocheted like
bullets in the cavernous space, but Manson was also rivetingly
intimate during the forlorn, torchy "Milk."</TE>
<TE>   No Doubt worked even harder to get every snap, crackle and pop out
of selections from "Rock Steady," "Kingdom" and 2000's "Return of
Saturn."</TE>
<TE>   Although the players ran breathlessly through the hits "Just a
Girl," "Sunday Morning," "Don't Speak," "Ex-Girlfriend," "Underneath
It All" and many others, their fast pace never felt rushed. Indeed,
bouncing and twirling like brightly attired dervishes, they seemed as
excited to perform those oft-played songs as the crowd was to hear
them.</TE>
<TE>   Abetted by two backup singers who manned keyboards and horns as
needed, No Doubt also successfully dialed down the mood with a
mini-acoustic set. Stefani struck a particularly vulnerable note with
a subdued "Magic's in the Makeup," which went beyond the concerns of
a superstar reconciling her public and private faces to touch a more
general questioning of identity.</TE>
<TE>   Moments such as that and the wistful "Simple Kind of Life"
emphasized the girl-next-door quality that makes Stefani appealing to
so many young women.</TE>
<TE>   Although tough in her yards of studded denim, and icily glamorous
with her theatrical makeup and high blond ponytail, underneath it all
her lyrics expressed the heartfelt dreams and romantic desires that
can be just as hard to realize as any rock-star aspirations.</TE>

<HD>Freshness should make Tupac's 'Dayz' a bright one</HD>

<LD>Tupac Shakur remains bigger in death than he was in life. Tuesday's
release of the two-CD album "Better Dayz" marks the eighth release of
the rapper's music since he was slain in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   Those albums have sold more than 13 million copies in the U.S.,
according to Nielsen SoundScan, accounting for more than half of his
total sales of 22.6 million to date.</LD>
<LD>   The new album from 2Pac (the name under which he recorded)
includes more than two dozen tracks, many with guest collaborators
including Tyrese, Outlawz, Trick Daddy, Nas and Mya and fresh
production elements added by various producers.</LD>
<TE>   The resulting songs "sound like they were recorded yesterday,"
says Violet Brown, urban music buyer for Wherehouse Entertainment,
who has heard about a half-dozen of the songs. "These tracks are not
dated at all, and what he's rapping about is very current. The lyrics
are very intense -- he's rapping a lot about life and death."</TE>
<TE>   The response at radio to the first single, "Thugz Mansion,"
demonstrates his connection to today's rap fans. It tops Radio &amp;
Records magazine's list of records with the most increased airplay in
a single week and is No. 2 in the rankings of songs added by the most
stations in the previous week.</TE>
<TE>   "Better Dayz" arrives in a heavy week that also sees news albums
in stores from Jennifer Lopez, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes and Tim
McGraw. Still, Brown expects Shakur's album to debut in the Top 10,
possibly at No. 1, his stiffest competition coming from Lopez. His
last posthumous album, "Until the End of Time," entered the national
sales chart at No. 1 in March of last year and has since sold 1.9
million copies.</TE>
<TE>   Recent media attention on Shakur's shooting death in Las Vegas,
including stories in The Times and the documentary film "Biggie &amp;
Tupac," has probably intensified interest.</TE>
<TE>   Shakur reportedly left more than 200 recordings when he died.
Slightly more than half that number have since been released,
including the material on "Better Dayz." How much more can we expect?</TE>
<TE>   "When we put out the last one," says Interscope Records spokesman
Dennis Dennehy, "I heard there'd be one more from his Makaveli
period, which is this one, then one more single album, then that's
pretty much it."</TE>
<TE>   An excess of posthumous releases from an artist usually trigger
skepticism from fans, but, Brown notes, "As long as it's quality
stuff, nobody cares what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   The new collection, she says, "is very deep -- as deep as the rest
of his stuff.... If it ever gets to the point where it's just a
rehash of the same stuff, it'll be a problem."</TE>

<HD>Standing out in the Spectrum</HD>
<DH>Local troupes strive to make a statement with distinctive
styles, artful execution and focused creativity during the showcase
of short pieces.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a special art to getting noticed and remembered on a program
of short pieces by many choreographers -- a program such as the
16-part Spectrum: Dance in L.A. bill at the Ivar Theatre on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Clarity of purpose is a must, so pieces that switch styles (Stefan
Wenta's folk ballet "The Faraway Sea") or focus (Rei Aoo's dance
drama "Dilemma") risk seeming confused.</LD>
<LD>   Similarly, excerpts from pieces that nobody knows (Brenda Bike's
quartet "Exercise of Power" or Rande Dorn's equally satiric duet
"Being WE Knee Deep in Sweetwaters") can look fragmentary: puzzles
with no solutions.</LD>
<TE>   The trick to being memorable in such circumstances may lie in
projecting a single high-profile concept: the alternation between
formal ballet moves and sprawling, anti-ballet anarchy in Scott
Heinzerling's solo "as if" (danced by Tekla Kostek).</TE>
<TE>   Or the juxtaposition of antique Bharata Natyam from India with
contemporary hip-hop and jazz dancing in Janet Roston's "Tanjore
Project."</TE>
<TE>   A powerful rhythmic pulse can also keep a dance on the list of
highlights -- whether the approach is formal and elegant, as in Ken
Morris' jazz quartet "Jungle Moon," or go-for-broke celebratory as in
Erin Landry's messy, large-scale "Africano."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, sophisticated spatial design (Hillary Thomas' quartet
"Back to the Earth") and a distinctive movement vocabulary (Anna
Djanbazian's liquid duet "Selfless Love") always help a piece linger
in memory.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if choreographers can combine several virtues and add
faultless execution, they're heads above nearly everyone, which is
where Denise Leitner's artfully designed, sharply rhythmic women's
ensemble "Pathways #4" belonged on Saturday, along with Corey D.
Burrell's more conventional but equally exciting women's mood piece
"Love Ridden."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it doesn't hurt if you've got drama in your blood,
structural savvy galore and one of the finest dancers in the city, as
in Joe Goode's postmodern character study "Native Son." Patrick Damon
Rago danced this solo with his usual brilliance and an extra edge of
ferocity.</TE>
<TE>   New works by Jesse Abrescy, ("Music Sustains Me"), Bob Boross ("If
There's a Hell Below, We're All Gonna Go") and Ruby Karen ("Passing
Thru") completed the program.</TE>
<TE>   Next performance in the Spectrum series: Feb. 1-2.</TE>

<LD>Maria and Alfonso were spending the weekend at camp where Uncle Ruben
worked as the nature guide. It was a cool fall evening, close to
suppertime.</LD>
<LD>   "Let's go for a walk before supper," said Uncle Ruben. "The woods
are beautiful at this time of the year."</LD>
<LD>   Uncle Ruben showed them the thick layer of leaves and bark and
twigs on the forest floor.</LD>
<TE>   "This is how the forest makes new soil," he said. "Leaves and
twigs drop and are never raked away. They just stay there until the
FBI makes them fertilizer for the trees."</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI?" asked Maria with surprise, looking all around.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben laughed. "The fungus, the bacteria, and the insects.
That's the FBI of the forest, and they turn all these twigs and
leaves into soil. See?"</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben pushed his hand deep into the mulch. "Feel how moist
it is just below the surface."</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso eagerly pushed his little hands into the soil.</TE>
<TE>   "Look here," Uncle Ruben said. "See the spider web?"</TE>
<TE>   "Where?" asked Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   "Sit down," said Uncle Ruben. "Look at the tunnel," said Uncle
Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   Maria and Alfonso peered.</TE>
<TE>   "You mean that black hole?" asked Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, now watch." Uncle Ruben took a slender flowering stalk of a
wild grass and gently touched it to the outer edge of the web.</TE>
<TE>   After about 15 seconds, a spider came out of the tunnel to
investigate. Alfonso leaned in real close as the spider ran back into
the tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, why do you think the spider makes the web?" Uncle Ruben
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how spiders eat," said Uncle Ruben. "They build the web to
catch flies and mosquitoes. Those other bugs are the spider's
dinner."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly they heard the supper bell ringing.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," said Uncle Ruben, "now it's time for our supper."</TE>

<HD>Look at you, girl</HD>
<DH>A photojournalist tries to capture what it means to be
feminine today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Renee Tawa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The showgirl's handwritten note -- on a scrap of paper, edges curled
and yellowed -- was taped to her lighted makeup mirror: "I APPROVE OF
MYSELF."</LD>
<LD>   Later, photojournalist Lauren Greenfield was flipping through the
pictures of the dancer that she'd shot in Las Vegas for a German
magazine. The photograph of the note also shows a dressing room
cluttered with hairbrushes and other primping tools, a scene that
triggered a subtle association for her, noted Greenfield, 36, a
Harvard graduate. The way Greenfield saw it, she and the showgirl had
spun out of the same milieu.</LD>
<LD>   Greenfield's new photography book, "Girl Culture" (Chronicle
Books), illustrates that world, or what she sees as a twist on the
concept of modern femininity, in which rituals of grooming and beauty
take on intense significance. The glossy, oversize book also includes
interviews with 20 of the girls and women pictured and an essay by
Greenfield, whose work has appeared in the New York Times Magazine,
Time and National Geographic.</LD>
<TE>   "With 'Girl Culture,' I really tried to look at the more universal
themes and look everywhere and show the teenager in Minnesota is
thinking about the same things as the teenager in Beverly Hills who
is thinking about the same things as the showgirl who's a grown woman
in Vegas," said Greenfield, who lives in Venice with her husband and
2-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   At the Stardust Hotel in 1995, Greenfield also noticed that the
showgirl had put up pictures of models she admires or looks to for
inspiration. "That was the beginning of the project, really.... That
idea of how girls construct their identities, and how they use pieces
of the outside world and pieces of a magazine, pieces of a model and
images of other people or other things, like a piece of clothing or
designer brand, to kind of help conceptualize who they are. That was
a really powerful idea for me."</TE>
<TE>   In the book, Sheena, 15, from Santa Fe, says she wants to be a
"topless dancer or a showgirl" when she grows up; Lily, 6, who shops
at a designer boutique in Los Angeles, says, "If I don't dress well,
I feel geeky"; and Alison, 17, says she cuts her calves with razor
blades for "this release of endorphins." Greenfield also caught girls
at a weight-loss camp in New York, pregnant girls and teenage mothers
in Inglewood and Stanford University's women's swim team.</TE>
<TE>   A personal project</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, in her photography studio, which is
connected by a walkway to her airy, loft-like house, Greenfield
rushed through one phone call after another in the hectic days before
her book's scheduled release in December. Her previous photography
book, "Fast Forward: Growing Up in the Shadow of Hollywood" (Knopf,
1997), documented the media-saturated world of young people in Los
Angeles. "Girl Culture" is "the most personal project I've done,"
said Greenfield, who grew up in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, she was a chronic dieter. As a preteen, she worried
that she didn't have the right designer jeans to wear to Hebrew
school. As a 6-year-old, one day, she sobbed at her reflection in the
mirror, convinced that she was ugly. "A lot of this was inspired by
my own experience growing up here," Greenfield said. "I feel that
things are the same, but they're worse. Like, when I was a teenager,
you had to be thin, and you had to look good in clothes, but now you
have to wear a miniskirt, and have a six-pack [stomach] or decorate
your belly, like having a navel piercing ... and wax and tan and dye
your hair."</TE>
<TE>   The collection is not meant to be an indictment or "at all
representative of girls," Greenfield said. Instead, she tried to
point to the thread that tied her to her subjects. "I could always
relate to the different girls," she said. "One thing about being a
photographer is that you get to see what it's like to be in the
popular group. You get to see what it's like to be unpopular. You get
to go over the edge into all these different worlds."</TE>

Photography have put together a traveling exhibition of photographs

<HD>'Last Supper' critiques Iran's societal structure</HD>
<DH>The film delivers a feminist protest via the tale of an
architecture professor's marriage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fereydoun Jeyrani's "The Last Supper" is the latest fiery feminist
protest film from Iran, and Jeyrani has shrewdly expressed his
sentiments in a brisk, appropriately tempestuous melodrama with an
effective flashback structure. In tone "Supper" goes right up to the
precipice of going over the top, but in his own way Jeyrani
demonstrates the firm control and discipline that Todd Haynes brought
to "Far From Heaven."</LD>
<LD>   Mihan Mashreghi (Katayun Riahi) is an eminent professor of
architecture who makes outspoken attacks on the wanton destruction of
Iran's vintage architecture by untrammeled development. One of her
impassioned lectures is interrupted by a man Mashreghi regards as a
chief villain, a major builder (Atila Pesiani), who also happens to
be her husband of 26 years. Witnessing her father's angry
interruption is their daughter Setareh (Haniye Tavassoli), also her
student, who becomes determined to persuade the couple to end their
unhappy marriage. Also in the class is Mani Motaref (Mohammad Reza
Golzar), a top student whom Setareh has set her heart on marrying.</LD>
<TE>   Divorce remains such a taboo in Iran that it takes considerable
effort, and the consequences escalate from the cruelly ironic to the
outright tragic, a progression Jeyrani handles with such aplomb that
it becomes a commentary in itself, suggesting that he could not have
gotten away with his movie in Iran had it not been ultimately
punitive at its climactic moment. Jeyrani inspires his cast, which
includes Sorayya Ghasemi as Mihan's devoted and lifelong servant.</TE>
<TE>   An endorsement of women's aspirations to living fulfilling
personal and professional lives of their own choosing, "The Last
Supper" is a polished film set in an environment so sleekly upscale
that it could almost pass as an affluent part of Southern California.
It is also yet another attack on the curse of the arranged marriage.
In a telling remark to her distraught father Setareh tries to explain
that neither he nor her mother are to blame for their miserable
marriage but that responsibility lies with her grandfathers, who
arranged it.</TE>

<HD>The Reagan legacy: Vivid portrait of the president</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long before he became the 40th president, Ronald Reagan was asked by
his son Michael for a bigger allowance. His reply: "When the
government lets me keep more of my paycheck."</LD>
<LD>   Michael Reagan recalls that lesson fondly in "Ronald Reagan: A
Legacy Remembered," a two-hour biography at 9 tonight on the History
Channel. Ronald Reagan changed the course of world history by
doggedly following his principles, and although this show is unlikely
to alter the opinions of his admirers or detractors, it paints a
vivid picture of the public and private man.</LD>
<LD>   Anchored by former CNN correspondent Frank Sesno, the program
features frank interviews with Reagan's wife, Nancy, and his three
children, as well as political associates and rivals such as Mikhail
Gorbachev.</LD>
<TE>   Reagan's stubbornness paid off politically, but there was always a
personal cost. His daughter, Patti Davis, recalls icy dinner
conversations when she was a kid, unable to stomach Reagan's "black
and white" view of the world. His son Ron remembers a relationship
that changed forever the day, at age 12, he refused to go to church.</TE>
<TE>   They also recall how Reagan electrified the crowd at a 1964 speech
for presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, launching his own
political climb after a Hollywood career. And how, while California
governor, he nonchalantly rescued a girl at a poolside party in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Although Reagan was a popular president, he left a mixed legacy
with his simple approach. His tax cut spawned a political
"revolution," and his military buildup and tough negotiating stance
helped push Gorbachev to tear down "the wall" of the Soviet empire --
but only after Reagan broke his campaign pledge to balance the
budget. His style of setting the vision and then delegating
responsibility has become a leadership model -- but detachment worked
to his detriment in the Iran-contra scandal, when his White House
traded arms for hostages.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his many battles, Reagan never seemed to lose his
charm. When he left the world stage in 1994 after being diagnosed
with Alzheimer's disease, he said goodbye to a colleague by joking,
"There's one good thing: Every day I meet new people."</TE>

<HD>Bells Take Aim at Rival</HD>
<DH>Telecom firms go after WorldCom's market but deny they are
behind an effort to keep it mired in Bankruptcy Court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jube Shiver Jr.</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc.'s archrivals have set their sights on the fallen
telecommunications giant, potentially undermining its financial
health as it struggles to emerge from the largest bankruptcy filing
of all time.</LD>
<LD>   This group of competitors -- which includes Pacific Bell parent
SBC Communications Inc. and the other Baby Bell local phone companies
-- is lobbying federal regulators for new rules that would require
the nation's No. 2 long-distance company to make hundreds of millions
of dollars in upfront payments before it can use the Bells' networks
to route phone traffic. Currently, WorldCom pays the Bells after it
collects from its long-distance customers.</LD>
<LD>   The Bells aren't WorldCom's only foes. The Clinton, Miss.-based
carrier also is fighting the largest labor union in the
telecommunications industry and even an influential church group that
has taken aim at the company.</LD>
<TE>   They all are seeking to slow the financial reorganization of the
former telecom titan in a bitter campaign that analysts say is being
orchestrated by the Bells, long-distance carriers AT&amp;T Corp. and
Sprint Corp., and others hoping to wrest business from WorldCom and
head off a bloody price war.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of battles on a variety of issues that ...
suggest there is an organized effort by rivals to keep WorldCom in
bankruptcy as long as possible and make it as painful as possible to
ensure they don't get out," said Blair Levin, a former chief of staff
at the Federal Communications Commission who is now a telecom analyst
for investment firm Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "AT&amp;T, Sprint and the Baby Bells," Levin added, "are clearly
better off the longer WorldCom stays" mired in Bankruptcy Court or
remains tied up with federal regulators, who are under political
pressure to protect consumers from possible service interruptions by
financially troubled carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The Bells deny that they are behind any organized effort to
undercut WorldCom. They say their only aim is to protect themselves
from the same financial ruin that has engulfed WorldCom and so much
of the rest of the industry.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom sought Chapter 11 protection in July, listing assets of
$104.billion and debts of $32 billion. The company has been charged
by the Securities and Exchange Commission with fraud for misstating
earnings by as much as $9 billion dating to 1999.</TE>
<TE>   About 35 major telecom providers have sought federal bankruptcy
protection in the last two years, including Winstar Communications
Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd., a venture headed by Los Angeles
financier Gary Winnick.</TE>
<TE>   Yet critics have singled out WorldCom as a special case because
its accounting irregularities were so massive and because the
company's aggressive pricing of services -- grounded in what turned
out to be fictitious profit -- forced other carriers to follow suit,
causing massive industry losses.</TE>
<TE>   One of the key factors fueling the intense lobbying, analysts say,
is the desire of SBC, Verizon Communications Inc. and BellSouth Corp.
to poach WorldCom's turf. They are angling to enter the
$100-billion-a-year market for supplying data and long-distance
services to large businesses.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom and AT&amp;T are the leading providers of such services. But
WorldCom is losing its grip on the business as it struggles to emerge
from bankruptcy protection. Sprint says it has gained about $250
million worth of business from big company customers at WorldCom's
expense. AT&amp;T says it has won some former WorldCom customers too.</TE>
<TE>   The three largest regional Bell phone companies have been largely
cut off from the market because of federal rules that restrict their
ability to offer long-distance service in their home markets, and
they are pushing to get those restrictions lifted.</TE>
<TE>   SBC, for instance, is making an aggressive bid for approval to
offer long-distance service in California. A fourth Baby Bell, Qwest
Communications International Inc., has been able to develop a
significant long-distance presence by building its own nationwide
fiber-optic network.</TE>
<TE>   However, WorldCom is beginning to turn the tables on the Bells in
their primary market: local phone service.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's MCI unit has more than 2 million subscribers for "The
Neighborhood," a plan that offers combined local and long-distance
telephone services, voicemail, caller ID and other services in 36
states for a monthly fee between $50 and $60.</TE>
<TE>   The jockeying for market share has some analysts speculating that
a local Baby Bell will try to gain a national footprint to lure big
corporate customers by either acquiring MCI or eliminating the
company as a competitor. That's why they believe the Bells are
undertaking their own lobbying and encouraging outside groups to
pressure WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-WorldCom efforts began in August, when the Bells filed a
petition with the FCC seeking authority to demand hundreds of
millions of dollars in upfront payments from WorldCom and other
financially troubled carriers that use the Bells' networks. The Bells
said the payments would help protect them from deadbeats such as
WorldCom, which owes SBC alone more than $325 million.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom has called the prepayment proposal "unnecessary,
subjective and potentially discriminatory." If it were to be
implemented, experts estimate that WorldCom might initially have to
come up with close to $1 billion to pay the upfront fees or deposits
-- an amount that WorldCom officials say would strangle the company.</TE>
<TE>   Telecom experts say the FCC isn't likely to do that, however.
Instead, they expect the agency to strike a middle ground that will
allow the Bells to collect some additional money but probably much
less than they are seeking. A decision by the FCC is at least a month
away.</TE>
<TE>   The lobbying campaign spread last month when the United Church of
Christ, a Cleveland-based ministry with 6,000 churches, filed a
petition with the FCC seeking to bar WorldCom from transferring its
valuable communications licenses to other entities. The company needs
that flexibility in order to reorganize its communications assets,
such as microwave transmission towers, and to get out of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a corporate culture of greed, fraud and criminal
behavior at WorldCom that makes the company no longer eligible to
hold the public trust," said the Rev. Robert Chase, executive
director for the Office of Communication of the United Church of
Christ Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not out to punish the rank-and-file or investors. But to
allow those at WorldCom who created the crisis to emerge from
bankruptcy endangers the telecommunications industry and its
infrastructure," Chase said.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom already has beaten back one challenge from the formidable
Communications Workers of America, the labor union that represents
700,000 industry employees.</TE>
<TE>   The CWA asked federal procurement offices in late October to cut
off WorldCom's $1.7 billion in government contracts for telecom
services. But this month the General Services Administration extended
WorldCom's federal contracts through January 2004. The procurement
agency said WorldCom's performance "has been consistent with the
terms" of its accords with the government.</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of others -- including a number of high-ranking phone
executives -- take a dimmer view of the company, and they have
stepped up their criticism of WorldCom's efforts to emerge from
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "The impact of the malfeasance at WorldCom, Global Crossing and
Qwest and the damage it has caused cannot be overestimated," Sprint
Chairman William T. Esrey said in a speech this month at a UBS
Warburg investors conference. "From a public policy perspective, it
is troubling that a company possibly could commit fraud, go into
bankruptcy and then emerge with a competitive advantage against
companies that behaved ethically."</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Vice Chairman Lawrence T. Babbio Jr. expressed a similar
sentiment last week when he called WorldCom "outright dishonest."</TE>
<TE>   "They committed fraud and they should not be in business; we'd all
be better off," Babbio said at a forum sponsored by Chief Executive
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The Bells deny, however, that they are driving any broad campaign
to sink WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not aware of anything we have done to support" the efforts of
church groups or labor unions against WorldCom, said BellSouth
spokesman Bill McCloskey. Spokesmen for Verizon, SBC, Sprint and AT&amp;T
also denied any involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, WorldCom critics have plenty of their own motivations
to oppose the carrier even without the Bells' backing.</TE>
<TE>   The CWA has long been upset with WorldCom because it has had no
success organizing workers at the carrier. The United Church of
Christ has had a long history of battling powerful communications
companies in the name of the public interest.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many analysts say the timing and intensity of the
anti-WorldCom movement suggests it is being coordinated by the Bells.</TE>
<TE>   "The spin behind this is largely driven by the Baby Bells and
slightly by AT&amp;T," said Brian Moir, a Washington lawyer and lobbyist
who represents large business telephone customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Baby Bells are trying to force a situation where one of them
can buy WorldCom."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom draws an even more direct connection. The company claims
that Chase of the United Church of Christ has been influenced by his
association with Samuel A. Simon, founder of a Washington-based
consulting group called Issue Dynamics Inc., which has done work for
some of the regional Bell telephone companies as well as their
national trade association.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bell companies would like nothing better than for us to not
emerge from bankruptcy," said WorldCom spokesman Peter Lucht.</TE>
<TE>   Chase acknowledged that he knew Simon but said that their
relationship has had no bearing on the church's lobbying campaign
against WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, some experts think the lobbying efforts will
ultimately prove fruitless.</TE>
<TE>   "Most companies are not going to be successful going through
Chapter 11," said Royce Holland, chief executive of the struggling
regional carrier Allegiance Telecom Inc., which has seen many
comparable firms file for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   "Chapter 11 can fix your balance sheet, but not a business plan
that wasn't well thought out or a management team that couldn't
execute," Holland said.</TE>
<TE>   However, he added, "WorldCom may be an exception to that rule.
With a world-class network, and good management, it has the
resources" to get back on its feet.</TE>

<HD>Grocery Stores Checking Out Fingerprints</HD>
<DH>Small shops are using biometric technology that retrieves
customers' data to cut losses from fraud.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You might not peg La Playa Market, a cramped Inglewood bodega with a
single checkout lane, as an early adopter of technology.</LD>
<LD>   But the store was among the first in the nation to install a
groundbreaking and controversial personal-identification system that
uses unique physical characteristics such as an individual's
fingerprint to identify customers and crack down on check-cashing
fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Although large supermarket chains and major discount retailers
have been slow to introduce the system, mom-and-pop food markets and
small urban grocery chains are rushing to biometric technology.</LD>
<TE>   The reason? La Playa and other markets in low-income neighborhoods
have more at stake than the big supermarket chains. As much as 70% of
their food sales come from customers who don't have bank accounts and
rely on local markets to cash their checks.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the things here they could probably get at bigger
stores," said Ray Hernandez, a clerk at La Playa's meat counter where
several customers were lining up to cash checks recently. "They come
here for this service."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas Supermarkets, a nine-store chain based in Ontario, said
that since it installed a fingerprint-scanning system two weeks ago
more than 5,000 customers have signed up.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes it easier for them when they come in," said Cardenas
general manager Steve Vallance. "They don't have to carry ID."</TE>
<TE>   But it's really more of a benefit to the chain. The system,
Vallance said, has helped stem the company's losses from check fraud,
which in recent years had soared as high as $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We cash about $3.5 [million] to $4 million in checks a week,"
Vallance said.</TE>
<TE>   With the company planning to open more stores in the coming years,
the stakes were getting too high to become complacent, he said. "We
had to make sure those checks were clean."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas is using a fingerprint scanner made by Herndon, Va.-based
BioPay Inc., whose system is in about 30 locations across Southern
California and 300 outlets around the nation, many of them
check-cashing businesses. Two rival biometric technology firms also
are marketing similar supermarket systems.</TE>
<TE>   For the BioPay system, a customer must register by scanning his or
her driver's license or other identification card and a fingerprint.
Thereafter, when the customer comes in to cash a check, the data are
retrieved by a touch of an index finger to an electronic pad, or
"reader." A cashier then swipes the check to detect its magnetic ink,
takes a picture of the check, verifies the bank information and
matches it against a database of other checks cashed by that
customer.</TE>
<TE>   The system does not cross-reference the information with law
enforcement or government databases, BioPay President Tim Robinson
said. But when a bogus check is detected, the system flags it and
shares the information with other stores if necessary, so the
individual is prevented from passing counterfeit checks at other
locations.</TE>
<TE>   BioPay charges store locations about $75 a month for the system,
plus $10,000 for each fingerprint machine. Many stores charge a 1% to
2% fee to cover the cost of the service. Cardenas charges 5% of an
individual's check, but gives the customer a voucher for the amount
to be used in a Cardenas store as an incentive to start spending
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   But as handy as the technology may seem, larger grocers -- which
do less check cashing -- have been slow to embrace the system for
credit and debit cards. Many fear their customers will consider it an
intrusion.</TE>
<TE>   Kroger Co., the nation's largest supermarket operator, is testing
the electronic identification system in only a few Texas stores.
Thriftway market chain is running a pilot program in some of its
Seattle stores.</TE>
<TE>   Albertson's Inc. officials said they haven't been convinced. "As
it becomes more cost-effective and as customers tell us this is a
service they will use," the chain might consider it, spokeswoman
Stacia Levenfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy experts say customers probably don't have a lot to fear
from such shops as Cardenas and La Playa storing images of their
fingerprints, but the system is yet another way that consumers are
allowing merchants and institutions to acquire their personal
information.</TE>
<TE>   And although giving up such information might not be a concern
now, said Lee Tien, senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation in San Francisco, it could become one as the technology is
used by more businesses, which could begin sharing consumers'
personal data.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the makers of biometric technology, which also can scan
retinas and faces, are predicting that sales of their equipment will
grow to $2 billion in 2006 from $200 million this year. There are no
federal laws that deal with sales of fingerprint data and related
personal information.</TE>
<TE>   However, Robinson points out that many consumers routinely give
away more personal information than BioPay requires when dealing with
such businesses as car rental firms.</TE>
<TE>   "You have already given away all your privacy," he said, adding
that his company does not share data with marketers, and shares
information about bad-check writers only with other businesses.</TE>
<TE>   That shouldn't alleviate consumers' concerns, Tien says.</TE>
<TE>   "You point your finger at one company and say we're not as bad as
them. But everyone is pooling and sharing this kind of personal
information promiscuously," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, small grocers say, few of their customers inquire about what
is done with their personal information.</TE>
<TE>   "Should I be worried?" asked shopper Patricia Luna, as she joked
around with clerks at La Playa Market last week. "I don't think about
it. All I want is my money. I'll do whatever they ask."</TE>

<HD>Gasoline Prices Fall 5.56 Cents in 2 Weeks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The price of a gallon of gas fell more than a nickel nationwide over
the last two weeks as crude oil prices stayed low and supply outpaced
demand, an industry analyst said Sunday. It was the largest two-week
drop in about a year.</LD>
<LD>   The average price of gas nationwide, including all grades and
taxes, was about $1.44 a gallon on Friday, according to the Lundberg
survey of 8,000 stations nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   That was down 5.56 cents a gallon from Nov. 8, the date of the
last Lundberg survey, when the average cost of a gallon of gas stood
at $1.49, said Camarillo-based analyst Trilby Lundberg.</LD>
<TE>   "The two main reasons for the lower retail gasoline prices are
lower oil prices and flush gasoline supplies," Lundberg said. "Crude
oil prices of late were not falling. However, over recent weeks they
have fallen appreciably, and these price cuts have been working their
way down to the gasoline pump."</TE>
<TE>   Lundberg also cited the lower seasonal demand for gas that is
typical of the winter months. She said the upcoming Thanksgiving
holiday probably won't affect gas prices.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers are likely to see continued price reductions in the weeks
to come -- barring any unexpected events affecting crude oil prices,
Lundberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "Prices were extraordinarily steady from early April forward,
showing almost no change. Moderate rises between late September and
October have now been more than offset by this drop of more than 5
cents," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, gas costs more than it did a year ago, when motorists were
still feeling the effect of a post-Sept. 11 price slump. On Nov. 16,
2001, the weighted average price of a gallon of gas was $1.23.</TE>
<TE>   The national weighted average price of gasoline, including taxes,
at self-serve pumps Friday was about $1.41 a gallon for regular,
$1.50 for mid-grade and $1.59 for premium.</TE>

<HD>Federal Agency Seeks Control of Pension Plan</HD>
<DH>Frontier Corp.'s retirement fund is tied up in the
bankruptcy proceedings of Global Crossing, company's former owner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leigh Strope</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government's pension insurance program is asking a federal court
to give it control of the underfunded retirement plan of a company
formerly owned by Global Crossing Ltd.</LD>
<LD>   Pensions of 5,500 workers and retirees of Frontier Corp. are short
by $105 million, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. estimates. The
telecommunications company, based in Rochester, N.Y., was owned by
Global Crossing until it was sold last year.</LD>
<LD>   The PBGC is asking the U.S. District Court in New York to
terminate the pension plan as of Dec. 3 and to name it as the
trustee.</LD>
<TE>   Frontier was sold to Citizens Communications Co. in 2001, and the
sale agreement specified that Global Crossing transfer almost all of
the pension plan to the buyer. Global Crossing, the fiber-optics
company that has filed for bankruptcy protection, has not made the
transfer, according to the PBGC.</TE>
<TE>   In bankruptcy proceedings, Global Crossing, founded by Los Angeles
financier Gary Winnick, has proposed a reorganization that includes
transferring the retirement plan to a liquidating trust controlled by
its creditors. The reorganization plan could be approved at a Dec. 4
court hearing, and the PBGC wants to act before then.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot allow an abusive arrangement that shoves an underfunded
pension plan into a liquidating trust where all the gains belong to a
select group of creditors and all the losses are dumped on the PBGC,"
Executive Director Steven Kandarian said.</TE>
<TE>   The PBGC would prefer that the retirement plan be transferred to
Citizens Communications as originally planned.</TE>
<TE>   "But we have to act now to protect participants and to increase
the chances of recovering enough to minimize the hit to the pension
insurance program," Kandarian said.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing spokeswoman Rebecca Yeamans said: "All payments to
retirees are continuing uninterrupted during this process, and
participants' money is protected under federal law regardless of the
outcome of this objection."</TE>
<TE>   The government corporation was created in 1974 to insure payment
of basic pension benefits for workers in the private sector. It is
financed largely from insurance premiums paid by companies that
sponsor pension plans and by the PBGC's investment returns.
Participants in a plan taken over by the program receive, on average,
about 94% of benefits they had earned.</TE>
<TE>   Frontier workers and retirees do not need to take any action.</TE>

<HD>Librarians Emerging From Book Stacks, Increasing Activism</HD>
<DH>They've mobilized in Washington and are engaged in far more
controversial subjects than their usual issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former congresswoman and one-time presidential candidate Pat
Schroeder is hardly a Washington novice, but she took a political
drubbing recently from the unlikeliest of foes: a bunch of
librarians.</LD>
<LD>   Schroeder, who now heads the Assn. of American Publishers, had the
temerity to publicly criticize libraries for their stance on
copyright laws and for distributing free copies of electronic books
and articles that publishers are trying to sell. Schroeder's
spokeswoman made matters worse by complaining about the libraries'
"radical factions."</LD>
<LD>   Librarians pounced.</LD>
<TE>   They roasted Schroeder for "library-bashing." They confronted
Schroeder at public appearances, demanding an apology. They wrote to
lawmakers en masse to complain.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Schroeder raised a white flag and backed away from her
comments.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson? Don't mess with librarians these days.</TE>
<TE>   They were supposed to quietly fade away with the advent of the
Internet, but libraries -- and librarians -- are enjoying a higher
profile than ever before. They've mobilized in Washington, beefing up
their lobbying presence and inserting themselves into far more
controversial subjects than their usual bread-and-butter issues, such
as literacy.</TE>
<TE>   The 65,000-member American Library Assn., the chief trade group
for librarians, has:</TE>
<TE>   * Led opposition to tougher copyright laws, putting it at odds
with major entertainment and publishing conglomerates.</TE>
<TE>   * Lobbied against the Bush administration's anti-terrorism Patriot
Act because it gave law enforcement easier access to library records.</TE>
<TE>   * Successfully sued the government to block an anti-pornography
law that required libraries to install Internet filters on library
computers or risk losing federal funds.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't your grandmother's library," said Emily Sheketoff, head
of the American Library Assn.'s Washington office. "We're getting
into some odd things."</TE>
<TE>   But that higher profile may carry political costs. Librarians have
long enjoyed an all-American reputation, and that innocent image is
now taking a hit as opponents label them everything from
pornographers to pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Some thought it was no coincidence that a bill to double federal
funding for libraries stalled in Congress this year.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are going to provide these funds, how will they be used?"
asked Rep. Charles W. "Chip" Pickering Jr. (R-Miss.), one of the
chief sponsors of the Internet filtering bill that libraries blocked.
"Will they be used to promote a radical, extremist social agenda?
Libraries are like Mom and apple pie. Why would they want to squander
their goodwill and good reputations to get involved in issues like
child pornography?"</TE>
<TE>   Sheketoff and other librarians bristle at the notion that they
support pornography or don't care about children, but they say
criticism isn't surprising given the association's heightened
activism.</TE>
<TE>   "We successfully sued the government," said Sheketoff, former
deputy assistant secretary of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration during the Clinton administration. "That doesn't make
us very popular."</TE>
<TE>   Sheketoff, who cut her political teeth working for Senate
Republicans during the Watergate scandal, was hired by the American
Library Assn. in 1999. Some within the organization objected to the
appointment of Sheketoff, the first non-librarian to head its
lobbying office.</TE>
<TE>   But leaders decided they needed a political professional to get
them to the negotiating table on more issues and help overcome the
traditional stereotypes about librarians, which often resulted in
condescending, pat-on-the-head treatment on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "I still get people asking me where's my bun," Sheketoff said.
"We're training ourselves to be much more aggressive.... And
sometimes that also means being obnoxious and strident."</TE>
<TE>   The group has built up its Washington office to 20 members, nearly
twice its size in 1995, including one unit devoted to lobbying and
another to policy research.</TE>
<TE>   Lobbying expenditures by the American Library Assn. and other
library groups now rank among the highest for nonprofits, doubling to
about $750,000 in 2000 from $360,000 in 1997, according to the Center
for Responsive Politics.</TE>
<TE>   That's more than public broadcasters, Boy Scouts of America and
Red Cross combined, though less than the $1 million that the movie
industry pays annually to its top lobbyist, Jack Valenti.</TE>
<TE>   A former television producer, Sheketoff hasn't been shy about
using the media to "stay in the news cycle" on key issues. She hired
a press officer for the Washington office and has started sparring
more frequently with conservatives and law enforcement officials on
CNN, Fox News and talk radio.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowing a tactic from the for-profit world, Sheketoff initiated
a program to lean on libraries' vendors and suppliers for assistance
in Washington. For example, 3M Worldwide, which sells many of its
computer systems to libraries, was enlisted to help arrange meetings
with some lawmakers this fall about the library funding bill.</TE>
<TE>   When it needed co-sponsors for the bill, the Washington office
sent out 10,000 e-mails to libraries nationwide, urging librarians to
call their legislators. In less than a week, 94 lawmakers signed on.</TE>
<TE>   And though librarians are fighting to quash those old stereotypes,
they're not above exploiting their image to help butter up lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   During a key copyright battle, librarians appealed to Rep. W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) in part by evoking his childhood memories of
spending time at library bookmobiles, according to an entertainment
lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not pushovers," the lobbyist said. "They're pretty
formidable."</TE>
<TE>   Still, libraries lack the clout of more seasoned, and
better-funded, interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Librarians are not exactly up there with pharmaceutical
companies," quipped one Capitol Hill staffer.</TE>
<TE>   The American Library Assn.'s decision to sue to overturn the
Children's Internet Protection Act, however, has tested the limits of
that perception. Conservatives ranging from radio personality Dr.
Laura Schlessinger to the Family Research Council attacked the
association for the suit. Sheketoff said she received hate mail and
death threats.</TE>
<TE>   Though some libraries support the use of filters to bar visitors
from browsing pornography Web sites and other potentially offensive
material on the Internet, the association maintains that such
decisions are better handled at the local level, rather than by a
federal mandate.</TE>
<TE>   American Library Assn. President Maurice Freedman asserts that
Internet filters, which are based on a list of adult-themed words,
infringe on patrons' civil rights because they frequently block sites
that have nothing to do with pornography. Among them are those
dealing with breast cancer and birth control. The association's
lobbyists have noted that even the congressional Web site of House
Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) became snagged in the filter
because of his first name.</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court sided with the librarians, and this month
the Supreme Court agreed to review the case.</TE>
<TE>   Now librarians worry that their lawsuit may have derailed their
funding bill, which passed unanimously in committee but was never put
to the House floor for a vote. The measure would increase federal
library funding from about $160 million a year to about $350 million.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Diamond, a spokesman for Armey, insisted that lawmakers
simply ran out of time in the last session.</TE>
<TE>   Although he conceded that there were concerns about how much money
was being allocated and where funds would go, he said the filtering
lawsuit was not a factor.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't bother us one bit if they speak out on that," Diamond
said. "That's their right."</TE>
<TE>   Copyrights are another issue that librarians are speaking out on,
creating new divisions with old allies, such as publishers and media
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Libraries spend about $2 billion a year on books and $1 billion on
electronic databases, the American Library Assn. estimates. But they
fear that the growing use of anti-piracy technology and copyright
controls will prevent them from performing their traditional services
of loaning books, making backup copies and helping patrons with free
research.</TE>
<TE>   For example, many libraries have switched to electronic databases
rather than subscribing to hard-copy magazines and scholarly
journals.</TE>
<TE>   But they insist that they need to have the right to copy materials
as a backup and to share materials with other libraries. Otherwise,
if a library can no longer afford to pay for electronic access, it
loses not only future issues, but also access to the archives.</TE>
<TE>   Publishers and media companies, on the other hand, worry that in a
digital world, libraries will become an electronic back door through
which books, movies and music can pass freely. In the past, when a
library loaned a book to a patron, there was little concern that it
would interfere with sales. But if libraries can loan digital copies
of materials, publishers fear that widespread pirating may result and
sales could slump.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at what happened with music," said Schroeder, the former
congresswoman. "If it gets out for free, how are we going to pay the
authors?"</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder said she is hoping to soon find a compromise that will
allow libraries to continue serving patrons without threatening the
livelihood of publishers.</TE>
<TE>   Since her jab last year, Schroeder has been careful not to
criticize librarians, and she says she has spent many hours
explaining her remarks to them.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a very strong image, and this is a political
environment," Schroeder said. "Librarians were very upset. But for
the life of me, I still have not figured out what to apologize for."</TE>
<TE>   Sheketoff harbors no hard feelings. "In fact, I thanked her," she
said. "It really increased our visibility."</TE>

<HD>Will Tech Continue Leading Rebound?</HD>
<DH>Nasdaq has outperformed other indexes in the most recent
stock rally. But investors remain wary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market is on a hot streak, and technology issues are
leading the charge.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, investors have heard that come-on before, and for the
last 2 1/2 years it has been to their peril to believe that any
rebound -- especially in tech -- would be more than transitory.</LD>
<LD>   That's why suspicions are running high with Wall Street again in
recovery mode, even though some market bulls say their reasons for
optimism are as solid as they've been in a long time.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed out Friday up for the
seventh straight week, the longest winning streak since 1998. The
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index ended at 1,468.74 on
Friday, its highest close since June 19.</TE>
<TE>   Since reaching five-year lows in early October, the Dow is up
20.8%, at 8,804.84, and the Nasdaq index is up 31.8%.</TE>
<TE>   The last rally of this magnitude occurred in the fourth quarter of
2001, as the market rebounded from the sell-off that followed the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as now, battered tech stocks led the way. In fact, the
advance among the tech sector's biggest names is on an eerily similar
pace: The Nasdaq 100 index, which comprises the most prominent Nasdaq
tech firms, has risen 38.7% from its October low. A year ago at this
time the index was up 40% from its post-attacks low.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's fourth-quarter rally lasted until the first week of
January. The market then struggled through the winter before plunging
anew in spring and summer amid a wave of corporate financial
scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Someone who one year ago today bought the so-called QQQ fund,
which replicates the Nasdaq 100 index, still is down 31% despite the
rally of recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder many investors are suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   "There appears to be a fairly common assumption among market
followers that the rebound in prices since the lows of October is
merely a 'bear market rally,' " said Richard McCabe, chief market
analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Small investors seem particularly wary. Despite the heady gains of
the major market indexes since early October, stock mutual funds have
taken in relatively little in new cash in the last four weeks,
according to AMG Data Services, which tracks fund cash flows.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in the week ended Wednesday investors pulled a net $2
billion out of stock funds, AMG estimated.</TE>
<TE>   A high level of skepticism can be a good thing for Wall Street: It
often means there still is plenty of money on the sidelines, waiting
to be lured into a continuing rally.</TE>
<TE>   Among professional investors, however, bullish sentiment has
rebounded sharply since early October. Last week's poll of
independent market newsletter writers by Investors Intelligence
showed 49.4% are bullish, up from fewer than 30% at the market's
bottom in October. The remainder either are bearish or expect at
least a short-term pullback in stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even the professionals are holding back a bit: The bulls had
topped 60% in the newsletter poll in early 2001 and reached 55% in
spring of this year, in both cases preceding fresh market plunges.</TE>
<TE>   Other trends also point to a relaxation of the fear level in the
market. Yields on corporate "junk" bonds have tumbled as some
investors have rushed back into those securities. The yield on an
index of 100 junk issues tracked by KDP Investment Advisors fell to
10.53% on Friday, the lowest since early June and down from a peak of
12.34% in mid-October. (As the yield of a bond falls, its price
rises.)</TE>
<TE>   Investors' renewed interest in junk bonds suggests growing faith
that the economy will continue to improve in 2003, and thus that
there is less risk of debt-heavy companies' being unable to pay their
bills.</TE>
<TE>   "We find very compelling fundamentals now" in the junk market,
said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Trust in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   But junk bonds also are a favorite playground of market timers --
investors who are looking for no more than a short-term trade (or, in
other words, a bear market rally). Credit-rating firm Moody's
Investors Service, in a report Friday, said that despite the recent
slide in junk bond yields, "investors are still in a state of high
anxiety regarding their attitude towards credit risk."</TE>
<TE>   For stocks and junk bonds, a central question is whether the
economy will be OK in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   On that front, some reports last week indicated that the outlook
is improving. The Conference Board said its index of leading economic
indicators stabilized in October, halting a four-month slide. And the
government said weekly claims for jobless benefits hit a four-month
low.</TE>
<TE>   Big investors who have been putting cash to work in stocks say
that even if the economic outlook remains murky, the market's mood
has rightly improved since early October. "The market was priced for
Armageddon, and that's just not the scenario," Ablin said.</TE>
<TE>   As was the case a year ago, the current rally also has the
calendar on its side.</TE>
<TE>   The November-to-January stretch historically has been the stock
market's strongest period of the year. Knowing the seasonal trends,
many money managers may prefer to get on board a market advance
rather than fight it, even if their conviction isn't strong.</TE>
<TE>   The key differences between now and a year ago or two years ago,
Wall Street's bulls say, is that share prices are substantially
lower, and so are most interest rates. In addition, with Republicans
now in control of Congress, investors are expecting new tax cuts for
businesses and consumers in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Those factors should keep this rally from abruptly reversing,
optimists say.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, many Wall Street pros say, financial and accounting
scandals have become old stories, and investors are figuring that the
worst of the bad news on that front has passed.</TE>
<TE>   What hasn't changed since a year ago is the threat of more
terrorist attacks or a wider conflict in the Middle East, either of
which could dash consumer and investor confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Even for investors who believe that the long bear market is
finally over, a big question is whether the devastated technology
sector would lead a rebound. Typically, when new bull markets begin,
the leaders aren't the same stocks or sectors that led the last bull
market. Investors move on to other ideas.</TE>
<TE>   So why are tech shares out front again?</TE>
<TE>   In part, the stocks' gains are a natural snap-back from the deeply
depressed levels of early October, analysts say. Institutional
investors also know they can use many tech stocks to get back into
the market in a hurry, thanks to the sheer number of shares
outstanding from firms such as Cisco Systems Inc. and Oracle Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "Tech offers money managers a way to make up performance very
quickly" when the market is turning, said Kevin Marder, market
strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   With the average domestic stock mutual fund still down 18.1% year
to date, according to Morningstar Inc., money managers have a lot of
red ink to try to wipe away.</TE>
<TE>   For the tech rally to be sustained, however, investors will have
to believe that the fundamentals of the companies will improve
substantially in 2003, and that the stocks aren't already overpriced
based on earnings expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Foreman, chief investment officer for domestic equities at
Trust Co. of the West in Los Angeles, warns that "there are going to
be many tech companies that aren't going to make it." That was the
market's message when it pushed hundreds of tech shares to
penny-stock levels over the last year, and the message still is
valid, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the industry consolidation that will continue to be forced by
tech stocks' collapse will mean a rosier long-term outlook for the
companies that survive, Foreman added. That expectation is helping to
fuel the latest rally in the sector.</TE>
<TE>   Already, "companies like EBay, Amazon.com, Yahoo and Expedia
completely dominate" their sectors, Foreman said, "and those are
still the fastest-growing businesses going."</TE>

<HD>Services Group to Buy Marriott Distribution Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Services Group of America Inc., a closely held holding company for
food distributors, agreed Sunday to buy Marriott International Inc.'s
food distribution business to allow it to expand into California and
elsewhere in the West. Terms weren't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Services Group's McCabe's Quality Foods Inc. distributes food
throughout the Pacific Northwest and Pacific Rim to such chains as
Burger King, Wendy's and Arby's.</LD>
<LD>   The transaction will extend its territory to California, Arizona
and Idaho and add Marriott clients Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Black
Angus and Sizzler among other restaurants, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   McCabe's also will take over Marriott Distribution Services'
operations in Los Alamitos, Milpitas, Calif., and Salem, Ore., the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition will more than triple sales for Portland,
Ore.-based McCabe's to about $650 million annually and will boost
Services Group's annual revenue to more than $2.2 billion, Chairman
Thomas J. Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   Bethesda, Md.-based hotel operator Marriott announced this year
that it wanted out of the food distribution business after the
division had $1 million in operating losses and $5 million in
restructuring and other charges in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The food division, which supplied food to Marriott hotels in
addition to other clients, contributed about 10% of Marriott
International's $10 billion in annual revenue last year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Marriott International rose 43 cents to close at $34.57
Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Tallying Port Dispute's Costs</HD>
<DH>Many companies managed to escape major losses, but some
negative effects could be permanent</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evelyn Iritani and Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So how much did months of labor strife and uncertainty at West Coast
ports cost the U.S. economy?</LD>
<LD>   The short answer is that no one really knows. Clearly, the most
damage came during the 10-day management lockout that ended Oct. 9.
But the labor dispute hobbled cargo movement both before and after
the lockout ended, and even now the hangover sends pangs through the
economy.</LD>
<LD>   Produce exporters forced to dump stranded fruits and vegetables on
the domestic market still are tallying up their losses. Retailers
that had popular products stuck at sea are waiting to see if they can
make up for lost sales during the holiday season. Truckers continue
to burn valuable fuel and time getting in and out of the
still-congested waterfront.</LD>
<TE>   "I've gone from making three trips a day to maybe one if I'm
lucky," said Rodel Biala, an independent trucker who figures he has
lost at least $5,000 in income idling in long lines at the ports of
Los Angeles and Long Beach. "I'm just trying to survive right now."</TE>
<TE>   But Biala's quick calculation of his own personal setback isn't so
easy to extrapolate across the entire economy. Analysts say it's
impossible to gauge the precise overall figure because the effect
goes far beyond the 29 West Coast ports, extending across industries
and borders.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, sectors tied closely to the ports, such as trucking,
were hit first and worst.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some experts believe that many U.S. companies escaped major
losses by stockpiling inventory or diverting cargo through East Coast
ports. Other companies were able to largely recover once the ports
reopened.</TE>
<TE>   "I bet at the end of the day, when everything is cleared off the
docks, the net cost to the economy is relatively small," said Jim
Glassman, chief U.S. economist for J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   What also may never be known is just how close the U.S. economy
came to the brink -- when the port backup would have turned from a
costly but manageable supply disruption into a trigger for global
financial chaos.</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast ports handled about $310 billion in cargo in 2000,
42% of all U.S. waterborne trade, according to a study by the
Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy. Nearly one-third of
automobile and truck imports are shipped through the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   In Asia, where cargo piled up on the docks during the dispute,
anxious manufacturers already suffering from the weak U.S. economy
feared they would have to stop production if the ports remained
closed much longer.</TE>
<TE>   "If such a thing reaches a certain scale where the pain is really
severe, you have an Asian financial crisis and an economic mess,"
said Stephen Cohen, co-director of the Berkeley Roundtable. "Maybe 10
days is within a manageable figure, and had it gone on for another 10
days it would not have been manageable."</TE>
<TE>   Few believe that the toll on the U.S. economy will reach $19.4
billion, the damage estimate for a 10-day shutdown contained in a
study commissioned by the Pacific Maritime Assn., whose 70 members
include shipping lines, terminal operators and stevedoring services.
Economists said a shock of that magnitude in an already shaky global
economy would have had a noticeable effect on the U.S. stock market,
employment data or other key barometers of fiscal health. Yet such
ripples never materialized.</TE>
<TE>   Shipping lines, presumably the hardest hit by this dispute, have
been cagey about their own losses. Singapore-based APL said the port
shutdown cost it $10 million in forgone revenue, wages and route
diversion. But the PMA, which shuttered the ports after accusing the
longshore union of engaging in costly work slowdowns, declined to
provide any accounting for its members.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland-based Transpacific Stabilization Agreement, a
rate-setting group whose 14 shipping lines account for the lion's
share of ocean cargo between the U.S. and Asia, has projected that
its members will lose a combined $2 billion this year. But a
spokesman acknowledged that most of that red ink is related to a
sharp drop in shipping rates -- not the labor strife at the docks.</TE>
<TE>   John Martin, whose maritime consulting firm conducted the PMA
study, said it was far too early to provide any figures on the
economic fallout, though he expected it probably would fall between
$4.7 billion and $19.4 billion, the damage range he projected for a
shutdown lasting five to 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said it would take months to ferret out all the hidden
costs related to the port shutdown, such as additional borrowing
expenses for transportation firms whose financial ratings were
downgraded.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he conceded that his earlier projection would have to be
revised significantly. For example, he predicted that a shutdown of
10 days or greater would lead to the loss of about 90,600
full-time-equivalent jobs (181.2 million hours) and nearly $693
million in federal, state and local tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, though dockworkers, truckers and others were knocked off
the job right away and a few manufacturing plants depending on
just-in-time inventory idled their assembly lines, there were no
reports of widespread work disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   Even major agricultural exporters reported only partial losses of
their perishable cargo. Dole Food Co., which had predicted a loss of
$2.4 million early in the shutdown, later put the figure in the
$250,000 to $500,000 range.</TE>
<TE>   Martin credited President Bush's intervention in the dispute with
containing the damage. Bush forced an end to the lockout by seeking a
court injunction under the rarely used Taft-Hartley Act.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, the Taft-Hartley prevented a catastrophic impact,"
Martin said. "There was pre-warning on this, and things may have
gotten stopped just in time."</TE>
<TE>   But Patrick Anderson, a principal with the Michigan-based Anderson
Economic Group, which has done studies on the effect of auto industry
strikes, said the potential damages provided by the shipping lines
were grossly exaggerated. He estimated the total losses for the port
shutdown at $1.7 billion, which he said was comparable to the effect
of the seven-week General Motors strike of 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike a natural disaster such as a tornado or earthquake, there
isn't a huge destruction of assets in a transportation strike. In
addition, major retailers were bracing for troubled labor
negotiations this year and had made contingency plans. Some
inventory, such as perishable food, would be a total loss if the
cargo were delayed too long. But in most cases, the cargo eventually
will make its way into the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson noted that in this type of supply-chain disruption, many
costs simply are shifted between economic players.</TE>
<TE>   The expense of holding inventory, for instance, will be moved from
the retailer or warehouse to the shipping company. Meanwhile,
shipping companies lose business, but air freight companies and some
trucking companies pick up extra trade. One retailer may suffer
because its goods are held up at port, but because consumers still
want to spend money, that just means another retailer down the block
probably rings up the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said the only way to arrive at a $1-billion-a-day loss
would be to "sink the ships, not delay them."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the disruption did take something of a bite out of
the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. subsidiary of Honda Motor Co., which halted assembly
lines from California to the Midwest and Canada, estimated its losses
related to the ports' shutdown at $83 million in wages, extra
shipping fees and other costs.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp., co-owners of the New
United Motor Manufacturing Inc. plant in Fremont, Calif., aren't
disclosing their losses. But NUMMI's 3,500 workers still are working
overtime to make up for a weeklong shutdown of pickup truck and car
assembly lines after parts were held up at the Port of Oakland. NUMMI
also had to air-freight 40 containers of parts from Japan and divert
cargo through Portland, Ore., Long Beach and even Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, many of NUMMI's suppliers had to idle assembly lines
or air-freight in key components, according to Michael Damer, a NUMMI
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Big merchants are feeling the squeeze as well. The National Retail
Federation, a Washington-based trade group whose membership includes
major department store and discount chains, said that 39% of its
members expect shortages of goods during the peak holiday shopping
season.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly hard hit were smaller firms selling seasonal items.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Rodriguez, the vice president of Mercado Latino, a
Latin-food distributor based in City of Industry, estimates that he
has lost $500,000 to $1 million worth of business because he was
caught short of popular items such as Spanish olives and cooking wine
that are in high demand in the holiday season. He said the port
congestion still is wreaking havoc on his deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his containers were diverted to Mexico and Alaska. From
there they must be brought to California by truck, which takes time
and is more expensive than rail.</TE>
<TE>   "This is life-threatening," Rodriguez said. "It's like being a
peanut vendor in Dodger Stadium without peanuts."</TE>
<TE>   For some companies, the rerouting of cargo through the East Coast
or the Gulf of Mexico is likely to become permanent, even though it
may add costs to their distribution system, according to Bill
Wanamaker, a spokesman for the American Trucking Assn.</TE>
<TE>   That's potentially bad news for West Coast trucking and logistics
firms, which stand to lose market share to competitors in other parts
of the country. Wanamaker said he knows of one Southern California
distribution firm that lost a huge chunk of business after a major
retail customer decided it was too risky to continue receiving all
its imported merchandise through the ports of Long Beach and Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It demonstrates," Wanamaker said, "that events like this have not
just temporary consequences but permanent effects."</TE>

<HD>Investors Get Plateful of Economic Data</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors will keep one eye on the turkey and another on a mound of
economic data during a sluggish Thanksgiving week.</LD>
<LD>   Market watchers are split over whether momentum from the Dow's
stunning 21% rally from a five-year low in early October will sweep
over into this week. But they tend to agree that any gains or losses
will be meager during the holiday-shortened week.</LD>
<LD>   Retail sales for November are expected to get a boost as consumers
hit the nation's malls and other shopping outlets the day after
Thanksgiving.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. retailers' November-December same-store sales, or those open
at least a year, are forecast to rise about 3%, or more than last
year's 2.2% gain, economists say.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales are a key retail indicator that exclude new and
closed locations.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market will be closed Thursday to celebrate the
Thanksgiving Day holiday and will close at 10 a.m. PST Friday.
Trading floors will empty out toward the end of the week, leading to
light volume on a lackadaisical Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, economic reports will pour in this week, including
readings on the growth of the economy, consumer spending, consumer
confidence, durable goods and weekly jobless claims.</TE>
<TE>   Gross domestic product, which measures the value of goods and
services produced within U.S. borders, is expected to be revised up
to a 3.8% annualized rate for the third quarter from a previous rate
of 3.1%. The GDP report is due Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Investors will scrutinize a report on new-home sales in October,
also due Tuesday. Sales are expected to edge down to 992,000 in
October from 1,021,000 in September.</TE>
<TE>   Cheap borrowing, coupled with the perception that homes are a
stable and profitable investment compared with stocks, have sustained
a thriving housing market, even as much of the economy sputters.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, the Conference Board will release its read on
consumer confidence for November. Consumer confidence is expected to
rise to 85.2 in November from 79.4 in October, when it hit its lowest
level since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts track consumer confidence for clues on consumer spending,
which drives about two-thirds of the U.S. economy and has remained
fairly robust throughout the economy's downturn.</TE>
<TE>   A report on October consumer spending, or personal consumption, is
set for Wednesday. Consumer spending, one of the main drivers of
economic growth, was expected to have risen 0.2% last month after
falling 0.4% in September.</TE>
<TE>   Personal income is forecast to gain 0.2% in October, not as robust
as September's 0.4% rise, according to economists polled by Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   Weekly jobless benefit claims, due Wednesday, are expected to land
at 382,000 for the week ended Nov. 23, up from 376,000 in the
previous week. Last week investors applauded a surprising drop in
weekly jobless benefit claims that fueled hopes the labor market is
stabilizing.</TE>
<TE>   Orders for durable goods, also due Wednesday, are expected to rise
2% in October from a decline of 4.9% in September.</TE>
<TE>   The market will get yet another pulse-taking on consumer sentiment
Wednesday when the closely watched University of Michigan survey is
released. The final November reading is expected to be 85.5, up from
80.6 in the previous report.</TE>

<HD>EU Ministers to Vote on New Antitrust Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Europe's antitrust control is set for a radical makeover that will
change the way companies, courts and countries do business across the
15-nation European Union.</LD>
<LD>   The new rules affecting cartels and abuse of dominance will be
voted on by EU ministers when they meet Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   It is a sensitive area that includes probes into Microsoft Corp.'s
alleged abuse of power, and price-fixing conspiracies that have
prompted fines of hundreds of millions of euros.</LD>
<TE>   The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, will complement
the new rules by voting Dec. 11 on a separate package of reforms
overhauling the merger process in Europe. The two packages are
unconnected.</TE>
<TE>   At present, companies file notices with the commission to make
certain their partnerships with rivals and others are within
antitrust law. The new rules would do away with such reviews, but at
the same time would give the bloc's member states and their courts a
big role in enforcing community antitrust law.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules also would clarify the authority of the commission
to break up a company, if that is necessary to remedy violations of
antitrust law. That has not happened yet in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   They also would give authorities the right to raid private homes,
with the permission of a national judge, to find materials in
antitrust investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Commission officials say the changes are long overdue. The old
cartel rules of 1962 were designed to meet the needs of the then-six
members.</TE>
<TE>   The commission has gotten bogged down with the rules and matters
would become worse in a European Union that will expand to 25 members
in 2004. The commission wants to give up responsibility for reviewing
company agreements.</TE>

<HD>Hynix Creditors to Meet on Rescue Measures</HD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Korea Exchange Bank and other major Hynix Semiconductor Inc.
creditors meet today to discuss possible rescue measures for the
world's third-largest computer memory-chip maker.</LD>
<LD>   Lenders, including Citibank's Seoul branch, will discuss
recommendations from Deutsche Bank, which was hired to advise them on
what to do with the ailing chip maker.</LD>
<LD>   Deutsche Bank has recommended that creditors swap $1.5 billion of
debt into stock and delay payment on remaining debt to keep the chip
maker in business, Maeil Business Newspaper reported.</LD>
<TE>   Four companies control 80% of the global market for dynamic random
access memory, or DRAM, chips used in personal computers and other
devices.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts estimate that Hynix controls about 20% of the market,
whereas Micron Technology Inc. and Samsung Electronics Corp. each
have a 25% share.</TE>
<TE>   The chip makers have been ailing with the global drop in sales of
PCs.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department in June launched an antitrust investigation
into whether semiconductor manufacturers manipulated prices in the
$11.2-billion memory-chip market.</TE>

<HD>Qantas Plans to Buy 22.5% Stake in Air New Zealand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WELLINGTON, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>Qantas, Australia's national airline, said it would buy a 22.5% stake
in Air New Zealand to form a regional airline alliance, the two
companies said today.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which would face tough scrutiny by regulators in both
countries, would see Qantas injecting up to $272 million into the New
Zealand airline, currently 82% owned by the government after a
bailout last year.</LD>
<LD>   It also would allow the two airlines to streamline their
operations and international services and "establish a major airline
grouping in the region," said Air New Zealand Chairman John Palmer.</LD>
<TE>   Air New Zealand would maintain its independence and continue to
provide domestic and international services, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed deal, Air New Zealand would combine with and
manage those parts of Qantas that operate to, from or within New
Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   Qantas would take two seats on the Air New Zealand board and Air
New Zealand would take one seat on the Qantas board.</TE>
<TE>   Qantas Chief Executive Geoff Dixon said the partnership would help
both airlines retain their independence, protect job security for
staff and boost tourism between the two countries at a difficult time
for the industry.</TE>
<TE>   The two airlines had been talking about a closer relationship all
year after the New Zealand government injected $495 million into the
carrier last December.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts believe winning approval from market and competition
regulators could be the biggest hurdle to the plan. The carriers
dominate their domestic markets and the routes between the two
neighboring countries.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's competition regulator said the proposal appeared
anti-competitive and would take at least four months to assess.</TE>
<TE>   Rival Australian budget airline Virgin Blue said that a Qantas
stake in Air New Zealand would offer no benefits to consumers. The
company said it already had raised its concerns with competition
regulators in both countries.</TE>

<HD>Anschutz Purchase Aided Qwest on Taxes</HD>
<DH>Billionaire bought an airplane from the phone carrier in a
'like-kind exchange,' allowing the firm to defer liabilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc.'s biggest investor, Philip
Anschutz, bought an aircraft from the company for $7.6 million in
2001, helping the local phone carrier defer some taxes.</LD>
<LD>   A subsidiary of a company controlled by Los Angeles billionaire
Anschutz purchased the plane in May 2001 in a so-called like-kind
exchange, in which a company sells one asset and purchases another
near the same time. The transaction deferred taxes on the sale for
Denver-based Qwest, the company said in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Companies use such exchanges to reduce taxes when upgrading
vehicles, aircraft, Federal Communications Commission licenses and
real estate, Qwest said in the filing. Qwest made the filing to
describe transactions that had been "inadvertently left out" or not
required in earlier filings, Qwest spokesman Steven Hammack said.</LD>
<TE>   The subsidiary's purchase of the plane "resulted in significant
tax deferrals and savings," Qwest said. "The transaction was approved
by the disinterested members of our board of directors."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Qwest closed Friday at $4.62 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock is down 67% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest acquired the aircraft from a third party, which the filing
doesn't identify, in December 2001. Rules governing such asset
exchanges are meant to encourage investment and generate economic
growth, Qwest said in the filing.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate series of transactions, a subsidiary of Anschutz Co.
received notes worth $36.9 million in connection with a transaction
that involved KPNQwest, a Netherlands-based joint venture 47.5% owned
by Qwest, and Global TeleSystems Inc., according to the filing.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2002, KPNQwest bought assets from Global TeleSystems for
$210 million in convertible KPNQwest bonds and the assumption of some
debt and other obligations.</TE>
<TE>   The Anschutz Co. subsidiary had become a creditor to Global
TeleSystems in 2001 and had provided interim financing to Global
TeleSystems in 2001 and 2002, according to the filing.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz informed Qwest's board of his company's relationship with
Global TeleSystems "contemporaneous to when he found out KPNQwest was
going for" the Global TeleSystems acquisition, Jim Monaghan, a
spokesman for Anschutz, said over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The notes still are held by Anschutz Co. and currently have no
value, the filing said. KPNQwest filed for bankruptcy protection in
May.</TE>

<HD>Dockhands Hoping Accord Brings Stability</HD>
<DH>Weary after months of uncertainty and slowdowns stemming
from contract battle, union members, others look forward to steady
work.</DH>

<LD>At Terminal Island at the Port of Los Angeles on Sunday, a group of
workers gathered to unload two ships docked at Pier 400. But a load
already had been taken off their minds.</LD>
<LD>   Weary after months of uncertainty surrounding their jobs,
dockhands at the port expressed relief that a tentative labor deal
announced late Saturday night might bring them a measure of security
and wage increases over the next six years.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been under a lot of pressure lately so it will be good to
have everything worked out," said one burly union crane operator, who
declined to give his name.</LD>
<TE>   Members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union
probably will vote on the agreement in January.</TE>
<TE>   A few union members questioned the length of the contract, saying
it was twice as long as their most recent pact. Some suggested, with
bravado, that the rank-and-file would vote against the deal if wage
increases or the proposed pension plan were unsatisfactory.</TE>
<TE>   But most workers said they just wanted to put the messy contract
battle behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great gig," said one 42-year-old longshoreman during
his lunch break.</TE>
<TE>   "Work is steady, and we keep moving cargo, more cargo every year.
And the money's good. I just hope it stays that way."</TE>
<TE>   A marine shipping clerk who has worked at the port 25 years, who
also asked not to be identified, said the workers were relieved that
a deal had been reached a month before the expiration of a federal
injunction that was keeping the ports open and running.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing we wanted to do was go out on strike," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The port's labor troubles sent waves of discontent crashing far
beyond the shipping yards of Wilmington and Long Beach. Businesses
from retailers to truck-washing operations were walloped during a
10-day lockout.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents the shipping lines
and terminal operators, then filed documents with the Justice
Department last month claiming the union had defied a court order by
engaging in systematic slowdowns, which caused productivity to
plummet.</TE>
<TE>   Dockworkers bristled at the suggestion, saying they were following
work and safety rules. They attributed any declines in productivity
to congestion on the docks, shortages of equipment and labor, and
mismanagement by terminal operators.</TE>
<TE>   Some truckers said they were among those who have been squeezed
the most. A group of drivers waiting for their cabs to be cleaned at
Del's Truck Wash on Flint Street in Wilmington said work has been
slow for more than six months. And that hurts the truckers because
they typically are paid by the load -- not by the hour.</TE>
<TE>   The truckers said they have sat days and hours waiting to pick up
a single container to drive north to the rail lines.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we have to wait two to three hours and sometimes we
lose a whole day," said Isidro Gonzales, a 37-year-old driver from
Downey who was repairing his rig outside Harbor Truck Supplies on
Anaheim Street in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't disagree with the longshoremen. Everyone wants to make a
lot of money. I do too," Gonzales said. "But if they don't work, I
don't make money. We all need to support families and make service on
our trucks."</TE>
<TE>   Another driver, Americo Dasilvo of Pine Bush, N.Y., was buying
bolts at Harbor Truck Supplies. The 42-year-old driver said the port
labor woes have had repercussions throughout the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the East Coast is slow. We're wasting a lot of time trying
to get loads," Dasilvo said. "It's been bad because we've also got to
pay for our trucks and houses."</TE>

<HD>Rose Fans No Longer Feeling Blue</HD>
<DH>Anticipation grows for the elusive color, stronger
fragrances, thanks to biotech breakthroughs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Elias</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roses are red and a variety of other colors. But they've never been
blue -- an omission rose breeders have sought for centuries to
remedy.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be a beautiful thing to see," said James Armstrong, an
award-winning flower show exhibitor and consultant to the San
Francisco Rose Society.</LD>
<LD>   Breakthroughs in biotechnology may finally resolve the quest for
the elusive blue rose, which does not exist because roses lack the
corresponding pigment genes.</LD>
<TE>   Technology also promises to restore sweet smells to the rose and
other flowers. Generations of commercial breeding have led to
beautiful but bland-smelling roses. Their colors are stunning and
vase lives long, but they have little fragrance.</TE>
<TE>   Genetic engineers also are busy bringing science to bear on
diseases and pests that affect the world's 120 rose species, which
have blossomed into a $10-billion-a-year business worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's the blue rose that remains the biggest prize.</TE>
<TE>   At Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville,
scientists studying how drugs metabolize in the liver stumbled across
a human protein that may hold the key to creating the world's first
known blue rose.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Gillam, working in the lab of biochemist F. Peter
Guengerich, amazed her boss one day with a flask of bacteria that she
turned blue with an enzyme taken from a patient's liver. Gillam and
Guengerich now are trying to insert into roses the human gene that
produces that blue enzyme.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have called you crazy five years ago if you told me I
would be pursuing a blue rose," said Guengerich, who spends most of
his time researching disease-fighting drugs. "It's not something we
set out to do."</TE>
<TE>   Guengerich marvels that so many gardening enthusiasts lust after
the blue rose, the pursuit of which has reached near-mythic
proportions.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason this is the holy grail for this type of work,"
Guengerich said. "We could try to create blue cotton, blue anything,
really."</TE>
<TE>   They've managed to get only a few blue spots into the stems. "It's
not as easy as you may think," Guengerich said. "It's going to take
more work."</TE>
<TE>   Guengerich and Gillam are talking to biotechnology companies about
helping them develop a blue rose.</TE>
<TE>   They're not alone -- Florigene, an Australian company, was
launched in 1986 to develop a blue rose. Its scientists have tried to
splice a "blue" petunia gene into roses, with little success.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeter-smelling roses are perhaps closer to market. Researchers
around the world are working to identify scent genes in roses and
other flowers. A key step has been mapping their genomes.</TE>
<TE>   A group of Israeli researchers published a paper in the journal
Plant Cell in September that compared the genome of the
strong-scented Fragrant Cloud rose to that of the nearly odorless
yellow rose. They isolated genes that occurred in only the fragrant
rose and may be responsible for scent. The trick now is to splice the
scent genes into non-fragrant varieties, a not-so-easy task.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, we don't have the technology to transform the
rose," said David Weiss of Hebrew University of Jerusalem, co-author
of the Plant Cell paper. "We are working on it."</TE>
<TE>   At Clemson University in South Carolina, researcher Sriyani
Rajapakse has developed DNA "fingerprints" so growers can protect
their rose breeds from being stolen. She also has produced a rough
draft of the rose genome.</TE>
<TE>   Rose genomes will allow growers to more easily and quickly weed
out undesirable plants, Rajapakse said. Now, growers typically have
to wait until all of their roses bloom to decide which plants to keep
and which to discard.</TE>
<TE>   "Biotechnology holds great promise for roses," Rajapakse said.</TE>
<TE>   Among other biotechnology projects that soon may be underway is
the creation through genetic engineering of thornless roses. Robert
Skirvin, a professor at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, hopes his work with thornless blackberry bushes can
be used to de-thorn the stems of brambled rose varieties.</TE>
<TE>   Other research in various stages could add more panache to the
ornamental flower industry. Of the top 10 selling flowers, only the
freesia has a naturally occurring blue variety.</TE>
<TE>   Although there's growing criticism of biotechnology's use on crops
to produce food and pharmaceuticals, protest against tinkering with
flower genes has been muted. That's probably because flowers
generally aren't being consumed.</TE>
<TE>   A few complaints have come from purists, but serious hobbyists
such as Armstrong of the San Francisco Rose Society view
biotechnology as a great way to grow better, hardier flowers.</TE>
<TE>   "They still have to be extremely careful that there isn't
inadvertent hybridization," Armstrong said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm not a purist. It would be nice to see a blue rose, and
the only way that's going to happen is through genetic engineering."</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Sheds Part of Stake in Utility Division</HD>
<DH>The sale of a 20.4% stake to a group of investors begins
the company's transformation into a pure media business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>French media conglomerate Vivendi Universal said Sunday that it has
completed the sale of a 20.4% stake in utility arm Vivendi
Environnement to a group of French, Italian and U.S. investors for
$1.85 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi Universal, whose businesses range from Hollywood films to
wastewater treatment, also said it has agreed to sell the rest of its
40.8% stake to the investor group by late 2004.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement means Vivendi Universal, which began as the water
company Compagnie Generale des Eaux in 1853, will become a pure media
business, completing its transformation away from its roots.</LD>
<TE>   "It's in keeping with the strategy announced ... on Sept. 21 that
Vivendi plans to focus on its entertainment businesses," company
spokesman Alain Delrieu said.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 7, the debt-ridden conglomerate announced plans to begin
pulling out of the utility business as part of an effort to
strengthen its finances.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has sought to improve
the company's balance sheet after a spending spree during the tenure
of his predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, left the company with huge
debts.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal said the sale of the 20.4% stake and call
options for the other half was based on a price of $22.42 for each
share and call option.</TE>
<TE>   When the transaction closes Dec. 24, the investors are to receive
shares plus call options that can be exercised until Dec. 23, 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal said the sale puts the company on track to cut
its debt to about $13.9 billion by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The company said the sale "represents a new important milestone in
the financial restructuring of Vivendi Universal and allows it to
improve significantly its financial flexibility."</TE>
<TE>   The investors are mainly French companies, such as insurers AGF
and Groupe Axa, banks BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole Indosuez, and
utility Electricite de France. Others include the Italian insurer
Assicurazioni Generali and the Wasserstein Family Trust of the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Environnement supplies water to 110 million people in more
than 100 countries, including 26 million households in France. The
company recycles the trash of 74 million people in 48 countries,
cleans up the streets of 4,000 cities, including London and Madrid,
and runs 236 train and bus services in 20 countries.</TE>

<HD>The Big One Is on Its Way: Why Aren't We Doing More to
Protect Kids?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Hough and Lucy Jones</AU>
<BD>Susan Hough and Lucy Jones are seismologists with the
U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Geologists have identified 14 large earthquakes on the San Andreas
Fault over the last 1,500 years -- just under one every 100 years.
The bad news: It's been 145 years since the last one.</LD>
<LD>   The geologic evidence shows significant variation in the time
between past events, with some gaps as long as 300-plus years. So we
still cannot say when the next one will strike.</LD>
<LD>   The long-term implication of the record is clear, however:
Earthquakes are in our future.</LD>
<TE>   As frightening as this sounds, it behooves us to remember that
earthquakes don't kill people, buildings kill people. The saying is
as true today as when it was first coined decades ago, and the Earth
continues to illustrate the point.</TE>
<TE>   A massive magnitude 7.9 earthquake in a sparsely populated part of
Alaska recently caused relatively minor damage and few injuries,
while much smaller earthquakes in Italy and Pakistan claimed dozens
of lives.</TE>
<TE>   In California, we suffer periodic reminders, such as the 1987
Whittier Narrows earthquake, that even moderate earthquakes can kill.
However, we have tended to be confident that our schools are safe.
The Field Act, enacted in the aftermath of the 1933 Long Beach
earthquake, requires that buildings for elementary and secondary
schools and community colleges be built to especially stringent codes
and subject to inspection during every step of the building process.
In 1990, Field Act provisions were extended to include private
schools (charter schools and day-care centers remain exempt). Clearly
a tragedy such as the recent one south of Rome, which claimed the
lives of 26 children, couldn't happen here. Right?</TE>
<TE>   As helpful as it has been, the Field Act has not solved all our
problems. Although its early standards were strict, they were
improved over time as we have learned more about earthquakes; so
older schools were built to codes less stringent than now required
and could be made stronger.</TE>
<TE>   Recent proposals to solve the space problem facing the Los Angeles
Unified School District and many other districts call for
retrofitting existing structures. Yet many experts wonder whether
these buildings would be as safe as a structure whose construction
was monitored from the beginning. The state has stepped in and is
requiring an expert review of the retrofitting process to evaluate
the safety risk. A strict inspection process for retrofitting will be
needed.</TE>
<TE>   Even in earthquake-resistant buildings, what happens inside
matters when the ground starts to shake. Toppling objects can cause
injury and even death. Classrooms are filled with potential hazards,
from computers to bookcases and paper cutters. In general, they are
secured against earthquake shaking only by particularly conscientious
teachers or active parent groups. No law or regulation governs school
contents.</TE>
<TE>   Building codes do not apply to existing structures; neither do
existing laws provide any direct incentive for retrofitting. Such
work is undertaken on single-family homes out of concern for the
safety of one's family, although even in those cases it is easy to
become complacent as memories of the last big earthquake inevitably
fade.</TE>
<TE>   For multi-unit housing, the issues are more complex. This is true
not only for low-income housing units, where retrofitting may be
prohibitively expensive, but also for higher-end condo and apartment
units.</TE>
<TE>   For schools, we need to decide as a society how far we will go to
protect our children. The Field Act is a great beginning, but it is
not the final answer.</TE>

<HD>Caucasus Conundrum</HD>
<DH>As the people worry, Putin thrives on war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Politkovskaya</AU>
<BD>Anna Politkovskaya is a special correspondent for the
newspaper Novaya Gazeta in Moscow and author of "A Dirty War: A
Russian Reporter in Chechnya" (Harvill Press). This article was
translated by Alexei Kuznetsov of The Times' Moscow Bureau.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chechnya is a sickness for Russia.</LD>
<LD>   We may pretend to be happy at times, pretend that our economy is
not stagnant. We may choose to be glad that we do not have to line up
for sausages and eggs anymore. But it all seems irrelevant when you
realize that it is the war in the North Caucasus that controls life
in Russia, a war that has been going on intermittently for eight
years, a war that has claimed the lives of thousands of our citizens.
And no one even knows for sure how many victims there are because no
one has counted.</LD>
<LD>   The war enthrones the Kremlin leadership. It fires and appoints
top-ranking officials. It cripples the judiciary to such an extent
that, instead of being a democratic mechanism to ensure adversarial
contests, courts turn into a doormat used by the authorities for
their own convenience. The free press is being destroyed by this war.
And on top of all this, today, after the October terrorist act in
Moscow, we also have to live in a fear that does not let us go even
for a minute.</LD>
<TE>   An old acquaintance of mine called once and said: "Weird. There
were lots of people out in the streets over the weekend, and no
terrorist act. Do you happen to know why not?"</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, another friend called, with almost the same words
and the same feeling: "I have been waiting for a terrorist act, but
they will probably again get us where we least expect it."</TE>
<TE>   This is exactly the fear that has become hard-wired into our
genetic code: The war that to John Q. Public had seemed rather remote
has now crept into every household. For the thinking majority, life
after the mass hostage-taking at a Moscow theater is a feeling of
being up in the air around the clock: Will a new act of terror occur?
And where? And how can all this be stopped?</TE>
<TE>   Even President Vladimir V. Putin -- he who tries to prove to the
world that he is such a strong and dashing guy -- has publicly hushed
and rebuked everybody and raised his voice to say no, do not hold
your breath. That it will not stop, there will be no peace talks
because we are fighting "international terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   So is peace in Chechnya possible at all? And what kind of peace is
possible now, after Putin's statements that there will be no peace
until all terrorists are crushed and all those who even dare to
breathe a word about it will be reckoned among international
terrorists?</TE>
<TE>   All wars end in peace. History has failed to come up with any
other outcome. Moreover, peace, as history teaches us again, always
starts with the same thing: The warring sides, although they have
killed lots of people, sit down at the negotiating table and face
each other. This is what will happen in Russia too. Yet it is unclear
when, exactly. And it is this "when" that is the rub.</TE>
<TE>   Some in Russia say, "There will be peace when the military wants
it." Others say, "When Putin needs it." I support a different point
of view.</TE>
<TE>   Putin is indeed the pragmatist that the West believes him to be.
However, the naive West thinks that Putin's pragmatism is for the
sake of the country he leads. Instead, Putin's pragmatism is, first
and foremost, for his own sake.</TE>
<TE>   Today's regime in Russia, as personified first and foremost by
Putin, is interested only in power -- to keep it, consolidate and
augment it, and do it in such a way that opponents would not even be
able to raise their heads.</TE>
<TE>   As far as the current Chechnya war is concerned, Putin practices
exactly this pragmatism of personal power to the highest degree,
which in fact is barefaced cynicism. Putin does not care about
civilian casualties (in more than three years of the war he has not
once expressed condolences to the families of the killed Chechens) or
even the thousands of victims among the military who perish in
Chechnya or die of wounds in hospitals. All that interests him in the
war is deriving the benefit that will guarantee his reelection for a
second term.</TE>
<TE>   What do I mean by this? It is common knowledge that the Russian
people are irrational by nature. The majority of them do not require
candidates running for offices to provide clear-cut economic
programs. In fact, the people are even slightly irritated, as opinion
polls show, when a candidate is too intelligent -- or at least more
intelligent than the mass. At the same time, Russian people love
macho -- they love brutality, demonstrations of strong-handed
policies and tough moves made for show.</TE>
<TE>   I am sure Putin and the new team of spin doctors being knocked
together to run the 2004 presidential campaign are saving "peace in
Chechnya" as a tidbit for that campaign. A "strong Putin" will again
be shown as a person who had the guts to launch the war even before
he became president, as the president who allegedly broke
international terrorism in the North Caucasus and, finally, as
someone who managed to "make peace," no matter how hard it was to
initiate peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   In this scenario, one can expect first a sharp deterioration of
the situation in Chechnya in 2003. It will be Putin crushing the
"backbone of international terrorism." It means even more large-scale
and severe "mopping-up" operations, bombing, shelling, looting,
people abducted and disappearing without a trace, jackbooted pressure
on the civilian population. The ideological foundation for this
cruelty will be presented as a "hard-edged war against international
terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   For journalists, covering the current Chechnya war was bad even
before now, with the authorities harshly and illegally limiting
journalists' capabilities. Now the authorities will do the same thing
with the help of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, both chambers of parliament almost unanimously passed
amendments to the federal law on the "fight against terrorism" that
ban any criticism of the Kremlin leadership's policies in Chechnya,
under the threat of criminal liability and imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   The amendments strip journalists of the right to cover the war the
way they see it. The administration brackets almost the entire
Chechen people as bandits and terrorists, without sparing even
children. And if "mopping-up" operations in Chechnya are described in
the media as what they really are -- punitive military operations to
kill and torture people -- such reporting, according to the new
legislation, can be interpreted as "resistance to the
counter-terrorist operation, propaganda and/or justification of the
terrorist cause."</TE>
<TE>   The essence of the new amendments is that the actions of the
elected authorities are removed from the control of the public. This
is something that we saw in Soviet times, and we know the
consequences perfectly well. The examples are the war in Afghanistan
and the ruined and ineffective Soviet economy that is still felt in
the total poverty of half of the population.</TE>
<TE>   But Putin needs to get reelected.</TE>
<TE>   This is the sad background against which in 2004 Putin will be
presented to the Russian public as the "peacemaker." And the people
will believe it. Heartily acclaiming him, they will reelect him. But
will the real situation in Chechnya change? Of course not.</TE>
<TE>   Putin's creed doesn't change. The war will continue to reproduce
terrorism, pushing the younger generation in Chechnya to become more
and more radical. What awaits us is the Israeli option, where every
Palestinian sitting next to you on a bus is feared.</TE>
<TE>   This is exactly the "peace" that the "pragmatic" Putin regime has
got in store for us, no earlier than 2004.</TE>

<HD>Back of the Hand to Those Who Gave So Much</HD>
<DH>Elderly veterans find government promise is empty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Turley</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a law professor at George Washington
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may be one of the cruelest bait-and-switches in history. At issue
is a promise by the government to World War II and Korean War
veterans that their health-care benefits would be guaranteed for
life.</LD>
<LD>   Now that this bill has come due, the government has reneged and
said it is not legally bound to make good on its promise.</LD>
<LD>   One of these veterans is Robert Reinlie, who had more than 30
missions in a B-17 bomber over Europe during World War II. He flew
through walls of German flak and antiaircraft fire to survive in one
of the war's most hazardous duties. Now, at 81, he is fighting his
own government in court, and this time he is losing.</LD>
<TE>   A federal court of appeals in Washington ruled last  week that
although a promise was made by the government, it was a promise that
could legally be broken. The court ruled that the loss was
significant for these veterans and that the breach of the promise was
shocking. Yet it could not force the government to act morally.</TE>
<TE>   This controversy began near the end of World War II, when the
military was struggling to keep veterans in its ranks. A war against
the Soviet Union was viewed as almost inevitable, and the government
needed veterans like Reinlie.</TE>
<TE>   So it made a promise: If military personnel would serve at least
20 years, they would receive free lifetime medical care for
themselves and their dependents.</TE>
<TE>   Tens of thousands of veterans responded and soon found themselves
fighting in Korea against waves of Chinese soldiers. They had made a
promise to serve, and this was a generation that was taught to keep a
promise, even at the cost of one's life.</TE>
<TE>   The government has never denied that it made this promise.
However, in 1995 the Clinton administration was looking for things to
cut out of a budget to fund greater priorities, like politically
popular subsidies and transportation projects. Government lawyers
soon realized that, even though a promise was made, the only thing
preventing Washington from reneging was a moral commitment.</TE>
<TE>   In our government, this made it an easy decision.</TE>
<TE>   The government informed all veterans over 65 (by definition all of
the World War II and Korea veterans) that they would have to seek
medical care from Medicare. Though they could request free care from
military hospitals, they were given the lowest priority for such care
and usually were turned away because of the downsizing of military
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, most had to purchase supplemental policies, which
could cost hundreds of dollars a month. Many of these veterans,
almost all in their 80s and 90s, cannot afford the additional cost
for the health care that they were promised would be covered.</TE>
<TE>   While fighting the veterans in court, the Clinton and Bush
administrations secured billions of dollars in pork-barrel projects,
special-interests breaks and subsidies from a willing Congress -- a
Congress that recently appointed a committee to expand its own
taxpayer-funded health club and recreation facilities. Many members
of Congress apparently believe that the Battle of the Bulge refers to
their own selfless struggle against unsightly weight gain.</TE>
<TE>   The hypocrisy of our government was never clearer than this month
on Veterans Day. While these politicians were using World War II
veterans as human props, government lawyers were in court stripping
them of their benefits. While officials waxed poetic about the "debt
that we owe and can never repay" this greatest generation, the
administration was busy contesting any legal obligation to pay at
all.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Washington had to rush to guarantee an insulting end
to the lives of those who gave so much to so many. World War II
veterans are dying at the rate of 1,200 a day.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the government is acting consistently with its past.
In 1932, more than 20,000 veterans of World War I camped out in
Washington demanding promised bonuses from Congress. The government
sent in tanks under the command of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who
viciously attacked with heavily armed troops and burned their
makeshift camp to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   So now our politicians are busy sending off a new generation of
young Americans to fight in our name. We have promised them much, and
politicians have again professed undying support for them and their
families. Meanwhile, the government is trying to quickly dispatch one
generation of veterans before the first of the new generation of
wounded come home.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the dwindling number of World II veterans will still be
sought out by these same politicians for photo ops every Veterans Day
and pushed to the front of the parade. They just have to watch their
step; if they trip and break a hip, they are on their own.</TE>

<LD>Some smart humans with pleasant scents and a largely incomprehensible
vocabulary have determined that over thousands of years their
species, through domestication and interaction, changed the genetics
of what would become canines. The scientists, who have only two legs,
just reported their serious findings in the journal Science. They
believe that humans changed wolves -- rescuing them from a cold
forest life of surviving paw to mouth -- by bringing these canny
creatures into the warmth of a house as domesticated dogs with their
own toys, soft beds and biscuit treats they needn't share.</LD>
<LD>   The Science research suggests it was humans' idea to serve meat in
a bowl to former wolves who once had to chase dinner. Now, this
retired wildlife sleeps around the house whenever it wants. The
scientists say dogs have learned to read human looks, gestures and
sounds; even puppies know how to do this from birth.</LD>
<LD>   We can report exclusively here that this news -- considered
hilarious in dogdom -- is traversing the globe through bouts of coded
barking from one backyard to another. Although dog dialects and
accents differ by region, the rough translation of these canine
messages is: "It's still working perfectly. They think they're
training us!"</LD>
<TE>   Humans' uncanny ability to learn from dogs was, like many
important advances, discovered by accident. Legend says that
thousands of years ago a portly dog seeking a workout one cold
morning delivered a stick to an idle human. Instantly, the human knew
the trick. He tossed the stick away. The dog brought it back. The
human threw it away. Again and again. Even when the dog fetched a
different stick, the human knew to toss it.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, other animals have deciphered human learning patterns.
Even illiterate ducks have successfully trained humans frequenting
parks. The ducks walk up, ask for bread and tilt their heads,
waiting. Well-trained humans know to stop and drop large quantities
of bread crumbs.</TE>
<TE>   Training humans requires time -- and patience. Sure, all it took
was little puppy licks for humans to learn baby talk. But generations
of whimpering passed before humans finally began cloaking cold floors
in carpets. Humans encountering each other still don't get the
sniffing protocol. And despite centuries of example by all breeds
during morning and evening walks, humans still haven't learned where
to do their business, though most know now to clean up after the dog.</TE>
<TE>   A growing cadre of conservative canines holds that humans, though
adorable when children, are stubborn and quite simply untrainable as
adults. According to this orthodox interpretation of the
stick-tossing legend, the dog who discovered humans' apparent
capacity for learning was not seeking exercise. He was cold in the
cave and intended the stick for the fire.</TE>

<HD>Argentine Children's Plight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Maria Rosa Gomez died Nov. 11 at the children's hospital in Tucuman,
a city in northern Argentina, She was 6 years old and weighed 18
pounds. Her malnourished brothers, Pablo and Juan Facundo, were in
the same hospital. In a country as historically rich as Argentina,
this might normally be described as an isolated case of horrible
child abuse. But 52 more malnourished children are in the same
hospital, say local news reports, and Tucuman is not the only place
where this is happening in economically distressed Argentina.</LD>
<LD>   In Catamarca, a nearby province, the staff of the Eva Peron
hospital report that they can hardly keep up with the more than 600
children ages 2 to 6 who have come to its doors suffering from
malnutrition. The same thing is happening in the Rio Negro, Neuquen,
Chubut and La Rioja provinces.</LD>
<LD>   Undernourishment of children has long been a critical problem in
Latin America. But not, until recently, in Argentina, a major grain
and beef exporter with a reputation as South America's breadbasket.
In much of the 20th century, Argentina was a wealthy land of
opportunity, second choice for poor European immigrants after the
United States. In the last two decades, however, unscrupulous,
irresponsible politicians obsessed with winning reelection have been
on a spending rampage that has drained the country's resources.</LD>
<TE>   How is it possible, Argentines wonder, in a country that is the
world's fifth-largest exporter of agricultural products, that
children with swollen bellies and emaciated faces are rushed to
hospitals in a desperate effort to save their lives?</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gabriela Lopez Romano of Tucuman's children's hospital places
blame on the local politicians. "They are shameless. They steal the
money that comes from the federal government to fund social programs
for the needy." The respected newspaper La Nacion has picked up the
doctor's accusations in demanding a federal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   An August report by Transparency International, an independent
watchdog group that surveys corruption in 102 nations, also singled
out Argentina for criticism. The Argentine state, says the report, is
"captured by a network of leaders who misuse it in the service of
their business and political interest." Argentina is in the middle of
an economic crisis, one that is surely aggravated by investor
wariness of government corruption. But even at its worst, Argentina
should be able to feed its children.</TE>

<HD>Fast Health Reform for L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comprehensive health-care reform has seemed like a perverse joke ever
since the Clinton reform plan crashed in the early '90s. But a report
released by the National Academy of Sciences last week, concluding
that "the health-care delivery system is incapable of meeting the
present, let alone the future, needs of the American public," shows
how the Bush administration can begin reforms on its own now, without
giving congressional infighting a chance to defeat change.</LD>
<LD>   The report urges Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G.
Thompson to swiftly launch "demonstration projects" that give half a
dozen counties or states freedom from rigid Medicare and Medicaid
funding rules to let them "remove barriers to innovation and ... put
in place incentives that will encourage redesign and sustain
improvements." In return, these regions would be expected to
automatically enroll some uninsured people in the pilot projects --
for example, by letting all members of a family enroll in a plan now
restricted to children.</LD>
<LD>   The danger is not that Thompson will ignore the academy's report.
It was he, after all, who commissioned it. Rather, the danger is that
he will use it as fodder to support the administration's knee-jerk
cure-all for most budget problems: privatization.</LD>
<TE>   The L.A. County health department's director, Dr. Thomas
Garthwaite, is finishing a health-care reform plan that aims to make
better use of taxpayer dollars. His proposal includes creating a
paperless health-care system that tracks the cost-effectiveness of
each treatment offered to patients. It would also increase the use of
preventive-care experts like "intensivists," who are trained to spot
signs of pneumonia and other life-threatening complications before
they take hold. These measures would reduce hospital stays and help
trim the $1.8 billion Americans spend annually on intensive care. Not
to mention save lives.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush official who would be in charge of the new projects,
Medicare and Medicaid Director Tom Scully, should be falling all over
himself to support the Garthwaite plan, which within its reforms
includes the very changes the academy is calling for. However, Scully
has been lambasting the Garthwaite plan as a "special deal" that
would require him to "just write them a check and bail [Los Angeles
County] out."</TE>
<TE>   Scully has instead been urging the county to at least partially
privatize some of its hospitals. What he doesn't say is that
privatization is full of dangers because it gives health-care
providers numerous incentives to "game" the system and offers few
rules to prevent them from the most egregious sorts of profiteering
at patients' expense.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of forcing it to privatize, Scully should make L.A.
County, the epicenter of the nation's health-care crisis with more
than 2 million uninsured people, the administration's first
demonstration project.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration should focus not on forcing ideological
solutions upon regions, but rather on enabling counties to begin
practical and moderate reforms to make their health-care systems work
fairly and effectively for all -- the very reforms outlined in the
academy study.</TE>

<LD>If we must have political parties then, clearly, it is time for a new
one. The Republicans have been co-opted by the radical, increasingly
fascist and un-American right representing nothing but their own
desire to wield unfettered power and the interests of their morally
bankrupt megabuck supporters. The Democrats have become a vaporous
nonentity consisting of disparate, equally corrupted self-servers and
fragments of diverse "me, me, mine" groups.</LD>
<LD>   We need the honest and courageous from both these parties to come
forward and create a new center before we end in disaster. America
needs a new political coalition that will represent the genuine
well-being of all the people and the planet. We need courageous
political leaders who will not be bought, who will stand for the
greater good and refuse to bow before the extremists in both parties.</LD>

congressional seats; when we have an eclectic mix of honest citizens
offering themselves for election; when we have statesmen seeking high
office instead of the current crop of grubby politicians, then I
shall vote again enthusiastically. For now, it is a waste of time.</TE>

work. Although I have voted in every major city and national election
and given financial contributions, the activism lay dormant. The
latest election results should have been a wake-up call not only for
the Democratic National Committee and politicians but for the rest of
us too.</TE>
<TE>   I hope that others will join me in recommitting ourselves toward
ensuring that those things that we are passionate about (choice, the
environment, education) do not get trampled by the conservatives
swinging their banners from the right.</TE>

<LD>Ruth Lilly's donation of $100 million to a poetry magazine is truly a
selfish act (Nov. 19). Instead of giving her money to those who could
truly benefit from it -- such as those who can't afford the drugs her
namesake pharmaceutical company sells -- she has chosen to lavish a
huge endowment on a magazine that prints some poetry. There is no way
in the world that this magazine could ever need that much money. A
gift of $1 million would have been more than enough to ensure that
her cherished Poetry magazine could keep on going.</LD>
<LD>   Lilly did not earn any of that money. She was born into great
wealth that came from hard-working men and women who paid good money
to buy the drugs from her family's company. By virtue of this gift
she has shown that she has no compassion for her fellow human beings.
It truly disgusts me. I call on Poetry magazine to turn down this
ridiculous gift and instead ask Lilly to set up a foundation to
distribute this $100 million to disabled Americans who cannot afford
their much-needed medications.</LD>

<HD>County's Misplaced Concern Over a Tree</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I find it extremely comforting to know that our county supervisors
have all their priorities in line. Mike Antonovich is willing to
spend time, media attention and $250,000 of a developer's funds to
replant a 400-year-old tree (Nov. 19), yet he cannot even feign
interest in the neediest of his human constituents ("County Urged to
Grant Reprieve to Rehab Center," Nov. 20). I attended the eye-opening
Board of Supervisors meeting last Tuesday. During the impassioned
speeches delivered by members of the Rancho Los Amigos community
regarding the board's decision to close the hospital, Antonovich and
other supervisors did not even have the common decency to pay
attention to the speakers.</LD>
<LD>   Not for a moment am I trying to make light of the importance of
saving the Santa Clarita oak tree. However, I would like to point out
that weighed against the prospect of saving human lives, all of the
attention being put on the plight of a single tree seems misplaced.</LD>

<TE>   Re Steve Lopez's darkly ironic column on tree-sitter John
Quigley's vigil in Santa Clarita, Nov. 20: His conclusion that we
deserve to lose that beautiful oak for our complacency and complicity
with developers is right on the money! If we drive through Santa
Clarita and shake our heads at the sprawl, yet do nothing, we are as
much to blame as Antonovich for "rolling over like a lap dog for
developers." And if we buy a house, and thereby encourage the
developers to keep their juggernaut rolling, we are similarly to
blame.</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't mean, however, that we don't have the right to call
for an immediate halt to the irresponsible destruction in the
northern part of our county. In fact, there's only one source of
dissent powerful enough to stop the destroyers of Santa Clarita, and
that's us, the generation of new suburbanites who helped create this
mess. Chalk it up to basic homeowners' rights, but if you buy a house
with a beautiful view, that view must be defended from sprawl. Don't
stand by while John Laing Homes and the Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co.
sell you out so they can sell more homes. And vote Antonovich out
next time he runs.</TE>

<TE>   The original, Nov. 15 news article reporting on the oak tree
stated that the developer did not want to remove the tree but was
being required to remove it by the county in order to widen Pico
Canyon Road. Yet the letters you published Nov. 20 berate the
developer for wanting to destroy the tree.</TE>

<TE>   If there is one thing we are passionate about in Santa Clarita
more than oak trees, it's roads. The only reason we have let our oak
tree passion take over from our road passion is that Pico Canyon Road
doesn't go anywhere. If the developer promised to build a Nordstrom
(our really serious passion) at the end of the road, the good
citizens of our fair town would have the tree-sitter out in no time.</TE>

<LD>It is indeed fortunate that the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected the
appeal of a prisoner who claims it is his right to procreate while in
prison (Nov. 19). This ruling should be applied to every prisoner,
whether he is serving a sentence of two years or a sentence of life
without the possibility of parole. If William Gerber, a life-term
inmate who wants to ship his sperm to his wife so she can conceive by
artificial insemination, is allowed to do this, just how does he
expect to raise his child?</LD>
<LD>   Can he expect a prison guard to drive him home every day so he can
be a father, and drive him back at night? Can Gerber expect his wife
and child to move into the prison with him? In either case, obviously
not. What Gerber and his fellow inmates need to learn, once and for
all, is that they are in prison for punishment.</LD>
<LD>   They also need to learn that they are not there to take a break
from society but, instead, so that society can take a break from
them.</LD>

Child Evangelism Fellowship has won a lawsuit allowing its members
free use of campus facilities for after-school meetings.</LD>
<LD>   I hope that this group will not perpetuate the misguided ideas
prevalent in our Western society about color. According to the
article, the teacher displayed a multicolored floppy top hat. In
describing the meanings of each color, she explained that "black
represents sin" and "white means clean from sin." As a black person,
I resent this implication.</LD>

<LD>"Crackdown Demanded on Skid Row Camps" (Nov. 19) states that some
agencies that provide services to the homeless denounced our plan,
saying that "it was merely another attempt to sweep the streets of
homeless people who have nowhere else to go." In fact, our plan
specifically calls for an anti-street encampment ordinance in
conjunction with providing a shelter bed for every person removed
from an encampment.</LD>
<LD>   Another so-called homeless advocate stated that "most addicts and
mentally ill are not service-resistant," they just don't want to
abide by the rules at shelters. This is exactly the problem we are
attempting to rectify -- a city policy that allows individuals to
refuse to go to a shelter when beds are available because they don't
like the "rules" that prevent them from abusing drugs or alcohol. We
believe that the city should stop enabling self-destructive behavior
and, instead, help people get the services that they need and
deserve.</LD>

"public health and safety catastrophe." And it's not just on skid
row.</TE>
<TE>   Walking the short distance from the train station to my office
building, I have held my breath to avoid the acrid smell of urine
that permeates this place and averted my eyes from the sight of human
feces piled on the sidewalk. Walking back from lunch, I've witnessed
a man urinating against the side of a building and reported it to a
public safety officer, who responded with a shoulder shrug and not
much more. I've feared for my safety when a panhandler, who was
displeased that he did not get any money, followed me down the street
shouting obscenities.</TE>
<TE>   Enough is enough. I applaud the Central City Assn.'s efforts to
take back the streets. I encourage City Council members Jan Perry and

<HD>Lynda Van Devanter, 55; Vietnam Nurse Told Harrowing War
Story</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lynda Van Devanter, an Army surgical nurse in Vietnam whose
autobiography focused attention on women's struggles with post
traumatic stress syndrome and chemicals including Agent Orange, has
died. She was 55.</LD>
<LD>   Van Devanter, whose 1983 book "Home Before Morning" inspired the
1988-91 television series "China Beach," died Nov. 15 at her home in
Herndon, Va. The cause was systemic collagen vascular disease, which
she had attributed to her exposure in Vietnam to chemicals including
the defoliant Agent Orange.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the Vietnam Veterans of America said the
organization will pursue an Agent Orange claim against the government
on behalf of Van Devanter's daughter, Molly.</LD>
<TE>   Van Devanter was the founding executive director of the Women's
Project of the Vietnam Veterans of America from 1979 to 1984,
testifying before Congress and other government agencies on behalf of
the 7,465 women Vietnam veterans.</TE>
<TE>   She joined the 71st Evacuation Hospital in Pleiku, South Vietnam,
after telling herself: "If our boys were being blown apart, then
somebody better be over there putting them back together again. I
started to think that maybe that somebody should be me."</TE>
<TE>   But the idealism spiraled downward quickly amid the constant gore,
noise, fear and fatigue of war, and would lead after her return home
to recurring nightmares of one of her patients, a teenage soldier
whose face had been blown away.</TE>
<TE>   The nurse's highly successful book, which described doctors and
nurses indulging in drugs, alcohol and sex to ease the horror of what
they saw on their operating tables, opened new dialogues about
women's problems in war. But it also sparked criticism from a group
called Nurses Against Misrepresentation that spread from the Pentagon
to Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The opponents were led by Patricia L. Walsh, a civilian nurse in
Vietnam, who had published a fictional account of her experience,
"Forever Sad the Hearts," in 1981. That book was being considered as
a motion picture for Cher at the same time actress Sally Field
optioned Van Devanter's book for a film. (Neither movie materialized,
but CBS developed "China Beach," starring Dana Delany, based partly
on Van Devanter's book.)</TE>
<TE>   Walsh and other nurses opposed any "Home Before Morning" film,
Walsh told The Times in 1987, because "we know the power of Hollywood
[and] we didn't want what was in Van Devanter's book to be put on the
screen. She portrayed medical teams in an utterly disgusting fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "She wrote about a neurosurgeon who abused drugs and alcohol and
about euthanasia and about GI bodies decomposing in a morgue. And
about a nurse and surgeon who fell into bed together -- covered with
blood from the operating room. Well, those things didn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Van Devanter responded to The Times then: "In Vietnam, some of us
did things that we were not so proud of at the time. But we were
under enormous stress -- physically, emotionally and spiritually....
The fact is, my book is not about sleazy people -- it's about people
who have been through an insanity. It's about attempts to find a
moment of sanity in the midst of that."</TE>
<TE>   Her book, written with Christopher Morgan, earned generally good
reviews, including one in Business Week stating:</TE>
<TE>   "As one of thousands of forgotten women Vietnam veterans, she has
had special burdens to bear in her long effort to 'come home'
emotionally. With intelligence and grim humor, her book describes her
stint, at 22, as an Army nurse in 1969 and 1970 -- for her a year of
transition from middle-class idealist to battle-scarred cynic. Her
gruesome ordeal did not end with a return to civilian life. Van
Devanter's ongoing struggle to overcome grotesque 'flashback'
hallucinations, a drinking problem, an unstable personal life, and
the unique stigma of being a female veteran evokes sympathy and
admiration. Her story demands respect and provides a view into an
American netherworld still too often ignored."</TE>
<TE>   Born one of five daughters in a Catholic family in suburban
Washington, D.C., Van Devanter earned a bachelor's degree in
psychology at Antioch University and her nursing degree at Mercy
Hospital School of Nursing in Baltimore. After her wartime service,
she had a few jobs as a civilian nurse, including at Torrance
Memorial Hospital in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, she descended into uncontrolled drinking and crying,
and was on unemployment, food stamps, then welfare, and in therapy
but still unable to discuss Vietnam.</TE>

<HD>Ward Munson, 92; Businessman, Philanthropist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ward Munson, a Southern California sporting goods magnate and
philanthropist who helped organize the Japanese surrender ceremony
aboard the U.S. battleship Missouri that ended World War II, has
died. He was 92.</LD>
<LD>   Munson, who lived in a retirement community in Fullerton, died
Nov. 16 of heart failure while flying home from a goodwill tour of
China with business and community leaders.</LD>
<LD>   On Sept. 2, 1945, it was up to Munson, then a Navy lieutenant and
part of the battleship's small protocol committee, to ensure that
every member of the historic assembly -- from Gen. Douglas MacArthur
and Fleet Adm. Chester W. Nimitz to Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru
Shigametzu down to the lowest ranking sailor -- was standing in the
right place for the peace signing.</LD>
<TE>   "When it was announced that the Japanese delegation was aboard
there was a dead silence and all you could hear was the sound of
Shigametzu's wooden leg as he climbed the plank ... ," Munson told
The Times in 1995, before a 50th anniversary ceremony aboard the
Missouri in Bremerton, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Munson recalled in that interview and in various speeches that the
Missouri was preparing for the planned invasion of Japan's home
islands in the fall of 1945 when the atomic bombs dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki forced Japan to surrender.</TE>
<TE>   "We were ecstatic with joy," he said. "Everyone wanted to get the
war over with and get home to our families. But we also knew that the
dropping of the bomb was going to change the world, as it has."</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Munson collected vintage photographs and wartime
memorabilia for 50 years before donating them to the Missouri, which
is now a museum.</TE>
<TE>   He was among the honorees at the Missouri's decommissioning and
then recommissioning in 1986 and rode to San Diego on board in 1991
before the battleship fired the first offshore bombardment shots in
the Gulf War. He also attended the 1999 dedication of the Missouri as
a memorial permanently anchored near the U.S. battleship Arizona in
Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Wolverine, Mich., Munson was 5 when he moved with his
family to Azusa, where his father was a rancher, builder, and city
treasurer and tax collector. Munson earned a degree in rhetoric at UC
Berkeley in 1932. It was the height of the Depression, and the degree
failed to attract any job offers.</TE>
<TE>   He drove an oil truck, worked on a construction site, operated a
gas station, and then rode the rails hobo-style to Chicago to sell
orange juice at the Chicago World's Fair. He eventually landed a
sales job with Procter &amp; Gamble, and remained with the company until
the war.</TE>
<TE>   In 1946, Munson and his late wife, Alice, started a wholesale
sporting goods business in their 400-square-foot Azusa garage. Munson
Sporting Goods moved to Costa Mesa in 1972. By the time Munson sold
the company in 1981, staying on as board chairman and then
consultant, he had built it into the leading wholesale distributor of
fishing, hunting, camping, marine and athletic equipment to retail
stores in the 10 Western states.</TE>
<TE>   Munson was named Southern California small businessman of the year
in 1973 by the federal Small Business Administration, and in 1974 was
chosen as outstanding businessman in the Western states by the
National Council for Small Business Management Development. Munson
also was president of the Southern California Sports Council and the
National Assn. of Sporting Goods Wholesalers.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two decades, Munson devoted his attention largely to
philanthropy. Deciding to give away half his wealth, he endowed
scholarships at UC Berkeley, built a chapel at Azusa Pacific
University and made major donations to Citrus College, Azusa Youth
Program, San Gabriel Valley YMCA, Union Rescue Mission in Los
Angeles, World Vision, the Salvation Army and Norman Vincent Peale's
Center for Christian Living.</TE>
<TE>   He volunteered as readily as he wrote checks, either donning an
apron to serve food in soup kitchens or helping make administrative
decisions. As a longtime member of the board of trustees at Azusa
Pacific University, he persuaded the board to build -- and made the
first donation for -- a new dormitory after students invited him to
spend a night and experience their crowded living conditions
first-hand.</TE>
<TE>   Munson also served on the boards of the Orange County chapters of
the Salvation Army, Council of Boy Scouts of America, Economic
Development Corp., Goodwill Industries/Helmsmen and Big Brothers and
Big Sisters.</TE>
<TE>   He was a former local president and district governor of Rotary
International and a benefactor of the Rotary Foundation. Fellow
Rotarians accompanying the wealthy Munson on his China trip said he
flew coach, commenting that "we can provide the polio vaccine for
12,000 children for the cost of [an] upgrade."</TE>
<TE>   Munson is survived by his second wife, Sandy; two daughters,
Colleen and Rosemary; sister, Dottie; seven grandsons; and a
granddaughter. Munson's first wife died of cancer in 1995, and their
son, Kelly, died of cancer in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that any memorial contributions be sent to
the Munson Family Foundation, 5753-G E. Santa Ana Canyon Road #199,
Anaheim Hills, CA 92807.</TE>

<HD>Dr. Victor Herbert, 75; Experimented on Self to Prove
Anemia Link</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Victor Herbert, 75, whose experiments on himself linked a
shortage of folic acid to a type of anemia, died Tuesday in New York
City of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   While conducting research at Harvard University four decades ago,
Herbert began to doubt the prevailing view that anemia caused by a
folic-acid shortage was limited to alcoholics who did not eat
properly and to people with digestive disorders.</LD>
<LD>   Herbert began a diet that included no folic acid, which is found
in fruits and leafy vegetables. Within about seven months, he
developed mild megaloblastic anemia, a condition that causes fatigue,
headaches and diarrhea.</LD>
<TE>   The experiment is credited with establishing the link. Today,
megaloblastic anemia is recognized as a global problem. In 1998, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration began requiring that folic acid be
added to all food grains.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert was born in New York City and earned his bachelor's in
chemistry at Columbia University. He later earned an MD there as well
as a law degree. He served as a medical officer in the Army during
World War II.</TE>

<DL>COLLEGE STATION, Texas</DL>
<LD>With a burst of flame answered by a deafening roar from the crowd, an
unsanctioned Texas A&amp;M University bonfire sprang to life Sunday
night, rekindling a tradition on hold since a deadly collapse that
killed 12 people in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   A group of current and former A&amp;M students calling themselves
Unity Project unofficially resurrected the event.</LD>
<LD>   "It's great to have it come back," said sophomore Samuel Rogers,
24.</LD>
<TE>   Several thousand current and former students gathered in a
darkened field about 10 minutes east of College Station for the
lighting.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me sad, but a good kind of sad," said senior Audra
Forcht, 21. "You can't explain the importance of this tradition."</TE>

<HD>Ridge's Time in Trenches Makes Him Battle-Ready</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper and Richard T. Cooper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Of all the occupations that fill out Tom Ridge's resume --
prosecutor, congressman and governor of Pennsylvania among them --
perhaps none more qualifies him to become America's first secretary
of Homeland Security than this: combat veteran.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since President Bush proposed creating the department, a
messy amalgam of 22 agencies and their 170,000 employees, old
political hands have warned of a clash of bureaucratic cultures and
intergovernmental turf wars.</LD>
<LD>   But today, when Bush signs the bill creating the Department of
Homeland Security, the strapping 6-foot-3 Ridge will be right there
with him as his choice for secretary.</LD>
<TE>   Ridge, 57, brings more to the job -- regularly described as
requiring an encyclopedic mind and a biblical personality -- than his
Bronze Star, which he earned for valor in combat in Vietnam. He also
has 13 months of experience as the first director of the White House
Office of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   Not that this always was considered an asset. In his first months
in the ill-defined, some said toothless, position, Ridge collected
more bruises than medals.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, the same administration officials who long were
rumored to have been considering practically everyone but Ridge say
he is battle-tested and fully qualified for the post, which requires
Senate confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge has lived through a lot since he was sworn in as Bush's
homeland security advisor on Oct. 8 of last year -- a day after the
United States began bombing Afghanistan and three days after the
first of what would be five anthrax-related deaths. But many question
how much safer the country is now, and whether the new department --
which includes neither the FBI nor the CIA -- can succeed in
overcoming the intelligence failures that preceded the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge's aides, however, express confidence in the government's
ability to protect Americans. They point to the response to last
month's audiotape statements from Al Qaeda leaders, which warned
vaguely of renewed attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and CIA warned that the likelihood of new terrorist
attacks had risen. But Ridge, arguing that warnings were of no value
if they did not influence what people did, took control of the threat
advisory system and established new guidelines for action, his staff
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He pulled all the agencies together and said the time for issuing
warnings without actions was over," said Gordon Johndroe, Homeland
Security spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Just because threat information was not specific enough to raise
the alert status did not mean preparations didn't need to be made,
Ridge told officials from various agencies.</TE>
<TE>   So he set up and ran meetings and conference calls between top
government officials and operators of water treatment plants, energy
facilities, nuclear and chemical plants and other potential targets
to discuss immediate steps they should take to protect their
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   While no one, including Ridge, believes that launching the massive
Cabinet agency will be easy, the evidence suggests he will bring
significant assets to the job. His open, elbows-in style, his 12
years in the House and his experience as a two-term governor --
coupled with the strong support he's won from state and local
officials -- could all be sources of strength.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Ridge has never tackled a job so complicated.
But many in Congress are likely to give him the benefit of the doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "I like him. I respect him," said Democratic Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman of Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Paul C. Light, director of the Brookings Institution's Center for
Public Service -- who jokes that only Moses could handle the job --
also said that Ridge "has the toughness and the ability to do the
job."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia lawyer David Girard-diCarlo, a friend and GOP
powerbroker, says Ridge's low-key style can be deceiving. "He has
great humility" and listens to everyone, Girard-diCarlo said. But
once Ridge makes a decision, his friend added, he displays "a bulldog
determination to get things done."</TE>
<TE>   For Thomas Joseph Ridge, who was born on Aug. 26, 1945,
determination was part of survival. His father struggled to support a
growing family on a salesman's pay. When Ridge was born, his parents
lived in public housing.</TE>
<TE>   Although the family eventually had a small house of its own, Ridge
grew up knowing his father had sacrificed his own hopes of becoming a
lawyer for the sake of his children.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge attended Catholic schools, had a paper route -- it
reportedly took him three hours to make his collections because he
spent so much time visiting with the customers -- and became a
champion debater.</TE>
<TE>   From his mother, Ridge picked up a combative streak. When
schoolboy Ridge confessed to tearing his pants in a fight with a kid
who jeered at his religion, Ridge's mother said, "That's fine with
me. Go back and swing at him again."</TE>
<TE>   Ridge got into Harvard University on a scholarship, graduated with
honors and entered Penn State's law school. But he was soon drafted
into the Army.</TE>
<TE>   He came home from Vietnam with ears damaged by the noise of
artillery shells and needed a hearing aid. He finished law school,
spent 10 years in private practice and won a seat in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   If his family shaped his personality and values, his dozen years
in Congress gave Ridge the first experience that bears directly on
the challenges waiting at the Homeland Security Department. Like most
House members, he learned to dig into a subject and work for
compromises among entrenched interests.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Ridge's years in the House are very much of a plus," said
Indiana University political scientist Charles R. Wise. "He
understands what Congress can do, or refrain from doing, to make the
secretary's job easier, or make it anywhere from difficult to
impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James A. Leach (R-Iowa), who chaired the House Banking
Committee when Ridge was a member, says Ridge had a knack for getting
cooperation by being, above all, a straight-shooter. "He is an
exceptionally decent guy," Leach said. "I don't know anyone that
people would like more to give the benefit of the doubt to."</TE>
<TE>   The new secretary also will have to win the trust of the
transferred agencies and create an environment that encourages
openness, creativity and a readiness to leapfrog the bureaucratic
swamps.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush's White House homeland security advisor, Ridge worked hard
to address pockets of discontent. When he heard last summer that Rep.
Jane Harman (D-Venice) thought he was not getting enough done, he
invited her to breakfast and showed her his new operations center.</TE>
<TE>   He also has been an effective advocate for his mission. Early on,
Ridge formed a strategic alliance with the Office of Management and
Budget, which had retained its traditional budgetary control over the
agencies with homeland security functions.</TE>
<TE>   OMB Director Mitchell E. Daniels said that he and Ridge "put
together a little SWAT team." Ridge gathered information, negotiated
with the relevant federal agencies, as well as state and local
governments, and decided what should be done. Daniels' staff arranged
the budgeting details to make it happen.</TE>
<TE>   When several governors threatened to demobilize National Guard
troops at airports for lack of money, Ridge "cut through the legal
and funding issues to get these people paid for out of federal
dollars," Daniels said.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, the new secretary of Homeland Security must demonstrate
that the president is behind him.</TE>
<TE>   That will be crucial in dealing with congressional satraps, said
Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.). To persuade committee chairmen and others
to yield turf, the secretary must present this as "an overriding
national security mandate which has the support of the president."</TE>
<TE>   Ridge appears to have no problem there. His friendship with the
Bush family dates to his political service to Bush's father.</TE>

Robin Cochran contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Saudi Funds Raise New Fears on Hill</HD>
<DH>Lawmakers question whether other nations may be
unknowingly, or willingly, officially 'facilitating the next wave of
terror' in U.S.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With ties already strained between the United States and Saudi
Arabia, a growing number of congressional leaders stressed Sunday
that unresolved questions about money from the Saudi royal family
that ended up with two Sept. 11 hijackers "raises the stakes" that
future terrorists also may be getting help from other sources for yet
another attack in this country.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't have any reason to believe that there are not still
infrastructures of support and cooperation here inside the United
States facilitating the next wave of terror," Sen. Bob Graham
(D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on
NBC's "Meet the Press."</LD>
<LD>   The top Republican on the panel, Sen. Richard C. Shelby of
Alabama, agreed, saying that the FBI should "relentlessly pursue" the
trail of thousands of dollars that Saudi Princess Haifa al Faisal
apparently gave to the families of two Saudi men in San Diego. Those
men in turn provided financial assistance to two other Saudis in San
Diego who were hijackers on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   Shelby noted that the United States' relationship with Saudi
Arabia is not as warm today as in past years. "They have a lot of
oil. We need the oil. We've done a lot of things for them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But, if you look at the overall support of the so-called
charities that fund a lot of terrorist groups, they've got a lot of
answering to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi government acknowledged over the weekend that the
princess, who is married to Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi
ambassador to the United States, was making what she thought were
charity payments to a woman with serious medical problems.</TE>
<TE>   But it turned out that much of the money made it into the hands of
the woman's husband, Osama Bassnan, and a friend, Omar al Bayoumi.
Both men, who were neighbors in San Diego, befriended San Diego
hijackers Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi; Al Bayoumi helped them
relocate in San Diego and make their initial rent payments.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has said it has thoroughly investigated the matter and
concluded that the royal family was not intentionally trying to
assist any of the 19 hijackers, 15 of whom were Saudi citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the issue has raised fears on Capitol Hill on two
fronts: that Saudi Arabia is not completely in league with the United
States in the war on terrorism, and that other countries may be
unknowingly -- or even willingly -- officially supporting future
terrorist operations.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a leading member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee and a co-sponsor of legislation creating an
independent commission to investigate the terrorist attacks,
suggested on ABC's "This Week" that the Saudi royal family may be
going the way of the shah of Iran, who so alienated his people that
he eventually was forced from power.</TE>
<TE>   "The Saudis have been engaged in a Faustian bargain with the
radical Islamic fundamentalists for many, many years in order to stay
on the throne," McCain said. "And it is clear that huge amounts of
money have gone to [terrorist] organizations ... that take the kids
off the street, teach them to hate and destroy us.</TE>
<TE>   "And you know, like any Faustian bargain, it comes time to pay up.
And unless the Saudis change this, then I believe they will meet the
fate of the shah of Iran."</TE>
<TE>   He said the royal family should be pushing through changes that
bring more freedom to its people. "The Saudis have got to start on
the process of democratization," he said. "They've got to stop this
business of funding these radical Islamic organizations, which are
intent on destroying the West and the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), McCain's co-sponsor on the
Sept. 11 commission legislation, noted on CBS' "Face the Nation" that
President Bush's statement to the nations of the world -- "You're
either with us or with the terrorists, and if you're with the
terrorists, you will feel our wrath" -- should apply "not just to
enemies, like Iraq and Afghanistan under the Taliban or Iran ... [but
also] to our friends, like Saudi Arabia."</TE>
<TE>   "And either they have to change, or the relationship that we have
with Saudi Arabia is going to change dramatically," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Adel al Jubeir, the foreign policy advisor to Saudi Arabia's de
facto ruler, Crown Prince Abdullah, denied Sunday that the princess
had intentionally financed the hijackers and said his government
sharply decries any form of terrorism, whether it comes from within
its borders or from abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing on both "This Week" and "Face the Nation," he said that
the princess "is a very generous woman who goes out of her way to
help people in need" and that her charitable contributions only
indirectly made it to the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   For her part, the princess issued a statement Sunday: "My father,
King Faisal, was killed in a terrorist act in 1975. I find that
accusations that I contributed funds to terrorists outrageous and
completely irresponsible. This is the time for people to come
together to combat the scourge of terrorism so that others will not
suffer the loss of loved ones."</TE>
<TE>   Al Jubeir suggested that Bassnan and Al Bayoumi probably never
realized that Almihdhar and Alhazmi were terrorists when they
befriended them.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that Bassnan and Al Bayoumi had been investigated by
the FBI, and that Bassnan was deported to Saudi Arabia while Al
Bayoumi was briefly held by authorities in England.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think for a moment that if these people had [knowingly]
given money to terrorists, the FBI would have let them go?" Al Jubeir
asked.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi diplomat also strongly enunciated his government's stand
against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "We will do whatever it takes and we will follow every lead, as we
have in the past in this war on terrorism," he insisted on ABC. "If
there are any links between anybody and any terrorist organization,
we will pursue this vigorously.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be merciless when it comes to dealing with people who
support terrorism, I assure you of that."</TE>
<TE>   On the issue of ferreting out financing for future terrorist
plots, "there's a lot of investigation yet to be done," Graham said.</TE>
<TE>   He posed this central question: "Is there, inside the United
States, an infrastructure that provides support, financing, logistics
for the next generation of hijackers or other forms of terrorists who
are preparing for the next wave of assaults against the United
States?"</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the money flow from the Saudi princess to the San Diego
hijackers, he said that even if the link between the two was
nebulous, "it raises the stakes substantially of what the threat is
in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Shelby said that the question of how the Sept. 11 hijackers were
financed could provide valuable clues for uncovering future terrorist
plots.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to follow the money, because without money, the
terrorists would have a hard time ever being able to put together
these attacks," he said. "The money trail is the key."</TE>

<HD>New Crew Expected to Reach Space Station Today</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Space shuttle Endeavour chased after the international space station
Sunday, bringing a relief crew for its three longtime inhabitants.</LD>
<LD>   The astronaut who will take over as the space station's next
commander, Kenneth Bowersox, said it was hard to believe that he was
finally on his way after five years of training.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't wait," he said in an interview Sunday night. "I've seen
two or three sunrises during the last couple days and I can't believe
how many more I've got ahead of me. But I think every day is going to
be precious up here."</LD>
<TE>   Bowersox and the six others aboard Endeavour are expected to
arrive at the space station this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   American astronaut Peggy Whitson and Russian cosmonauts Valery
Korzun and Sergei Treschev have been aboard the space station for
almost six months. Their mission was supposed to last 4 1/2 months,
but after they moved in, all of the space shuttles were grounded
because of cracked plumbing. Then, Endeavour ran into other trouble
that further delayed liftoff, until Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Bowersox said he took advantage of the last two weeks of delay to
catch up on sleep, as did crewmate Donald Pettit.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour will spend a week at the space station and return to
Earth, with Whitson and her two crewmates, on Dec. 4.</TE>

<HD>Danger of Old Bombs Is Bigger, Group Says</HD>
<DH>Government reports understate the hazards of weapons buried
on former military sites, according to documents from
whistle-blowers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Miguel Bustillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government has understated the scale of the safety
problem posed by old bombs and chemical and biological weapons buried
at former military sites throughout the United States, including
three in California, according to documents disclosed by a group that
airs accusations from whistle-blowing bureaucrats.</LD>
<LD>   In one of the documents -- a private briefing paper for the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's new enforcement director, John
Suarez -- EPA officials stated that finding and removing the leftover
weapons "has the potential to be the largest environmental cleanup
program ever to be implemented in the United States." The more than
16,000 military installations containing unexploded ordnance cover an
area larger than Florida, the briefing paper said.</LD>
<LD>   Yet many of the sites have already been converted to civilian uses
despite the presence of bombs, and the Defense Department has been
taking "ill-advised shortcuts to limit costs" on many cleanups,
according to the paper, which was leaked along with other documents
by an EPA official to Public Employees for Environmental
Responsibility, a Washington-based group that shields whistle-blowers
and publicizes their claims.</LD>
<TE>   The group planned to release all of the documents today. They
include an early draft of an EPA survey on the unexploded munitions
problem that contained critical conclusions omitted from the final,
official draft, which was released two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The source of the documents "is someone in a position to provide
it," said Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for
Environmental Responsibility. He described his organization as an
"information Laundromat" that protects conscientious public servants
from retribution.</TE>
<TE>   Among the documents is an EPA survey of closed military bases in
2000 which found that more than half of the sites polled -- including
Ft. Ord on the Monterey Peninsula -- either had located chemical or
biological weapons or suspected that they were present.</TE>
<TE>   Ft. Ord previously reported that it had found such weapons on site
and, along with the Salton Sea Test Base in Imperial County and Mare
Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, reported the presence of unexploded
munitions.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials are conducting cleanups of all three California
sites. Ft. Ord, which was home to more than two dozen firing ranges
for decades, is now the site of the Cal State Monterey Bay campus.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA survey also found that the military had often used open
burning and detonation techniques to get rid of the munitions without
proper environmental permits, and that it had failed to erect fencing
or warning signs at half of the old sites still containing munitions,
even though many are near housing, parks and other civilian sites.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those findings were either modified or omitted from the
final EPA report, which was later made public, a comparison shows.
Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility said its source at
the EPA contends that the omissions were made under pressure from the
Department of Defense, which had paid for the survey. Defense
officials in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the findings on chemical and biological weapons,
the survey originally criticized methods that the Defense Department
has been using to determine how to clean up sites. It concluded that
the department has relied too heavily on statistical sampling to
determine the likely presence of bombs. The EPA draft said the
Defense Department also should have been examining records and
conducting more inspections of the old firing ranges.</TE>
<TE>   "At the ranges where statistical models were used, 91% of
recommendations that were generated were not acceptable to EPA,"
stated one portion of the survey omitted from the final draft. It
also concluded that the sampling, although more inexpensive, "may be
inadequate in protecting human health and safety."</TE>

<HD>Gore's Time Has Come and Gone on the Reshaping of America's
Families</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a safe bet that between presidential runs, Adlai Stevenson and
Richard Nixon never felt compelled to share with the American people
their views on how fathers should relate to their children or whether
elementary schools should cut down on the sweets at lunch.</LD>
<LD>   But that's exactly what Al Gore, the once and perhaps future
Democratic presidential candidate, has done in the new book he's
written with his wife, Tipper -- "Joined at the Heart: The
Transformation of the American Family."</LD>
<LD>   How you feel about that will probably go a long way toward
explaining how you feel about Gore overall. To Gore admirers, the
book will demonstrate an intelligence, curiosity and engagement that
many of them see lacking in the Oval Office's current occupant. Those
who don't like Gore, in both parties, will probably see the book as
proof that he's lost in the clouds, lost in the weeds or, in some
anatomical marvel, both.</LD>
<TE>   Both camps might agree that this is unlike any book ever written
by anyone thinking about running for president. It's not a memoir;
it's not a call to arms; it's not even much of a policy blueprint on
issues affecting families. Gore had plenty of recommendations on that
front from his 2000 campaign, but he passes over them lightly here.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the book is a combination of big-picture sociology on the
changing economic and social role of family over time, and
miniaturist portraits of 13 contemporary families diverse enough to
form their own rainbow coalition. Along the way, the Gores offer tips
for parents either from their own experience, or their take on the
work of experts in the field. Large chunks might have been written by
a friendlier Dr. Phil.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in an era when political allegiance is so heavily driven by
cultural attitudes, the book inevitably advances an underlying view
of the social changes remaking American family life. And it's a view
likely to drive social conservatives nuts.</TE>
<TE>   In the book, the Gores chronicle familiar changes in family life
over the last generation. The divorce rate, although stabilizing
lately, is twice as high as 40 years ago. More children are born out
of wedlock. More couples live together before marriage. Interracial
marriages are more common, as are openly gay couples living together,
and even raising children.</TE>
<TE>   To all this, the Gores largely say: fine. They're not enthusiastic
about the trends in family breakdown, but they are optimistic about
the ability of American families to fit the pieces together in ways
that work. "We believe," they write, "it is long past time to demand
an end to the narrow-minded condemnation of good families that happen
to be different."</TE>
<TE>   All this is the political text in this book. But there's a subtext
too: an assumption that understanding and responding to the daily
problems of ordinary families is an essential responsibility not only
of the federal government in general, but also of the president in
particular.</TE>
<TE>   After the Cold War ended, and George H.W. Bush lost a 1992
presidential race in which he appeared disconnected from daily life,
that was a widespread assumption. Bill Clinton focused more on the
routines of family life than any president before him, lavishing
attention not only on such big issues as education and children's
health care, but also on such secondary concerns as helping parents
monitor what their kids see on television.</TE>
<TE>   In his 2000 race, George W. Bush tilted in that direction too. He
campaigned in classrooms so much that he seemed to be running for
school board, and he presented his tax cut partly as a way for "moms
and dads" to work less and spend more time at home.</TE>
<TE>   Gore went even further than Bush. His agenda followed parents
through their day, from preschool and after-school programs to
expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act so that fathers and
mothers would have a federally established right to attend
teacher-parent conferences.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguingly, however, much of what the Gores portray in the new
book as the keys to successful families seems largely beyond the
reach of public policy. They talk about play, resilience,
communication, understanding, patience and simply a commitment to
spending more time together, even if that means less money.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week, I asked Gore whether writing the book
had raised or reduced his expectations about the ability of public
decisions to improve private family life. "Paradoxically, it's led me
to two different conclusions," he said. "One: The immediate cause of
most of the stresses and problems that we Americans face are things
we need to deal with personally and in our families. However, when
you pull back from the individual family situation and look at the
national pattern, the case is even more compelling for me that large
national trends have a profound influence on the chances for success
or failure that each individual family confronts.</TE>
<TE>   "For example," he went on, "the ability to earn a decent living
... while maintaining a sane balance between time spent in the
workplace and time spent with the family is one of the most important
factors facing virtually all of the families in the country. And
there are national policies that have a lot to do with whether or not
real wages go up or down."</TE>
<TE>   That answer is thoughtful and reasonable, as is most of the
analysis in the book. It's possible, however, perhaps even likely,
that voters will find the undeniable expertise Gore displays here
less relevant in 2004 than in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Americans seem less
interested in a president who will understand their ordinary stresses
than one who will protect them against extraordinary dangers. Voters
felt terrorism was now such a compelling priority that they
essentially gave Bush a pass this year -- even for the weak economy;
in such a world, it's not likely that they'll give Gore many points
even if they decide he has better ideas about balancing work and
home.</TE>
<TE>   This book doesn't appear designed to score political points
anyway, and Gore, if he runs, will likely have no shortage of ideas
on the traditional big tickets of presidential politics -- the
economy and national security. But his focus here seems to embody a
moment that has already passed. It would be nice if the president
could think intently every day about easing the intimate pressures
facing families. In a world where jumbo jets become bombs, however,
it's not clear that most Americans now believe the country can afford
that luxury.</TE>

<LD>There was one hot topic of discussion the day before college
basketball's Maui Invitational got underway.</LD>
<LD>   The Lahaina Civic Center is now air-conditioned.</LD>
<LD>   To those who have sat in a building filled with many more than the
listed capacity of 2,500, and under lights added for television, it
was good news.</LD>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe it when I heard about the air-conditioning,"
Massachusetts Coach Steve Lappas said. "I guess the heat was part of
the ambience of the tournament. But I'm glad it's going to be
cooler."</TE>
<TE>   Said Utah's Rick Majerus, making his third trip to the tournament:
"I sweated through my Aloha shirt big time both times, so I'm happy
for the air."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NBA single-game playoff record for most
minutes played without a turnover?</TE>
<TE>   Rip job: Jimmy Kimmel, in his weekly bit on "Fox NFL Sunday," did
a number on Howie Long. Kimmel pointed out that Long had said the
previous Sunday that McNabb had either broken a fibula or a broken
"tibula."</TE>
<TE>   Kimmel pointed out there is no such thing as a "tibula." "It's
tibia," Kimmel said.</TE>
<TE>   He then showed a diagram of a brain, followed by a diagram of
Long's head. It showed Long had a large ego under his skull and a
very small brain.</TE>
<TE>   Long seemed to take it all in good spirits.</TE>
<TE>   Pointless: Here's another example of a sideline interview with a
coach at halftime offering nothing. Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops, asked
by TBS' Craig Sager about putting up 25 points in the first half
against Texas Tech on Saturday, said:</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't that what we're supposed to do, put points on the board? We
plan on playing the second half too!"</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma, which led, 25-0, at halftime, won, 60-15.</TE>
<TE>   Good point: TBS play-by-play announcer Ron Thulin had his say
after players missed dousing Stoops with Gatorade:</TE>
<TE>   "Thank goodness. I'm ready for people to stop pouring things on
head coaches. ... The wave and throwing things on head coaches, let's
make them illegal."</TE>
<TE>   How about sideline halftime interviews as well?</TE>
<TE>   Ouch: Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle reports this
crack about the woes of the San Francisco 49er kicker from comedian
Bob Starlatte at a Big Game luncheon last week:</TE>
<TE>   "Who's going to get the Ax? Cal? Stanford? Jose Cortez?"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Dan Majerle, Phoenix, 59 minutes in a
triple-overtime game against Chicago on June 13, 1993.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Fox studio analyst Jimmy Johnson, on McNabb
continuing to play on his broken ankle:</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, [Coach] Andy Reid shouldn't be taking any heat.
There's a misconception about coaches making decisions on playing
injured players. Here's the process: If a player gets injured, he
goes to the team doctor for an examination. The team doctor then
makes a decision as to whether or not the player can or should play
and tells the trainer.</TE>
<TE>   "The trainer tells the coach, at which point the coach will talk
to the player."</TE>
<TE>   Retorted Long: "You could have eliminated that whole trilogy of an
explanation because all it really comes down to is, 'Can you go?' "</TE>

<HD>Clippers Don't Go Out on Rim</HD>
<DH>Piatkowski's shot with 1.4 seconds left beats Rockets,
90-89, with a little help from goaltending by Yao.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers gave away a 17-point lead Sunday afternoon, handling the
ball as if it were toxic and watching the one Houston Rocket who can
consistently score from the perimeter get loose again and again.</LD>
<LD>   Just when it threatened to get really embarrassing, a funny thing
happened.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers rallied and won.</LD>
<TE>   Eric Piatkowski's runner off the glass, and Yao Ming's fingertips,
with 1.4 seconds remaining gave the Clippers a 90-89 victory over the
Rockets before 16,876 at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Yao was whistled for goaltending, but the consensus at game's end
was that Piatkowski's shot, which danced on the rim, was going to
fall regardless.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in," Piatkowski said of the last of his 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was in the hole," Houston Coach Rudy Tomjanovich
agreed. "You've got to credit Piatkowski for making a tough shot."</TE>
<TE>   The Rockets had one more crack at a victory, but Steve Francis'
off-balance shot at the buzzer was off the mark. Francis had swished
a three-pointer over Andre Miller and Quentin Richardson to beat the
third-quarter buzzer and give the Rockets a 69-66 lead.</TE>
<TE>   As has become their method of operation, the Clippers (5-9) built
an early lead but couldn't hold it. They led by 17 points several
times, the last at 37-20 on Keyon Dooling's jump shot early in the
second quarter, and held a 48-34 advantage after Piatkowski made a
layup just before halftime.</TE>
<TE>   But the Clippers committed too many turnovers -- a whopping 23
that led to 24 points for the Rockets by game's end -- to maintain
their big lead. They also lost track too often of Houston's Glen
Rice, who scored 18 of his 23 points in the third quarter, and the
Rockets rallied into the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Houston (7-5) led by six, 89-83, after Rice dunked with 1:24 to
play, when the Clippers rallied. Miller scored on a drive, then made
one of two free throws. Actually, he made two, but was whistled for
stepping over the line on the first one.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi's seven-foot hook shot over Yao at the right
baseline brought the Clippers within 89-88 with 37.8 seconds left.
Yao, who had four points in 28 minutes, missed a hurried shot at the
other end.</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to get the ball to Elton [Brand]," Piatkowski said
of the final play.</TE>
<TE>   And with good reason. Brand scored a season-best 26 points on
nine-for-14 shooting and had 15 rebounds in 46 minutes of relentless
play.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rockets bottled up Brand on the Clippers' final possession
and, according to Piatkowski, "He was yelling at me, so I came off
the pick and Andre threw me the ball. I wasn't sure how much time was
left, but he yelled at me to shoot it, so it couldn't have been very
much."</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski's shot kissed the glass and rattled around on the rim
before it looked as if it would drop through. At the last possible
moment, Yao tipped the ball away, which is legal in international
play but forbidden in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the cheers of the fans, the Clippers still had to sweat
out the final 1.4 seconds. After all, they gave up James Posey's
winning jump shot at the buzzer Friday that capped the Denver
Nuggets' rally from a 16-point deficit in the fourth quarter. But
Francis, who had 31 points and 10 assists, couldn't connect.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a much-needed win for us," Coach Alvin Gentry said after
the Clippers won for the second time in seven games at Staples.
"Obviously, we've been struggling. I shouldn't say struggling. We've
played well in spurts."</TE>
<TE>   That has been the trouble for the Clippers in recent games in
which they have led entering the fourth quarter. Their bad patches
have happened late.</TE>
<TE>   "We found a way to win the game," Gentry said. "Hopefully, this
will springboard into something good for us. We played extremely hard
and we executed. The big thing was that we won. We haven't been a
very good home team. Hopefully, this gives us something to build on."</TE>

Yao and Then Before Sunday's
four-point effort against the
Clippers, 7-foot-5 rookie center Yao
Ming had been steadily improving and
starting to show why the Houston
Rockets made him the top pick in the
draft. Comparing Yao's numbers in his
first six games to his last six:

<LD>   What: The Official 2002 World Series videotape and DVD: "Heaven in
Seven"</LD>
<TE>   Producers: Major League Baseball Productions</TE>
<TE>   Price: $19.95</TE>
<TE>   Angel fans, new and old, here's the videotape and DVD you've been
waiting for. And it's quite a show, although all the producers really
had to do was follow the script. How could they miss?</TE>
<TE>   The scene is set with highlights from the regular season,
including the Angels' 6-14 start, Barry Bonds' achievements and the
Oakland Athletics' 20-game win streak. Then come highlights of the
first two rounds of the playoffs, including the Angels coming back
from a 6-1 deficit to defeat the New York Yankees, 9-6, in Game 3 of
the division series.</TE>
<TE>   Finally comes the nitty gritty -- a game-by-game review of a most
memorable seven-game World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The video is 100 minutes, and the DVD offers 30 minutes of bonus
coverage. A case could be made that the editing could have been
tighter. But there was a lot of ground to cover.</TE>
<TE>   The video and DVD include interviews from all the principals and
plenty of behind-the-scene shots. One particularly emotional moment
shows Tim Salmon and Jackie Autry, both drenched in champagne,
hugging in the Angel locker room.</TE>
<TE>   The video and DVD, which will premiere at a private screening
tonight, become available in stores Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Dolphins Have Power and Glory</HD>
<DH>Williams rushes for 143 yards and two touchdowns as Miami
rolls to a 30-3 victory over reeling Chargers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Just before the Miami Dolphins took the field for the second half
Sunday, running back Ricky Williams pulled aside quarterback Ray
Lucas and gave him a little reminder.</LD>
<LD>   "Remember," Williams said, "I'm a beast in the second half."</LD>
<LD>   That scouting tidbit was not lost on the San Diego Chargers, who
found him rather beastly in the first half as well. By game's end,
Williams would have his sixth 100-yard rushing game of the season --
a franchise record -- and the Dolphins (7-4) would send the Chargers
home in disgrace, 30-3.</LD>
<TE>   Williams gained 143 yards in 29 carries, scoring on runs of one
and 12 yards. And, like a lot of defenses this season, San Diego
players were chasing his braids all afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just a big man moving at a high rate of speed," Dolphin
guard Mark Dixon said. "Unless you've played against it, you can't do
it justice. You can talk about, 'We have to get more people to him.
We have to wrap up.' But when he hits it, it's a different sound than
anything else in the world. It's a totally different sound -- an
explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just so much power, right-now power. He gets his power right
on top of you before you can brace for it. I don't know how else to
explain it, but people are never ready for the hit. They're always
almost in position, and that's because he gets to them a step quicker
than they think."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a promising season is rapidly disintegrating for San
Diego (7-4), which has lost three of four and faces tough home games
against Denver and Oakland. The 2001 Chargers started 5-2, remember,
before losing nine in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "The key for us is to not start blaming each other and saying,
'Here we go again,' " safety Rodney Harrison said. "I think that
whole thing is out of our system. I don't think we have guys around
here that are saying, 'Uh oh.' There has been so much turnover on
this team, and, honestly, we're better than we were last year."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't always show. San Diego's defense, traditionally solid
even in the worst of seasons, has been remarkably shaky in recent
weeks. Miami gained 413 yards to San Diego's 144.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost the battle offensively up front, and we lost the battle
defensively up front," said Charger Coach Marty Schottenheimer, who
is 1-9 in games at Miami. "We didn't make any plays to stay on the
field, and we didn't make any plays to get them off the field.
Clearly, it was a very disappointing performance by our football
team."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help that the Chargers lost Pro Bowl cornerback Ryan
McNeil to an arm injury in the first quarter. That not only put extra
weight on the shoulders of rookie cornerback Quentin Jammer, it
limited the effectiveness of Harrison, maybe the league's best safety
when it comes to shutting down the run. With McNeil on the sideline,
Harrison had to think more about the pass and couldn't zero in on
Williams the way he normally might.</TE>
<TE>   "When Ryan leaves, you lose a leader, you lose a guy that makes
plays and a guy that really helps manage the secondary with me,"
Harrison said. "As much potential as Quentin Jammer has, he's still a
rookie."</TE>
<TE>   Lucas, looking far more comfortable and competent than he did in
recent games against Buffalo and Green Bay, completed 14 of 23 passes
and repeatedly threw in Jammer's direction.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego's Drew Brees was sacked three times, and the Dolphins
intercepted his opening pass, setting up the first of Olindo Mare's
three field goals.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers were stung by two calls in the third quarter, one
questionable and the other supported by replay. The controversial
call came on a Miami punt when Dolphin Scott McGarrahan hit returner
Reche Caldwell and knocked the ball loose, even though Caldwell had
signaled for a fair catch. The Dolphins recovered the muffed punt,
and officials ruled McGarrahan was shoved into Caldwell by Jammer.
Schottenheimer watched with an incredulous glare as the Dolphins took
over at the Charger 28 and scored four plays later.</TE>
<TE>   On the last play of the third quarter, James McKnight caught a
short pass in Dolphin territory as was falling, then climbed to his
feet before a Charger could get to him. He dashed down the sideline,
turning the play into a 77-yard gain before he was chased down at the
five by Jammer.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers challenged the call, arguing McKnight was down, but
officials took a look at the tape and determined the receiver's hand
was down when he was first touched, but not his knee.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about getting caught from behind, McKnight said: "The guys
are going to give me a hard time. They say I'm the fastest guy on the
team, but I'm always getting caught."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he could get some pointers from the beast, the guy who puts
the dread in dreadlocks.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't prepare for Ricky, especially the smaller guys on the
other side," Dolphin tackle Todd Wade said. "An arm tackle is not
going to do it. I think most of the DBs in the NFL fear Ricky more
than anything. They don't want to make that big tackle against that
guy."</TE>
<TE>   Wade lowered his voice and made a confession: Sometimes, he's a
spectator just like everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "As an offensive lineman, you want to be making those blocks
downfield," he said. "But once you look back and he's 10 yards past
you, you just start walking. I should be running ... but you just
want to watch him."</TE>

<HD>It's Time to Celebrate for Ohio State, for Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some hung over Ohio State fan in Columbus woke up in a cold sweat
Sunday morning with this nightmarish newsbreak playing in his head:</LD>
<LD>   This is Bob Bubblehead reporting LIVE for Buckeye Witness News in
Columbus: In a stunning development, Ohio State's invitation to the
Fiesta Bowl was rescinded yesterday after it was revealed Oklahoma
inexplicably passed Ohio State in the final bowl championship series
standings.</LD>
<LD>   Oklahoma, not 13-0 Ohio State, will play No. 1 Miami for the
national title in the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl. A BCS spokesman said,
looking back, he wasn't sure why the Fiesta Bowl invited Ohio State
to the national title game Nov. 23 when Oklahoma still had two games
to play and "everyone knows how wacky those BCS computers are." It
was learned a drastic change in the New York Times computer rankings
put Oklahoma over the BCS top. Oklahoma, No. 10 the week before Nov.
23, jumped to No. 1 in the last NYT ranking and that gave Oklahoma
the decimal point difference."</LD>
<TE>   Relax, Buckeye fans, it was only a dream, but you know what? I
thought the same thing Saturday night in Columbus not long after Ohio
State accepted the Fiesta Bowl bid following its 14-9 win over
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   It all seemed so official. John Junker, the Fiesta Bowl executive
director, was misty-eyed in the end zone at Ohio Stadium and even
formed a giant "0" with his arms as he stood near the Ohio State
band's tuba section. You'll have to forgive Junker; he's from Akron.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, in a sport in which two-loss Colorado missed a shot at the
national title last year by 0.05 of a point and Miami lost out a year
earlier by 0.32, how could anyone make any guarantees?</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way," Fiesta Bowl spokesman Shawn Schoeffler said
Sunday when asked about the possible Oklahoma surprise. "They [Ohio
State] are undefeated. They're so far ahead."</TE>
<TE>   True enough. Ohio State, No. 2 in last week's BCS standings, held
a 7.05 lead over No. 4 Oklahoma. But, with Washington State's loss,
the Sooners should move to No. 3 in today's BCS standings and pick up
poll points for moving into the spot vacated by Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   What if Oklahoma thrashed Oklahoma State and Colorado in its last
two games? Could they make up the gap on Ohio State?</TE>
<TE>   "I hope not," Schoeffler hedged, "but you never know."</TE>
<TE>   You hope somebody did the math on this before Ohio State Coach Jim
Tressel accepted the Fiesta Bowl bid.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeffler said the Fiesta Bowl received permission to take Ohio
State from Big East Commissioner and BCS coordinator Michael
Tranghese.</TE>
<TE>   John Paquette, the BCS' lead spokesman, confirmed Sunday that
Tranghese had given the Fiesta Bowl the go-ahead after determining
there was no way Ohio State could fall from No. 1 or No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   So there you have it, Buckeye fans. Not even the BCS nerds can
screw up this trip to the national title game.</TE>
<TE>   At least that's today's story.</TE>
<TE>   Scenarios Central</TE>
<TE>   OK, USC fans, let's start that eight-clap: U-rah, C-rah, L-rah,
A-rah.</TE>
<TE>   One advantage the BCS system has over a playoff is the strange
quirks it produces, such as the delicious prospect of USC rooting for
UCLA to beat Washington State on Dec. 7. A Bruin win sends USC to the
Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at the contenders in order of last week's BCS
standings.</TE>
<TE>   1. Miami: Plays at Syracuse this week and hosts Virginia Tech on
Dec. 7. Two wins and Miami takes on Ohio State for the national title
in the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   2. Ohio State: The only thing left to do before Tempe is pack the
Panama hats and golf clubs.</TE>
<TE>   3. Washington State: Saturday's three-overtime loss to Washington
knocks the Cougars out of the national title race, but a win over
UCLA puts Mike Price's team in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   4. Oklahoma: Will move to No. 3 in the BCS standings and can steal
a spot in Tempe if the Sooners win two games and Miami loses once.</TE>
<TE>   5. Georgia: Needs to win its last two games and hope Oklahoma and
Miami lose.</TE>
<TE>   6. Notre Dame: Can still get to the national title game if it
beats USC this week and Miami, Oklahoma and possibly Georgia lose.</TE>
<TE>   7. Iowa: The school is stuck in neutral, having played its last
game Nov. 16. The Hawkeyes are a longshot to make the Fiesta Bowl,
but the Rose Bowl is all but cinched.</TE>
<TE>   8: USC: Ready to play leapfrog? If USC beats Notre Dame this
weekend, the Trojans probably will jump over the Irish and Iowa to
No. 5. From there, all it takes is a Georgia or Oklahoma loss to get
the Trojans to No. 4, which would clinch a BCS at-large berth. Even
if USC loses to Notre Dame, it goes to the Rose Bowl if UCLA beats
Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   More to ponder: If USC gets to No. 4 in the BCS, and Iowa is the
clear-cut other at-large choice, 10-2 Notre Dame might get aced out
of a major bowl. We thought the Irish had lawyers to protect them
from things like this.</TE>
<TE>   It would be really galling if Notre Dame doesn't make it but that
school from Tallahassee does. Florida State, at 8-4, has clinched a
share of the Atlantic Coast Conference title and probably will get
the BCS berth. If the Seminoles lose to Florida next week, they could
be the first five-loss team to make a BCS game. And gee, didn't Notre
Dame sort of take Florida State to the shed this year?</TE>
<TE>   Washington State's loss all but assures the Pac-10 will be the
only major conference not to have placed a school in a BCS national
title game.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is the Pac-10 still can get two schools in BCS games
if Washington State goes to the Rose Bowl and USC earns an automatic
at-large berth.</TE>
<TE>   One man's minute-to-minute, ever-changing Heisman Trophy top five:
1. Willis McGahee (Miami), 2. Carson Palmer (USC), 3. Larry Johnson
(Penn State), 4. Ken Dorsey (Miami), 5. Brad Banks (Iowa).</TE>

<HD>For Lakers, Rust May Be History</HD>
<DH>Three-time champions find their comfort zone as O'Neal
scores 24 points in 111-99 victory over Bucks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal was the best player on the floor and Kobe Bryant had
another triple-double and three other Laker players scored in double
figures Sunday night and, really, it was as close as they'd come to
looking like themselves again.</LD>
<LD>   If it was not perfect, and it wasn't, their game was at least
familiar, when O'Neal drop-stepped and Bryant pushed to the rim and
the shooters stepped into their shots. The Lakers defeated the
Milwaukee Bucks, 111-99, at Staples Center, where they honored Chick
Hearn beforehand and then played a game he might have appreciated,
after having clung to Bryant for most of the season's first three
weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been a while," Laker guard Derek Fisher said afterward. "It
felt comfortable, though. It wasn't something we're not accustomed
to."</LD>
<TE>   O'Neal, who returned Friday from off-season foot surgery, started
a basketball game for the first time since Game 4 of the NBA Finals.
He had 24 points and 11 rebounds in 28 minutes, then said his foot
felt "pretty good." Bryant had 15 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists
(the assists coming as the Lakers shot a season-high 50.6% from the
field) for his third triple-double of the season, the sixth of his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher scored 21 points despite two hard falls under the basket,
the second causing his head and back to slam into the floor.
Afterward, a bruised tailbone made every turn an adventure in
discomfort, though he predicted he'd play Tuesday, when the Lakers
start a three-game trip in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee's Ray Allen wasn't as fortunate. He suffered a sprained
right ankle and was taken from the arena on the back of a cart.</TE>
<TE>   About seven minutes into the second quarter, Allen, averaging 27.5
points in his previous four games, made his first shot after seven
misses and then was helped from the floor, a team official under each
arm. He had pulled up near the left elbow of the key and shot over an
approaching O'Neal. Allen's right foot landed on O'Neal's, and he
fell hard to the floor, clutching his ankle.</TE>
<TE>   It left the Bucks unable to stay with the suddenly bold Laker
offense, which averaged 89.2 points without O'Neal, then scored 86 in
his debut. In a shootout and for a change equipped to shoot back, the
Lakers went over 100 points for the second time all season and for
the first time in 23 days. Every Laker starter scored at least 10
points, they had a season-high 34 assists on 44 field goals, and as a
result they've won two consecutive games for the second time.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are different when I am in there," O'Neal said. "I get
doubled a lot. I kick it out to guys and guys can take their time
hitting shots. We do not have many one-on-one players on this team.
We are just getting back into form. It may take a week or it may take
over a month, but we will be there when it is all said and done."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal fouled out the Bucks' backup center (Dan Gadzuric) and
their starting center (Ervin Johnson) on consecutive fourth-quarter
possessions. He made 10 of 18 shots and his 24 points came despite
six misses in 10 attempts from the line.</TE>
<TE>   "I am rusty," he said. "I am like an average big man right now,
and that is not good enough for me. But, I am good enough to give you
20-something [points] and 10 [rebounds]. But that is not acceptable
for me.</TE>
<TE>   "I look forward to getting better and I look forward to becoming
dominant again. It may take me a week or a month, but I will be back
before March."</TE>
<TE>   Emotionally drawn by a pregame ceremony that concluded with the
unveiling of a jersey with Hearn's name on it, the crowd roared when
O'Neal was announced as the Lakers' starting center. He plowed
through the arms and shoulders of his teammates into the circle of
starters near mid-court, then scored six points on three-of-four
shooting in the first quarter, over eight minutes, and the Lakers
were off.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, whose jumper has deserted him for the last week or so,
filled in the gaps around O'Neal and the perimeter shooters. He had
six assists and six points in the second quarter and five rebounds in
the third.</TE>
<TE>   And, while Phil Jackson was not enthralled by the Lakers in
O'Neal's absences, the coach had to admit that ultimately there was
something familiar about it all.</TE>
<TE>   "It was our comfort zone, how we play, and how we look to play
with one another," he said. "I thought that part of it was pretty
obvious."</TE>

<KH>USC vs. NOTRE DAME, SATURDAY, 5 P.M., CH. 7</KH>
<HD>Attention, Voters</HD>
<DH>Trojans deserve to rank higher than No. 6 in polls</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Too bad there's no reward for improving in college football.</LD>
<LD>   Too bad college football poll voters are as predictable as ice
dancing judges. Movement upward is glacial and predictable.
Washington State loses? Everybody move up one spot please.</LD>
<LD>   As the polls came out Sunday, as USC crept up a little, to No. 6
in both the Associated Press and USA Today/ESPN offerings, it was so
obvious. Performance doesn't matter. Among the top 10 teams, only USC
(and maybe Iowa) are getting better. But in this system, consistent
improvement doesn't matter.</LD>
<TE>   The way the Trojans dissected UCLA, the way Carson Palmer picked
apart the Bruin defense, the way Kareem Kelly joyfully plucked a
Palmer pass for a touchdown, the way Keary Colbert high-stepped down
the sideline, the way the defense, even with its best player, young
Shaun Cody, sidelined for the year, continues hitting hard and
smartly, it is clear.</TE>
<TE>   USC doesn't belong in the Holiday Bowl, the place where the
Pacific 10 Conference has sentenced its second-place team.</TE>
<TE>   This USC team wouldn't be out of place in the Fiesta Bowl, going
against Miami for the national championship.</TE>
<TE>   And certainly this USC team should be invited to the Rose Bowl if
the Trojans beat Notre Dame Saturday. Even if UCLA doesn't beat
Washington State a week later. Rules are rules, agreements are
agreements and, yes, Washington State beat USC in overtime weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   But how embarrassing for the Rose Bowl and the Pac-10 if USC
finishes the regular season 10-2, having compiled that record while
playing the nation's toughest schedule according to the bowl
championship series ratings formula, and Washington State with, at
best, a hobbled Jason Gesser and, at worst, his backup, comes and
gets blown out by Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yeah, Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow the Big Ten is being rewarded because its two best teams,
its only quality teams, didn't play each other.</TE>
<TE>   USC didn't get to avoid Washington State. Or Arizona State or
Oregon or Oregon State or UCLA. Yet Iowa, which lost to an Iowa State
team which was beaten by Connecticut Saturday, is being voted above
USC both by writers and coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Do you people pay attention? Anyone who is voting Iowa as a better
team than USC, one question: If you had to put your own money on the
winner of a game at a neutral site between USC and Iowa right now,
where would you put that money?</TE>
<TE>   Who among the top 20 teams has a quarterback playing better right
now than Palmer? Which team among the top 20 has a better roster of
receivers than USC? Or running backs?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to get into the polls and rankings and all that
stuff," Justin Fargas said Saturday after USC's 52-21 whipping of
UCLA. "All I can tell you is that this team is getting better every
week and, in my opinion, I don't see that happening anywhere else. Do
we get rewarded for that? I guess that's up to other people, you
guys, the voters. The voters see what they see and think what they
think."</TE>
<TE>   They've seen Ohio State barely hang on to beat Cincinnati, Penn
State, Purdue, Illinois and Michigan. The Buckeyes haven't improved,
they've marked time and survived in a mediocre Big Ten.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma stumbled against Texas A&amp;M, and the Sooner defense was
exposed while giving up 30 points not three weeks ago. And yet
they're back at No. 3 in the AP poll and still in the race for the
Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Fargas needs to understand: seeing and thinking are two things
voters don't always do.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, coaches and players, have handled this well. They
have not whined. If they miss out on the Rose Bowl, Coach Pete
Carroll said, "It's our fault. We lost to Washington State."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he has no second thoughts about the tough schedule,
about playing Auburn, Colorado, Kansas State and Notre Dame out of
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on your focus," Carroll said. "Is your only focus to
win a national championship? That's not my focus. My focus is to win
the championship in our conference and to win the Rose Bowl. When we
look at things in that manner, then our schedule has made us tougher,
more competitive and we needed that because we have a really hard
conference schedule. And if we don't play in the Rose Bowl? That
won't take away that we're co-champions of the Pac-10."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll won't say it, Fargas won't say it, but if USC beats Notre
Dame Saturday, the BCS will suffer if the Trojans end up in the
Holiday Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The way Ohio State struggles to score against mediocre teams such
as Cincinnati and Illinois, the national title game in the Fiesta
Bowl has the makings of another debacle, a blowout same as last
season.</TE>
<TE>   If Washington State ends up in the Rose Bowl and Gesser can't
play, ditto. An ugly game.</TE>
<TE>   And the Holiday Bowl, on Dec. 27, will have the best team in the
country. What a waste.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't mind playing anybody right now," Carroll said. "Other
teams might not feel that way."</TE>
<TE>   That's for sure. Who would want to play USC?</TE>

<HD>Season for Bruin Doubters</HD>
<DH>As UCLA prepares for men's basketball opener, exhibitions
stir concern about high expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The season hasn't started, and UCLA already has suffered its worst
loss at Pauley Pavilion and dropped two exhibitions for the first
time.</LD>
<LD>   The season hasn't started, and boos already have rained from the
rafters like pepper into soup, searing the impressionable psyches of
freshmen post players Michael Fey and Ryan Hollins.</LD>
<LD>   The season hasn't started, and senior Jason Kapono already is
apologizing for the team's lack of intensity in a 25-point exhibition
loss. The Bruins also lost their second exhibition, by six points.</LD>
<TE>   "This is tough to swallow," he said. "It will definitely mean we
need to bring maximum passion to the practice floor. When you don't
play defense and don't play hard, you get exposed."</TE>
<TE>   Only exhibitions, yes.</TE>
<TE>   But, quite an exhibition they were.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA was trounced by a hastily assembled collection of players
called Branch West Academy. Then it happened again, losing to EA
Sports, a team that was 0-12 before beating the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Crushed along the way was a good portion of the buoyancy that
normally accompanies a new season.</TE>
<TE>   Preseason polls have saluted UCLA, which despite losing three
starters and a combined 39.3 points and 17.4 rebounds a game, is
ranked No. 15 by the Associated Press and as high as No. 10 in other
polls.</TE>
<TE>   The return of Kapono -- the leading scorer the last three seasons
-- along with the expected maturation of junior T.J. Cummings and
sophomores Cedric Bozeman and Dijon Thompson, the addition of
seasoned perimeter threats Ray Young and Jon Crispin, and the
sky-high potential of Fey and Hollins had given rise to considerable
optimism.</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention a purported change of attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need to go through the infamous grinder-holy
smokes-down-by-10-to-Podunk-U stuff," Kapono said. "If we are going
to lose, we'll all have floor burns, cuts and scrapes."</TE>
<TE>   All it took was debacles in games that don't count, though, and
the positive feelings were exposed as wafer-thin. The already tepid
support for Coach Steve Lavin among Bruin fans is on the verge of a
full-scale freeze out. Fair or not.</TE>
<TE>   Entering his seventh year, Lavin has a 135-59 record and has led
the Bruins to five Sweet 16s, including last season on the strength
of a double-overtime upset of Cincinnati. But wolves are constantly
at his door, for early season blunders, Pacific 10 Conference
stumbles and an inability to get beyond the Sweet 16.</TE>
<TE>   And he is still so young, just 38, nary a wrinkle in his
well-tanned forehead, bald spot on his pate or crack in his golly-gee
smile.</TE>
<TE>   What, Lavin worry?</TE>
<TE>   "There will be growing pains, but I think that by the end of the
season we should be in a position to make another run," he said. "I
like this team, I like the blend of old and new, I like the
athleticism and the energy."</TE>
<TE>   Energy, though, was noticeably absent in the exhibitions. Same
with defense, passion and any other intangible a coach is charged
with igniting.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to Kansas and Georgia, and they're out there playing hard
every minute," said Brian Jones, a former Santa Clara guard who
played for EA Sports. "UCLA was waiting, waiting, and they never
turned it on. They looked like they were second-guessing themselves."</TE>
<TE>   New UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero watched the games from the
front row with his arms folded across his chest. After the Branch
West trouncing he said the experience was "instructive."</TE>
<TE>   A strong start -- something the Bruins haven't exactly specialized
in recently -- will be necessary to quell the burgeoning riot. But a
schedule that includes early games against Duke, Kansas, Michigan and
St. John's might not be accommodating.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most challenging schedule of my career," Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Defeating high-profile opponents on a national stage is something
the Bruins have repeatedly accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, UCLA takes the floor less with experience than
potential. Lavin won't start Fey or Hollins early on, preferring a
lineup of 6-foot-10 Cummings and four perimeter players -- Kapono,
senior Ray Young and sophomores Bozeman and Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   Rebounding and interior defense are glaring question marks,
although the shortest starter is Young at 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   "We can have four perimeter players around T.J., but actually it
gives us a lot of size," Lavin said. "Sometimes perimeter players are
better at rebounding because they have quick feet and can position
themselves well."</TE>
<TE>   Fey, a wide-body center, and Hollins, a lithe pogo stick, are
certain to experience growing pains. Both, eventually, should be
competent players. But with sophomore power forward Andre Patterson
ineligible until at least mid-December, the front line will be
hard-pressed to make up for the loss of last season's center, Dan
Gadzuric, and power forward, Matt Barnes.</TE>
<TE>   "We can score, we all love to score, but we have to play defense
to win," Cummings said.</TE>
<TE>   Perimeter shooting could carry the Bruins. Kapono is the school's
all-time leading three-point shooter. Young spent the off-season
honing his jumper. Crispin was a long-range threat for two years at
Penn State and Cummings possesses a strong mid-range shot.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman and Thompson were much improved by the end of last season
and are essential components of the Bruin press. Point guard Ryan
Walcott is a sparkplug off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   The talent is there. In fact, someone respected for his knowledge
of the game was not the slightest dismayed by the lackluster Bruin
performance against Branch West.</TE>
<TE>   "They have tons of talent and they are just beginning to feel out
what to do," he said. "They have all the pieces and are trying fit
them into the puzzle. Give them time. They'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   The expert is Doug Gottlieb, the 26-year-old Branch West point
guard who set NCAA records for assists at Oklahoma State. His father,
Bob, is the Branch West coach. Gottlieb respects Lavin for his track
record of motivating the Bruins while dodging bullets.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that makes Steve such a great coach is that he gets
guys to play at an unbelievable level when they need to the most," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   With Guerrero in evaluation mode and fans uneasy, the Bruins might
need to reach that level not only before the NCAA tournament, but
before the ball falls to mark the New Year.</TE>

<KH>ATLANTA 41, CAROLINA 0</KH>
<HD>Falcons Complete a Rare Double Shutout of Panthers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Michael Vick scanned Carolina's sideline and saw heads hanging -- an
unmistakable sign of defeat. He pointed this out to his Atlanta
teammates and told them it was time to pounce.</LD>
<LD>   The Falcons did, racking up eight sacks and forcing six turnovers
Sunday in a 41-0 victory over Carolina -- the Panthers' eighth
consecutive loss.</LD>
<LD>   "It was like 21-0, and the Panthers had this empty look in their
eyes, like they knew it was over and hopeless, and they weren't
coming back," Vick said. "We were in the huddle and I said, 'Let's go
out and finish these guys.' "</LD>
<TE>   The Falcons (7-3-1) proved their dominance over Carolina (3-8) by
beating the Panthers for the sixth consecutive time and ninth time in
the last 10 meetings. Atlanta outscored Carolina 71-0 this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think its fairly evident we're not a very good football team
when we play the Atlanta Falcons," Coach John Fox said. "Basically, I
told [the team] that I was ashamed of our performance, and they ought
to be too."</TE>
<TE>   It's the first time that a team has shut out an opponent twice in
the same season since 1976, when Denver blanked San Diego, 26-0 and
17-0. Vick threw for 272 yards and two touchdowns, Warrick Dunn
scored twice and Atlanta had 426 total yards. The defense had four
interceptions and recovered two fumbles.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome was clear so early that Vick was able to spend all of
the fourth quarter celebrating on the sideline, along with new owner
Arthur Blank.</TE>
<TE>   "That was as close to a perfect game as you can possibly play,"
cornerback Ray Buchanan said.</TE>

<KH>BALTIMORE 13, TENNESSEE 12</KH>
<HD>Titans Get Burned by Mistakes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Some teams find ways to win. On Sunday, the Tennessee Titans found
ways to lose.</LD>
<LD>   "We managed to lose this game just about any way you can," Titan
Coach Jeff Fisher said after his team lost, 13-12, to the Baltimore
Ravens.</LD>
<LD>   How many things did Tennessee do wrong?</LD>
<TE>   The Titans gave up a blocked punt for the game's only touchdown,
turned the ball over four times and committed a penalty that negated
a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention Steve McNair's miss of a wide-open Derrick Mason
for what would almost surely have been a winning touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Barely a minute into the game, Baltimore rookie Ed Reed blocked
Craig Hentrich's punt, picked it up and scooted 11 yards into the end
zone for what turned out to be the game's only touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Then McNair, who had all four of Tennessee's turnovers, threw an
interception in the end zone on third-and-goal from the Baltimore
four. On the next series, Andre Dyson's 28-yard interception return
was negated by a roughing-the-passer penalty against the Titans'
Keith Bullock.</TE>
<TE>   "I started to get the feeling at that point that it was going to
be our day," said Baltimore quarterback Jeff Blake, who like many of
the offensive players had a bad day -- 11 for 24 for 109 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans (6-5) probably were due for a clunker. They had won
five consecutive games after starting 1-4 and have now lost five in a
row to Baltimore, including a playoff game at home two seasons ago,
when the Ravens won the Super Bowl. "We felt like we were one play
away but we never got it," said Eddie George, who had 61 yards and
hasn't run for more than 100 yards in nine games against Baltimore.</TE>

<KH>INDIANAPOLIS 23, DENVER 20 (0T)</KH>
<HD>Vanderjagt's Kicking Proves Oh-Snow-Good</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Indianapolis kicker Mike Vanderjagt had already kicked a 54-yard
field goal through a heavy snowfall at the end of regulation, but
Colt Coach Tony Dungy wasn't sure he wanted him to try a second
50-yarder in overtime.</LD>
<LD>   So who did the coach turn to for advice? Justin Snow, of course.</LD>
<LD>   The Colts' holder talked Dungy into the kick, and Vanderjagt
rewarded him with a 51-yard field goal with 9:22 remaining in
overtime to help the Colts beat the Denver Broncos, 23-20, Sunday
night.</LD>
<TE>   Dungy wanted to punt, but Snow said Vanderjagt could make it.
Several other players chimed in to help change Dungy's mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I was determined to punt the ball, because I thought we could
back them up and stop them and get good field position," Dungy said.
"They all, to a man, said, 'No, let's win right here.' "</TE>
<TE>   Despite the snow flurries, players slipping and balls squirting
loose all over the field, Vanderjagt felt right at home.</TE>
<TE>   A Canadian who played three seasons in the Canadian Football
League, Vanderjagt was three for three Sunday after missing five of
his previous eight attempts.</TE>
<TE>   The Colts (7-4) started the final drive in regulation at their 20
with 1:40 left, then moved 44 yards in 11 plays to set up
Vanderjagt's 54-yarder with three seconds left. The kick sailed
through the uprights with plenty of room to spare.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis got the ball first in overtime and moved 35 yards for
Vanderjagt's winning kick, which again had plenty of distance. "It's
Grey Cup Sunday today, and I'm Canadian, so it was a typical Sunday
game for me," Vanderjagt said. "It's safe to say I thoroughly enjoyed
this."</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos (7-4) lost on a dramatic kick for the second time this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Denver lost, 24-22, to Miami on Oct. 13 when Olindo Mare kicked a
53-yarder with six seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Denver has won all of its games during the day but is 0-4 at
night. The Broncos have lost three straight at home, their longest
streak since 1994, and failed to take advantage of San Diego's loss
earlier in the day. Denver is tied with the Chargers and Oakland atop
the AFC West.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time that you put yourself in a situation like we did and you
don't come away with a victory, it is pretty tough for a football
team," Denver Coach Mike Shanahan said.</TE>
<TE>   "I am disappointed we didn't get it done."</TE>
<TE>   The Colts won their third straight to move a game ahead of
Tennessee in the AFC South.</TE>
<TE>   They needed another huge game from Marvin Harrison to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison had 11 catches for 107 yards -- six on third-down
conversions at one point -- giving him 100 receptions for the season.
He became the first player in NFL history to reach the mark four
consecutive seasons, eclipsing the record he shared with Jerry Rice
and Herman Moore.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm running out of things to say about him," said Colt
quarterback Peyton Manning, who completed 29 of 44 passes for 229
yards.</TE>

<KH>N.Y. JETS 31, BUFFALO 13</KH>
<HD>Pennington Shows Fancy Footwork</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>They called him "Jelly Legs" and "Elvis."</LD>
<LD>   No, not Curtis Martin -- Chad Pennington.</LD>
<LD>   Pennington punctuated the New York Jets' fourth consecutive
victory Sunday with moves worthy of a Broadway dancer. Or, as
teammate Sam Garnes said after a 31-13 rout of Buffalo, "Watch out,
Michael Vick."</LD>
<TE>   Neat jukes that leave defenders sprawled helplessly on the ground
are expected from Martin, who ran for 120 yards as the Jets (6-5)
remained firmly in the AFC East race. No one looks for Pennington to
make them.</TE>
<TE>   But after watching Martin make the Bills miss left and right,
Pennington borrowed some of those moves on a one-yard touchdown that
clinched the win. He sent linebacker Eddie Robinson tumbling to the
turf with an inside fake on a rollout, then trotted into the end
zone.</TE>
<TE>   On fourth down, no less.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't pretty. I think the move was so bad, he'd never seen it
before," Pennington said of Robinson. "It was a disgrace to the
quarterback position that has Donovan McNabb and Michael Vick."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't that bad. And it certainly was effective, taking away
the momentum the Bills had built. "I didn't know he had that many
moves," Coach Herman Edwards said. "He looked like Elvis Presley."</TE>
<TE>   Martin has those kind of moves. Finally healed from a sprained
ankle that plagued him since the season-opening win at Buffalo,
Martin put together his second consecutive 100-yard effort. He has
rushed for more than 1,150 yards in each of his seven seasons, but
has struggled for much of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I'm getting better, slowly but surely," Martin said. "We
[were] at the bottom of the totem pole and we have to continue to
fight our way up and take nothing for granted."</TE>
<TE>   Pennington also was 15-for-24 (62.5%) for 178 yards. He entered
the game completing a league-best 71% of his passes.</TE>
<TE>   Keyed by Martin, the Jets quickly moved to a 24-3 lead on the
opening drive of the second half. Operating into a stiff wind, they
moved 65 yards as Martin ran for 17 -- Robinson drew a 15-yard face
mask penalty on the play -- and went 18 yards with a dump pass.
Laveranues Coles was wide open on a play-action rollout pass and
Pennington connected with him for an 11-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bills (5-6) drove 69 yards, including an 18-yard pass to
Eric Moulds on fourth down, before Travis Henry ran in from the
one-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   When Buffalo moved within 11 points on Mike Hollis' 40-yard field
goal late in the third quarter, the crowd got restless.</TE>
<TE>   Not to worry. The Jets went 65 yards in 11 plays as Pennington,
5-2 as a starter, used his wideouts for big plays. Wayne Chrebet
caught an 11-yard pass on third down, Santana Moss gained 22 with a
spin move after the catch, and Coles hauled in a high throw for 15
yards.</TE>
<TE>   On fourth down, Pennington did his dance step into the end zone.</TE>

<KH>CLEVELAND 24, NEW ORLEANS 15</KH>
<HD>Green Gears Up Browns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The running back scampering across the Superdome field was not Deuce
McAllister.</LD>
<LD>   With the injured New Orleans star watching from the sidelines,
Cleveland rookie William Green ran for 114 yards and a touchdown to
spark the Browns to a 24-15 victory over the Saints on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I really feel this offense is just tapping into what it can do,"
Brown quarterback Tim Couch said.</LD>
<TE>   It was the fourth victory in the last five games for the Browns
(6-5).</TE>
<TE>   It was the third loss in the last four for the Saints (7-4).
McAllister, the NFC's leading rusher with 950 yards, was active but
did not play because of a sprained right ankle. "You want to make
plays, it's hard to sit on the sidelines," McAllister said. "I wanted
to help my team."</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans gained only 74 yards rushing and scored only one
touchdown in six trips inside the Cleveland 20-yard line. Cleveland
forced three red-zone turnovers -- two interceptions and a fumble by
Aaron Brooks -- and twice held the Saints to field goals.</TE>
<TE>   "I made three bad decisions," said Brooks, who completed 23 of 40
passes for 318 yards, but had three interceptions and no touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Couch was 12 for 21 for 182 yards and a touchdown. He was
intercepted twice. "I've got that gunslinger mentality," Couch said.
"No matter what happens I'm going out there and throwing the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Couch's third pass was intercepted by Dale Carter, who returned it
23 yards to give New Orleans the ball at the Browns' 37. John
Carney's 33-yard field goal gave the Saints a 3-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland went ahead, 7-3, on a one-yard touchdown run by Green.
The 85-yard drive was fueled by a 46-yard pass from Couch to Quincy
Morgan and three penalties against the Saints that gave the Browns 14
yards and two first downs.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans opened the second quarter with a 27-yard field goal
after a drive stalled at the eight. The Saints blew a chance to get
the lead when Brooks fumbled at the Cleveland 17.</TE>
<TE>   The Saints stopped the Browns, but Michael Lewis muffed the punt,
which Andra Davis recovered for Cleveland. Two plays later, receiver
Dennis Northcutt took a handoff and ran 36 yards for the score,
making it 14-6 with 3:50 in the half.</TE>
<TE>   On the Saints' next possession, Lewis caught a 59-yard pass as New
Orleans drove to the 12 before settling for Carney's 30-yard field
goal that made it 14-6.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the half, New Orleans drove to the two before Brooks threw
an interception on third down to Anthony Henry.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them we stunk," Saint Coach Jim Haslett said. "We were
awful and that's not us. We had a lot of turnovers."</TE>

<KH>CHICAGO 20, DETROIT 17 (OT)</KH>
<HD>Decision Blows Away Lions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHAMPAIGN, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Detroit took the wind and Chicago got the win.</LD>
<LD>   Sore-armed Jim Miller came off the bench to rescue the Bears, who
benefited from Detroit's unconventional overtime strategy Sunday to
beat the Lions, 20-17, and end an eight-game losing streak.</LD>
<LD>   "The wind was a factor. They wanted us to drive the length of the
field, which is exactly what we did," Miller said after Paul
Edinger's 40-yard field goal gave the Bears their first win since the
second week of the season.</LD>
<TE>   "Any team wants the ball in overtime. They made the decision and
it cost them," Miller added.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who has a sore right elbow, led the Bears to 10 points in
the final 2:33 of regulation, featuring two great catches by Dez
White, and Chicago (3-8) forced overtime on Edinger's 22-yard field
goal on the final play.</TE>
<TE>   After winning the coin toss to start overtime, the Lions (3-8)
decided to play defense first with a 17-mph wind at their backs
instead of taking the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing the outcome of this game, I wouldn't do it again,"
Detroit Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "But in a similar situation, I
would. I had complete confidence in our defense up to that point. I
had complete confidence we would get a stop. The wind knocked the
ball off the tee when we were kicking off. It was substantial, that
was my rationale."</TE>
<TE>   But given the ball first, Miller moved the Bears from their own 35
to the Detroit 22, connecting on third-down passes of 14 and 15 yards
to Marty Booker and then passing to White for a five-yard gain on
fourth-and-three from the Detroit 30 to get Edinger in position for
the game winner.</TE>
<TE>   "You always want to take the ball," Edinger said. "It's sudden
death."</TE>
<TE>   Mornhinweg made another debatable decision during the final drive
after Chicago was called for holding on a third-and-five from the
Lion 35. Detroit accepted the 10-yard penalty, backing the Bears up
but also giving them an extra down that Miller used to connect with
Booker for the 15-yard gain.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a 52-yard field goal and I wanted to give them little or
no chance at points," Mornhinweg said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really understand why they didn't decline it," Edinger
said. "They knew what the wind was doing."</TE>

<LD>This could get habit-forming.</LD>
<LD>   Duck tough guy Kevin Sawyer scored another goal Sunday night in a
4-4 tie with Florida. It was his second in a week and the third of
his career.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't want to do too much, then they expect too much the
following year," Sawyer joked after the game.</LD>
<TE>   Sawyer created his own opportunity. A few minutes earlier he had
suckered Florida's Peter Worrell into taking a penalty.</TE>
<TE>   With the lines jumbled after the power play, Sawyer found himself
on ice with Steve Rucchin and Patric Kjellberg, two-thirds of the
Ducks' top line.</TE>
<TE>   Kjellberg went into the Panther zone and fired a backhander that
Jani Hurme saved. The rebound came right to Sawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "Not much I can say about that," Sawyer said. "The rebound nice
and juicy, all I had to do is shoot it in."</TE>
<TE>   So is Paul Kariya's job on the top line in jeopardy?</TE>
<TE>   "I notice he was looking at me a little funny," Sawyer said,
smiling. "I don't know if he felt threatened or not. I think he'll be
OK for now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers have played 24 games this season, 10 of which have
gone into overtime. Their winless streak was extended to eight games
Sunday, but they are 0-1-5-2 in that time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, Duck officials announced the 13,254 tickets sold as the
attendance at the Arrowhead Pond during the third period.</TE>
<TE>   A fan sitting below the press box shouted, "Don't believe it."</TE>

for having too many players on the ice. Florida takes advantage by
scoring twice in the last 13 minutes to salvage a 4-4 tie.</DH>

<LD>Somehow Steve Rucchin managed a smile, even a chuckle, when asked
about what should have been a moment to savor.</LD>
<LD>   As hats floated to the ice, he had lost his hat trick when the
Mighty Ducks were called for too many men on the ice.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks then lost a two-goal lead in the last 13 minutes and had
to settle for a 4-4 tie with the Florida Panthers Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   There was a general loss for words afterward as to how this all
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin, though, knew there were others who suffered among the
announced 13,254 at the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel bad for the people who lost their hats," Rucchin said. "I
said on the bench, 'If it was me, I wouldn't be too thrilled about
losing my hat for nothing.' I guess the fans have to take that one up
with the refs."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the only thing left for the Ducks was to try to laugh off
this loss.</TE>
<TE>   They thoroughly dominated the game, with a moment to cherish when
Rucchin appeared to polish off his first career hat trick 6 minutes
48 seconds into the third period. Once the referees started waving
their arms, nothing went right.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a 5-2 lead, the Ducks had to kill a power play. Instead
of burying an inferior opponent, they saw the Panthers tie the score
with 13.3 seconds left. Instead of another two points in the
standings, they were left with one after blowing a two-goal lead in
the third period for the third time this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know what exactly happened," Coach Mike Babcock said.
"Rucchin is in for a hat trick, the game is over and they say we have
too many guys on the ice. There was no one more shocked than me when
that happened."</TE>
<TE>   The search for silver linings began the moment Florida's Kristian
Huselius, alone at the side of the net, redirected Sandis Ozolinsh's
blue-line shot past goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere to tie the score,
4-4.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the games we have to win," Giguere said. "There is no
excuse about it. We should have won this game tonight."</TE>
<TE>   So stunning was the turn of events, Duck players and their coach
couldn't even keep the story straight on Huselius' goal and why he
was alone near the post.</TE>
<TE>   "[The puck] got hit in front and went in another direction,"
Babcock said. "It was going to the left side and ended up on the
right side."</TE>
<TE>   Said Giguere: "The puck was actually going wide. Their guy got a
stick on it, deflected it into the net."</TE>
<TE>   There was a lot to sort out after this one.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had chances to salvage their Sunday in overtime. Rucchin
hit the post. Florida's Jani Hurme made a toe save on a Niclas
Havelid try. Those efforts merely made a frustrating game
unexplainable.</TE>
<TE>   "At no point, in my mind, did they dominate the game or take the
game over," Babcock said. "Yet the mental mistake cost us."</TE>
<TE>   Victory seemed a mere formality. Rucchin had two first-period
goals. Andy McDonald knocked in a power play goal. Kevin Sawyer
chipped in his second goal of the season and third of his career.</TE>
<TE>   All was right for the Ducks. After all, the Panthers had only 13
shots through the first 46 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Then Rucchin intercepted a pass at the blue line, had the time and
open ice for a triple axel or two. He waited out Hurme before
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Hats flew.</TE>
<TE>   Arms waved.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, on a line change at the time, had nearly enough players
on the ice to shoot a team portrait.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't happen too often, huh?" Rucchin said. "It was very
strange, no question about it. That was a huge turning point,
obviously....</TE>
<TE>   "That would have been 5-2, and a lot nicer cushion. Then, not only
do we have a goal taken away, but we had to kill a penalty."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks couldn't. Niklas Hagman came across the blue line and
unleashed a wicked shot that beat Giguere high, making the score 4-3,
8:26 into the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "We're up 5-2, and the whistle blows and we have too many guys on
the ice, I guess," Babcock said. "They wouldn't call it if it
wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Leaving him unable to laugh this one off.</TE>

<HD>Buccaneer Defense Shuts Down Favre</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers left no doubt about who has the NFL's best
defense.</LD>
<LD>   The Buccaneers beat the Packers, 21-7, in a meeting Sunday of the
teams with the NFL's best records. The superb effort by Tampa Bay was
overshadowed by an ugly exchange between Packer Coach Mike Sherman
and Tampa Bay defensive tackle Warren Sapp as they walked off the
field.</LD>
<LD>   Tampa Bay intercepted Brett Favre four times and Brad Johnson
threw two second-half touchdown passes as the Buccaneers (9-2) won
for the first time this season over a team with a winning record at
the time it lost to Tampa Bay.</LD>
<TE>   Favre was sacked three times, including the game's last play, and
had little success after taking advantage of Tampa Bay's only
turnover to give the Packers (8-3) a 7-0 lead in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers are off to their best start ever and thrust
themselves into position to make a run for home-field advantage in
the playoffs, which would be important for a franchise that has never
won a postseason game on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized what was at stake and realized it was another brick
in the road to the Super Bowl that has to come through Tampa," Sapp
said. "Next week we can put a couple more bricks in there."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson returned from being poked in the right eye to throw
touchdown passes of four yards to Joe Jurevicius and three yards to
Ken Dilger. Martin Gramatica kicked field goals of 38 and 51 yards
for the Buccaneers, who trailed 7-3 at the half.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Kelly had two interceptions, setting up Tampa Bay's first
touchdown and stopping another drive deep in Buccaneer territory with
Favre working feverishly to try to wipe out a two-touchdown deficit
in the last five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Ronde Barber stepped in front of a slant pass intended for Terry
Glenn to turn back another threat and Dexter Jackson's interception
and 58-yard return to the Green Bay five led to Johnson's touchdown
pass to Dilger.</TE>
<TE>   Favre, whose record is 0-5 at Raymond James Stadium, completed 20
of 38 passes for 196 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was 15 of 25 for 134 yards, with no interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Favre's four-yard touchdown pass to Donald Driver was his 20th,
giving him nine consecutive seasons with 20 or more -- one shy of the
NFL record set by Dan Marino from 1983-92. Linebacker Na'il Diggs set
up the score with his 29-yard return of an interception that glanced
off Keyshawn Johnson after Tampa Bay had moved from its 20 to the
Green Bay 33.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Johnson missed most of the opening quarter after being poked
in the eye. Rob Johnson replaced him a little more than five minutes
into the game and threw the pass that Diggs picked off three plays
later.</TE>
<TE>   The Packers also sacked Rob Johnson twice to stop another
promising drive and Brad Johnson re-entered the game after Tampa
Bay's backup was unable to move the ball on the Buccaneers' first
possession in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay's defense, which has only given up five touchdown passes
all season, gave up little after Favre took advantage of the
Buccaneers' only turnover. The Packers were held to 28 yards in the
second quarter and went three-and-out on four straight possessions
during a stretch of the second and third quarters while Green Bay's
lead was being trimmed to 7-6.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers went ahead when Coach Jon Gruden successfully
challenged a ruling that Jurevicius didn't get both feet down in the
end zone on his touchdown catch. Replays showed that the receiver got
his right foot down after catching the ball, then managed to tap his
left foot before going out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   Favre is 14-6 with 34 touchdown passes during his career against
Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   But he has also thrown 19 interceptions against the Buccaneers,
who lead the NFL this season with 25.</TE>

<KH>SEATTLE 39, KANSAS CITY 32</KH>
<HD>Youth Serves Seahawks Well</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The young Seattle Seahawks realize they'll make plenty of mistakes.
Matt Hasselbeck and Orlando Huff showed they're also learning how to
get it right.</LD>
<LD>   Hasselbeck had his best performance of the season, throwing for
career highs with 362 yards and three touchdowns and Huff made a big
defensive player as the Seahawks beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 39-32,
on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Hasselbeck completed 25 of 36 passes without an interception.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm comfortable, and I guess that's part of the maturing
process," said Hasselbeck, in his second season as a starter in the
NFL. "Part of it is that our young guys are really playing well. I'm
going to have a better day if those guys improve."</TE>
<TE>   Shaun Alexander ran for 145 yards in 23 carries and provided
breathing room for Seattle (4-7) when he ran for a 46-yard touchdown
on a counter play that made it 39-25 with 1:52 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most positive team I've ever been on," said
Alexander, in his third NFL season. "Every week, everyone feels like
this is going to be the week that we play like Super Bowl champions."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City's Priest Holmes ran for 197 yards and two touchdowns
in 23 carries and caught seven passes for 110 yards, including a
screen pass from Green that went for a 64-yard touchdown and a 17-7
lead midway through the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs (5-6) pulled to 39-32 in the final minute when Trent
Green threw a 15-yard scoring pass to Marc Boerigter with 31 seconds
to play, but Seattle's Bobby Engram recovered the ensuing onside
kick.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been involved in a game where a running back had
nearly 200 yards running but we still wound up minus-one in the
turnovers," Chief Coach Dick Vermeil said. "And that was a huge
turnover."</TE>
<TE>   Credit Huff, a second-year linebacker, for that one. He
intercepted a pass by Green after the Chiefs reached the Seattle one
just before the half. Huff made an athletic play, shuffling his feet
to stay inbounds with the Seahawks trailing 17-14.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I had my hands on the ball, so it was just a matter of
getting my feet down," said Huff. "I thought I had it, but I knew I
had it after I looked up and saw the replay."</TE>
<TE>   The officials needed another look too. They initially ruled Huff
didn't have possession but the play was overturned after a review
when Seattle challenged the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have gone up 24-14 and it would have been a different
game," Green said. "All of a sudden, we gave them a lift."</TE>

<HD>Allison's Recovery Is Ahead of Schedule</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings may be in line for an early Christmas gift if center Jason
Allison's knee injury continues to heal at the pace it has since he
suffered a torn medial collateral ligament and sprained anterior
cruciate ligament on Oct. 29.</LD>
<LD>   Allison, who originally was diagnosed to be sidelined eight to 12
weeks, has been skating for nearly a week and went through some light
drills with his teammates Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like I'm ahead of schedule," Allison said after the Kings'
2-0 victory over Dallas on Saturday. "I feel good, but I'll have to
wait and see what happens. It still gets swollen and sore, but that's
normal."</LD>
<TE>   Allison, who is under the supervision of team therapist Robert
Zolg, suffered his injury against Atlanta when he hit knee-to-knee
with Andy Sutton. In the 12 games Allison has missed, the Kings are
4-4-1-3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Things are looking up for the Kings, who have a chance to be at
full strength before the end of December.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is Allison closer to returning, but the Kings also expect
to have winger Adam Deadmarsh back in the lineup against the Florida
Panthers on Wednesday after he sat out the last five games because of
post-concussion symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Another good sign for the Kings was Ziggy Palffy's effort against
the Stars on Saturday. Palffy recorded his first two-goal game of the
season after struggling for much of the first five weeks of the
season because of a groin injury.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good to be back at home and to win a tough game like
this gives you confidence," Palffy said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we have to put some points up at home the next few weeks.
We have to play smarter and with confidence."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, off until Wednesday's home game with the Panthers, did
not practice Sunday.</TE>

<LD>On a slow-witted 12th Sunday of this NFL season, on a very dumb day
afternoon, who uttered the following timeless words:</LD>
<LD>   "I was going down and I had the wrong brain cell reacting and I
tried to do something stupid. I can't tell you why I did it."</LD>
<LD>   Was it:</LD>
<TE>   a) Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre after throwing four
interceptions in a 21-7 loss at Tampa Bay and handing over
possession, at least temporarily, of the NFC's home-field advantage
to the Buccaneers?</TE>
<TE>   b) St. Louis Coach Mike Martz after bypassing a score-tying,
chip-shot field goal with 17 seconds to play, telling Kurt Warner to
go for the win and then watching the Rams lose the ball and the game
to Washington on the very next play, 20-17?</TE>
<TE>   c) Detroit Coach Marty Mornhinweg after winning the overtime coin
toss and electing to kick, then turning a Chicago fourth down into a
third down by accepting a holding penalty that gave the Bears two
cracks at first down, a couple of fog-headed decisions that
eventually produced a 20-17 Chicago victory?</TE>
<TE>   d) Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer after his no-look,
behind-the-back lateral resulted in a turnover and Oakland's first
touchdown in the Raiders' 41-20 road triumph?</TE>
<TE>   For the record, the words belonged to Plummer, but he could have
been speaking for the group, and then some, on a day when many shrewd
NFL minds, and Mornhinweg's, seemed to be moving in slow motion.</TE>
<TE>   In Tampa, Fla., where the Packers and Buccaneers were locked in a
struggle for NFC supremacy and/or a few hours of hanging out with
good buddies Favre and Warren Sapp as they winked, laughed and hung
out for a while, the smart money was on the Buccaneers.</TE>
<TE>   For one, the Buccaneers have never lost to Green Bay at Raymond
James Stadium. Before Sunday's game, Favre and the Packers were 0-4
there.</TE>
<TE>   For another, the Buccaneers play for excitable boy Jon Gruden, who
had his players whipped into an emotional frenzy for this one,
playing on the most primal instinct of all, abject fear.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers and the Packers began the game with the same
record, 8-2, amid much pregame talk about the teams meeting again in
the NFC championship game. The Buccaneers were afraid they might have
to play that game at Lambeau Field, where the Packers have never lost
a playoff game, and in weather colder than 34 degrees. The Buccaneers
have never won while playing under those conditions.</TE>
<TE>   As Gruden pitched it to them, it was win now or freeze later.</TE>
<TE>   What followed were four quarters of anti-freeze, highlighted by a
defensive charge that harassed Favre into four interceptions --
giving him seven in Green Bay's last two games, both losses. It also
included a crushing, open-field block by Tampa Bay's Sapp on Green
Bay offensive tackle Chad Clifton after Favre was intercepted in the
third quarter by Brian Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   Sapp flattened Clifton, who injured his hip on the play and had to
be carted off the field.</TE>
<TE>   Worse than that, in the view of Packer Coach Mike Sherman, Sapp
seemed to celebrating Clifton's misfortune by standing tauntingly
over the fallen player.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Sapp and Sherman exchanged angry words. Sherman
thought the play was "kind of cheap." Sapp said the hit was legal and
noted that "I didn't pick him up and slam him. What's the problem
here?"</TE>
<TE>   That's the question fans and media have been asking all season in
St. Louis, home of the defending NFC champion Rams, also known as the
Team That Forgot How to Win With Kurt Warner. Warner, winner of two
of the last three league most-valuable-player awards, went 0-4 during
an incredible September before breaking the little finger on his
passing hand on Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams lost their first game without Warner, then switched to
third-stringer Marc Bulger, who promptly reeled off five consecutive
victories, then injured one of his fingers. Martz went back to Warner
on Sunday, a decision that yielded sound enough numbers: 34 for 49
for 301 yards, two touchdowns and one interception.</TE>
<TE>   However, playing without the injured Marshall Faulk, Warner
managed to produce only 17 points -- three fewer than the Redskins,
although the Rams did have the ball at the Washington six with 17
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   A field goal from there was virtually a sure thing. But Martz
bypassed it to go for the touchdown. When Redskin linebacker LaVar
Arrington bypassed the St. Louis offensive line to strip Warner of
the ball, setting up teammate Daryl Gardener's recovery at the 13,
Warner dropped to 0-5 and the Rams to 5-6 and all but waiting for
next season.</TE>
<TE>   "I just made a bad call at the end," Martz said. "We lost this one
on a coaching error at the end."</TE>
<TE>   So did the Lions, which is nothing really new, although
Mornhinweg's unique handling of the overtime period against the Bears
does make you wonder: Is he coaching to get the Lions a better draft
choice? And if he is, when does the NFL adopt the lottery system?</TE>
<TE>   As anyone who has watched the NFL recently can tell you, when you
win the overtime coin toss, you take the ball. Every time. There
could be a tornado twisting, a dam bursting, a hurricane howling. If
you win the toss, you take ball. Can't win the game without it.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit won the toss and decided to kick.</TE>
<TE>   Mornhinweg said he wanted the Lions to have the wind at their
back, presumably to help expedite their post-loss sprint back to the
locker room.</TE>
<TE>   After that, the Lions tried to regroup. Mornhinweg couldn't. On
third and five from the Detroit 35, the Bears were flagged for
holding. Decline the penalty and Chicago is facing either a punt or a
52-yard field-goal attempt -- into the wind that had Mornhinweg so
worried. Accept the penalty, and Chicago has two plays to gain 18
yards and extend the drive.</TE>
<TE>   Mornhinweg took the penalty, Chicago took the victory. Two passes
gained the Bears the necessary yardage for the first down, setting up
Paul Edinger's winning 41-yard field goal moments later.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Mornhinweg tried to explain himself. He said he took
the wind because "all the points in the second half were down at the
other end." (Not that there were many scored on either side of the
field; these were the Lions and Bears playing.) He said he had a lot
of confidence in the Detroit defense and "I simply wanted to put our
team in the best position to win."</TE>
<TE>   When the Lions lost, their 14th road loss in a row, reporters went
hunting for second guesses. Detroit running back James Stewart
acknowledged that "Hindsight's 20/20. He's the head coach. He gets
paid to make those decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Although the educated guess would be: not for much longer.</TE>

<KH>PITTSBURGH 29, CINCINNATI 21</KH>
<HD>Steelers Come Back After Blowing Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>The Pittsburgh Steelers still don't know how to play with a huge
lead. Good thing they were playing the Cincinnati Bengals.</LD>
<LD>   The Steelers frittered away a 17-point lead for the second
consecutive home game, but rallied for a 29-21 victory Sunday after
the bumbling Bengals fumbled away a punt and a late lead.</LD>
<LD>   The Bengals (1-10) led, 21-20, until T.J. Houshmandzadeh's fumbled
punt with 6 1/2 minutes remaining in the game led to rookie Jeff
Reed's third field goal. Jerome Bettis followed with his second
touchdown on a 79-yard rushing day that moved him past O.J. Simpson
into 11th place in career rushing. Bettis has rushed for 11,287
yards.</LD>
<TE>   But when Reed missed the extra point, the Bengals still had a
chance to force overtime. They drove to a first down at the Steeler
five in the final minute before Jon Kitna threw four consecutive
incompletions, with Chad Scott knocking away a pass intended for Chad
Johnson on fourth down.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we just got fed up," Steeler safety Brent Alexander said.
"We all said to each other, 'Don't be the guy to give up the
touchdown." '</TE>
<TE>   In a similar situation last week, Corey Dillon twice couldn't get
into the end zone from the one in the final minute of the Bengals'
27-20 loss to Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   "I say it over and over, but it's true," Johnson said. "It's just
a play here and a play there. We don't make a play and it kills us."</TE>
<TE>   Kordell Stewart replaced the injured Tommy Maddox and completed 22
of 26 passes for 236 yards, but the Steelers (6-4-1) stalled for more
than two quarters after surging to a 17-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like a kid playing in a sandbox," Stewart said, and not
just because the sandy Heinz Field turf was in terrible shape. "I was
excited just to have an opportunity again."</TE>
<TE>   Especially since Maddox, who made a quick recovery from the scary
injury in Tennessee last week that left him temporarily paralyzed,
might return Sunday against Jacksonville. Coach Bill Cowher will
decide after Maddox sees his doctor early this week.</TE>
<TE>   Hines Ward, who had his third consecutive 100-yard game, became
the first Steeler receiver with consecutive 1,000-yard seasons since
Roy Jefferson (1968-69).</TE>

<HD>Sherman, Sapp Exchange Words After Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Green Bay Coach Mike Sherman angrily confronted Tampa Bay's Warren
Sapp after the Packers' 21-7 loss to the Buccaneers on Sunday at
Tampa, Fla., complaining that the All-Pro defensive tackle knocked
one of his players out of the game with a cheap shot.</LD>
<LD>   Sapp denied the accusation and said he was stunned Sherman came up
to him and initiated an obscenity-laced exchange after the player
finished a television interview on the field.</LD>
<LD>   "He cursed at me. He said something to set me off," Sapp said,
declining to say what Sherman said.</LD>
<TE>   When Sapp responded to the coach, a member of the Buccaneer
public-relations staff intervened and held the player away from
Sherman, who was restrained by a Packer assistant coach. At one point
in the shouting match, Sapp screamed at Sherman: "If you think you're
so tough, why don't you put on a jersey?"</TE>
<TE>   Sherman was upset about a block Sapp made on Packer offensive
tackle Chad Clifton during Brian Kelly's return of a third-quarter
interception. Clifton was pursuing Kelly, but was not close to him.</TE>
<TE>   Sapp appeared to hit Clifton in the front of the right shoulder.
Clifton injured his right hip and was taken to the locker room on a
cart. Sherman felt Sapp celebrated Clifton being down on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "When a guy is numb on the ground, you're responsible, and you're
happy about it, it bothers me a little bit. Warren's a great player.
I just said I didn't appreciate that type of play."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Clifton's teammates, including Brett Favre, said they'd
have to see the film before commenting on whether the hit was legal.
Sherman thought it was questionable and felt Sapp made it worse by
celebrating.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think there's any place in the game for that,"
Sherman said. "Maybe I overreacted to the hit. But what I saw looked
kind of cheap. But who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Sapp was not penalized on the play.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got two or three blockers on me. We get a pick, Brian Kelly
is running all over the field. I see a guy going at my man, I put a
lick on him. What's the problem?" Sapp said. "I didn't hit him below
the waist, there's no flag on the play. Is this not a contact sport?</TE>
<TE>   "Nine referees on the field didn't find anything wrong with it,
and I'm sure they're looking at 99 [Sapp's number]," Sapp said. "I
don't care if they review it. It's nothing but the man's running
after the ball and I put a lick on him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver kicker Jason Elam missed his first extra-point attempt
since his rookie season of 1993 Sunday against the Indianapolis
Colts.</TE>
<TE>   Elam had made an NFL-record 371 consecutive extra points until his
miss. His kick hit the left upright and caromed left. He has made 397
of 399 extra points in his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's key injuries:</TE>
<TE>   * Chicago quarterback Chris Chandler sprained his left ankle in
the third quarter against Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   * Atlanta linebacker John Holecek broke his right arm against
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   * St. Louis left guard Tom Nutten suffered a broken leg against
Washington.</TE>

<KH>WASHINGTON 20, ST. LOUIS 17</KH>
<HD>Rams Fumble Away a Big Opportunity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LANDOVER, Md.</DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Rams were just a chip-shot field goal away from
overtime when Kurt Warner lost the ball.</LD>
<LD>   LaVar Arrington made the strip, and Daryl Gardener made the
recovery at the 13. The Washington Redskins won, 20-17, Sunday,
giving Coach Steve Spurrier an improbable victory based on defense,
ball control and an error-free game from Danny Wuerffel.</LD>
<LD>   "We would like to have had a little less drama, but we'll take the
win any way we can," said Wuerffel, who completed 16 of 23 passes for
235 yards with no interceptions and no sacks.</LD>
<TE>   Stephen Davis scored three touchdowns and ran for 88 yards in 31
carries. The Redskins (5-6), who had an 86-37 pass-run ratio in
losing their previous two games, passed only 24 times and ran 39.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we're in position to go to Dallas with a little bit of
momentum," Spurrier said. "Hopefully we'll play a little better than
we did today and get back into whatever playoff race there is."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams are also 5-6, and their playoff hopes are just as faint
as those of the Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   Said Ram receiver Torry Holt: "It's a five-game season. We have to
go 5-0."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams had won five in a row to get from 0-5 to 5-5, and they
were down, 20-10, in the fourth quarter before Warner helped bring
them back.</TE>
<TE>   The final drive started at the Ram 20 with 3:28 remaining. Using
short passes and runs, Warner moved the team downfield until his
fumble on first-and-goal at the six with 17 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Ram Coach Mike Martz faulted himself for calling the wrong play.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a shame to come back and play like that at the end and not
win." Martz said. "I just made a bad call at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Warner said he never saw Arrington coming.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those where you kind of start to feel him and try to
look for somebody," Warner said. "But not to the point where I
thought he was coming free and had a clean shot at me."</TE>
<TE>   The play spoiled Warner's return after missing five games because
of a broken finger. He completed his first 15 passes and then lead a
masterful touchdown drive -- going nine for 10 and connecting with
Ricky Proehl for a five-yard touchdown to make it 20-17 with 6:08
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Warner was 34 for 49 for 301 yards with two touchdowns and one
interception. "It doesn't matter how I did," he said. "We didn't
win."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams' five-game win streak came with Marc Bulger at
quarterback. Bulger was listed as the third quarterback Sunday after
he was unable to get a good grip on the ball in pregame warmups.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams were also missing Marshall Faulk, who sat out his second
consecutive game with foot and ankle injuries.</TE>

<HD>Far-Right Freedom Party Fizzles in Austrian Election</HD>
<DH>Experts say dismal showing signals political end of Joerg
Haider. Conservatives win 42%, forcing another coalition government.</DH>

<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>Once the symbol of the growing power of Europe's far right, Austrian
politician Joerg Haider could find himself left out in the political
cold after his party's dismal showing in Sunday's parliamentary
election.</LD>
<LD>   Haider's Freedom Party garnered 10% of the vote, a sharp drop from
the 27% the party won in the 1999 nationwide elections. The
conservative People's Party, led by Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel,
came out on top with 42%, followed by the Social Democrats with just
under 37%. The Greens party came in last with 9%.</LD>
<LD>   The Freedom Party played on Austrian fears of immigration and the
economic impact of European Union expansion, a strategy that proved
less successful this time than when its second-place finish in 1999
propelled it into government. A power struggle within Freedom Party
ranks led to the coalition's collapse in September, precipitating
Sunday's elections.</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to defections from the Freedom Party, the People's Party
won nearly 16 percentage points more than in 1999. However, the party
failed to secure a majority, forcing negotiations with Freedom or the
Social Democrats on forming a government.</TE>
<TE>   According to recent polls, a majority of Austrians prefer a
renewal of a "grand coalition" between the People's Party and the
Social Democrats, which in one form or another has governed Austria
for most of the postwar period.</TE>
<TE>   But relations between the two parties have been increasingly
antagonistic, and Social Democratic backbenchers are opposed to
joining the government as a junior partner. Schuessel is leaving his
options open, saying only that "nothing has been decided."</TE>
<TE>   The People's Party may find it easier to work with the Freedom
Party, despite the breakdown of its partnership, because its clear
electoral advantage would enable it to dictate far better terms this
time. One of those terms could be putting Haider on the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not Haider's end, but it is the beginning of his political
end," said Anton Pelinka, a political scientist at the University of
Innsbruck. "For the first time, significant segments, and not only
single persons, in his own party have opposed him openly, and the
general attitude [toward him] is almost ridiculing."</TE>
<TE>   The charismatic Haider, who has praised Adolf Hitler's economic
policy and referred to Nazi concentration camps as "punishment
camps," engineered the Freedom Party's rise from a marginal
opposition party to a major political player. After the strong
electoral showing, the Freedom Party joined the government in early
2000, prompting Austria's fellow European Union member countries to
temporarily suspend diplomatic ties in protest.</TE>
<TE>   Haider, who is also governor of Austria's Carinthia province, then
stepped down as head of the party, ostensibly to ease tensions.
Nevertheless, supporters and opponents alike still considered him the
de facto leader of the party.</TE>
<TE>   An internal power struggle between hard-line Haider loyalists and
the party's mainstream conservatives ensued, triggering the
resignations of top Freedom Party ministers, including party head and
Vice Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer, in September. That in turn led
Schuessel to dissolve the coalition and call elections a year earlier
than expected.</TE>
<TE>   The Freedom Party, struggling under new leadership, had little
time to mobilize voters, and Haider did not enter the campaign fray
until two weeks before the election.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his reputation as a consummate campaigner, Haider's
belated involvement did little to enhance the party's standing with
voters.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you motivate voters when you destroyed your own party?"
said Peter Hajek, a political analyst at the public opinion research
firm OGM in Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   Haider's increasingly erratic behavior didn't help. He visited
Iraq three times this year, twice to meet with President Saddam
Hussein, most recently in early November. He repeatedly threatened to
retire from federal politics, only to return, a gambit that appears
to have irritated voters.</TE>
<TE>   Haider's abrupt fall from grace hardly seemed possible two years
ago, when the Freedom Party appeared to be at the vanguard of
Europe's rightward march. Media commentators across Europe spoke of a
"Haiderization" of continental politics as far-right parties scored
startling electoral gains in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and
Italy.</TE>
<TE>   With Austrian voters disenchanted with Haider, some analysts
predict that the Freedom Party firebrand will eschew domestic
politics and seek to lead a pan-European far-right grouping, possibly
in the EU's Parliament. However, the Freedom Party's implosion and
subsequent election defeat have greatly reduced Haider's standing.</TE>
<TE>   "He still can have a destabilizing impact on Austrian and European
politics, but it will be much less important than in the past," said
Pelinka.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Coup Leader Is New President of Ecuador</HD>
<DH>Left-leaning political novice Lucio Gutierrez defeats a
billionaire. He has promised to fight corruption, though he is short
on details.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>QUITO, Ecuador</DL>
<LD>In a stunning turn of events, a left-leaning former army colonel
declared victory in Ecuador's presidential election Sunday, just two
years after he was jailed for leading a coup.</LD>
<LD>   With 97% of the vote counted, former Col. Lucio Gutierrez had a
commanding lead over billionaire banana magnate Alvaro Noboa, 54.4%
to 45.6%.</LD>
<LD>   Gutierrez, a political unknown who has never held elected office,
ran a campaign short on details and long on promises. One of his main
pledges was to fight corruption. Some voters feared that he might
pattern his rule after another former coup leader, Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez, whose fiery rhetoric has deeply divided his
nation.</LD>
<TE>   As results rolled in Sunday showing him ahead, Gutierrez attempted
to reassure his country and the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Ecuadoreans, what you have here is a very centered man, a very
calm man, a very tolerant man," he said, asking for unity and
promising to lead through consensus. "I want to signal my commitment
to human rights, to private property, to the right to life, to the
right to education and health."</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez's apparent victory is the latest sign of the discontent
sweeping Latin America after a decade in which more open markets and
conservative governments failed to deliver promised improvements in
living standards. Both Brazil and Venezuela have elected left-leaning
governments recently, and Argentina remains in political turmoil
after the collapse of its banking system.</TE>
<TE>   The results in Ecuador are also a sign of increasing unhappiness
with traditional political parties in Latin America, which have come
to be seen as corrupt machines out of touch with ordinary people.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe that ideology was relevant," said Adrian Bonilla,
a political analyst who works for a think tank in Quito, the capital.
"It was more that he was seen as anti-establishment, someone who was
against politics and against the traditional political parties."</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez's only previous participation in politics was his role
in the ouster of former President Jamil Mahuad two years ago amid a
banking and corruption crisis. Gutierrez was the most senior military
official involved.</TE>
<TE>   His ad hoc political party, stitched together from the support of
unions, military officers and a small Marxist party, has only 15 of
the 100 seats in Congress, meaning he will have to govern through
alliances.</TE>
<TE>   In the first round of voting, Gutierrez's campaign had a
distinctly leftist tone. But he veered sharply to the center as
Sunday's runoff approached, meeting with International Monetary Fund
officials in Washington and reaching out to businessmen and bankers.</TE>
<TE>   He pledged to repay the oil-rich country's international debts and
continue the process of dollarization. Ecuador dropped its national
currency in favor of the U.S. dollar in 2000. The move prevented
economic collapse that year but has made the country's exports less
competitive in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez also softened his opposition to allowing Washington to
use a military base in the coastal town of Manta, saying he would
abide by an existing agreement letting U.S. planes conduct anti-drug
spying missions from there.</TE>
<TE>   The moves were seen as a positive sign by U.S. foreign policy
experts, who say Gutierrez is joining a block of recently elected
Andean presidents -- including Alvaro Uribe in Colombia and Alejandro
Toledo in Peru -- who have expressed a desire to work with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than being a second Chavez, who has been hostile to the
United States, analysts said Gutierrez seems likely to become an ally
in a region where Washington has long had troubled relationships.</TE>
<TE>   "He's more sophisticated, better educated and has the advantage of
being able to see what happened to Chavez," said Richard Feinberg, a
UC San Diego professor and Latin America expert. "He has made every
effort to distance himself from Chavez."</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador's pronounced regionalism, which divides the country
between the more relaxed, liberal voters on the coast and the more
traditional, conservative voters in the highlands, also played a role
in the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Noboa, who is from the coast, captured two of every three votes in
the region. But that was not enough to overcome Gutierrez, a native
of Quito, who won three of every four votes in the highlands.</TE>
<TE>   Though both men adopted similar populist campaign platforms, their
biographies offered voters a stark choice.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez first came into the public eye on Jan. 21, 2000, when he
joined a group of indigenous protesters to briefly overthrow Mahuad's
government.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez quickly turned over control to a senior commander, then
stepped down. Gustavo Noboa, no relation to Alvaro Noboa, was
subsequently appointed president, and Gutierrez spent six months in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than expressing regret for his role in the coup during the
campaign, Gutierrez made it a selling point. He named his political
party after the date of the overthrow and took to wearing a fake
green military uniform at campaign rallies.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his parallels with Chavez, also a former military
commander, Gutierrez denied any similarity.</TE>
<TE>   "We are two different people," he said. "I am a fan of governing
with consensus. I will look for unity among all Ecuadoreans. I will
govern with businessmen, with bankers, with social movements, with
political parties."</TE>
<TE>   With his dark skin and anti-corruption platform, Gutierrez, a
former pentathlete and engineer, appealed to indigenous groups that
make up about 40% of the population of 13 million.</TE>
<TE>   He promised to crack down on graft and improve health coverage and
living conditions for the nearly 80% of the population that lives in
poverty. He even sent out his running mate, a doctor, with medical
teams to treat the poor.</TE>
<TE>   However, Gutierrez has never clearly spelled out how he would pay
for his programs. He said he would announce both his Cabinet and his
economic plan only after being elected. He is to be sworn in Jan. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Ecuadoreans who voted for Gutierrez cited his fight against
corruption, as well as his humble origins.</TE>
<TE>   "We are with the colonel, because the colonel has demonstrated
that he will defend the middle class," said Segundo Achina, 77. Noboa
"is one of the country's biggest millionaires."</TE>
<TE>   Noboa, 52, inherited a vast fortune from his father, who created a
banana and shipping empire that is believed to account for as much as
5% of the country's gross domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   A fluent English speaker, Noboa spends up to six months a year
living on Park Avenue in New York. On the final day of the campaign,
he won a court battle against two sisters who were battling for
control of the billion-dollar business.</TE>
<TE>   Noboa had blanketed TV with ads promising cheap homes, better
health care and more education. He pledged to make Ecuador into an
"empire" with a huge middle class.</TE>
<TE>   Outspending Gutierrez five to one, Noboa also went on the attack
against the former coup leader, accusing him of being a communist and
a wife-beater and having links with leftist Colombian guerrillas who
make frequent incursions into Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   He even ran a commercial featuring images from the Venezuelan coup
that briefly ousted Chavez in April, suggesting that Gutierrez would
lead Ecuador -- never known for its political stability -- down a
similar path.</TE>
<TE>   Late Sunday, Noboa conceded the election.</TE>
<TE>   "I will continue fighting, as I have all my life, to resolve the
economic problems of Ecuador," he said, standing with his wife and
children in the courtyard of a grain factory he owns in the coastal
town of Guayaquil.</TE>
<TE>   Voters who backed Noboa seemed to believe that the businessman
would have been better able to deliver new jobs and an improved
economy.</TE>
<TE>   "He has lots of factories in Ecuador, and he has made them
bigger," said Ivan Torres, 32, sitting at a river walkway in
Guayaquil a few days before the vote. "Plus, since he has so much
money, he won't need to steal any more from the government."</TE>
<TE>   But many voters seemed turned off by both candidates. More than
one in 10 either chose "none of the above" or ripped up their
ballots. Voting is mandatory in Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   Many cited the candidates' lack of political experience and the
promises made with no apparent way to achieve them.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't trust either of them," said Javier Velasco, 31.</TE>

<HD>Iraqis Protest Fine Print</HD>
<DH>U.N. resolution's wording is a setup for U.S. attack,
foreign minister says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>In a point-by-point protest, the Iraqi government told the United
Nations this weekend that the fine print behind the weapons
inspections set to begin this week will give Washington a pretext to
attack.</LD>
<LD>   The new U.N. Security Council resolution on the inspections could
turn "inaccurate statements [among] thousands of pages" of required
Iraqi reports into a supposed justification for military action,
Foreign Minister Naji Sabri said in a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</LD>
<LD>   "There is premeditation to target Iraq, whatever the pretext,"
Sabri said.</LD>
<TE>   His lengthy letter, dated Saturday and made public Sunday, was not
expected to affect the inspections, which are to resume Wednesday
after a four-year hiatus. Iraq accepted the resolution in a Nov. 13
letter.</TE>
<TE>   Preparations moved ahead on Baghdad's outskirts Sunday, where
technicians at the U.N. inspection center worked to establish a "hot
line" with the Iraqi government.</TE>
<TE>   The first working group of 18 inspectors is to arrive today on a
flight from Cyprus.</TE>
<TE>   Resolution 1441, unanimously adopted by the Security Council on
Nov. 8, demands that Iraq give up any chemical, biological or nuclear
weapons, or face "serious consequences."</TE>
<TE>   It requires Iraq to submit an accounting by Dec. 8 of its weapons
programs, as well as of chemical, biological and nuclear projects
that it says are peaceful.</TE>
<TE>   Sabri's letter said a key passage on providing documentation is
unjust, "because it considers the giving of inaccurate statements --
taking into consideration that there are thousands of pages to be
presented in those statements -- is a material breach" of the
resolution's requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Sabri wrote that the aim was clear: "to provide pretexts ... to be
used in aggressive acts against Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   The foreign minister's letter disputed allegations that his
government has retained chemical or biological weapons and rebuilt
weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States and Britain failed to give one credible proof
on this matter," Sabri wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote of what he called arbitrary powers being granted to
inspectors, including meeting Iraqi scientists "inside their country
without the presence of a representative of their government, or
asking them to leave the country with their families to meet [for
interviews] abroad."</TE>
<TE>   Sabri urged Security Council member nations to ensure that the
weapons inspectors are committed "to their obligations according to
the U.N. Charter and ... the United Nations' goals." If they do so,
he wrote, they will "uncover the false U.S. accusations."</TE>

<HD>S. Korean Soccer Chief Drops Candidacy</HD>
<DH>Hyundai scion throws his support behind ruling party
candidate in presidential race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Chung Mong Jun, the charismatic mogul credited with organizing the
World Cup, dropped out of the contest to become South Korea's next
president and pledged to support the candidate of the ruling party.</LD>
<LD>   Dejected and appearing on the verge of tears, Chung announced his
decision early today after a specially commissioned poll showed him
slightly behind Roh Mu Hyun, a protege of President Kim Dae Jung.</LD>
<LD>   "I will give my full support for [Roh's] victory in the election,"
Chung told supporters in an uncharacteristically terse speech at his
campaign headquarters. He and Roh had agreed earlier that the weaker
candidate would drop out of the race.</LD>
<TE>   Chung's withdrawal may give new life to Roh's flagging campaign
and raises hopes for supporters of the South's "sunshine policy" of
engagement with North Korea. Roh, a 55-year-old human rights lawyer,
is a leading voice in the liberal political camp in South Korea. If
both he and Chung had remained in the race, it was a virtual
certainty that conservative Lee Hoi Chang would emerge the victor on
election day, Dec. 19.</TE>
<TE>   The 50-year-old Chung, handsome, multilingual and rich, had added
a touch of panache to an otherwise colorless contest. As a vice
president of FIFA, world soccer's governing body, he rose to
prominence this year when South Korea co-hosted the World Cup with
Japan. An heir to the giant Hyundai conglomerate, which has led the
South Korean business community in investing in North Korea, Chung
supports continued aid to the impoverished communist state.</TE>
<TE>   The revelation in October that North Korea was violating a pledge
not to develop nuclear weapons threw a wrench into the political
equations. It tilted the South Korean electorate to the right and put
Lee strongly in the lead. Lee, 67, the head of the opposition Grand
National Party and a former supreme court justice, finished second
behind Kim in the 1997 presidential election. Kim is barred by the
constitution from seeking another five-year term.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent poll, taken Sunday by the South Korean newspaper
Dong-A Ilbo, showed Lee slightly behind with 37.5% of the vote
compared with 41.1% for Roh.</TE>
<TE>   But political analysts said Chung's withdrawal gave a bounce to
Roh's candidacy that probably cannot be maintained for the three
weeks remaining until the election. A minor labor party candidate
also is running.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it will depend on North Korea's behavior. If North Korea
behaves well in the coming weeks, it will be a big help for Roh,"
said Hahm Sung Deuk, a political scientist at Korea University in
Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Lee has been an articulate critic of the sunshine policy, which he
says is too indulgent toward North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the conservative opposition party over the weekend
criticized the deal between Roh and Chung as a "dirty political
collaboration."</TE>
<TE>   "Their collaboration is an act of deception for the people," Lee
said Sunday while campaigning in Kwangju.</TE>
<TE>   Roh dismissed the allegations. In a speech to supporters just
after midnight today, he said, "We were able to give people a renewed
hope in politics by providing them a chance to witness concession and
fair play in politics."</TE>

<HD>Jerusalem Shows Low Tolerance for Museum</HD>
<DH>A proposed institute faces a rival Holocaust center, a
tough economy and regional strife.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alissa J. Rubin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>At first glance, few places on Earth seem like better candidates for
a museum of tolerance than Israel, where Jews and Palestinians kill
one another almost daily and mutual hatreds seem rooted in the stony
soil.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli-Palestinian dispute is just one of the fault lines:
secular Jews versus religious Jews, Israeli Arabs versus Israeli
Jews.</LD>
<LD>   In such an atmosphere, the formal launch Sunday by the Simon
Wiesenthal Center of its plan to build a Museum of Tolerance, drawing
on the center's successful experience with its museum of the same
name in Los Angeles, seemed almost like an impossible act.</LD>
<TE>   "Promoting tolerance and human dignity is one of mankind's
unfinished challenges," said Ehud Olmert, Jerusalem's mayor, who
pushed hard to bring the museum to his city.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed museum has long generated controversy in Israeli
newspapers and magazines. Yad Vashem, the renowned Holocaust museum
here, lobbied behind the scenes to discourage the center from going
ahead with its plans, which Yad Vashem saw as competition. Some
Jerusalem natives bristled at the proposed museum's design, by
leading American architect Frank O. Gehry, which is unorthodox by the
standards of this ancient city.</TE>
<TE>   A number of groups that promote coexistence between Muslims and
Jews asked why it was necessary to spend $150 million to build a
museum to promote tolerance when there were so many programs underway
to work on such issues.</TE>
<TE>   And there was the economic reality: Since the armed violence began
here 25 months ago, tourism has all but vanished, leading many people
to question whether anyone will come to a museum in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   But none of that daunted the force behind the project, Rabbi
Marvin Hier, the founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center and
its Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The realities and repercussions of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict were "known to everyone involved in this project, and we
thought maybe we should postpone it," Hier said. "And then we
thought: No, the most important thing for an American Jewish
organization is to say we want to have a stake and we're coming in
bad times; we want to do it now."</TE>
<TE>   Hier said the Wiesenthal Center is committed to privately raising
$150 million for the building and $50 million more to serve as an
endowment -- huge amounts by Israeli standards and unimaginable by
Palestinian ones. Hier, who is known as an indefatigable fund-raiser,
will not say how much has already been raised or pledged. But he said
his visit to Israel over the last few days brought in far more money
than he had expected.</TE>
<TE>   "We're well on our way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The project also relies on contributions from the city of
Jerusalem and the Israeli government, which gave the museum the land
-- a parcel in downtown Jerusalem adjacent to Independence Park. The
three-acre campus on which the museum will be built will include a
conference center, a theater, an education center, a library and
interactive, state-of-the-art multimedia exhibits. It is slated to be
completed by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   In deference to Yad Vashem, the Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance
agreed to avoid dealing with the Holocaust and focus instead on the
history of intolerance prior to the Holocaust and on the
post-Holocaust period, particularly terrorism and anti-Semitism, Hier
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be superfluous in Jerusalem, just a few miles from Yad
Vashem, to do that work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite those public assurances, Yad Vashem officials remain
skeptical that the new museum will be able to avoid the Holocaust,
and they are clearly irritated that it has received backing from the
government. In open letters published in local media, some members of
the public also questioned whether it is possible to deal with
tolerance and intolerance without a discussion of the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   "Yad Vashem does not see the need to build an additional Holocaust
museum in Jerusalem that will utilize state land and public funds,"
said a statement released by the museum.</TE>
<TE>   "The center was granted highly desirable land in the center of the
city without a public bid. In addition, the Tolerance Museum, which
is run by a private organization, will use public funds to maintain
the center's activities."</TE>
<TE>   The Wiesenthal museum will ask for taxpayer support once it is up
and running.</TE>
<TE>   Even harder is the touchy subject of how the museum will deal with
Israeli-Palestinian relations. Hier says organizers will market the
museum to Arabs as well as Israelis, and he points to the Los Angeles
museum's success in attracting people of all faiths and from such
disparate groups as gang members and police officers.</TE>
<TE>   However, veterans of Jerusalem's charged atmosphere, who support
the goal of mutual understanding between the two communities, see
many difficulties ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, what Israel needs is tolerance," said Larry Abramson,
former head of the fine arts department at Bezalel Academy in
Jerusalem. "Does it need a museum of tolerance? I'm not sure.</TE>
<TE>   "Any true concept or forum for tolerance has to have equal
representation on both sides, not just symbolic involvement."</TE>
<TE>   The museum's organizers are vague about how they will involve the
two sides, especially because relations have deteriorated to such a
point that Palestinians and Israelis rarely work together on public
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center, who also came to Jerusalem, acknowledged the challenge. "We
have to do our best to reach out across the board. We have a lot of
challenges and obstacles to bridge.... But a lot of the questions
will vanish the day we open our doors."</TE>

contestants left the country and flew to London, where organizers
have moved the event. However, the governor of Kaduna, the center
point of the rioting, warned that anyone found to be inciting
violence would be shot on sight.</LD>
<LD>   The Nigerian Red Cross counted 215 bodies on the streets and in
mortuaries in Kaduna, 100 miles north of the capital, Abuja, said
Emmanuel Ijewere, president of the group. Previous estimates said
about 100 people were killed.</LD>
<TE>   An unknown number of other bodies were believed to have been
buried by family members, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The violence began after a newspaper said last week that Islam's
founding prophet would have chosen a Miss World contestant for a
wife.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Kaduna residents tried to recover what they could from
their destroyed homes.</TE>
<TE>   At least 22 churches and eight mosques were destroyed in the
mayhem, said Shehu Sani of the Civil Rights Congress in Kaduna.</TE>

<LD>Physically, he was the smallest man in the American Legion hall,
stooped under the weight of bronze medals and rows of pinned ribbons.</LD>
<LD>   But he was a hero to every man in the room. Retired Col. Aaron
Bank, founder of the Green Berets, turned 100 on Saturday, and nearly
200 Army Special Forces soldiers and their families turned out Sunday
at American Legion Post 291 in Newport Beach to celebrate.</LD>
<LD>   "He's the one you look up to. He's the icon," said Mike Johnston,
a retired Army captain from Newport Beach who helped organize the
event. "Any warrior would be proud to do just one of the things he
did. To start at 38, that alone is amazing."</LD>
<TE>   Bank, who grew up speaking three languages in New York City,
enlisted in the military in 1940. Considered too old for the regular
Army, he volunteered for the Office of Special Services.</TE>
<TE>   In 1944, he went AWOL from a hospital in Algiers and parachuted
behind German lines to aid the French Resistance. He led a mission to
capture Adolf Hitler that was aborted after reports that the Nazi
leader had killed himself. Later, Bank rescued prisoners of war in
Indochina and conversed with Ho Chi Minh.</TE>
<TE>   In 1951, he helped the Army form the elite Green Beret unit and
was its first commander. "He was the father of the Green Berets,
which grew from a military afterthought to a separate unit," read a
plaque presented by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Proclamations, letters from governors and generals, and other
accolades were read Sunday. There were two giant cakes decorated with
green berets.</TE>
<TE>   Bank returned the adulation of the audience, saying, "Special
Forces, because of their mission, attracts the finest type of young
American.... I adored the men below me. I always tried to be fair to
them."</TE>

<LD>A woman's body was found in a trash bag by a Caltrans crew clearing
brush along southbound Interstate 5 on Saturday morning, according to
police.</LD>
<LD>   The badly decomposed remains were sent to the Los Angeles County
coroner for identification. "At this time, we're unable to tell how
old the person was or even what nationality they were," said Officer
Alan dela Pena, of the Whittier Police, which patrols the area.</LD>
<LD>   Police are investigating the discovery as a homicide, but Dela
Pena said the victim could have been a transient who used the bag to
stay warm.</LD>

<HD>Activist to Head Agency on Mexicans in U.S.</HD>
<DH>Some worry Candido Morales, a newcomer to big-time
politics, won't be effective.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Garrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexican officials swooped into Candido Morales' small-town life
earlier this fall and plunked him onto the world stage, unexpectedly
appointing the quiet American social worker as Mexico's point man for
immigrants in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Morales, a 57-year-old immigrant from Oaxaca, faces a daunting
job: He must address the fraying marriage between an estimated 20
million Mexicans living in the United States and their sometime
suitor, Mexican President Vicente Fox.</LD>
<LD>   He must build a new organization for Mexican immigrants while
negotiating politics on both sides of the border. And all the while,
he must contend with U.S. critics who say he does not understand
Mexican politics and was picked as director of the Institute for
Mexicans Abroad precisely because he is expected not to make waves.</LD>
<TE>   "He is a go-between. He is not a problem solver," said Felipe
Aguirre, spokesman for a group called Mexicans in the United States,
which advocates giving immigrants a political voice in both
countries. "I wish him well, but the whole point of this is basically
to shove the problem under the rug."</TE>
<TE>   But the potential of the job is huge -- both for the immigrants
and the country from which they came. Mexicans in the United States
send an estimated $9.2 billion a year south, equivalent in value to
Mexico's tourism industry and second only to oil and manufacturing as
a source of national income. They also influence relatives back home
politically and, in the future, may even be able to vote in Mexican
elections.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about a new, transnational politics," said Rafael
Fernandez de Castro, a Mexico City specialist on U.S.-Mexico
relations. "There is a Mexican nation within the U.S. nation.... They
could become a heck of a foreign lobby for Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Morales' job is twofold. He is expected to advocate for and aid
Mexicans living in the United States. But he is also supposed to
harness their political and economic power to help their native
country, to encourage them to "participate in the transformation of
Mexico," said Carlos Gonzalez Gutierrez, head of Latino affairs at
the Mexican Embassy in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Guiding Morales' agenda will be a council of 120 advisors drawn
mostly from within the United States. In a sign of the complicated
politics Morales must negotiate, some Mexican immigrants earlier this
month launched a protest of the way the Mexican government is picking
the advisors, charging that it is undemocratic.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the right way to handle the Mexican immigrants in the
U.S.," said Carlos Villanueva, president of Pasadena-based Worldwide
Assn. of Mexicans Abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The council's first meeting is set for December. Observers say
major issues are likely to include proposals to legalize undocumented
workers in the United States and ways to reduce the often-huge fees
charged for wiring money back to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Morales moved from his house near his parents' home in
the tiny Sonoma County town of Windsor to an apartment in Mexico
City.</TE>
<TE>   He said he cannot discuss specifics of his agenda until the
advisory council meets, but he has already embarked on a dizzying
series of trips to U.S. cities to meet with Mexican and Mexican
American groups.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's Economy</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month he popped in at UCLA for a symposium on human
rights and Mexican migrants. Sitting beneath a poster of crosses
representing all those who have died traversing the border, Morales
talked of improving Mexico's economy so people won't feel compelled
to emigrate in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Then, even before the piping hot empanadas had been served,
Morales was out the door, headed for Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA professor James Wilkie, who helped organize the conference,
said he was moved by the responsibilities that have suddenly landed
on Morales' shoulders. He also noted that, six weeks into Morales'
tenure as a jet-setting diplomat, the Mexican government had yet to
give him a cell phone to help him stay in touch on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a leader who had breakfast with his parents every morning,
and now he has to negotiate Mexico," said Wilkie. "It's probably not
humanly possible for anyone."</TE>
<TE>   "He's kind of humbly innocent," the professor said. "Maybe it's
refreshing to get someone in this position who doesn't claim to know
it all."</TE>
<TE>   Knows the Struggles</TE>
<TE>   As Morales climbed into a taxi after the UCLA appearance, he
seemed unfazed by the politics that swirl around him. His expression
is one of perpetual, thoughtful calm, broken occasionally by a broad
smile.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it doesn't become political," he said. "I'd like to be in
a position where we can work with all parties.... This is grass-roots
work."</TE>
<TE>   He does make one thing clear: He knows the struggles and problems
of the people he represents.</TE>
<TE>   Born in a tiny village in southern Mexico, he is a Mixtec Indian
whose father fled the poverty of Oaxaca for the United States in the
early 1950s, trying to cross the border more than 30 times before
finally settling in Healdsburg, north of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In the days before grapevines marched up the hills and brought
riches to the area, Morales' father worked on a prune farm, passing
his days plucking plums off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   When the younger Morales was 13, he and his mother joined his
father in the United States. Morales can still vividly recall the
utter confusion of sitting in a California classroom as English
flowed over him in wave after unintelligible wave. Salvation came
when a Spanish teacher took him under her wing and tutored him.</TE>
<TE>   Passing Kindness On</TE>
<TE>   He passed the kindness on. Childhood friend Roberto Ramirez, now a
high school calculus and physics teacher, remembers how Morales would
buy Ramirez's lunch for him in the school cafeteria because Roberto's
own English wasn't up to the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Morales went on to Santa Rosa Junior College and Sonoma State
University, where he majored in Chicano studies. After graduation, he
began working with the California Human Development Corp., an
organization that assists farm workers. His colleagues praise him as
a humble man with a gift for relating to others.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a quiet guy, very stoic, and he doesn't get ruffled too
easily," said George Ortiz, founder of the corporation. "He's very
good at meeting people and working collaboratively."</TE>
<TE>   Morales had spent his entire career at the organization, most
recently as communications director. Except for a few years in Oregon
and Washington putting together programs for farm workers, most of
his life has revolved around his small community in the gently
rolling hills, bright sunshine and cool ocean fog of Sonoma County.
Never married, he remained close to his family, living less than a
block from his parents.</TE>
<TE>   Even a foray into the rock 'n' roll culture of the 1970s took
place with his father at his side. The two were part of a band --
Morales played drums -- that performed Mexican music all over
Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Morales had no plans to change the quiet rhythms of his life.</TE>
<TE>   But late this summer came a call from the Mexican Consulate in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Would he be willing to submit his resume to serve on a new group
being set up to advise on Mexicans in the United States?</TE>
<TE>   He did send off a resume and was flabbergasted when he got a call
a few weeks later informing him that officials wanted to interview
him for the top job. The first week of September, Morales learned
that he had beaten out more than 300 other contenders for the post.</TE>
<TE>   Morales' trajectory from absolute outsider to a post in Mexico
City's government underscores the Fox administration's commitment to
migrants in the United States, said Gonzalez Gutierrez of the Mexican
Embassy in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   As an Indian, Morales "represents the minority within the minority
... in the Mexican diaspora," the diplomat said. "The fact that he
has been chosen sends a double message of belonging."</TE>
<TE>   But although they appreciate that message, some Mexican American
activists worry that Morales' outsider status might make things
difficult for him in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "He has helped a tremendous number of Mexican Americans living
here," said Brent Wilkes, executive director of the League of United
Latin American Citizens. "The question is ... if he doesn't know his
way around Mexican politics, will he be able to deliver?</TE>
<TE>   "We hope he's successful. There's a lot riding on it."</TE>

<HD>Only Fed-Up Voters Can Fix State's Damaged System for
Picking Legislators</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE SKELTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California's system for choosing legislators is badly broken. And
only voters can fix it.</LD>
<LD>   The problem: "Closed" primaries combined with districts drawn for
party protection. Together, they're adding up to legislative
extremism. Toss in term limits and it's a formula for producing
ambitious amateurs who are radical or reactionary.</LD>
<LD>   Not in every case, clearly, but that's the trend.</LD>
<TE>   It's not just my gripe. It's a complaint heard all over
Sacramento, especially from business leaders frustrated by leftist
Democrats and uncompromising Republican right-wingers.</TE>
<TE>   Now Garry South, Gov. Gray Davis' chief political strategist, also
is grumbling -- "speaking for myself." Nobody's more of a Capitol
insider than South. And this career pol has concluded that
California's political system -- particularly concerning the
Legislature -- is terribly botched.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think about the whole thing, I get sick to my stomach,"
South says. "It's all I can do to keep my mouth shut."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, South seldom does that.</TE>
<TE>   "I just fear where this political system is headed. It's getting
worse, not better. It's nearly dysfunctional."</TE>
<TE>   The main trouble spots:</TE>
<TE>   Closed primary</TE>
<TE>   We had a popular open primary for two elections. People could vote
for any candidate, regardless of party. Turnout rose.</TE>
<TE>   But party pooh-bahs felt threatened and sued. In 2000, the U.S.
Supreme Court sided with the parties and ruled that California's open
primary violated their right of association. Back we went to a closed
primary, banning cross-party voting. Turnout fell.</TE>
<TE>   Now major business interests are promoting a 2004 ballot measure
to establish another open primary for statewide, legislative and
congressional contests. The new system would be nonpartisan, thus
presumably constitutional. The top two vote-getters, regardless of
party, would run off in November, similar to a race for mayor in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Parties still could influence elections by backing candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The expected result: More moderates winning because a primary
candidate would need to attract a wide range of voters, not just
hard-core Republicans or Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to do something," South says. A nonpartisan primary "is
better than what we have. Going back to the closed primary was a
disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Closed primaries are unhealthy for both the legislative and
executive branches, he says, because they force "Republicans to race
far off to the right and Democrats far off to the left. Neither is
helpful to the political system."</TE>
<TE>   Status quo redistricting</TE>
<TE>   Legislators of both parties conspired last year to gerrymander
legislative and congressional districts in their own interests. They
redrew lines to preserve the political status quo for a decade in all
but a handful of the 173 districts.</TE>
<TE>   Seats became either safely Republican or safely Democrat -- mostly
the latter because Democrats control Sacramento. It means practically
every election is decided in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   Republican incumbents must guard against a primary challenge from
their right. Democrats watch their left. The middle is ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "The fear of being 'primaried' is driving decision-making in
Sacramento," South laments.</TE>
<TE>   "They have no idea how you get a budget passed. You've got
Democrats petrified about cutting spending because it'll tick off a
special interest they'll need to support them.... You've got
Republicans sitting there ... scared to death they'll get 'primaried'
by some anti-taxer."</TE>
<TE>   The solution: Take the decennial redistricting away from the
Legislature and place it in the hands of an independent commission,
perhaps appointed by the state Supreme Court. Voters previously have
rejected such ballot proposals, buying Democratic demagoguery about
"politicizing the courts."</TE>
<TE>   South supports the independent idea: "Ten years ago I wouldn't
have said that. But this [redistricting] was just a joke and so
damaging to the political system, I would favor almost any
alternative."</TE>
<TE>   Term limits</TE>
<TE>   Voters love term limits, but these limits are ludicrous: Three
two-year terms in the Assembly, two four-year stints in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   About the time legislators get the hang of legislating and
government -- like, where to find real waste -- they're sent packing.</TE>
<TE>   Limits should be extended to 12 years in each house.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amateur hour in Sacramento," South says. "That's not what
you want in a state this big....</TE>
<TE>   "People don't have to take the long view [on policy]. The minute
they get there, it's 'What am I going to do in six years?' "</TE>
<TE>   All this -- the closed primary, protectionist redistricting, term
limits -- "is a dastardly combination," South continues. "I'm utterly
disgusted with the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   But nothing will change until voters also get disgusted and fix
it.</TE>

<HD>Stars, Community Team Up to Fund Vietnam War Memorial</HD>
<DH>A benefit concert makes more than $200,000 for the unique
tribute in Westminster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For weeks, Vietnamese-language radio stations in Orange County blared
with pleas for help, and Vietnamese superstars walked door to door,
asking for donations.</LD>
<LD>   Hung Mai and his wife, Oanh, both from Anaheim, said they couldn't
help but get caught up in the fervor.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, Mai and his family joined thousands of spectators in
the largest fund-raising concert staged so far for the new Vietnam
War memorial statue in Westminster, which honors both United States
and South Vietnamese troops.</LD>
<TE>   The bronze statue in the 1.4-acre Freedom Park near Little Saigon
depicts a solemn pair of soldiers standing side by side. The statue
remains cloaked in canvas as workers add the finishing touches.</TE>
<TE>   "They called for the community's help to complete it," Mai said.
"We can't build it halfway and just leave it there. We had to help
too."</TE>
<TE>   The fund-raising extravaganza was sold out and became a joyous
celebration by late afternoon, when organizers announced they had
collected more than $230,000 from ticket sales and donations. The
Westminster War Memorial Committee needed $175,000 to add a black
marble fountain, a memorial urn and flags of the U.S. and the former
South Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers sold 20,000 tickets, and police estimated that more
than 10,000 attended.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long time, and now a lot of people's dreams are
coming true," said organizer Nam Loc Nguyen.</TE>
<TE>   The memorial's grand opening is set April 27, three days before
the 28th anniversary of the fall of Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   "They pulled our flag down. Now we can pull it back up," Nguyen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Flags of the former South Vietnam, the United States and U.S.
military branches hung from chain-link fences during the festivities.
Loudspeakers blared live rap, hip-hop, ballads and country music by
famous Vietnamese singers.</TE>
<TE>   One of the performers, Hung Nguyen of Canada, is the Vietnamese
Ricky Martin. He was swamped by adoring fans backstage. "I wanted to
pay my dues," he said as he signed autographs. "My time is worth the
sacrifice for a good cause."</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first time I see them in person! It's such an excitement
for me!" said Mike Vu, 22, of Camarillo. "The stars definitely
enticed me to go."</TE>
<TE>   Mai, 50, a computer programmer who sat on a blanket with his wife,
couldn't wait to have their children learn about Vietnam's history at
the event. His two daughters and three sons, who range in age from 10
to 20, were born in the United States. They don't speak much
Vietnamese and prefer McDonald's to Vietnamese food, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't understand what happened, why we are in the United
States," Mai said.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife were in college when the communists took over
Vietnam in 1975. Mai avoided capture by the communists, and the
wartime chaos separated the couple until they were reunited in 1979
in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "This community has many differences in politics," Mai said. "But
when it comes to freedom for Vietnam, we're supportive because we've
all suffered at the hands of communism."</TE>

<HD>Landfill Operator Seeks OK to Expand</HD>
<DH>County supervisors will take up Simi Valley dump's request
to add waste capacity and increase acreage. One resident files
complaint.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The operator of the Simi Valley Landfill wants to keep the county's
only garbage dump open for another 30 years instead of closing it in
20 months when its permit expires, according to a proposal to be
reviewed Tuesday by the county Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   Although several nearby residents can see the dump from their
homes, only one has formally complained about the growing mountain of
garbage just north of the Ronald Reagan Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The county Planning Commission endorsed the landfill expansion
plan in October.</LD>
<TE>   Resident Brenda Megerle, who lives about five miles from the
Madera Road site, asked in a letter to the Planning Commission that
appropriate measures be taken to shield the garbage from her backyard
view.</TE>
<TE>   "I am concerned that it has the potential to double what I can see
from my house, so I'm asking that they add some mitigation measures
to prevent that from happening," said Megerle, who lives in the East
Hills neighborhood of Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Landfill operator Waste Management of California wants to increase
the dump's capacity to 29.6 million tons, up from the 16.6 million
allowed under the present permit, said landfill manager Scott Tignac.</TE>
<TE>   The landfill has not yet reached the 16.6-million ton mark but
will do so in about seven years, Tignac said. By increasing capacity
to nearly 30 million tons, the landfill could operate until 2034, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate the increased garbage, Waste Management wants to
expand the landfill's boundaries by 26 acres to 297 acres, onto
property it would acquire next to the dump, Tignac said.</TE>
<TE>   The landfill is allowed to receive up to 3,000 tons of solid waste
per day, and the figure would not change under a new permit, Tignac
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Approval will provide for long-term municipal waste disposal
capacity for eastern Ventura County well into the 21st century,"
county Planning Director Christopher Stephens said in his
recommendation to the board.</TE>
<TE>   Stephens' staff also addressed Megerle's concern about the height
of the solid waste mound, saying landscaping requirements would
improve the view from her backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Recycled green waste and grass are used as coverage, Tignac said.</TE>
<TE>   Legal notices about the Planning Commission's hearing were sent to
all property owners within 2,000 feet of the landfill and to the
cities of Simi Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks. Megerle's was the
only letter received by the county, officials said.</TE>

<HD>New Tijuana Guide Targets Rowdy U.S. Tourists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>The crimes run the gamut: lighting fireworks, making excessive noise,
disobeying an official order, driving while talking on a cell phone.</LD>
<LD>   Fed up with American tourists who break the law during their
cross-border trips, Tijuana city officials have published a colorful
guide advising visitors how to stay out of trouble and where to turn
if they get into legal jams. The guide warns tourists not to pay
bribes to police, suggesting that they instead "politely insist on a
written citation" if officers ask for money.</LD>
<LD>   "We have different legal systems, but the basic rules are the
same," Tijuana Mayor Jesus Gonzalez Reyes said. "Don't do in Tijuana
what you are not able to do in San Diego."</LD>
<TE>   The 14-page pamphlet, which is believed to be the first of its
kind, is available on both sides of the Mexican border, at police
stations, insurance companies and tourist offices. San Diego
officials plan to deliver copies to the area's college campuses and
military bases to reach many of Tijuana's late-night revelers.</TE>
<TE>   The guide is Tijuana's most recent step in an effort to alter its
image from a lawless Wild West border town to a thriving cultural
center. Tijuana has also launched a public relations campaign to draw
tourists to the city's museums and restaurants, and the city's "image
committee" is urging shopkeepers to clean up downtown's Avenida
Revolucion.</TE>
<TE>   Tijuana's head of public safety, Martin Dominguez Rocha, said he
and the mayor are also cracking down on corrupt police officers as
part of the city's transformation. Dominguez acknowledged that some
officers trick tourists into believing they have committed crimes and
then scare them into paying illegal fines.</TE>
<TE>   "This guide will help so [tourists] know if their conduct
constituted a violation of the law and how much the sanction should
be," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Tijuana government, which came up with the idea for the guide
in late summer, has printed 2,000 copies of the pamphlet and 25,000
copies of a smaller brochure. The first round cost $6,000, and Mayor
Gonzalez said he hopes to raise additional funds to print more.</TE>
<TE>   The cover of the guide is hot pink and navy blue, with a
photograph of downtown Tijuana and a friendly warning: "Tijuana is
your home, act like it." Inside, there are answers to questions such
as: What should I do if my vehicle is stolen in Mexico? What happens
if I am caught driving with alcohol on my breath? What should I do if
I find myself in a traffic accident?</TE>
<TE>   The pamphlet also lists what tourists cannot bring into the
country, including guns, cattle feed, homemade food and canned meat.
The fines for the most common violations are listed in both pesos and
dollars. Visitors can expect to pay at least $12 for disorderly
conduct, $21 for being naked in public, $25 for not wearing a seat
belt and $42 for soliciting prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   Tourists who think their fines are unfair, however, can take their
cases to city judges, who are available 24 hours. Mayor Gonzalez said
the judges are "there to help you, there to defend you, there to
advise of the things you can do and the things you cannot do."</TE>
<TE>   An average of five Americans are arrested every day in Tijuana, on
charges ranging from drag racing to murder, according to a
representative from the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana. Police officers on
both sides of the border say they hope the guide will help cut down
on minor crimes.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Assistant Police Chief Adolfo Gonzales said most arrests
occur because tourists, drawn to Tijuana by its drinking age of 18
and its popular bars and dance clubs, are misbehaving and don't think
the laws apply to them.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that, because we are from the United States, we can do
whatever we want," he said. "That's where we get in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Other visitors, however, are victims of crimes in Tijuana and
return to San Diego, frantically asking for police officers to help
find stolen cars or track down robbers.</TE>
<TE>   "They get frustrated with us because they say we're not giving a
police service," Assistant Chief Gonzales said. "But we can't. The
best we can do is take a courtesy report."</TE>
<TE>   The guide provides telephone numbers and addresses of consulates
and tourist offices.</TE>
<TE>   But in case the guide doesn't succeed in keeping tourists out of
trouble, it does offer the address of one other key site -- the city
jail.</TE>

<HD>Hahn, Asian Shipping Lines Reach Accord to Fight Smog</HD>
<DH>The mayor and shippers will work to decrease emissions in
port by using city power.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>Several of the largest shipping lines in Asia have agreed to work
with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power on a program that
supporters hope will clean up air quality at the port of L.A. and at
the same time generate millions of dollars a year for the city
agency.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said in an interview that the
shipping lines will soon begin working with the city's port, the DWP
and environmental agencies to develop plans for shutting off their
engines and plugging into the city's power system while docked at the
port.</LD>
<LD>   That step could have significant impact on regional air quality,
officials said, because so many ships use the port and burn fuel
while there. About 2,200 cargo ship visits occurred at the port in
2001, and each ship stayed an average of two days. The typical
medium-sized cargo ship burns 7 tons of heavy bunker fuel a day while
docked, city officials said.</LD>
<TE>   If successful, the "alternative maritime power" program would be
the first to apply that notion on such a large scale, city officials
said. The U.S. Navy uses a similar model, and cruise ships that dock
in Juneau, Alaska, participate in a similar program. But no other
city offers electrical power of this type for its major shipping
lines.</TE>
<TE>   "The benefits of this will be huge," the mayor said. "We're glad
to be the leaders in this....For years, especially in the fall ...
you can actually see a brown haze over the port because of the ships
running their diesel engines."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, who is winding up a 10-day business trip to Asia, also
announced agreements between the ports of Los Angeles and Shanghai,
among the busiest in the world, to share in initiatives aimed at
improving air and water quality and mitigating other environmental
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   To persuade the shipping lines to agree to the alternative power
program, the mayor met in Tokyo with officials from Nippon Yusen
Kaisha Line and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. While in Shanghai, he plans
to meet with representatives of China Shipping, then Tuesday in Hong
Kong with executives from Orient Overseas Container Line Ltd. On the
final stop of his trip, in Taipei, Hahn plans to meet with executives
from Yang Ming Line and Evergreen Marine Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Together, those are some of the world's largest shipping
companies, and each has indicated willingness to participate in the
program.</TE>
<TE>   For it to work, the shipping lines will need to retrofit their
ships at a cost of about $500,000 each, but ultimately would reclaim
that investment by saving money on the fuel that the ships now have
to carry to run their engines while in port.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the DWP would need to build another underground
substation at the port and make other substantial improvements that
are expected to cost $50 million to $60 million over about 10 years,
according to DWP Executive Director David Wiggs. Those infrastructure
changes could be handled by the municipal utility without increasing
rates to customers, he added.</TE>
<TE>   DWP Could Benefit</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs, who is traveling with the mayor and other city officials
and business executives, said the DWP could generate $25 million to
$30 million a year if the program is successful.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be a model -- it's a source of new income for the
department at the same time we're reducing emissions," Wiggs said in
an interview. "This is the best of both worlds."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Janice Hahn, who is also on the trip, represents the
San Pedro, Wilmington area where air pollution has been a major
concern to residents, and which has been blamed for various health
problems, as well.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who live next door to our port really have suffered as
a result," said Hahn, the mayor's sister. "When those ships have
their engines going in dock, it's black, thick smoke coming out.
That's what we breathe down there."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the economic and air quality benefits of the deal,
she said, there would be indirect advantages. Cleaner air, for
instance, might make it easier to encourage investment and
development in the San Pedro waterfront area.</TE>
<TE>   Environment a Priority</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, a San Pedro resident himself, has pledged "no net
increases" of emissions at the port. And he has encouraged port
officials to make environmental initiatives a priority.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles port is the world's seventh busiest. With 27 major
cargo terminals, the port handles cargo worth $104 billion a year,
making it a linchpin of the regional and even national economy.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they do not think the environmental agreements
will spur the large shipping lines to do business elsewhere. In fact,
Wiggs of the DWP acknowledged that the move has to make economic
sense for these companies.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Wilson, president of the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce, said
the program "is a major step in the right direction to have steamship
operators now realize they have to help solve Southern California's
pollution problems."</TE>
<TE>   Noel Parks, president of the San Pedro and Peninsula Home Owners
Coalition, agreed, with some reservations.</TE>
<TE>   "The devil is in the implementation: It's a very expensive
operation and all the shipping lines have to do is sign off on it,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Given that the mayor is only announcing a research and
development program, the big question is how long will it take?"</TE>
<TE>   "As it stands, the port complex is growing by 6% each year," he
added. "At that rate, the growth will overtake the control effort's
benefits in just one year, and we'll be right back where we started
from.</TE>
<TE>   But Todd Campbell, policy director at the Coalition for Clean Air,
said: "We need the mayor to step in and take charge of this issue
because the port has been dragging its feet on it for at least two
years."</TE>

<HD>Creating a Home for a Headwater</HD>
<DH>Preservationists plan a nature center near a Calabasas
stream that feeds into L.A. River.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karima A. Haynes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying it wants to preserve a piece of the past for future
generations, a San Fernando Valley preservationist group plans to
open a nature center at a natural headwater of the Los Angeles River
in Calabasas.</LD>
<LD>   Mountains Restoration Trust, a Canoga Park-based nonprofit
organization that purchases, restores and preserves open space in the
Santa Monica Mountains, is expected to close escrow early next month
on a six-acre parcel at Mulholland Highway and Old Topanga Canyon
Road that includes a stream that feeds into the river.</LD>
<LD>   The property, known as Headwater Corners, is home to a variety of
ecosystems that provide a window into the area's past and offer clues
to preserve it for the future, trust officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the perfect location to demonstrate a mutually beneficial
coexistence between humans and nature," said Steve Harris, the
trust's president and executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Once escrow closes, the trust intends to spend a year working with
landscape architects, civil engineers, river scientists and other
preservation experts to restore the land and create two nature
centers.</TE>
<TE>   The trust has worked closely with Calabasas, Los Angeles County,
and state and federal officials for several years to acquire and
preserve open space, trust officials said. Since 2000, more than 88
parcels totaling 107 acres valued at more than $7.3 million have been
purchased for $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas, a community of 20,000 in western Los Angeles County,
takes pride in its rustic charm and is willing to enter into
public-private partnerships to protect its mountains and woodlands,
said Mayor Lesley Devine.</TE>
<TE>   "People come here because it's so beautiful -- the natural
terrain, oaks and hawks," Devine said. "There are some cities with
spectacular architecture, but that's not our beauty. It's the natural
beauty that makes the difference here."</TE>
<TE>   Under the development plan, the trust will convert two houses on
the site into interpretive centers where residents and schoolchildren
can learn how to protect the sensitive mountain region in which they
live.</TE>
<TE>   "We come out here with our urban sensibilities and we have no idea
about native plants, wildlife or flood control," Harris said. "We
want to be able to influence our neighbors to protect the health of
what they own."</TE>
<TE>   The former Masson family homestead is one of the two houses that
will be converted into nature centers, Harris said. The 100-year-old
white clapboard house is nestled beneath a canopy of mature oaks and
pines a stone's throw from the headwater.</TE>
<TE>   In its heyday, the single-story dwelling with a fieldstone
foundation was an important stop along a stagecoach route between
Calabasas and Los Angeles because of its proximity to water, a
precious resource in the parched Santa Monica Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The second dwelling, the Bartelle house, is a low-slung,
adobe-style house built in the 1950s. The front of the house features
a glassed-in atrium looking out onto a broad lawn near the edge of
the headwater.</TE>
<TE>   "If I close my eyes -- and block out the sound of the traffic -- I
can almost imagine what it was like here back in 1899," said project
manager Debbie O'Hare, leading a recent tour of the property.</TE>
<TE>   A licensed real estate agent with a passion for the environment,
O'Hare sold two acres she owned to the trust for the nature center
project.</TE>
<TE>   Standing at the edge of the headwater, O'Hare explained that the
narrow stream snaking through a thick stand of trees and brush flows
through Dry Canyon Creek in Calabasas to Arroyo Calabasas in Woodland
Hills and eventually into the Los Angeles River in Canoga Park.</TE>
<TE>   The headwater and its environs support five ecosystems, O'Hare
said: a wetland, coast live oak, coastal sage scrub, native grassland
and valley oak. Preservationists intend to remove nonnative plants to
encourage growth of indigenous species.</TE>
<TE>   "The interpretive centers will help to show the interrelationship
between man and nature," Harris said, "and we will be part of that
educational process."</TE>

<HD>New School Is a Tough Sell in Old Agoura</HD>
<DH>Residents say proposed Jewish campus would add traffic and
noise and harm the tranquillity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a reminder that she lives in a special niche of suburban Los
Angeles, Donna Flint need only step onto her porch at night and gaze
up at the inky sky.</LD>
<LD>   "It's pitch-black because we have no street lights here," said
Flint, a resident of Old Agoura, an equestrian hamlet nestled among
rolling hills. "You can see all the stars. People don't have that in
the city."</LD>
<LD>   Rick Wentz thinks Old Agoura is special too. He thinks its quiet,
rural setting would make an ideal location for a new Jewish day
school. "We view this as the perfect place for a school," said Wentz,
executive vice president of the Heschel West School's board of
directors. "We looked for three or four years to find this site."</LD>
<TE>   But the otherwise laid-back agricultural community is up in arms
over plans to relocate the school on a 73-acre parcel next to the
southeast tip of Old Agoura, a mile west of its current site.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to lose my view, we're going to have lights shining all
night, and the traffic's going to be really horrible," Flint said.</TE>
<TE>   The battle lines were drawn last week when the school released a
draft environmental impact report on the proposed 750-student campus,
while the Old Agoura Homeowners Assn. announced that it has hired
land-use attorney Frank Angel to fight the development plan.</TE>
<TE>   Wentz hopes the opposition will subside once residents of Old
Agoura, a 409-home community that is part of the city of Agoura
Hills, have studied the school's plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be a great neighbor," he said. "We are totally willing to
compromise. So far, their only position has been 'go somewhere else.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Old Agoura -- a mix of seniors and younger, wealthy
people on large lots -- have a reputation for strongly opposing
changes that threaten their tranquil surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   At least three developers have sought to build homes on the vacant
Heschel parcel in recent years but quickly backed away in the face of
formidable opposition. School officials bought the site because it is
the center of Heschel West's future student population.</TE>
<TE>   According to the project's environmental report, the Conejo Valley
area has one of the fastest-growing Jewish populations in North
America. The current school, in leased quarters, is attended by
students through the fifth grade, but the new campus would include
preschool through the eighth grade.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very progressive, humanistic day school," Wentz said.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides say there's no indication of anti-Semitism behind the
opposition. "We would just as soon leave the word 'Jewish' out of
it," said Jess Thomas, president of the homeowners association and a
32-year resident.</TE>
<TE>   One Jewish resident blames the opposition on misinformation. "I
think there's a lot of fear and confusion about what our project is
and what it's going to do to the neighborhood," said Sandy Isaacson,
an Old Agoura resident with three children attending Heschel West. "I
think that we would be the best neighbor that they could ever hope
for."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Thomas has "a drawer full of checks" from neighbors
who have contributed to the legal fund to oppose the school.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of our folks feel this school would be the beginning of the
end," Thomas said. "They moved here for a quiet, peaceful place to
raise their kids and animals. The school would have security lights,
and there would be noise from the kids. It would just be completely
out of place."</TE>
<TE>   The most often cited complaint is the estimated 2,600 car trips
that the school would generate at the Chesebro Road-Ventura Freeway
interchange. Locals already gripe about traffic, particularly since
Agoura High School is on the western border of Old Agoura. The main
east-west byway, Driver Avenue, is choked with vehicles when the
school day starts and ends.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't be able to get in or out," Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental report concludes that increased traffic from the
new school could be eliminated with road widening, left-turn lanes
and traffic signals, which would be partly or entirely funded by
Heschel.</TE>
<TE>   "With those steps, the traffic situation will be better, not
worse," Wentz said.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas is not persuaded. "What they do is interrupt the flow of
traffic, so that it adds to the congestion. They don't increase the
flow."</TE>
<TE>   With the proposed site just outside the city limits on
unincorporated Los Angeles County land, Old Agoura and Agoura Hills
residents have no final say on the project.</TE>
<TE>   The first public hearing is scheduled Dec. 18, when the county
Regional Planning Commission will examine the draft environmental
impact report.</TE>
<TE>   "The document analyzes all the facts," Wentz said, adding that he
hopes to prove that the school "won't have the negative impacts that
the homeowners fear."</TE>

<HD>Empathy at BETA Helps Teens Beat Substance Abuse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Malnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Geraldine started using marijuana when she was 13.</LD>
<LD>   "I was hanging around with friends, trying to fit in," she said.
"I quit for a while. But my friends didn't want me around when I
wasn't using, so I started doing it again."</LD>
<LD>   All she did was "get high and eat and go to sleep," she said.
"Then I got expelled from school."</LD>
<TE>   Geraldine is 14 now, clean and sober, and back in school. And
thanks to a cooperative effort by the Lake Elsinore Unified School
District and the Riverside Recovery organization, she thinks she can
stay that way.</TE>
<TE>   Geraldine is enrolled in Riverside Recovery's BETA (Behavioral
Education Toward Awareness) program. The organization received a
$10,000 grant from last year's Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign. As
part of this year's appeal, The Times is highlighting groups that
serve youths and families in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   BETA was set up by Jack Ketsdever and Otis Johnson to help
adolescents in the Lake Elsinore area who have alcohol- and
drug-related problems. Ten to 15 teenagers are enrolled at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the youngsters attend two group therapy sessions a
week, plus a third session in which their parents are included.</TE>
<TE>   "And once a week, they have a one-on-one with me," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them don't think that all this applies to them," he said,
"but if they stay here long enough, you can break through that
denial."</TE>
<TE>   Substance abuse is not an abstract concept to Ketsdever and
Johnson. Both of them struggled with the problem, and both have been
clean and sober for more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Ketsdever was a successful manager in the oil business when he
developed a drinking problem in the late 1970s. Within a few years,
he was down and out, living on skid row. "Then some drunks pulled a
bunch of mattresses into an empty building and got sober," he said.
Ketsdever was one of them.</TE>
<TE>   In the years that followed, he founded and ran several
substance-abuse programs, including BETA. "It's a program that
stresses the importance of one person helping another," Ketsdever
said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson is usually one of those persons. And these days, Geraldine
is often the other.</TE>
<TE>   "When the school sent me here, I thought it wouldn't work," she
said. "But there is a positive energy in this place, and I really
like it. Otis isn't like a teacher. He's a friend."</TE>
<TE>   A few days ago, Geraldine wrote him a letter.</TE>
<TE>   "Your words and attention have really touched me and helped me to
do better in life," she wrote. "I wake up every morning and say to
myself, 'Geraldine, you are beautiful and I love you.' "</TE>
<TE>   BETA relies on donations from individuals and fund-raising efforts
like the Times Holiday Campaign to finance its program, which costs
about $165,000 a year.</TE>

<LD>Robert Greenburg quit his medical practice six years ago. With it
went the Newport Beach office in the shadow of Hoag Memorial Hospital
Presbyterian, the six-figure income, the house on Lido Isle.</LD>
<LD>   The gynecologist thought he had something more important to do.</LD>
<LD>   He'd made trip after trip to Africa and fallen in love with the
people and the wildlife. He was moved to tears when an elephant came
close enough to touch. The people were so poor, though, and their
health needs so great.</LD>
<TE>   He talked to his mentor, Dr. Leo Lagasse of Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles. "Our only gift was medical things," Lagasse
said. "That's all we know."</TE>
<TE>   So the two men formed Medicine for Humanity. Operating it became
Greenburg's full-time job -- that is, if something qualifies as a job
when you don't get paid. He has taken teams of doctors to developing
countries throughout the world, from Malawi to Croatia to the
Philippines, where they have provided training to physicians and
other health workers in the treatment and prevention of cervical
cancer.Greenburg has volunteers from nearly every major medical
school in the country, including Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Ohio State,
the University of Wisconsin, Stanford and UCLA. About 120 of the
nation's 700 gynecologic oncologists work with Medicine for Humanity,
which Greenburg runs from his rented two-bedroom townhouse in Aliso
Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the greatest thing I've ever done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Greenburg and 10 doctors returned from seven days at
the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where they
treated 183 women.</TE>
<TE>   Rosebud, a four-hour drive from the nearest major urban area,
Rapid City, is one of the poorest areas in the nation. The women
there are loath to travel to doctors because it puts them in an
unfamiliar environment and often means going in bad weather, plus
they lack child care. When Medicine for Humanity shows up, everything
gets done on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   "They bring some phenomenal pathology and surgical
expertise," said Dr. Timothy Ryschon, who heads the Indian Health
Service hospital at Rosebud.</TE>
<TE>   Medicine for Humanity has concentrated on cervical cancer
because it is preventable, Greenburg said. Caused by the human
papilloma virus, there is a two- to 10-year pre-cancerous state. Even
if a woman has the disease, it's highly curable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the leading cause of cancer death in the developing world
among women," Greenburg said. "The reason it's the leading cause of
death is because there's no screening, and if there's no screening,
there's no treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Fatal cases of cervical cancer were also more prevalent
in developed nations until the introduction of the Pap smear in the
1940s to detect abnormal cells, Greenburg said. And there was news
last week that research on a vaccine for human papilloma virus had
shown promise.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, God, let this be the solution, but it's a work in
progress," Greenburg said. "We'll still have to take care of the
people who have the virus."</TE>
<TE>   Medicine for Humanity depends on donations from friends, families,
patients, foundations and businesses for its $100,000 annual budget.
Greenburg receives no salary; he lives on savings.</TE>
<TE>   "He's living on a shoestring," Lagasse said.</TE>
<TE>   Greenburg, 57, with gray hair and beard, is often wide-eyed in
wonderment as he talks. Aside from Medicine for Humanity, his passion
is wildlife photography, and in his townhouse he is quick to show
visitors a photo of two lions and another of three giraffes.</TE>
<TE>   Greenburg had made eight trips to Africa on photo safaris before
he started Medicine for Humanity. He would visit hospitals there and
see women dying for lack of treatment. "That's a horrible sight for
anyone, let alone a physician, let alone a gynecologist," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at it, and finally you see you've got to do something.
It's not like putting a man on Mars. This is fairly simple. We've
just got to get over there."</TE>
<TE>   Deciding to devote himself full-time to the new group wasn't
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "For my whole life I wanted to be a physician, and this is being
the purest form of a physician," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for training local doctors at their destinations, the group's
physicians go on rounds with their counterparts, listen to them
present cases and teach them surgical techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Cancer treatment is almost nonexistent in some countries. In all
of Malawi, there is one pathologist, Greenburg said. The only
technician able to read Pap smears died of complications from AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. William Crisp, who teaches at the University of
Arizona College of Medicine, has gone on Medicine for Humanity trips
to Nepal, the Philippines, Poland, Croatia and Bosnia, in addition to
U.S. Navajo and Hopi Indian reservations.</TE>
<TE>   The first time Crisp traveled to Cebu, deep in the Philippines,
patients made 24-hour boat trips to see the doctors. One patient was
a young woman whose family abused her for being unmarried and
pregnant. The doctors operated and found a 40-pound tumor that would
have killed her. On a usual day there, the doctors would oversee five
surgeries in the morning, go on rounds with the local physicians and
listen to them present cases.</TE>
<TE>   Greenburg has ambitious plans for Medicine for Humanity. He is
proposing programs in Malaysia, Croatia and Poland in which doctors
would fly in twice a month. The biggest problem is raising the $5
million to $10 million for three- to five-year programs in each
country.</TE>
<TE>   He's also trying to start a telemedicine center, so doctors could
easily consult with counterparts in the developing world over the
Internet. Using videoconferencing, several doctors could consult and
look at a patient who is thousands of miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Greenburg once thought he had his telemedicine center. The South
Orange County Community College District had big plans to turn the
former Tustin Marine base into a digital learning center. Lucent
Technologies had agreed to give Greenburg's group $6 million for
training and the district $4 million in equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Then the stock market took a dive, and, for reasons hotly
disputed, the college district turned down a state grant for the
learning center and scotched the project. District trustees said
there were questions about the availability of the land.</TE>
<TE>   "They had money, they had all these things lined up and they
thumbed their nose at it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the disappointment, Greenburg pushes on.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been my dream to do this international cancer prevention
work," he said. "I practiced for 25 years. Hopefully, the next 25
years, I can do international medicine."</TE>

<HD>A Minefield Fraught With Real Lessons</HD>
<DH>Laguna Hills students used fund-raising candy sales in
their mission to bring home an international campaign against land
mines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Laguna Hills High students sold lollipops last year to raise
money to remove land mines in distant war-torn places, the cause kept
getting lost amid the candy.</LD>
<LD>   "Kids were just buying the lollipops because they were lollipops,
not for a cause," said senior Lakshmi Ganesan, a member of the
International Baccalaureate honors program that is sponsoring the
campaign. "They didn't understand or even care what we were doing
with the money."</LD>
<LD>   That changed this year when the 37 honors students behind the
fund-raising effort embarked on a mission to educate the school's
nearly 2,000 pupils on land mines.</LD>
<TE>   The outreach appears to be working, with the money raised so far
double last year's $300 total. The students hope by June to collect
at least $1,000 -- enough to fund the removal of one land mine or buy
six prosthetic limbs.</TE>
<TE>   The money goes to the nonprofit Landmine Survivors Network, based
in Washington, D.C., which gives it to outreach centers in countries
where land mines are buried.</TE>
<TE>   The funds are spent on what officials at those centers see as the
greatest need. The students eventually learn how their money was
used.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Elise Boivin, who taught one of the sessions, said the land
mine issue is significant because it affects so many people,
especially unsuspecting noncombatants.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't just the people who live in the Third World countries,"
she said. "It's hikers, tourists -- land mines don't discriminate.
They kill regardless of who's there."</TE>
<TE>   A land mine can remain active for decades after battles end. About
100 million land mines are buried and an additional 100 million
stockpiled in 80 countries, according to the land mine network.</TE>
<TE>   The effort to clear and ban land mines was most notably championed
by the late Princess Diana. A video the Laguna Hills students show in
class presentations features Diana cuddling a toddler who lost a leg
to a land mine. Drafted in 1997, the Mine Ban Treaty has been signed
by 146 countries. The United States, which has stockpiled 11 million
mines and uses them to protect military personnel stationed between
North and South Korea, is not among them.</TE>
<TE>   International Baccalaureate is a rigorous two-year program in
which students earn college credit while in high school. Originally
created to provide standardized instruction for diplomats' children,
the program has been adopted by schools and emphasizes cultural
exchange and international perspectives.</TE>
<TE>   The international organization chooses an issue each year for
students to work with while fulfilling their community service
requirements. Land mine awareness is one of the few selected two
years in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Each of Laguna Hills' International Baccalaureate students, who
divided themselves into seven teaching groups, spent about a dozen
hours preparing lessons, which included videos and maps furnished by
the nonprofit land mine network.</TE>
<TE>   Some seminars have featured a flashy PowerPoint presentation, a
slide show of land mine survivors set to John Lennon's "Imagine" and
an activity in which students verbally steer blindfolded volunteers
through an obstacle course of crumpled newspaper "land mines."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Daniel Shi said although he enjoyed watching his giggling
classmates propel their glittery flip-flops, platform wedges and
battered tennis shoes through the obstacle course, he understood the
activity's deeper message.</TE>
<TE>   "It never occurred to me just how dangerous it was to walk through
a minefield," said Daniel, 17. "We were guiding each other and we
still stepped on them. People who live by land mines are really
taking chances with every step they take."</TE>
<TE>   Having students teach one another in a classroom setting is an
uncommon component of the partnership between the nonprofit group and
the International Baccalaureate program, said Christine Manula, who
heads the land mine group's advocacy department in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   She has heard of students leading schoolwide assemblies and
teachers incorporating information on land mines into lesson plans,
but said the Laguna Hills approach is unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great when schools take the extra step and go beyond
the carwash or the bake sale," Manula said. "Educating the next
generation of activists about the issue is just as important as
raising money."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the seminars, which by the end of the semester will have
been given in all of the school's 40-plus social studies classes, end
with a quiz and a question-and-answer session. Students asked why it
costs thousands of dollars to remove the mines -- different types of
detecting devices are needed, and workers are given hazardous pay --
and how many people they affect each year.</TE>
<TE>   Land mines maim or kill 10,000 civilians every year, junior
Gillian O'Reilly said during a presentation to a sophomore world
history class, noting that the figure comprises about one-third of
Laguna Hills' population.</TE>
<TE>   Relating a worldwide problem to their suburban enclave, where half
of the residents have college degrees and the median income is
$70,000, has been one of the difficult parts of engaging students
during the presentations, Lakshmi said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people in high school, especially in Orange County, live
in a protective bubble," she said. "We're opening it up and making
the whole student body realize we're all part of a world community."</TE>

<HD>Central Coast Land Set Aside as Greenbelt</HD>
<DH>Forty acres added to Morro Bay park. More purchases
planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sally Ann Connell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LOS OSOS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The Trust for Public Land announced plans to purchase property in the
heart of this seaside town on the Central Coast, as part of a
continuing effort to create a greenbelt around the scenic southern
side of Morro Bay.</LD>
<LD>   Working with a host of governmental and private groups, the land
trust, along with the Morro Estuary Greenbelt Alliance, has purchased
40 more acres for the greenbelt at a cost of $1.5 million. The trust
then transferred the land to the state to become part of Morro Bay
State Park.</LD>
<LD>   Plans call for an eventual 1,000-acre corridor stretching from
Montana de Oro State Park to Morro Bay State Park to form a horseshoe
around Los Osos, an unincorporated community of 14,800. Three hundred
acres have been acquired since the plan for the San Luis Obispo
County property was launched in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   Started more than 80 years ago as a coastal fishing and hunting
retreat for residents of the hot Central Valley, Los Osos is a
haphazardly planned coastal enclave perched on dunes. Sand blows
across the town's paved and unpaved roads on windy days.</TE>
<TE>   Many of today's lots in Los Osos can be traced to 1919, when two
developers advertised 25-foot wide lots in the town for $400 in a
national edition of Popular Mechanics magazine. They started as early
tent sites, and later housed fishing shacks. Now, many of the same
small lots contain $400,000-plus homes.</TE>
<TE>   As preservation efforts have moved closer to Los Osos,
environmentalists are buying expensive property often zoned
residential, according to Mary Menees with the Trust for Public Land.
The newly acquired acreage sits beside homes in this coastal town.</TE>
<TE>   "It's vitally important if you want to see this area avoid the
same sprawl which has taken over places like Los Angeles," Menees
said. She said her organization is putting an increased emphasis on
the California Central Coast, because of its potential for protecting
species and habitat lost in other regions of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Marla Morrissey, with the Greenbelt Alliance, said, "Coastal dunes
around the world are more rare than the rain forest and under more
pressure [of] being lost to development."</TE>
<TE>   This news comes at a significant time for those worried about the
future of the area. Los Osos, under a state-mandated 14-year building
moratorium because of its failure to build a sewage plant, still
relies on septic systems. But as plans have been finalized to break
ground for a sewer plant, expected to cost $106 per lot per month,
some residents worry about how fast the community might grow upon its
completion.</TE>
<TE>   Malibu similarly fought sewers -- even incorporating, in part,
over the issue -- in hopes of staving off development.</TE>
<TE>   The 40 acres that make up the latest purchase are adjacent to Los
Osos Middle School.</TE>
<TE>   Annemarie Vallesteros is the school's seventh-grade science
teacher, and she has incorporated the dunes into her classes.
Students pull out nonnative African veldt grass and plant silver dune
lupine seedlings.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire life cycle of the Morro Bay Blue Butterfly depends on
silver dune lupine," Vallesteros explained. The butterfly is listed
as threatened on the federal Endangered Species List.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, middle school is a blur," Vallesteros said. "But most of
these kids can tell you what they did in the dunes and why they did
it. That's an accomplishment."</TE>

<HD>Ahoy, Mateys: Everyone Out of the Water</HD>
<DH>Being landlocked hasn't stopped Villa Park from having a
holiday boat parade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The faded page of the high school yearbook resembles countless others
past and present.</LD>
<LD>   It pictures a bunch of kids clowning around on an outdoor
stairway. One is wearing a fancy white blazer and tie; another is
dressed like Hugh Hefner -- complete with a pipe; a third is encased
in a rigid-looking straitjacket. One of the boys is holding a banner
that proudly proclaims the group's identity: "Villa Park High School
Yacht Club. The Only Yacht Club Worth a Ship."</LD>
<LD>   The students posing for Page 117 of the 1982-83 Odyssey, however,
are different from the denizens of most high school yearbooks in at
least one respect: Though unaware of it at the time, they were giving
birth to an odd yet enduring tradition.</LD>
<TE>   "It was kind of tongue-in-cheek," admits Erik Kuli, now 37, who
founded the sporting club with five friends. He's the one wearing the
straitjacket in the picture. He doesn't wear it anymore, but some
might argue that he should: He also helps put on the most public
spectacle spawned by the long-dead club -- next month's Villa Park
boat parade, the only pageant of seagoing vessels, residents of this
landlocked city believe, that takes place entirely on land.</TE>
<TE>   "If Newport Beach can do it," Kuli says, "why not Villa Park?"</TE>
<TE>   Why not, indeed? Like its neighbor to the south -- whose harbor
and canals host Southern California's oldest, longest and most famous
annual boat parade -- this little city near the junction of the Costa
Mesa and Riverside freeways boasts a high per capita income -- in
excess of $100,000 per family per year -- and a median home price of
$750,000.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, one nonresident recently observed, "if you can
afford to live there, you can also afford a boat."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Newport Beach, however, the county's tiniest city -- with
only 2.1 square miles of territory and 6,000 residents -- contains no
bodies of water and is about 20 miles from the sea. But that didn't
dissuade Kuli and five buddies from planning Villa Park's first and
only yacht club at his 16th birthday party in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all involved in student government," he recalls, "and
knew that there was lots of money in the budget for school clubs. We
thought that yachting was sort of an upper-crust thing -- we were
preppy types and felt that it sounded better than bowling or fishing.
We would have called it the golf club, but they already had [one]. We
thought of calling it the beer-drinking club but figured we couldn't
get away with that."</TE>
<TE>   When the history of Villa Park is written, it should be noted that
none of the original initiators of the city's yachting tradition were
boat owners themselves. They were, however, people with friends in
high places. So they wrote a constitution, got a teacher to sponsor
them, persuaded the student senate to approve the idea and -- voila!
-- they had $400 and a page reserved in the yearbook.</TE>
<TE>   "We were kind of thumbing our noses at Newport Beach," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Yet thanks to the impressive embossed stationery that the club
members had printed, they landed invitations to that city's Bahia
Corinthian Yacht Club, where they had their pictures taken aboard
Newport Harbor yachts.</TE>
<TE>   The seeds for Villa Park's proud tradition of seamanship were
planted. One of the club members' fathers quickly came up with the
idea of the parade.</TE>
<TE>   "A bunch of us were at the big Women's League Christmas dance at
the Disneyland Hotel," recalls Rich Freschi, now a city councilman.
"We were all in kind of a celebratory mood.... Chuck came up with the
idea and ... by the end of the evening, we had a commitment for 15 to
20 boats."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, 38 boats turned out for the first Great Villa Park Dry
Land Yacht Parade in December 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a Doo Dah-type parade," Freschi says. "Everyone who had a
boat pulled it on a trailer. We had guys pulling Jet Skis, one kid
made a yellow submarine and someone was being pulled on a skateboard
behind a truck to simulate water skiing."</TE>
<TE>   The following year's boat parade attracted even more entries:
about 75. "It was huge," one city official recalls. "It was a hit."
Then the thing just died.</TE>
<TE>   The memory of the event lingered, however, in the hearts and minds
of its participants. And 15 years later, after Freschi had been
elected to the council by, among other things, promising greater
community involvement, he led a drive to bring it back.</TE>
<TE>   The modern parades -- which have taken place each December since
1998 -- bring out about 3,000 spectators to watch more than 50 boats
being dragged through city streets on trailers, heralded by baton
twirlers, drum majors and marching bands.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to serious yachts as large as 26 feet, organizers say,
the pageant has featured kayaks, fishing boats, surfboards and even
an amphibious car festooned with holiday lights. Recently the rules
were expanded to include such land-based vehicles as a huge yellow
cement truck.</TE>
<TE>   And, like their neighbors on Balboa Island, many Villa Park
residents have taken to throwing annual boat-watching parties in
their homes along the event's 1.25-mile route.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the kind of thing you do in a small town," says Karen
Holthe, chairwoman of this year's extravaganza, scheduled for Dec. 8.
"The purpose is to make us closer."</TE>
<TE>   So far, those neighbors haven't included members of the Newport
Beach City Council who, Freschi swears, have been invited but have
never shown up. "We wanted them to come and see if we do ours as well
as they do theirs," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach Mayor Tod W. Ridgeway begs to differ. "We've never
been invited," he flatly states. In fact, he says, he didn't even
know of the county's only inland boat parade until a reporter's
recent call. "I wouldn't snub Villa Park," Ridgeway says. "They're
nice people there."</TE>
<TE>   But would he actually attend their parade? Well, the mayor
demurred, "that would depend on scheduling."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Luehrs, president of the Newport Beach Chamber of Commerce
-- which sponsors that city's annual five-night boat parade,
attracting close to a million viewers -- went a step further. "I
don't see it as a particular threat," he said of the smaller city's
smaller parade. He even extended a cordial invitation: "If anyone
wants to participate in the Villa Park parade and then put their boat
in the water, we'd be happy to have them in ours."</TE>
<TE>   Ah, but there is one tiny stipulation. "Provided it will float,"
he added hastily.</TE>

<HD>Appointee Finds There Is Trouble in a Name</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accusations of political misconduct against Gov. Gray Davis by former
state coastal commissioner and convicted felon Mark L. Nathanson
emerged in the closing days of the governor's race and had one
political appointee muttering to himself, "Here it goes again."</LD>
<LD>   The grumbling came from Marc B. Nathanson, Democratic Party
activist, broadcast industry leader and, until recently, presidential
appointee and chairman of the board that oversees all international
broadcasting by the U.S. government, including Voice of America.</LD>
<LD>   Westwood resident Marc B. laments that people frequently confuse
him with Mark L.</LD>
<TE>   "I've had people cancel meetings on me because they thought I was
the other one," Marc B. says. "People talk to you funny. They are
cold all of a sudden when they hear your name."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is that the two Nathansons are close in age,
both have long been active in California politics and both have lived
on the Westside of Los Angeles. Besides serving as chairman of a
company that owns 23 radio stations, Marc B. is a Gray Davis
appointee to the state board overseeing the Anti-Terrorist
Information Center. Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca has appointed
Marc B. to a homeland security advisory board.</TE>
<TE>   Convicted racketeer Mark L. Nathanson was in the news this month
after court records were released indicating that he attempted to
convince prosecutors to cut his sentence in 1993 by offering to
implicate Davis in improper fund-raising. Prosecutors found no
evidence of wrongdoing and concluded Mark L. Nathanson lacked
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Marc B. can't wait for the latest publicity to die down. His wife
is a psychologist, and he said six of her patients recently offered
their condolences.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'We're very sorry to hear about your husband,' "
Nathanson said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Come to Think of It, They're All for Pelosi</TE>
<TE>   In some political contests, endorsements are of dubious value. But
in congressional leadership races, they really do matter. And early
endorsements can make the difference between winning and losing.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the significance of the list of 111 early supporters that
Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco released when she claimed victory over
Martin Frost of Texas this month in the contest to become House
Democratic leader.</TE>
<TE>   And thus a small surprise: Only 31 of the 33 newly elected
California House Democrats were on the list.</TE>
<TE>   On the pro-Pelosi roster were the Sanchez sisters, Linda and
Loretta, and new member Dennis Cardoza, who captured Gary Condit's
old seat in the Central Valley. But conspicuously absent were Reps.
Ellen Tauscher of Walnut Creek and Brad Sherman of Sherman Oaks.
Aides to the two missing members swear that the omissions were
inadvertent.</TE>
<TE>   Tauscher in fact had supported a Pelosi rival, Steny Hoyer of
Maryland, the year before, during Pelosi's ultimately successful race
for minority whip. But this time, Tauscher was quoted in the San
Francisco Chronicle on Nov. 9 -- the day after the list was released
but five days before the leadership election -- as saying that she
would back Pelosi because she had "the pedigree of a good leader."</TE>
<TE>   As for Sherman, aide Matt Farrauto blamed an oversight. "It was, I
guess, clerical," he said. He called Sherman "a strong Pelosi
supporter."</TE>
<TE>   Signs of Movement in Hahn's Taiwan Policy</TE>
<TE>   The mayor of Taipei has threatened "drastic action" if Los Angeles
fails to acknowledge that its Taiwanese sister city is not in the
People's Republic of China.</TE>
<TE>   When L.A.'s "Sister City Monument" went up in September, the
downtown sign placed Taipei in Taiwan, with no mention of China.
Chinese Consulate officials complained that the sign contradicted
U.S. and Chinese policy that considers the island of Taiwan a
province of mainland China.</TE>
<TE>   Just before Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn left for a trade
mission to Asia, a city crew changed the sign to put Taiwan in China.
Taiwan's Central News Agency reported that Taiwan's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou lodged protests.
Taiwanese in Southern California have also contacted L.A. City Hall
to express their displeasure.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn is scheduled to visit Taipei on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   When the Wedding Gift Registry Goes Public</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to giving wedding gifts, Los Angeles City Controller
Laura Chick splurges more than Councilman Tom LaBonge, but not as
much as Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski.</TE>
<TE>   At least that's the impression one might get from the latest
strange filing with the city's Ethics Commission, thanks to a law
which required Councilwoman Wendy Greuel to report the gifts she
received when she tied the knot with literary agent Dean Schramm in
July.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a who's who list of City Hall insiders and an
indication of how tight they are with a dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski and her husband, CRA commissioner Doug Ring, gave
Greuel a gift worth $78, while Chick spent $64 and LaBonge and his
wife spent $53.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Gloria Romero sent flowers worth $65. San Fernando
Valley political fund-raiser and former city Library Commissioner
Lucy McCoy went all out, spending $187 on her gift to the new couple.</TE>
<TE>   Just as interesting is who is not on the list. Greuel invited only
a few council colleagues to her nuptials, reportedly leaving some of
the others with hard feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Senators Say Chaplain Was a Real Godsend</TE>
<TE>   As a Presbyterian minister, Lloyd Ogilvie is used to working with
a higher power, but these last eight years have given new meaning to
those words.</TE>
<TE>   Ogilvie is retiring as chaplain of the U.S. Senate in March and
will return home to Hollywood, where he served for 22 years as
minister at First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Ogilvie said he decided to leave Washington to be closer to his
wife, who is being treated for acute lung difficulties at a hospital
in California.</TE>
<TE>   Senate party leaders Tom Daschle and Trent Lott said Ogilvie
helped steady the Senate in difficult times."He has been a real
source of strength and comfort to countless members of the Senate
family, from senators to staffers to elevator operators," Daschle
said. "Whatever the crisis -- from political strife to terrorism
attacks to the deaths of Paul Coverdell, Paul Wellstone and others we
love -- Dr. Ogilvie has helped us find a way to move forward."</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken:</TE>
<TE>   * Democratic political consultant and lobbyist Joe Cerrell always
sends out a clever invitation to his firm's annual holiday bash. This
year he pokes fun at Wall Street woes, sending an invite in the form
of a faux certificate of stock with the assurance, "This share won't
plummet in value on over-inflated earnings, poor CEO leadership or
idle speculation ... because this offer is only good on one day." It
goes on to say, "Don't expect Martha Stewart, Ken Lay or Dennis
Kozlowski to attend.... They have other federal 'offerings' they must
attend to."</TE>
<TE>   * In his unsuccessful bid for the Los Angeles City Council last
year, Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City) got hammered by
eventual winner Greuel for his ties to Indian gaming groups, several
of which gave him thousands of dollars in political contributions.
Well, Cardenas is running for a different council seat now, and it
appears the last experience affected him. Cardenas leads fund-raising
in the 6th District race, having raised more than $140,000, but not
one penny has come from Indian gaming.</TE>
<TE>   * The Anaheim Angels keep basking in the glow of their improbable
World Series championship. Rep. Ed Royce (R-La Habra) won House
approval on Nov. 15 of a congressional resolution to honor the team
for winning the series. "For those of us who grew up in Orange
County, this is an amazing and unforgettable moment in our history,"
Royce said.</TE>
<TE>   * In the space of less than one month, Mark Ridley-Thomas will
have held three important positions. A longtime Los Angeles city
councilman, Ridley-Thomas takes the oath of office soon to become a
state assemblyman. In the meantime, with Mayor James K. Hahn and
Council President Alex Padilla traveling in Asia on a trade mission,
Ridley-Thomas, who is also council president pro tem, found himself
holding down the fort this past week as acting mayor.</TE>
<TE>   * Maria Contreras-Sweet, secretary of the state Business,
Transportation and Housing Agency, has been a chief spokeswoman for
the Latino community, but she recently sent a holiday e-mail message
to state workers in which she misspelled the name of its most
prominent civil rights leader. One of the highlights of the year, she
said, was "donating thousands of books on an annual basis to children
of migrant farm workers in honor of Ceasar Chavez."</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me:</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about dressing someone up as a Pilgrim, but having a
Pilgrim walking across the street wouldn't get the same attention."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine on why he has asked his
police officer son, Chris Zine, to dress up as a turkey and
repeatedly cross the street at a signalized crosswalk on Sherman Way
as part of a Thanksgiving-themed sting this Wednesday to nab
motorists who do not yield to pedestrians.</TE>

<HD>China Tries to Woo Its Tech Talent Back Home</HD>
<DH>Silicon Valley dot-com casualties can return to a booming
economy in their native land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rone Tempest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>After two decades of watching thousands of top computer engineering
and science students immigrate to the United States, the Chinese
government has launched an aggressive push to win back some of the
country's brainpower from the economically stressed Silicon Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "We think some Chinese engineers will go back to China because
they have been laid off here and have no jobs," said Wang Yunxiang,
China's consul general in San Francisco. "In comparison, the overall
situation in China is very good."</LD>
<LD>   Since 1979, when the late leader Deng Xiaoping broke with China's
isolationist policy, more than 400,000 mainland Chinese students have
traveled abroad for graduate study. Only a relatively small number,
estimated at 10% to 25%, have returned home.</LD>
<TE>   Many ended up settling in the Silicon Valley, where they own
start-up tech businesses or work as integrated circuit design
engineers in many of the region's most successful companies.</TE>
<TE>   But the downturn in the U.S. high-tech industry, along with a
booming market in China, has renewed hopes that the people whom
former Premier Zhao Ziyang once called China's "stored brainpower
overseas" may be ready to return.</TE>
<TE>   Many cities have shiny skyscrapers labeled hopefully in Chinese:
"Returning Student Entrepreneurial Building." Chinese companies and
development parks now offer salary and benefits for recruits roughly
equivalent in purchasing power to those here in one of America's most
expensive communities.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese government also sponsors all-expenses-paid trips to
China, where top officials fawn over visiting engineers, who are
sumptuously entertained.</TE>
<TE>   A returning engineer with several years' experience in America can
expect free housing, a car and driver, and other perks not available
in the United States. Foreign science and technology degrees convey
high social status on returning engineers.</TE>
<TE>   Different Job Markets</TE>
<TE>   "We are kind of in the doldrums in the job market over here, but
over there people are welcomed with open arms," said Robert P. Lee,
chief executive of two Silicon Valley software companies and
president of the Asia America MultiTechnology Assn., one of several
business associations composed primarily of mainland and Hong Kong
Chinese engineers.</TE>
<TE>   "The benefit packages are smaller but, in the local economy, still
quite good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many expect the recruiting push to accelerate now that 59-year-old
Hu Jintao, a graduate of the prestigious Qinghua University
engineering school, has been chosen as the country's new leader. In a
rare overseas visit laden with political symbolism, Hu toured the
Silicon Valley even before being named general secretary of the
ruling Communist Party last week.</TE>
<TE>   The China push was on display most recently at a San Jose job fair
-- paid for by Chinese state sponsors -- that drew more than 4,000
China-born engineers to the Santa Clara County Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   "It was much bigger than the typical recruiting session that
traditional Chinese provincial governments have been doing over the
past two years," said AnnaLee Saxenian, a UC Berkeley professor who
has done extensive studies of the Silicon Valley's immigrant
communities. "There is a sense now that they can draw on this
overseas Chinese community who are now willing to go back and start
companies."</TE>
<TE>   "Platinum" sponsors, which included the Shenyang and Shanghai
technology parks, paid $10,000 to take part in the fair. China's
Ministry of Science and Technology was listed as a "supporting
organization." The only U.S. participant was Pittsburg, Calif., a
struggling blue-collar city on the Sacramento River that came seeking
new businesses. At many of the booths, engineers were lined up
several deep.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago," said Stephen W.Y. Lai, who was manning a booth at
the job fair for the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks, "no one
would have been interested because there were too many opportunities
in the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Some of those attending the Nov. 8-10 "China Meets Silicon Valley"
event said they were attracted by the opportunities they see in
China.</TE>
<TE>   Chu Jiajin, 69, a retired electrical engineering professor from
China, said he is tempted to return to his native land after being
laid off from his $100,000-a-year job at Quicksilver Technology, a
start-up integrated circuit company in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   But his son, Jeff Chu, 37, is hesitant. The younger Chu and his
wife, both engineers and naturalized American citizens, live
comfortably in a $900,000 home in Cupertino and are reluctant to give
up their combined $250,000 salaries to take a risk on making it in
China.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some good opportunities that I would consider in China
if we were not doing so well here," said the younger Chu, a chip
designer with a graduate degree in electrical engineering from San
Jose State University.</TE>
<TE>   Though the weekend job fair represented the biggest single event
of its type, the Silicon Valley has been the destination for smaller
recruiting delegations in recent months. Shanghai alone sent several
dozen recruiters into the valley recently.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese engineers and their start-up companies play an extremely
important role in the technology economy here, accounting for an
estimated $10 billion in annual sales.</TE>
<TE>   But if the patterns established by an earlier "reverse brain
drain" to Taiwan in the late 1980s and early '90s hold true, both
places can experience some benefits. The engineers will maintain
their academic and business links with the U.S. and the American
industry will benefit from the cheaper labor costs and manufacturing
in China.</TE>
<TE>   One factor helping the Chinese government effort is that, in the
era of globalization and China's acceptance into the WTO, the flow of
brainpower is no longer a one-way street.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, top executives travel back and forth between China and
the Silicon Valley so frequently now that in Chinese they are
jokingly called astronauts.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining Ties</TE>
<TE>   Even if they do choose to return to China to establish businesses,
many engineers will probably maintain their U.S. citizenship or
academic connections in North America.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that if you went to the U.S., it was, 'Bye-bye, see
you when you're 65,' " said Ping K. Ko, a former professor of
microelectronics at UC Berkeley who now runs a high-tech venture
capital company in China. "But opportunity now is worldwide. It's no
different than working in California and looking for job
opportunities in Texas."</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, Saxenian said, she prefers the term "brain
circulation" to the classic "brain drain" to describe the immigration
shifts affecting the Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "If they started to go back in very large numbers ... it could
affect the Silicon Valley," Saxenian said. "But I don't see that
happening in the short run. Most people understand that this is still
the center of tech and the biggest market."</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the Chinese government still encourages its top
students to seek graduate education in the United States. "There will
be no reverse in students coming here," Wang said.</TE>
<TE>   But through its recruiting drive and other inducements, the
government is hoping more will come back, ending the historic outflow
of top graduates. They include green card holders, those who possess
H1B visas for skilled high-tech workers and naturalized American
citizens -- including many who benefited from the blanket asylum
granted to students after the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy
movement.</TE>
<TE>   About 30% of the Silicon Valley's technology businesses, which
account for a total of $19.5 billion in sales and 72,800 jobs, are
run by Chinese and South Asian entrepreneurs, Saxenian said.</TE>
<TE>   A popular joke in the valley in recent years is that the corporate
acronym IC stands not for "integrated circuits" but for the Indians
and Chinese who run them. Companies founded by entrepreneurs from
China make up the largest group.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-year-old Li Ping, one of those entrepreneurs, is torn by the
lure of China.</TE>
<TE>   "We are running out of opportunity here," said Li, who owns a
high-tech machine shop in San Jose. "China is like the American West
at the turn of the century."</TE>
<TE>   But having gained American citizenship and with children in
American schools, Li, like many other Chinese engineers here, fears
he may be too entrenched in his new country to make the break for the
old.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me think of an old Chinese expression," he said, sipping
a glass of California red wine at the job fair's ornate banquet, "San
si nian he dong san si nian he xi."</TE>
<TE>   Literally translated, it means, "Someone who has lived 30 years on
the east bank of the river should then live 30 years on the west bank
to provide balance."</TE>

<HD>Stadium Site Still Tough to Pin Down</HD>
<DH>Three downtown locations are among eight evaluated as
potential NFL homes. But each presents complicated problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A city study of potential sites for a pro football stadium is running
months behind schedule and is focusing on three downtown locations
that present both new and familiar problems: the Coliseum, the
Staples Center area and a rail yard near Union Station.</LD>
<LD>   The city's recurring efforts to bring the NFL back to Los Angeles
have often bogged down on the difficult issue of where a team would
play, and the current efforts indicate that there are still no easy
solutions.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County Memorial Coliseum has received a cold
shoulder from the National Football League in previous city pitches,
and a proposal earlier this year to build a stadium near Staples
Center drew significant opposition from some city and Los Angeles
County officials.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Union Pacific Corp., which owns the rail yard, said the
property is vital to its operations and is not for sale.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium search is further complicated by politics.</TE>
<TE>   While some City Council members are jockeying to make their
favorite sites the city's preferred location in dealing with the NFL,
others are questioning why the city is using taxpayer resources to
help wealthy NFL owners gain access to the nation's No. 2 television
market.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a huge NFL fan and I would like nothing more than to be able
to get in my car and drive to an NFL game," Councilman Jack Weiss
said. "But the owners have demonstrated a record of doing everything
they can to fleece cities. Why we would make it easier to fleece Los
Angeles is beyond me. The NFL needs Los Angeles more than L.A. needs
the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nick Pacheco, who is pushing hard for the rail yard,
which is in his district, said the city could benefit economically if
the NFL could be persuaded to return to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The more we talk about options, the more we are seen by the
league as a viable site and that's important -- that we be in the
game," Pacheco said.</TE>
<TE>   All the maneuvering and study may be wasted, because the NFL could
just as easily stay out of the area or pick a location outside Los
Angeles if it decides to return to Southern California, observers
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Think of this as a primary election and each city is putting up
its candidate," said sports consultant David Carter, an advisor to
the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, which is conducting the
site study.</TE>
<TE>   "Pasadena is putting up the Rose Bowl," he said. "Other cities
will put up their sites, and the CRA is trying to get to the point
where the City Council can decide on its candidate."</TE>
<TE>   The City Council in June ordered the CRA to study potential
stadium sites and submit a report in early August. Redevelopment
officials said this week that the study, which will cost as much as
$25,000, isn't done and may not be completed until late March 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "We're simply not there yet," said Don Spivak, deputy
administrator for the CRA.</TE>
<TE>   Agency documents indicate that the CRA has whittled the list of 38
redevelopment project areas to eight. Those eight will be further
analyzed to determine whether they are suitable.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is looking only at redevelopment areas, which allow the
agency to use its land-acquisition powers and special financing to
make a stadium development more viable.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said the agency is giving special attention to the
Coliseum, the Pacific Union rail yard and the Staples Center area.
But Spivak said that "early findings" have not been fully reviewed by
the staff.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary report noted that the Coliseum "clearly is a
suitable location for a National Football League stadium."</TE>
<TE>   The Coliseum is judged "to be able to meet the needs of the
League. As an existing facility, there are no necessary additional
costs for site acquisition or assemblage, nor are there costs for
relocation."</TE>
<TE>   Even upgrading the Coliseum would cost less than developing a
totally new stadium, the report argued.</TE>
<TE>   NFL officials, including Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, have
indicated that they are not interested in the Coliseum. As Baltimore
Ravens owner Art Modell said in June, "Trying to put a new dress on
an old hooker is not the way I want to go dancing."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas expects that the CRA report
will give new life to using the historic structure in his district.</TE>
<TE>   Competing Sites</TE>
<TE>   "There is no project that has more going for it at this point than
the Coliseum," Ridley-Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   He was recently elected to the state Assembly and will move into
that post within the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Though some observers believe that his departure from the council
could reduce the momentum for the Coliseum, Ridley-Thomas said he
plans to push hard in Sacramento for turning the Coliseum, which is
on state land, into a state-of-the-art NFL stadium.</TE>
<TE>   As for the rail yard, "I understand that it's definitely seriously
being looked at," Pacheco said. "It's downtown. It's near the L.A.
River, so you can do something that complements that."</TE>
<TE>   Added CRA consultant Carter, "The rail yard is certainly in the
running."</TE>
<TE>   The Union Pacific said the reason the 50-acre rail yard is not for
sale is that it is essential for transferring truck trailers to and
from rail cars.</TE>
<TE>   However, Pacheco said, the CRA has the power to buy land and help
move businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The railroad's largest shareholder is billionaire sports magnate
Philip Anschutz, who was part of a group that proposed a $450-million
stadium next to the Staples Center, which is owned by Anschutz.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Roth, a spokesman for Anschutz, said there are no talks to
bring a stadium to Anschutz's land.</TE>
<TE>   The Anschutz Entertainment Group proposed in March to build a
$450-million, 74,000-seat stadium next to the Staples Center on
privately owned land that is part of a new redevelopment project
area.</TE>
<TE>   However, the county Board of Supervisors filed a lawsuit, alleging
that the area was not blighted so the city could not justify
diverting property tax funds that otherwise would go to county
coffers. Also, some City Council members said they would oppose using
tax money to help a stadium proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Then in June, the Coliseum Commission announced that it would
spend $1 million to develop its own plan for a stadium, infuriating
the Anschutz group and prompting it to drop its stadium plan.</TE>
<TE>   One objection to the Anschutz plan was that it interfered with the
purpose of the redevelopment project, which was to increase
affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   To address that concern, the new proposal being studied by the CRA
would put the stadium on about 20 acres of city-owned property used
for parking that is already part of the Staples Center site.</TE>
<TE>   That way a stadium would not interfere with housing production, a
CRA official said.</TE>
<TE>   Council President Alex Padilla, who heads a council panel
overseeing the stadium selection process, has met with those involved
in the Staples Center project to see if it can be made to work.</TE>
<TE>   However, Roth downplayed that idea.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to not play a role in the NFL situation vis-a-vis Los
Angeles," Roth said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn supports the CRA study, but a spokesman
cautioned against attributing too much importance to the study.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just one look in terms of what the CRA thinks might be
good locations," said Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook.</TE>
<TE>   "There are other factors," he said. "Where do investors want to
go? Where is space available. Where is the NFL interested in going? A
CRA analysis is useful input but is not binding on a decision."</TE>
<TE>   Private Investors</TE>
<TE>   In fact, private investors are already looking at sites not
considered by the CRA study.</TE>
<TE>   Casey Wasserman, owner of the L.A. Avengers arena football team,
confirmed last week that he has been looking into buying the 32-story
Transamerica Center and surrounding properties for a possible stadium
in South Park.</TE>
<TE>   That area is within the recently adopted City Center Redevelopment
Plan, but CRA Commissioner Doug Ring said the pending stadium study
is not considering that site.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   8 possible sites</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency recently looked at
the 38 redevelopment project areas in the city and identified eight
that would accommodate a stadium and should be evaluated. The eight
redevelopment project areas being analyzed are:</TE>
<TE>   * City Center Project, an 879-acre area that includes part of the
downtown historic district and South Park and a 20-acre site adjacent
to Staples Center, thought by some redevelopment officials to be a
prime site for a stadium.</TE>
<TE>   * Hoover Project, a 735-acre area southwest of downtown that
includes the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, judged by redevelopment
officials as well suited to be renovated as an NFL stadium.</TE>
<TE>   * Council District 9 Project, a 2,817-acre area generally bounded
by Santa Monica Freeway on the north, Alameda Street and Central
Avenue on the east, Normandie Avenue on the west and 84th Street on
the south.</TE>
<TE>   * North Hollywood Project, a 750-acre area centered at the</TE>
<TE>   intersection of Magnolia Boulevard and Lankershim Boulevard that
includes a subway station and the NoHo Arts District</TE>
<TE>   * Crenshaw/Slauson Project, a 262-acre area about six miles
southwest of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   * Chinatown Project, a 303-acre area north of the downtown Civic
Center.</TE>
<TE>   * Pacific Corridor Project, a 693-acre area of east San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   * Adelante Eastside Project, a 2,200-acre area that includes Boyle
Heights, El Sereno and the Union Pacific rail yard touted by
Councilman Nick Pacheco as a potential prime site for a stadium.</TE>

<HD>Electronic Transcripts Ease Way to College</HD>
<DH>Ventura County school is making paper records a thing of
the past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a problem that has been around as long as students have been
applying to college: the lost high school transcript.</LD>
<LD>   Teenagers complain about it. Admissions counselors agonize over
it. Last year, Hollywood took it on with the comedy "Orange County,"
in which a high-achieving student's hopes of going to Stanford are
threatened when his school botches the transcript transmission.</LD>
<LD>   Now, some campuses are aiming to end those worries as they begin
making the ubiquitous paper transcript a thing of the past.</LD>
<TE>   Among the pioneers is Oak Park High School in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Oak Park will begin using a new software program that
enables students to have their records sent electronically --
directly from Oak Park's computers to the computers of colleges and
universities.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of waiting in long lines at the registrar's office and
filling out a paper form for each transcript request, students will
be able to order the documents from their home computers, using the
school's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than wait for weeks to learn whether a transcript arrives
at its destination on time, students will get confirmation e-mails
within 48 hours.</TE>
<TE>   The technology was developed by a small Thousand Oaks software
company, Docufide, and Oak Park is the first school to use it.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado high schools and colleges began a similar effort this
fall with a Los Angeles Internet company, Xap.com.</TE>
<TE>   In a handful of other states, including North Carolina and
Pennsylvania, officials are working with Xap to develop programs.</TE>
<TE>   With the majority of American high school students now applying
for college online, electronic transcripts are the next logical step,
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's faster, it saves money and there are fewer people handling
it, so having it misplaced is less likely," said Jeanne Adkins,
director of the Colorado Student Loan Program, a partner in that
state's electronic transcript project.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is the start of something major."</TE>
<TE>   Early Attempts Failed</TE>
<TE>   First attempts at electronic transcript transfers began more than
a decade ago, officials from several universities said, but nothing
worked well enough to completely change the system.</TE>
<TE>   Programs tried by universities in Texas and Florida were too
cumbersome and expensive for most cash-strapped high schools to
implement. And Colorado's system works only between high schools and
colleges within the state.</TE>
<TE>   Docufide's software is designed to work with any high school in
the country that stores student data electronically, said Mark Cohen,
the company's president.</TE>
<TE>   Universities don't need the software to accept transcripts sent
via Docufide, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to provide a true conduit between high schools and
colleges where one doesn't exist," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The software is free to high schools. Students will pay a $3 fee
for each transcript they order electronically.</TE>
<TE>   About 29 million high school transcripts are sent out each year
nationwide, said Jeffrey Harris, a co-founder of Docufide and an Oak
Park High alumnus.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said the software has built-in verification of each step in
the transfer process, as well as other checks and balances, to reduce
the potential for data loss.</TE>
<TE>   Built-in security features also prohibit anyone from intercepting
transcripts or altering them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Welcomed by Students</TE>
<TE>   At Oak Park High, where 65% of seniors go directly to four-year
universities, students welcomed the new program.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much stuff to keep track of already, and the
transcript requests are just one more piece of paper you have to fill
out," said Colin Richard, 17, the school's student body president,
who is applying to eight universities this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "This way it will be so much easier because I can do it at home at
3 in the morning if I want to."</TE>
<TE>   Oak Park Principal Cliff Moore said he sees the potential to save
time and money in the busy registrar's office.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a thing of the future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nordhoff High School in Ojai will be the second school to use
Docufide, Harris said, and many more are waiting to sign on.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 colleges have agreed to accept transcripts through
Docufide, Harris said, including Pepperdine University in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Long, dean of enrollment at Pepperdine, said transcripts are
the only portion of the school's undergraduate application process
not yet handled electronically.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the one document that students can't control, and there are
always mix-ups," Long said. "This, to me, will be very beneficial
once we get it in place."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Oak Park sent Pepperdine the first test transcript
using the software, and it looked great, Long said.</TE>
<TE>   But other higher education systems, including the University of
California and Cal State University, want to develop their own
systems rather than rely on a private company.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at UC and CSU are waiting for an electronic transcript
process expected to be available through a state project called
California School Information Services, said a Cal State spokeswoman,
Colleen Bentley-Adler.</TE>
<TE>   That system won't be ready for another several years.</TE>
<TE>   Registrar to Benefit</TE>
<TE>   At Oak Park, Pat Ramirez may be the person who benefits most from
the transition to electronic transcript transfers.</TE>
<TE>   As the school's registrar, Ramirez ensures that each record is
printed out, signed, stamped certified and mailed to colleges. She
handles as many as 2,500 requests a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite time-consuming," she said. "This is going to really
free me up to better help students."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Smith, an Oak Park senior who is filling out 10 college
applications this fall, said she also will appreciate the time saved.</TE>
<TE>   The transcript task is not only onerous, Smith said, it's
nerve-wracking.</TE>
<TE>   She said she has heard a number of nightmare stories about lost
transcripts. "This way seems a lot safer," the 17-year-old said.</TE>

<HD>Show Is Brush With Painter's Past</HD>
<DH>Retrospective will reveal many facets of Ventura artist
Hiroko Yoshimoto, who has also explored set design and calligraphy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As an art professor at Ventura College, Hiroko Yoshimoto has left her
mark on generations of students.</LD>
<LD>   As an artist, the Japan-born, Southern California-bred Yoshimoto
has also made her mark -- so much so that she will soon have her
first retrospective at the Ventura County Museum of History and Art.</LD>
<LD>   In preparation, the 59-year-old Yoshimoto has been retracing her
career with the curator of the show. And in the process, she has come
to an important realization: "Things do connect, from one to another
to another," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Yoshimoto works in a variety of media -- from oil to calligraphy
to set design -- and styles. She also tends to produce a body of work
in a series, patiently working through a concept before retreating to
the drawing board until another inspiration strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Her retrospective, which opens Dec. 10, is called "Visions of
Intangibles: The Art of Hiroko Yoshimoto, 1983-2002." It will cover
work from four series: "Slice of Life," "Four Seasons," "Lines and
Signs: Instruments That Convey Abstract Thoughts" and "Face to Face."</TE>
<TE>   A visit to Yoshimoto's house recently revealed a living workplace
in flux. Artworks were strewn around the living room, and other
pieces were being restored in her downstairs studio.</TE>
<TE>   The wraparound windows offer a panoramic view of downtown Ventura
and the ocean beyond, an inspiring spot for an artist.</TE>
<TE>   But her house with a view and her interests haven't necessarily
led her into landscape or urbanscape paintings. Yoshimoto seems
happiest to remain open to possibilities, perhaps partly due to her
profession as a teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting at her kitchen table and showing work from a catalog in
progress, Yoshimoto admitted, "I haven't been too active in marketing
my art. For one thing, I've had a full career in teaching, so that
provided me with paying the rent and so on .... That was good, in a
way, because I could experiment a lot. It freed me from having to do
things that would have to sell."</TE>
<TE>   She discovered an affinity for teaching when she took on her first
class at Ventura College in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   "I never planned to become a teacher," she said. "I am just lucky
that I love teaching. That was luck. Being in art and teaching, it is
very time-consuming and energy-draining. But [this way] you are
always involved in art."</TE>
<TE>   Lee Hodges, gallery director of the Buenaventura Gallery, is both
a colleague and a former student of Yoshimoto. The two also cross
paths in community arts efforts, such as the Municipal Art
Acquisition Committee for the city of Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   In the mentor-student relationship, Hodges said, Yoshimoto is "a
very gifted critiquer. I've never seen anyone [else] who could
critique your artwork and get into your head. She knows how to
improve what you're doing but stay within what you're doing, not make
it hers and not change it. She really just crawls inside your brain
and tells you what it needs."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, teaching sparks ideas for Yoshimoto the artist. In one
recent classroom project, students worked on portraits of each other,
round-robin style. The resulting mosaic of portraits gave Yoshimoto
the idea for her current "Face to Face" series.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Kobe, Japan, in 1943, Yoshimoto had an early nudge in the
direction of art from her father, a businessman who taught her
calligraphy after school.</TE>
<TE>   Yoshimoto was a teenager when her family moved to Pasadena. She
earned her bachelor's and master's degrees in art at UCLA, then
worked for a few years outside of fine art, including a stint for IBM
in Tokyo in the late '60s.</TE>
<TE>   When she returned, she committed herself to a life of teaching and
art-making. Married in 1977, she divorced in 1989 and has no
children, devoting her energies to art.</TE>
<TE>   She has shown in numerous Ventura County galleries and in such Los
Angeles art spaces as Judy Chicago's Women's Space, L.A. Artcore and
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Sales and Rental Gallery. She
has also shown at galleries in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Yoshimoto has channeled her interest in other
media, including music and opera, into occasional work as a set
designer.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, she supplied the spare, effective designs for a
version of Igor Stravinsky's "Soldier's Tale" at the San Buenaventura
Mission. The event was part of the 1999 Musics Alive! festival of the
New West Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   Her biggest such project to date, though, was her 1990 endeavor
designing sets and costumes for a Ventura College production of the
Mozart opera "The Magic Flute." She worked on the project for two
years, even doing research on Mozart in Vienna and tracking down
bolts of white silk in the Los Angeles garment district.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when I learned the difference between performing artists
and fine artists," she said. "After the show was struck, everything
was tossed away. I first thought, 'Oh my gosh, all that work and it's
just gone.'</TE>
<TE>   "But I learned the beauty in that. It's just wonderful to have
that one moment of your whole engaged performance and work, and
that's it. After that, it's gone. That's the nature of it."</TE>
<TE>   She added, laughing, that "visual artists are more archival,
thinking 'How long will this last?' "</TE>
<TE>   Yoshimoto's art seems like the proverbial journey of
self-discovery, one she reflects on while it's in progress.</TE>
<TE>   "I like things in clear simplicity, not overly dense or complex,"
she said. "I like to simplify things, to clarify and crystallize in
terms of thinking and what I want to say."</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean she always goes for realism over abstract
art.</TE>
<TE>   "Representational images can describe things much more clearly,"
she said. "However, abstract color, shape and images can go directly
to your heart or soul, and give you an emotional impact."</TE>

<HD>Dooling Gives Gentry Guarded Optimism</HD>

<LD>Backup guard Keyon Dooling's best game since he sprained his right
ankle more than a year ago was pivotal to the Clippers' victory
Sunday over the Houston Rockets. Dooling scored 18 points on
eight-for-10 shooting in 23 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   "If we were going to give away a game ball today, we would
definitely give it to him," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "He made some
great shots for us and he also turned up our defensive pressure."</LD>
<LD>   While starting point guard Andre Miller continues to play with
varying degrees of effectiveness, it would be a huge boost for Gentry
if Dooling were to play with the sort of confidence and effectiveness
he displayed Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Miller had 15 points on six-for-13 shooting and had eight assists
and five rebounds in 42 minutes. Marko Jaric, averaging 3.6 points
and shooting 27.6%, did not play for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With centers Michael Olowokandi and Sean Rooks in foul trouble in
the second quarter, Gentry had no choice but to play Wang Zhizhi
against Yao Ming in a much-anticipated matchup of Chinese players.</TE>
<TE>   Wang missed all three shots in 11 minutes and Yao had four points
on one-for-four shooting in 28 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi was impressed with Yao's play.</TE>
<TE>   "He's nimble for a big guy," he said. "He's a better athlete than
I thought he was in terms of moving his feet. He has a good touch. He
was shooting free throws on the technical fouls too."</TE>
<TE>   Said Wang of Yao, who had a 30-point, 16-rebound game last week
against the Dallas Mavericks: "Yao played well, but we stepped up the
defense on him as a team. Yao plays a great game and he is going to
have his time in the NBA."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers will serve Thanksgiving meals to families at the
Bread &amp; Roses Cafe in Venice at 11 this morning as part of their
Teamwork at the Table holiday program. They also will hand out food
and clothing at St. Joseph's Center at 12:30.</TE>

<HD>This Night Belonged to Chick</HD>
<DH>Beloved broadcaster Hearn, who died Aug. 5, takes his place
among other Laker greats in an emotional tribute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chick Hearn may be gone, but the Lakers are doing their part in
making sure he isn't forgotten.</LD>
<LD>   In an emotional ceremony before the Lakers' game against Milwaukee
on Sunday night at Staples Center, a jersey bearing Hearn's name was
unveiled. It hangs among those bearing the names West, Baylor,
Chamberlain, Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, Worthy and Goodrich.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than a number, Hearn's jersey has a microphone.</LD>
<TE>   "It look likes a No. 1, which is fitting," Laker Executive Vice
President Jeanie Buss said before the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Buss, who with Linda Rambis organized the ceremony, said it really
was the fans' idea.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard from so many fans who wanted us to do this," Buss said.
"The reason we did it now is because we couldn't do it on opening
night and this is the week of Chick's birthday."</TE>
<TE>   Francis Dayle "Chick" Hearn, who died Aug. 5 after taking a fall
at his home in Encino, would have turned 86 on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry West, who received a standing ovation in his first visit to
Staples Center since he became president of the Grizzlies, made a
special trip from Memphis to honor Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Gaines sang "Wind Beneath My Wings."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn's widow, Marge, elegantly dressed in a blue suit and white
hat, spoke to the fans.</TE>
<TE>   Also present were the Hearns' granddaughter Shannon Newman, her
husband, Louis, and great-granddaughter Kayla.</TE>
<TE>   Memorable photos of Hearn and many of his "Chickisms" were
displayed on the scoreboard as fans oohed, aahed and cheered.</TE>
<TE>   There will be more tributes to the man who until last season was
the only play-by-play announcer the Lakers had after moving to Los
Angeles from Minneapolis in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   Buss said 11th Street in front of Staples Center will be renamed
next month. Details are being worked out to erect a statue of Hearn
in front of Staples Center. The Lakers are planning to hold a dinner
in honor of Hearn in the spring. A post office in Encino is going to
be named after Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   "If Francis knew all those things were being named after him, he
would have said, 'Are these people crazy?' " Marge said.</TE>
<TE>   West called Hearn a unique man, a special friend and a man "who
loved his wife, his work and the Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net devoted most of its pregame show to honoring Hearn
and paid tribute to him throughout the game telecast.</TE>
<TE>   The pregame show included a taped interview Stu Lantz had done
with Jerry Buss, taped interviews with Kobe Bryant and Rick Fox, and
live interviews with Jeanie Buss, Marge Hearn and West.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Buss said Chick Hearn had given the Lakers an identity in
this city and brought all the Laker teams together. Marge Hearn said
she knew the night was going to be an emotional one, and Bryant said,
"Chick is the Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   Co-host Bill Macdonald said the ceremony was going to be
emotional. "But it is also going to be a celebration of Chick's
life."</TE>
<TE>   And that's what it turned out to be.</TE>

<HD>Falbrav Triumphs in Close Japan Cup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Falbrav, an Italian-based horse, won the $3.8-million Japan Cup by a
nose Sunday in Nakayama, after a foul claim by the trainer and jockey
of the American runner-up was disallowed by the track stewards.</LD>
<LD>   Trainer Neil Drysdale and jockey Corey Nakatani thought their
protest on behalf of Sarafan was given short shrift. "My horse ran
great, but the stewards did a bad job," Nakatani said. "[Falbrav]
bumped me four times and I was just cruising to pass him. They made
up their minds before I got to talk to them. I don't think [jockey
Frankie Dettori, aboard Falbrav] ever made an attempt to straighten
out his horse. I did."</LD>
<LD>   The first two finishers were longshots, Falbrav at 20-1 and
Sarafan, the Eddie Read Handicap winner at Del Mar, at 34-1. Symboli
Kris S., the 7-5 favorite, finished third, beaten by a neck, and
Jungle Pocket, the winner of the Japan Cup last year, ran fifth. The
time for 1 3/8 miles over a firm grass course was 2:12 1/5.</LD>
<TE>   After Falbrav passed Magnaten to take the lead in the late
stretch, Sarafan tried to rally on the inside. There was bumping
between the two horses near the wire.</TE>
<TE>   Drysdale went to the stewards with the foul claim.</TE>
<TE>   "It was impossible," Drysdale said. "They had already made up
their minds while I was trying to show them [on the replay] what
happened. The other horse came in on us, but they said
[responsibility for the contact] was equal."</TE>
<TE>   Falbrav, an Irish-bred, had finished ninth in France's Arc de
Triomphe. The Italian-born Dettori, who has been based in England
since he was a teenager, also won Saturday's $2-million Japan Cup
Dirt Stakes with Eagle Cafe.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the happiest man in the country," Dettori said after Sunday's
win.</TE>
<TE>   At Hollywood Park on Sunday, Victor Espinoza took over for the
globetrotting David Flores and won the $100,000 Cat's Cradle Handicap
with Cee's Elegance at 5-1.</TE>
<TE>   After riding Reba's Gold to a ninth-place finish in the Japan Cup
Dirt, Flores ran into a late flight to Los Angeles and was also
delayed going through customs at LAX. He arrived at the track in time
to watch the Cat's Cradle. Flores rode two winners later on the card.</TE>
<TE>   Cee's Elegance, who had been winless, with three seconds, in six
starts this year, beat Catling by four lengths as Super High, the 4-5
favorite, was a well-beaten fourth. The win ended an 11-race losing
streak for Cee's Elegance, dating to May of last year.</TE>

<HD>Bishop Amat Is Roused by Its Running Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though second-seeded Los Alamitos will be the favorite in its
Southern Section Division I quarterfinal against La Puente Bishop
Amat on Friday, it won't mean a thing if the Griffins can't put the
clamps on the Lancers' rejuvenated running game.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Amat (6-5) has averaged 391 yards rushing the last two
weeks in victories over Santa Margarita and Redlands, sparking an
offense that needed resuscitation in a five-game losing streak in
midseason.</LD>
<LD>   "We played them and they were on a five-game losing streak," Los
Angeles Loyola Coach Steve Grady said. "I thought, 'How could they
get going again?' They went from a regular offense to running a wing
T the week before playing us."</LD>
<TE>   "They're doing some good things with that offense."</TE>
<TE>   Three Bishop Amat runners gained more than 100 yards each,
averaging 5.1 yards per carry, and the Lancers converted 10 of 12
third-down opportunities in a 42-35 double-overtime playoff victory
over Redlands. Six of their eight drives ended in touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "Our blocking has really come through," Coach Mike DiFiori said.</TE>
<TE>   Tailback Chris Seals, who has tremendous acceleration, has
averaged 162 yards in the last two weeks. Fullback Jonathan Robinson
has put together consecutive 100-yard games, and fullback Andrew Soto
had a game-high 152 yards and four touchdowns against Redlands. He
scored both overtime touchdowns on one-yard runs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It took two nights, two sets of uniforms and some portable lights
to get it done, but Los Angeles Roosevelt won its first City Section
Championship Division playoff game since 1973 with a 14-11
quarterfinal victory over San Pedro last week.</TE>
<TE>   The start of the game Thursday, was delayed 1 hour 20 minutes
while school personnel worked at turning on a bank of lights. After
finally getting underway, the teams were scoreless with 6:39 left in
the first half when the lights failed.</TE>
<TE>   "The [original] lights had been rusted through so badly that they
had to be torn down," Roosevelt Coach Jose Casagran said. "The
[school] district told us that we would have new lights but not for
this season. They said they would rent us temporary lights ... but
they didn't contract the companies for the whole season.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we made the playoffs, they had to call out people to run the
lights, and in a miscommunication, they thought the game was Friday
and the guy didn't show up."</TE>
<TE>   The schools' principals agreed the game would be resumed at
Roosevelt if the school could prove, by Friday noon, it would have
working lights.</TE>
<TE>   "We really felt like we played two games," Casagran said. "I've
never seen anything like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Richard Irvin of Pasadena Muir passed for 520 yards in a 52-38
loss to Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula in a Division III game.
Irvin's single-game total is the fourth-best in section history.</TE>
<TE>   The record is held by Doug Baughman of Garden Grove Bolsa Grande,
who passed for 564 yards against Westminster La Quinta in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matt Engle of El Segundo threw for 320 yards and five touchdowns
in a 38-22 victory over San Marino in a first-round Division X game.</TE>
<TE>   Engle has 44 touchdown passes this season, the fifth-best total in
Southern Section history. Robert De La Cruz of Los Angeles Cathedral
has the top two marks of 63 (1999) and 62 (1998). Kyle Boller of
Newhall Hart is third at 59 (1998), and Chris Czernek of Newbury Park
is fourth at 45 (1995).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The stellar high school football career of Huntington Beach
Edison's Tommy Grady ended when he was helped off the field in the
third quarter Friday after being sacked for a 10th time in a 30-7
playoff loss to top-seeded Long Beach Poly.</TE>
<TE>   Grady, who a year ago passed for 268 yards and four touchdowns
against Poly in a 42-28 loss in the Division I title game, completed
seven of 16 passes for 44 yards on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   And one year after throwing for 33 touchdowns with only three
interceptions, he finished his senior season with 14 touchdowns and
seven interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough," said Grady, who is headed to Oklahoma in the fall.
"It didn't go how we wanted it to, not winning and not doing as good
as we thought we would."</TE>
<TE>   Edison finished 4-7 and was in the playoffs as a fourth-place
at-large team. But the season was not without lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether you're on a good or bad team, you have to keep working as
hard as you can," he said. "It made me tougher, mentally and
physically."</TE>
<TE>   Staff writers Ben Bolch, Dan Loumena and Eric Stephens contributed

<KH>DALLAS 21, JACKSONVILLE 19</KH>
<HD>Hutchinson Throws Strikes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>IRVING, Texas</DL>
<LD>Although Chad Hutchinson stumbled through his first three games with
sacks, fumbles and losses, Dallas Cowboy coaches found plenty of
things to praise. Each week they insisted they saw reasons why he can
be their quarterback of the future.</LD>
<LD>   The evidence was a bit more obvious Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Hutchinson threw for 301 yards and two touchdowns, and looked in
command while doing so, leading Dallas to a 21-19 victory over the
Jacksonville Jaguars.</LD>
<TE>   Hutchinson completed 16 of 24 passes, including ones that went for
49, 47 and 43 yards, while throwing for the most yards by a Dallas
rookie since Troy Aikman set the team record with 379 in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was excellent," running back Emmitt Smith said. "He
was poised when he had time to throw and when he had time, he hit the
right receivers."</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson occasionally looked like a 25-year-old rookie who spent
four years pitching in the St. Louis Cardinal organization. He was
sacked three times and threw his first two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The key, though, is that he minimized the damage and showed the
leadership the Cowboys (4-7) are seeking.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas had three offensive touchdowns for the first time this
season, with the scoring drives covering 99, 69 and 65 yards. The
Cowboys had lost four in a row, the last three since Hutchinson
replaced Quincy Carter.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you go out and win, they look at you as a winner,"
Hutchinson said. "We knew there was an opportunity for big plays. We
knew we had to be patient. I was just fortunate enough to put it in
places where they could make plays."</TE>
<TE>   Joey Galloway caught seven passes for 144 yards and both
touchdowns. The improved passing game also helped make the running
game more effective.</TE>
<TE>   All the talk of Smith sharing time with Troy Hambrick didn't
materialize. Smith ran 20 times for 73 yards and a touchdown and
Hambrick had 38 yards in four carries. Hambrick also had 33 yards on
three receptions but fumbled at the end of one deep in Jaguar
territory.</TE>
<TE>   Jacksonville (5-6) had won its previous two games to climb into
playoff contention. To make the playoffs, Coach Tom Coughlin said the
Jaguars had no margin for error.</TE>
<TE>   But Jacksonville made plenty of mistakes against Dallas, the worst
being a goal-line fumble by Fred Taylor midway through the fourth
quarter that Coughlin called "a nightmare." They also had Tim Seder
miss a 40-yard field goal in the second quarter and had a season-high
11 penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "We're back in the hole again," cornerback Jason Craft said.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson opened the second half with the 99-yard drive,
connecting on six of seven passes for 88 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "Going 99 yards I'm sure surprised everyone," Galloway said. "We
knew we had the talent, but it just hadn't been happening."</TE>

<LD>NBA players always share a union and often share an agent and,
sometimes, share a ride from Seattle to Portland, and still it is odd
to see an opposing player in the home locker room, where Tyson
Chandler was Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Chandler, the 20-year-old Chicago Bull who'd pulled on Superman's
cape and then woofed at him in a 13-point loss to the Lakers, walked
into a back room, chatted with Shaquille O'Neal and left with a grin
on his face.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal and Chandler, introduced years ago by Lester Conner, became
friendly when Chandler was at Dominguez High. So Chandler showed up
not to apologize for taunting O'Neal, but to catch up, and there were
no hard feelings.</LD>
<TE>   "I think he's stronger than last year -- seriously," Chandler
said. "I think he lifted weights the whole time he was out because it
was just a joke going up against him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the best player in the NBA, the most dominant for sure."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the Lakers won 58 games and won their third consecutive title
last season, O'Neal and Kobe Bryant combined to shoot 51.7% and
everyone else combined to shoot 42.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Through 13 games this season, with O'Neal missing the first 12
games and Bryant taking a lot of difficult shots, those two had
combined to make 43%, the rest 37.2%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers leave today on a three-game trip through Miami, Orlando
and Memphis. They'll spend Thanksgiving Day at O'Neal's place in
Orlando, eating his turkey.... Samaki Walker suffered a strained
lower back during Sunday night's game against Milwaukee and is
questionable for the Miami game. As the Lakers mull a possible roster
move to bring Mark Madsen off the injured list, Walker received
treatment late Sunday and was to have the same today.</TE>

<KH>NEW ENGLAND 24, MINNESOTA 17</KH>
<HD>Turnovers Have Got a Hold on the Vikings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>The New England Patriots outlasted a Minnesota team that can't win on
the road and can't hang onto the ball anywhere.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Brady threw three touchdown passes in the first half and the
Patriots held on for a 24-17 victory Sunday over the sloppy Vikings.</LD>
<LD>   Minnesota lost three fumbles and forced no turnovers, increasing
its league-worst turnover differential to minus-19. The Vikings have
lost 16 in a row on the road and haven't won since Thanksgiving Day
2000 in Dallas.</LD>
<TE>   "It's our fault," said D'Wayne Bates, who caught one of Daunte
Culpepper's two scoring passes. "The same reasons we lose at home we
lose on the road -- key turnovers, particularly turnovers that lead
to touchdowns."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots (6-5) led, 21-0, and got the ball back at the Viking
31-yard line when Richard Seymour recovered Randy Moss' fumble with
2:14 left in the half. The drive ended at the 39 with an eight-yard
sack on fourth down, and the Vikings got a six-yard touchdown catch
from Bates with 19 seconds left in the half.</TE>
<TE>   "That would have pretty much ended the game in the first half, I
thought, had we punched that one in," Brady said.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings (3-8) pulled to 21-17 early in the fourth quarter, but
the Patriot defense held, and Adam Vinatieri made a 34-yard field
goal with 11:09 left.</TE>
<TE>   Culpepper completed 24 for 49 passes for 272 yards and two
touchdowns. Brady was 21 for 34 passes for 239 yards and threw
scoring passes of nine yards and one yard to Christian Fauria and
five yards to Troy Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought it was going to be easy," Patriot Coach Bill
Belichick said of the Vikings. "They've got some big-play players."</TE>
<TE>   But those players -- Culpepper, Moss and Michael Bennett -- each
lost a fumble, giving the Vikings 16 this season, to go with 16
interceptions.</TE>

<LD>Brent Barry's second basket of the game, a three-pointer with 4.7
seconds left, gave the Seattle SuperSonics a 91-90 victory over the
Spurs Sunday night at San Antonio.</LD>
<LD>   The win ended the Seattle's three-game losing streak and ended the
Spurs' four-game winning streak. The SuperSonics, who trailed from
the second quarter until Barry's shot, were led by Gary Payton's 26
points.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Duncan led San Antonio with 22 points, and David Robinson
added 18 points and 17 rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   Minnesota 106, New York 88 -- Kevin Garnett had 25 points, 15
rebounds and seven assists as the Timberwolves used their substantial
height advantage to win at Madison Square Garden. Allan Houston
scored 32 points, but the Knicks lost for the 10th time in 12 games
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 77, Miami 75 -- Mike Miller made a 22-foot jumper with one
second left at Orlando, Fla., as the Magic survived the absence of
their two best players -- league-leading scorer Tracy McGrady (back
spasms) and Grant Hill (ankle) -- to beat the Heat. In all, Miller
had 31 points and a career-high 19 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 94, Toronto 84 -- Allen Iverson scored 37 points at
Toronto to help the 76ers hand the Raptors their fifth consecutive
loss. Iverson, who has scored 30 or more points in his last four
games, had 23 points in the second half.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>David Bell, who helped the San Francisco Giants reach the World
Series, agreed to a $17-million, four-year deal with the Philadelphia
Phillies on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Bell batted .261 with 20 homers and 73 runs batted in last season.
The free agent will replace All-Star third baseman Scott Rolen, who
was traded to St. Louis in July.</LD>
<LD>   Rolen and Manager Larry Bowa had opposite personalities and feuded
often during their 1 1/2 seasons together. Bell and Bowa got along
well when they were together in Seattle from 1999-01.</LD>
<TE>   "I know Larry, and I really like Larry," Bell said. "I look
forward to playing for him."</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Red Sox will hire Theo Epstein as their general
manager, a team source told the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Epstein, 28, will be the youngest general manager in baseball
history when the team makes the announcement, which is expected to
come today. Randy Smith was 29 when he was hired by the San Diego
Padres in 1993.</TE>

<TE>   Sorenstam smiled and lightly pumped her fist several times when
the final putt of another record-breaking year fell in for par.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam finished at 13-under 275 for a three-stroke victory and
earned $215,000, making her the first woman to exceed $11 million in
career earnings. She ended the season with a 68.70 scoring average,
shattering the record she set last year (69.42).</TE>
<TE>   Mickey Wright in 1964 was the last player to win 11 times in one
season. Wright set the record of 13 victories in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods shot a four-under 67 for his best round in the Dunlop
Phoenix at Miyazaki, Japan, but finished six strokes behind winner
Kaname Yokoo of Japan.</TE>

<KH>HOUSTON 16, NEW YORK GIANTS 14</KH>
<HD>Texans Use Their Bag of Tricks to Pull Out Win</HD>

<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The Houston Texans aren't just beating mediocre teams anymore.
They've improved enough to hurt the ones with playoff aspirations --
like the New York Giants.</LD>
<LD>   The Texans used a trick play, a big punt return and two field
goals by Kris Brown -- the last one a 50-yarder with 6:57 to play --
to defeat the Giants, 16-14, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "This one is going to sting," Giant quarterback Kerry Collins
said. "We did not play well enough to win, but we are just going to
have to come back and get a win next week."</LD>
<TE>   Houston (3-8) beat Dallas to open the season and later defeated
Jacksonville, but this was the Texans' first victory over a team with
a winning record.</TE>
<TE>   "This is great. It should lift everyone's spirit," Texan center
Steve McKinney said. "It lets all the guys know if we can hang around
until the fourth quarter, we'll have a chance to win.</TE>
<TE>   Giant Coach Jim Fassel was upset after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "All week long, all I talked about was being ready," Fassel said.
"I know we made mistakes. They were trying to play hard and were
playing hard, but we just made mistakes too many times."</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 14-13 after Collins threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to
Amani Toomer with 13:10 to play, the Texans drove 41 yards to the
Giants 32, setting up Brown's game-decider.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I'm here," Brown said. "Anytime I get an opportunity
to put points on the board, I've got to make sure I take advantage."</TE>
<TE>   It still took two late interceptions -- by Matt Stevens with 5:57
to play and by Jeff Posey with 1:19 left -- to preserve Houston's
victory. The Texans won for the first time in four games and ended
the Giants' winning streak at three.</TE>
<TE>   Posey's interception ended New York's next-to-last drive at the
Texan 29. New York got the ball back with 22 seconds to play, but a
long pass by Collins fell incomplete in the front part of the end
zone as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   After a dull first half that ended with the Giants (6-5) leading
7-5, the Texans enlivened the game with a 39-yard punt return by
Jermaine Lewis to the Giants 34, and another of the Texans' trick
plays, setting up a one-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Wells.</TE>
<TE>   Facing third-and-six from the New York 30 after the punt return,
Carr lateraled across the field to James Allen, who threw the ball
back to Carr, who had an open field and ran to the two-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   After Wells' touchdown, Carr passed to Allen for the two-point
conversion and a 13-7 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Carr completed 10 of 23 passes for 103 yards. Collins was 18 for
41 for 214 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We made enough mistakes to cost us the game: a field goal missed
that should have been made, a ball over the punter's head to give
them two other points," Fassel said. "I'm not happy about that at
all."</TE>

<KH>OAKLAND 41, ARIZONA 20</KH>
<HD>Raider Offense Is Right at Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The schedule says this was a road victory for Oakland. With a sea of
Raider black in the stands, it felt just like home.</LD>
<LD>   Rich Gannon moved the NFL's No. 1 offense up and down the field
with little resistance in a 41-20 victory over the reeling Arizona
Cardinals on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Gannon completed 27 of 45 passes for 340 yards and three
touchdowns, Charlie Garner rushed for 100 yards and a score, and
Tyrone Wheatley had 82 yards and a touchdown in 13 carries.</LD>
<TE>   "We felt by watching film that we could pretty much do what we
wanted," said Oakland's Jerry Porter, who caught two touchdown
passes, "whether it be running it or passing it."</TE>
<TE>   Gannon topped 300 yards passing for the eighth time in 10 games.
The record for 300-yard passing games in a season is nine, held by
Dan Marino, Warren Moon and Kurt Warner.</TE>
<TE>   "Rich is just having an unbelievable year," said Jerry Rice, who
caught seven passes for 110 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders (7-4) amassed a season-high 520 yards against the
hapless Cardinals, who lost their fifth in a row and have been
outscored 171-84 in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Marcel Shipp gained 135 yards in 16 carries for Arizona in his
first NFL start. But the Raiders scored touchdowns after Jake
Plummer's two first-quarter turnovers and were in control throughout.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland's first touchdown came after Plummer inexplicably tried a
no-look, behind-the-back lateral on a broken play. Shipp got the
start because Thomas Jones broke his right hand Friday night. Jones
told the Cardinals he broke it when he hit it on a counter reaching
for a ringing telephone.</TE>
<TE>   With more than half the crowd of 58,814 in 73,000-seat Sun Devil
Stadium decked out in Raider black, Oakland won its third in a row
after a four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   "When we came out, they cheered us like it was a home game,"
Porter said. "When they [the Cardinals] came out, they booed them. It
kind of shocked me."</TE>
<TE>   Gannon threw touchdown passes of seven and 14 yards to Porter in
the first half and a 37-yarder to Rice for a third-quarter score.</TE>
<TE>   Shipp was the lone bright spot for the Cardinals (4-7). The
second-year running back from Massachusetts, who was not drafted, had
122 yards by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders revved up their offense with a 17-point third quarter.
Oakland had touchdown drives of 62 and 64 yards on its first two
possessions of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Sebastian Janikowski's 37-yard field goal made it 38-14 with 43
seconds left in the third quarter. Janikowski capped the blowout with
a 51-yarder with 1:56 remaining in the game as Oakland avenged a
34-31 overtime loss at home to Arizona last year.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's 4-2 start seemed like ancient history in the Cardinals'
locker room. "I just wish I could say something that would make
everything better, but there's nothing to be said," defensive tackle
Russell Davis said. "Guys have got to look at themselves and say 'Are
we going to give up or are we going to go out there and play ball?' "</TE>

<HD>A Unique Runner</HD>
<DH>Despite Tourette's syndrome, Morgan is one of Canyon's best</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Ortega</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As they are before just about every big race, the high school runners
competing in the Division I boys' race of the Southern Section
cross-country championships are a bundle of nerves and excitement.</LD>
<LD>   Some shake their arms and legs, perhaps in a nervous habit,
perhaps trying to loosen up. Some take long, slow, deep breaths.
Others seem deep in thought as they absently chew on their
fingernails.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan Morgan, a top runner from Canyon Country Canyon High, which
has one of the best teams in the state, is among them. The senior
looks calm, but his mind is in a full sprint even though his legs
haven't started the race.</LD>
<TE>   Because of illness, he and several teammates are at less than 100%
for Saturday's race and he knows he needs a top effort to help his
team advance to the state championships in Fresno in another week.</TE>
<TE>   His goal had been to break the 15-minute barrier in what would be
his last trip over Mt. San Antonio College's 2.91-mile course as a
high school runner. But now those thoughts, which would have made him
edgy enough, have taken a backseat to the needs of his team.</TE>
<TE>   It is important for him to remain calm and keep his focus --
indeed, more important for him than any other runner in the race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Flashback three years, to the early stages of what is the first
Foothill League cross-country race of the 1999 season.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan is racing alongside his teammates in the first 200 yards of
the course at Griffith Park when he suddenly completes three
consecutive 360-degree spins before continuing on.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Broneer, Canyon's co-coach, recalls many spectators wondering
what was happening. "They said, 'What's that guy doing? Is he showing
off or what?' They didn't know about his condition."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan has Tourette's syndrome, an inherited neurological
condition characterized by repeated and involuntary body movements --
tics -- and uncontrollable vocal sounds.</TE>
<TE>   He was a fifth grader when he was diagnosed with attention deficit
disorder. The tics associated with Tourette's became prevalent about
a year later.</TE>
<TE>   "It started out as little things, like him making the sound of a
bird chirping," his mother, Martha, said. "Then it developed into
things like him doing a 360-degree spin or grabbing his leg and
pulling it up toward him."</TE>
<TE>   Dave DeLong, Canyon's other cross-country co-coach, recalls the
tics being so violent that they would cause Morgan to yell and fall
out of his chair during classes in his first year of high school.</TE>
<TE>   The frequency of the tics only increased when Morgan got nervous
or excited. In important competitions, he might do spins, or crouch
to touch the ground behind him during a race.</TE>
<TE>   But that was then, and this is now.</TE>
<TE>   His tics, as he has grown older, are no longer as obvious. Now
during a big race, they might show up every 200-300 yards in the form
of a quick, skipping-like motion in his stride.</TE>
<TE>   Other people, he knows, are disabled by Tourette's. As far as he
is concerned, he is only inconvenienced.</TE>
<TE>   "Tourette's doesn't bug me at all," Morgan said last week. "People
always joked about it in my younger days, but it doesn't bother me
now because everyone knows who I am and it gives me certain
characteristics. Everyone says that if I didn't have it, I wouldn't
be me."</TE>
<TE>   It also isn't the only adversity he has had to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   When he was very young, an injury restricted the flow of blood to
an area near his left hip and caused the top of his thigh bone to
die. In order to correct that, he wore a series of casts and leg
braces.</TE>
<TE>   Finally able to rid himself of the braces in fourth grade, he
shortly thereafter was diagnosed with ADD. Two years after that, his
father committed suicide.</TE>
<TE>   That, Morgan said, was rock bottom.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time I cried was the day my dad passed away," Morgan
said. "Nothing can be as brutal as that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes into Saturday's race, it's apparent that Morgan is
running more conservatively than usual. Is that because he isn't
feeling well, or because he is following directions?</TE>
<TE>   He's in the top 20 or so in the 121-runner field, but his coaches
have told him to hold back more than usual in order to conserve
energy and not overdo it during the flat first mile of the race.</TE>
<TE>   When Morgan ran 15 minutes 7 seconds to place fifth in the
Southern Section Division I final over the same course last year, he
passed the mile mark in a group of five that included Michael Poe of
Etiwanda High.</TE>
<TE>   Approaching the same point on Saturday, he has moved into the top
dozen, only a few strides back of first-place Poe as the field begins
its ascent up the switchbacks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a junior last year, Morgan was the No. 3 runner on a Canyon
team ranked second nationally after winning Division I titles in the
section and state championships.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for a guy who had never run on an organized level before
high school.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan became serious about running after his older brother,
Drake, Canyon's school record-holder in the pole vault, suggested he
go out for the cross-country team as a freshman.</TE>
<TE>   Success in running has brought stability. After getting poor
grades through most of middle school and spending more than his fair
share of time in a vice principal's office for disciplinary reasons,
Morgan has earned mostly Bs and Cs at Canyon. And he feels as if he's
part of something special as a member of the cross-country and track
and field teams.</TE>
<TE>   "[Running] has taken me away from a lot of things that I could
have done wrong," Morgan said. "If I wasn't involved with running,
who knows where I would be right now.... Straight Fs and probably on
the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Martha Morgan agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just that he's found something he's good at," she said,
"but that he's surrounded by coaches and teammates who are
responsible people and care about him."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan's teammates never made fun of his tic. Rather, they've had
fun with it. Some have invented their own tics, and if Morgan
experiences one at the starting line of a race they'll often pitch in
with one of their own to draw the attention of runners or spectators
who might be staring at him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just part of his uniqueness," teammate Mark Bingham said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After the one-mile mark of Saturday's race, Poe breaks away from
the field. Morgan lets him go, but he is in good position, in the top
10, near the base of aptly named "Poop-Out Hill."</TE>
<TE>   Kellen Acosta of Murrieta Valley and Alex Benavidez of Don Lugo
pass Morgan as they turn up "Reservoir Hill" with 1,000 meters left
in the race. But Morgan overtakes them before the top of the hill and
holds them off in the final half-mile.</TE>
<TE>   He finishes eighth in a time of 15:18 -- 11 seconds off his career
best at Mt. San Antonio, but good enough to lead Canyon to a
sixth-place finish and give his team its third consecutive berth in
the state championships.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is that we got there," Morgan said. "I think
we can definitely run better next week. I know I can."</TE>

<HD>Champions League's Attendance Up</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The European Champions League, the most successful club competition
in the world, saw its attendance rise by 10% during the first round
of this year's tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Figures released by UEFA, European soccer's governing body, showed
that 3,378,442 people attended matches during the 32-team first
phase, an increase of almost 300,000 from the 2001-2002 season.</LD>
<LD>   Stadium capacity also increased in terms of percentage filled,
rising from 74% to 79%, UEFA said, while the television audience in
the six major markets -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands and Spain -- rose from 41.5 million viewers a year ago to
43.5 million this year.</LD>
<TE>   The Champions League's second round begins this week, with 16
teams still in contention.</TE>
<TE>   Algerian Victory</TE>
<TE>   The Algerian club JS Kabylie on Sunday became the first team to
win the Confederation of Africa Football Cup three years in a row,
despite losing, 1-0, to Tonnerre Yaounde of Cameroon in the second
game of the two-game final at Yaounde, Cameroon.</TE>
<TE>   Kabylie had won the first match, 4-0, in Algeria and claimed the
Cup, 4-1, on aggregate.</TE>
<TE>   Santos Resurgent</TE>
<TE>   Santos, the club that was led to worldwide fame by the exploits of
Pele more than three decades ago but which has since fallen on harder
times, continued its resurgence with a surprise victory over favored
Sao Paolo in the Brazilian championship quarterfinals Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Robinho, 18, and Diego, 17, each scored in a 3-1 victory in the
first game of the two-match quarterfinal series. Santos last won the
Brazilian championship in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   In another quarterfinal game, Corinthians, led by 1994 World
Cup-winning coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, swamped Atletico Mineiro,
6-2, in front of 81,000 as striker Deivid scored four goals.</TE>
<TE>   Also, veteran Romario, 36, created all three goals as Fluminense
shut out Sao Caetano, 3-0, and Gremio and Juventude played to a
scoreless tie.</TE>
<TE>   Cagliari Punished</TE>
<TE>   The Italian Serie B club Cagliari has been banned from its own
stadium for three games and fined $10,000 because one of its fans ran
onto the field and knocked Messina goalkeeper Emanuele Manitta
unconscious during a league game last week.</TE>
<TE>   In meting out the punishment, the Italian league's disciplinary
committee also awarded Messina a 2-0 victory in the match. Messina
had been leading, 1-0, when the incident occurred, causing the match
to be abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink Moves</TE>
<TE>   The speculation over which South Korean national team players
former coach Guus Hiddink eventually would take with him when he left
Korea to coach to PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch league appears to be
over.</TE>
<TE>   The Dutch team is close to reaching agreement to bring midfielder
Park Ji Sung to PSV from his Japanese club, Kyoto Purple Sanga, for a
Korean-record $4.5 million and now is moving to also acquire
midfielder Lee Chun Soo.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina Rising</TE>
<TE>   Coach Marcelo Bielsa said his first priority now that Argentina
has emerged from its post-World Cup hibernation is to rebuild fans'
confidence in the team.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina scored a 2-0 victory over Japan on Wednesday in its
first game since being knocked out of the World Cup in the first
round.</TE>
<TE>   Asian Champions</TE>
<TE>   All three of Asia's major league championships have been decided,
with Dalian Shide of China becoming the latest title winner on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Dalian earned its seventh Chinese championship in the last nine
years with a 2-1 victory over Beijing Guoan.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Jubilo Iwata became the first club to win both halves
of Japan's split-season J-League championship, while earlier,
Seongnam Chunma won the Korean league title for the second year in a
row.</TE>

<LD>   The catch, of course, is it won't be the Bruins.</LD>

<TE>   "To keep Washington State out of the Rose Bowl and put USC in the
Rose Bowl?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what, we just try to win, no matter who's going to go
where. We just want to win, no matter what happens."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins' chances of winning -- and the Trojans' chances of
reaching the Rose Bowl -- will be considerably higher if Washington
State quarterback Jason Gesser can't play because of the high ankle
sprain he suffered in Saturday's loss.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser has a well-earned reputation for playing hurt -- he endured
cracked ribs last season and a separated rib this season -- but high
ankle sprains are notoriously slow-healing injuries that often cost
athletes a month or more.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't get hurt and leave the game, we would have won that
game," Gesser told reporters after the Washington loss. "Hopefully I
can finish this season out and play against UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Price called it 50-50 Gesser will play against UCLA
after Gesser's first two sessions with the training staff Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a chance he'll be back," Price said. "If you ask Jason,
it's 100% he'll be back. I don't know, but there is a chance. It
isn't hopeless at all."</TE>
<TE>   Gesser has managed improbable comebacks before, returning from a
dislocated rib against Montana State in September to pass for 431
yards the next week in a come-from-behind victory over California.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know about this one," Price said. "This one's a funny
injury, real weird. Obviously, he'd probably be in shotgun quite a
bit. If anyone could do it, he can."</TE>
<TE>   With Washington State students on fall break, the team is off
until Thursday evening, when the Cougars will begin preparing as if
backup Matt Kegel will start against UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins still can finish as high as third in the Pacific 10
standings -- it would require a UCLA victory over Washington State
and a somewhat unlikely Arizona State loss to Arizona. They also
could finish tied for third or as low as a multi-team tie for fourth.
(Oregon State and Washington are in the clubhouse at 4-4, and UCLA
and Arizona State are 4-3 with a game to play. Cal, also 4-4, is
ineligible for a bowl after its NCAA probation appeal.)</TE>
<TE>   In the case of ties, the Pac-10's bowls pick in order from among
the tied teams.</TE>
<TE>   After the Rose and the Dec. 27 Holiday Bowl, the Pac-10
affiliations, in order, are the Dec. 31 Sun Bowl in El Paso-- where
UCLA lost to Wisconsin in 2000 -- the Dec. 26 Insight.com Bowl in
Phoenix, the Dec. 25 Las Vegas Bowl and the Dec. 31 Silicon Valley
game in San Jose, which is facing serious financial difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to overestimate all that rests on Gesser's ankle.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars led, 20-10, with less than five minutes remaining
Saturday. But with Gesser already out, Washington rallied.</TE>
<TE>   The game ended on a controversial call on a play that was ruled a
lateral and a fumble recovered by Washington instead of a deflected
incomplete pass.</TE>
<TE>   Price said Sunday after reviewing the tape he is "positive" the
call was wrong and that in addition to his usual report on the
officials to the Pac-10, he will consider calling Commissioner Tom
Hansen, who was at the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I might give him a call, but it's over. It's done with. You can't
get it back."</TE>
<TE>   Against UCLA, Washington State has a chance to take back the Rose
Bowl. Kegel, a junior, has completed 26 of 39 passes, but only for
203 yards and without a completion longer than 19 yards. But Price
said he is capable of winning the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have a chance to go to the Rose Bowl and not too many
people in life get second chances," Price said.</TE>

<LD>Last season: 21-12 overall, 11-7 in Pacific 10 play.</LD>
<LD>   Finish: Sixth in the Pac-10, reached the NCAA West Regional
semifinal while seeded No. 8, beating No. 9 Mississippi and No. 1
Cincinnati before losing to No. 12 Missouri.</LD>
<LD>   Coach: Steve Lavin, seventh season, 135-59.</LD>
<TE>   Who's gone: Center Dan Gadzuric, forward Matt Barnes and guards
Billy Knight and Rico Hines.</TE>
<TE>   Who's new: Centers Michael Fey and Ryan Hollins, forward Marcedes
Lewis, guards Ray Young and Jon Crispin.</TE>
<TE>   Projected starters: Forwards Jason Kapono (16 points, 5.1
rebounds) and Dijon Thompson (4.5 points, 2.2 rebounds), center T.J.
Cummings (7.6 points, 3.1 rebounds), guards Cedric Bozeman (4 points,
3.5 assists) and Ray Young (7 points, 2.2 rebounds in 2000-01).</TE>
<TE>   Keys to season: The development -- especially on defense -- of
freshman post players Michael Fey and Ryan Hollins is needed to
overcome the loss of Gadzuric and Barnes. Point guards Cedric Bozeman
and Ryan Walcott must continue to improve. Strong perimeter shooting
from Kapono, Young and Crispin is essential.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Getting 20 wins will be a challenge with a grueling
nonconference schedule. UCLA is picked to finish third in the Pac-10.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>CEDRIC BOZEMAN (Guard)</LD>
<LD>   No. 21, 6-6, 183, sophomore: The freshman struggles caused by
inexperience and an early season knee injury behind him, Bozeman
could be the most improved Bruin. He should be more adept at
involving his teammates and more aggressive using his height and
driving to the basket. Whether he is a better free-throw shooter
(28.6%) remains to be seen.</LD>
<LD>   No. 55, 6-2, 195, junior: After sitting out last season as a
transfer, Crispin should add depth and another shooting threat to the
backcourt. He started 31 games as a sophomore at Penn State,
averaging 7.2 points. He made 110 three-point shots in two seasons
with the Nittany Lions.</LD>
<TE>*--*
JON CRISPIN (Guard)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>*--*
T.J. CUMMINGS (Center-Forward)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 43, 6-10, 223, junior: An adept scorer from mid-range and a
50.0% shooter, Cummings must become a better all-around player to
help make up for the loss of Dan Gadzuric and Matt Barnes. He has
averaged only 3.3 rebounds in two seasons. Cummings is a vocal leader
whose positive demeanor rubs off on teammates.</TE>
<TE>*--*
MICHAEL FEY (Center)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 45, 6-11, 245, freshman: A traditional wide-body center, Fey
could develop into a force. He can score from inside 10 feet and has
a knack for drawing fouls. More important to the Bruins will be his
ability to rebound and defend. There are few experienced Pac-10
centers, so this is a good season for Fey to become acclimated.</TE>
<TE>*--*
JOHN HOFFART (Center)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 52, 6-10, 279, junior: Basically a quality practice opponent
for Gadzuric last season, Hoffart could become valuable if Fey and
Hollins are slow to develop. A transfer two years ago from Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo, Hoffart works hard and understands the system.</TE>
<TE>*--*
RYAN HOLLINS (Center)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 15, 6-11, 215, freshman: One of the most athletic big men to
enroll at UCLA in many years, Hollins is a windmill shot-blocker who
can run the floor and dunk with a flourish. However, he is very green
-- he didn't start until his senior year at Muir High. Expect
everything from highlight-reel plays to raw freshman mistakes.</TE>
<TE>*--*
JOSIAH JOHNSON (Forward)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 54, 6-7, 237, sophomore: A seldom-used reserve last season,
Johnson has a nice touch from mid-range and is strong enough to
battle on the boards. The son of former Bruin great Marques Johnson
and brother of former Bruin Kris Johnson will gain playing time as he
reaches peak physical condition.</TE>
<TE>*--*
JASON KAPONO (Forward)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 24, 6-8, 213, senior: One of the most prolific scorers in UCLA
history, Kapono decided against declaring for the NBA draft for the
third year in a row. His motivation has never been greater and his
leadership has never been stronger. Kapono says his primary goal is
to win a championship before leaving UCLA.</TE>
<TE>*--*
MARCEDES LEWIS (Forward)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 4, 6-6, 240, freshman: A frequently used reserve tight end on
the football team, Lewis is determined to play two sports. Although
he won't join the team until football season ends, he could add a
much-needed rugged presence on the boards. Lewis averaged 16 points
and 10 rebounds in two years at Long Beach Poly High.</TE>
<TE>*--*
ANDRE PATTERSON (Forward)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 5, 6-7, 204, sophomore: Currently taking classes at Santa
Monica College, Patterson will join the Bruins in mid-December if he
makes sufficient academic progress. He is sorely needed. Patterson is
the team's best rebounder and a strong defender who could ease the
burden on Fey and Hollins.</TE>
<TE>*--*
DIJON THOMPSON (Guard-Forward)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 1, 6-7, 192, sophomore: Perhaps the best NBA prospect on the
roster, Thompson is a versatile wing player who can score, rebound
and play smothering defense. His shooting improved dramatically in
the second half of last season. Thompson needs to improve his passing
and cut down on turnovers.</TE>
<TE>*--*
RYAN WALCOTT (Guard)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 10, 6-1, 170, sophomore: An adept point guard, Walcott
contributes more than what is apparent on the stat sheet. The Bruin
offense often purred when he was at the controls. Walcott again will
play behind Bozeman and should get about 10 minutes a game. Improving
his three-point shooting is an emphasis in practice.</TE>
<TE>*--*
RAY YOUNG (Guard)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 34, 6-4, 210, senior: After redshirting last season, Young
will start at shooting guard, essentially replacing Billy Knight. He
has appeared in 94 games and started 22. Young is an excellent
defensive stopper who spent his year off honing his jump shot. He is
expected to be a three-point threat who will complement Kapono on the
perimeter.</TE>

<LD>So much for extended celebrations.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, USC reveled in euphoria for weeks after shutting out
UCLA in the last game of the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, a day after his team again routed its rival and moved
up to No. 6 in the Associated Press poll, Coach Pete Carroll and his
staff were back to work mapping out strategy for this week's showdown
with No. 7 Notre Dame.</LD>
<TE>   "We're just in the same mode," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll, however, did not hide his happiness over securing at
least a share of the Pacific 10 Conference championship. Washington
helped make it possible by upsetting Washington State in triple
overtime at Pullman.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State, which defeated USC in overtime, 30-27, on Oct.
5, can tie for the title and earn a berth in the Rose Bowl game if
the Cougars defeat UCLA at the Rose Bowl on Dec. 7. If Washington
State loses, USC wins the title outright and will play in the Rose
Bowl game Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big step for us to be a conference champion whether it's a
co-champion or not," said Carroll, who listened in his car as a
friend delivered play-by-play of the Washington State game by
cellular phone. "It would be great fun to top it off and go to the
Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope everyone that's a Trojan fan goes to the Rose Bowl [for
the Washington State-UCLA game] and fills it up. Cardinal and gold
would look great in there that day."</TE>
<TE>   USC's 52-21 victory over UCLA extended the Trojans' winning streak
to six games and assured the Trojans of their first nine-win regular
season since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, that was the last year USC and Notre Dame both
were ranked among the top seven when they played. Top-ranked Notre
Dame defeated second-ranked USC, 27-10, at the Coliseum and went on
to win the national championship.</TE>
<TE>   It is highly unlikely that either school will play for this year's
national title in the Fiesta Bowl, but both are in the running for
possible berths in the Sugar or Orange bowls. If USC wins the Pac-10
outright and does not ascend to the top two spots in the BCS
standings, it is contractually bound to play in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Bowl scenarios, however, were not on the minds of USC players
after dismantling UCLA. Notre Dame was -- especially after the
Fighting Irish beat Rutgers, 42-0.</TE>
<TE>   "We let the nation know today we're a real team and we play real
hard," safety DeShaun Hill said. "We saw they won, 42-0, so we know
it's a big-time game. They are a championship-caliber team like we
are."</TE>
<TE>   Said freshman receiver Mike Williams: "This sets us up pretty
good. We're back home, and we play well at home."</TE>
<TE>   USC has won eight consecutive games over the last two seasons at
the Coliseum. But extending that streak to nine will be a challenge
because the Trojans have not defeated UCLA and Notre Dame in the same
season since 1981. They have not defeated the Bruins and Fighting
Irish in consecutive games in the same season since 1978.</TE>
<TE>   There also is the Willingham factor.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame Coach Tyrone Willingham guided Stanford to victories
over USC in his last three seasons with the Cardinal before he left
for South Bend, Ind., last Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said familiarity with Willingham's systems would help the
Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the same coordinators and a lot of the same stuff is
being run," Carroll said. "It's not like a brand-new team to us."</TE>
<TE>   Trojan players said they would learn more about Notre Dame in film
sessions this week, but they've already drawn some conclusions based
on televised games and highlights.</TE>
<TE>   "The first couple games, their defense was being compared to the
Baltimore Ravens when they won the Super Bowl, like they were the
greatest ever," tackle Bernard Riley said. "I think they are going to
have their hands full with us."</TE>
<TE>   Trojan quarterback Carson Palmer, who passed for 254 yards and
four touchdowns against UCLA, said Notre Dame presents a greater
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have a whole lot of offense, they win with their
defense," he said. "We're going to have to play really well on
offense to get past them."</TE>
<TE>   USC's offense was in high gear against UCLA. The Trojans amassed
468 yards and scored almost at will as receivers repeatedly beat
Bruin cornerbacks. USC scored its most points of the season and
eclipsed 40 points for the fourth time in five games.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed this game offensively," said wide receiver Kareem
Kelly, who is three receptions shy of Johnnie Morton's USC
career-record 201. "We're going to need another performance like this
against Notre Dame."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said center Norm Katnik suffered a sprained ankle against
UCLA but will try to play against Notre Dame. Senior Derek Graf would
start in Katnik's place if he cannot practice or play.... Williams'
997 receiving yards is a Pac-10 record for a freshman.</TE>

<HD>Dying Young in Honduras</HD>
<DH>Gangs with roots in L.A. are largely to blame for the
increasing violence. But another group has blood on its hands as
well: the police.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras</DL>
<LD>The kids turn up dead nearly every day in some foul corner of this
capital.</LD>
<LD>   Some have been shot in the head. Some have been beaten with
sticks. Some have been hacked to bits. Their bodies are dumped into
muddy ditches or dead-end alleys like dolls chucked in the trash.</LD>
<LD>   Many are scarred with the crude black tattoos that mark them as
gang members, probably victims of an internecine war over drugs or
street corner space. But even more appear to be kids with no criminal
history.</LD>
<TE>   In the last five years, by one count, more than 700 youths 18 or
younger have turned up dead in Honduras, a vast majority in two major
cities, Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. The number has grown each
year, jumping from 66 kids in 1998 to a projected 230 this year.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Los Angeles -- with a population more than double
those of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula combined -- saw 108 homicides
of youths 18 or younger last year and 83 this year to date, not
including cases of child abuse, according to the Los Angeles Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the deaths here is an explosion of gang violence
during the last five years. Police estimate that more than 33,000
gang members stalk the country, most of them tied to Los
Angeles-based gangs. They kill one another for points, for respect,
or just for fun.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a game of 'Doom' to them," said Cesar Ruiz, the city's
chief homicide inspector, referring to a violent computer game.</TE>
<TE>   But at least some of the children were killed by police officers
bent on wiping out suspected gang members. President Ricardo Maduro
held an extraordinary news conference last month in which he admitted
that at least 23 kids had died at the hands of state security agents
over the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups and the United Nations believe the figure to
be much higher, as does the national police department's internal
affairs investigator. They say the government has allowed ad hoc
death squads to flourish both in the department and among private
citizen militias.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the government has issued a policy to the military
or police that says, 'Go kill kids,' " said Bruce Harris, regional
director of Casa Alianza, a group dedicated to protecting street
children. "But I would say that either through direct action or
inaction, there's state responsibility in the murder of children."</TE>
<TE>   Blanca Valladares keeps a tattered manila folder with a few blurry
photos of her son, who was found dead in a police station holding
cell in May.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen-year-old Franklin Noe Valladares wasn't involved in
gangs, she said, displaying a photo as proof. He is standing
shirtless in a grassy meadow. His narrow chest is thrust forward with
the cockiness of youth. He has none of the tattoos that gang members
here receive as part of their initiation rites.</TE>
<TE>   Police brought him in for questioning on suspicion that he stole a
wristwatch from another youth. Although the investigation is still
incomplete, Blanca Valladares believes police beat her asthmatic son,
who then had an attack, collapsed and died.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin was the second son Valladares lost. Her oldest child was
shot and killed by an angry drunk four years ago. His killer also
remains at large.</TE>
<TE>   "I spend my days crying and crying. I ask God for help to move
ahead," she said, her face trembling with the effort to block tears.
"Five months have passed, and they have said nothing to me. I want
answers."</TE>
<TE>   Casa Alianza was the first to sound the alarm about the growing
number of dead children. Five years ago, the group, which is
affiliated with the New York-based Catholic charity Covenant House,
began noticing more and more slayings of homeless kids.</TE>
<TE>   Casa Alianza heard stories from the children it took in, about
kids being rounded up for questioning by police and their battered
bodies appearing in the street the next day. The group was told of
white trucks similar to police vehicles that would take kids off the
streets, and of cops dumping gang members in rival turf, ensuring
that the youths would be attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Casa Alianza began gathering evidence. In one case, two teens
allegedly were taken by police officers for questioning in a town
outside the capital. The youths were later found dead, stabbed with
ice picks and their genitals cut off.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, four people -- ages 15, 17, 19 and 32 -- were
found slain at four spots around Tegucigalpa after having been taken
in by police for questioning. Each had been shot with the same
weapon, the corpses scattered apparently to throw off investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Casa Alianza investigators have collected information on 1,248
children and young adults killed between January 1998 and the end of
last June. Of those, 725 were 18 or younger. In about 4% of all
cases, evidence points to police committing the killings,
investigators say. In about 11%, they blame vigilante groups
operating with tacit police endorsement. About 13% are attributed to
gangs. The rest of the slayings were committed by unknown assailants
or blamed on others, such as private guards.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the visibility of the gangs, there is no single
explanation for the growing violence in Honduras. Some people blame a
U.S. policy that began in 1996 of deporting rather than trying
illegal immigrants accused of serious crimes. Many were U.S.-based
gang members who returned to their homes in Honduras and started
gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Others tie it to the economic and social dislocation that followed
Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which devastated Honduras. Lost jobs and
families shattered by the stress of rebuilding might have contributed
to the wave in violence.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, some blame the end of Honduras' mandatory draft, in which
the military often rounded up teenagers by force to serve their time.
Now these young people find themselves with no jobs and nothing to
do.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the cause, everyone agrees there is no easy answer to the
gang problem. "It goes to the deepest roots of society," said Oscar
Alvarez, the country's dynamic young security minister.</TE>
<TE>   Casa Alianza's contention that the police were executing children
attracted the notice of Asma Jahangir, the United Nations' special
rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execution.</TE>
<TE>   Jahangir spent 10 days in Honduras last year and produced a report
this fall that concluded there had been a "number of instances" of
children killed by police or by citizen militias whose activities are
tolerated by the government.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the report was delivered, the Maduro administration
had launched an investigation. The government report concluded that
574 minors had been killed from January 1998 to last June. The
government decided that in at least 23 cases, the police were
responsible.</TE>
<TE>   As a response, the government created a special police unit to
investigate child homicides. It also set up a committee to monitor
the results. So far, one former police officer has been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez said the government's acknowledgment of responsibility is
a sign of the willingness to confront a problem in its own ranks.
But, he said, the government believes the vast majority of the
killings can be blamed on gang-on-gang violence. Stopping the
killings means stopping the gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Part of his solution lies in a general crackdown on crime. Maduro
won office last year on pledges to have "zero tolerance" for crime.
He has put thousands of soldiers on the streets, proposed tough new
sentencing laws and urged lawmakers to lower the age at which youths
can be tried as adults.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the solution lies beyond police control, Alvarez said.
Youth gangs are as much a social problem as a criminal one.</TE>
<TE>   "I can have all the police officers and cars and radios I need,
and we'll have the same problems," Alvarez said.</TE>
<TE>   A short trip outside Tegucigalpa reveals how serious the problem
is. At a rehabilitation center in pine-covered hills, four youths sit
by a gurgling fountain looking slightly uncomfortable in their new
surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   They are far from the filthy cities where they once ran through
the streets, killing and robbing. All are former gang members and
drug addicts who have come here to this ranch, called Project
Victory, to look for new lives.</TE>
<TE>   They know firsthand the problem of kids getting killed in
Honduras' cities. One is here because his best friend was killed in a
hail of gunfire. Another has seen 20 of his friends die in five years
of gang life.</TE>
<TE>   For them, there is no mystery about who is killing the country's
children. They are.</TE>
<TE>   "I sincerely believe that the police don't have very much to do
with this. The real reason is rivalry and hatred between the gangs,"
said a 22-year-old former gang member who asked to be called Alex.</TE>
<TE>   Alex joined a gang called the Salvatrucha when he was 13. At 15,
he was sent for "training" to Los Angeles, the gang's headquarters
and birthplace. He speaks fondly of the days he spent in downtown
MacArthur Park, learning how to deal drugs and memorizing the gang's
internal code of conduct.</TE>
<TE>   He was deported to Honduras three years ago after being caught by
police. Back in his native country, Alex found himself disenchanted
with gang life. There was too much focus on killing, even compared
with the violent U.S. gangs.</TE>
<TE>   So he came to Project Victory to escape. He is trapped now, unable
to return to his neighborhood. Rival gang members still want to
settle scores. And his former companions want to kill him for
deserting.</TE>
<TE>   He ducks his head and pauses for a long moment when asked what can
be done to stem the bloodshed. He doesn't really have an answer.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go back and help," he said. "I want to help the other
young members get out of that life. I still care for them."</TE>
<TE>   Miller was recently on assignment in Honduras.</TE>

<HD>Owners of Oil Tankers Jittery</HD>
<DH>The large vessels are seen as easy targets for terrorists.
Mandatory security measures for commercial ships and ports are
sought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Warren Vieth</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Operators of giant oil tankers, convinced they have become sitting
ducks for global terrorists, are avoiding risky ports, requesting new
security precautions and seeking more armed protection as they sail
the waters of the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to an October tanker bombing and threats of more to
come, some ship owners want port authorities to declare approach
channels for tankers off-limits to all other craft. If an
unauthorized boat entered the "no-go" zone and headed straight for a
tanker, they say, naval patrols and coastal police should have the
authority to open fire.</LD>
<LD>   Next month, member governments of the International Maritime
Organization, a United Nations agency, are expected to approve the
first mandatory security measures for commercial ships and ports. The
rules were drawn up in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
but participants say last month's tanker attack off Yemen has created
new urgency. The FBI has warned that terrorists may be planning
maritime attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "The views have certainly changed," said Capt. Jayant Abhyankar,
deputy director of the International Maritime Bureau in London and a
former cargo shipmaster. "The message has come home to the industry:
Ships can be targeted by terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   The tanker industry's jitters reflect broader concerns that
terrorist groups have decided to target the infrastructure of
petroleum -- from the wellhead to the refinery -- in an effort to
disrupt the economic lifeblood of the United States and other
industrialized nations.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has taken initial steps to address the threat,
passing legislation directing the Coast Guard to tighten port
security and creating anti-terror patrol units at Long Beach, Los
Angeles and other ports. But authorities say more needs to be done.
In other countries, the work has hardly begun.</TE>
<TE>   "To hit a tanker with a boat full of explosives is not much more
difficult than getting into your car and driving into a fuel truck on
the interstate," said Ben Venzke, chief executive of IntelCenter, a
security consulting firm in Alexandria, Va. "The vulnerability of
tankers and other petroleum facilities has always been there. It's
just that Al Qaeda is now choosing to exploit that vulnerability."</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 6, a small boat loaded with explosives rammed into the
French oil tanker Limburg as it headed into a Yemeni port. The blast
ripped through the 2-year-old tanker's double hull, killing a
Bulgarian crewman and spilling 90,000 barrels of burning crude oil
into the Gulf of Aden.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe the bombing was the work of Al Qaeda, and a
statement issued last month by the terror network's political bureau
applauded the results.</TE>
<TE>   "If a boat that didn't cost $1,000 ... managed to devastate an oil
tanker of that magnitude, so imagine the extent of the danger that
threatens the West's commercial lifeline which is petrol," said the
Oct. 13 communique. "The operation of attacking the French oil tanker
is not merely an attack against a tanker, it is an attack against
international oil transport lines and all its various connotations."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of thinking concerns Lars Carlsson, president of
Concordia-Maritime in Gothenburg, Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Carlsson operates a fleet of six supertankers, four of which
transport crude oil from the Middle East to the United States, and
he's been in the cross hairs before. During the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq
war, Iraqi planes struck one of his ships with an Exocet missile and
dropped a bomb through the deck of another, where it detonated inside
a tank full of crude. Both attacks caused fires and damage, but there
was no loss of life and the ships were repairable.</TE>
<TE>   The broad economic consequences of a single attack may be
relatively inconsequential, Carlsson said. But if tanker-bombing
caught on, it could cause a chain of events that ultimately could
restrict the supply of oil and undermine the world economy.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had Limburg No. 5, 6 and 7 exploding, then we would see
something," Carlsson said. "Small bands of guys with a few guns and
an ideology, boarding ships and exploding them, could become heroes
to a lot of people in the Muslim world. That would be the worst
possible scenario."</TE>
<TE>   As terror targets go, tankers are relatively easy prey. They're
big -- nearly four football fields in length. They're slow --
cruising speed is 15 knots, or about 17 mph. And they're everywhere
-- about 3,000 big tankers ply the world's shipping lanes.</TE>
<TE>   "The style of attacks they're carrying out now are very difficult
to defend against," said Josh Mandel, Middle East analyst with
Control Risks Group, a London-based consultancy. "You've got a small
dinghy coming toward you at reasonably high speed. These tankers are
massive and not maneuverable. There's not much you can do."</TE>
<TE>   The immediate effect of a single tanker bombing on the world's oil
supply is minuscule. Very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, hold about
2 million barrels of oil. The world consumes almost 40 times that
much crude every day, and Western oil companies have nearly 900
million barrels in storage tanks.</TE>
<TE>   "There are literally thousands of tankers around the world," said
senior analyst Aaron Brady at Energy Security Analysis Inc. in
Boston. "You'd have to blow up a whole lot of them to have any real
effect on the price of oil."</TE>
<TE>   But some experts say repeated attacks could affect the world's oil
markets by scaring some tankers away from the Middle East and causing
transport costs to escalate.</TE>
<TE>   "If you started making it dangerous for vessels to traverse
certain sea lanes, then the owners might be reluctant to allow their
vessels to take that trade," said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the
Center for Global Energy Studies in London. "Then you could have
freight rates climbing very rapidly, and it might have serious
repercussions for oil prices."</TE>
<TE>   The Limburg bombing failed to roil the markets, but it sharply
curtailed traffic in and out of Yemeni ports.</TE>
<TE>   "Oil exports have fallen dramatically," said Colin Cridland,
tanker analyst with Braemar Seascope Group in London, the world's
biggest ship brokerage. "The number of ships calling there have
fallen dramatically. People are avoiding it where they can -- not
just oil tankers; they're doing it for everything. The country's
suffered tremendously."</TE>
<TE>   Other Middle East oil exporters, particularly Saudi Arabia,
provide much tighter security at their oil terminals, experts say.
But the sea lanes leading to and from the ports remain largely
unguarded, as are shipping choke points such as the Strait of Hormuz
at the entrance of the Persian Gulf and Bab al Mandab strait, which
links the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.</TE>
<TE>   In early December, the International Maritime Organization will
convene its first Conference on Maritime Security in London in an
effort to reduce the threat of terrorist attacks directed at ships.
On the agenda is a proposal to require coastal governments to
designate ships and ports as normal, medium or high risk, and devise
appropriate security measures for each level.</TE>
<TE>   Some advocate more aggressive measures. The International Maritime
Bureau wants coastal governments and port authorities to prohibit
fishing boats, pleasure craft and other vessels from entering the sea
lanes used by tankers to approach terminals. It is seeking
intensified naval and police patrols to board and investigate vessels
loitering in the no-go lanes, and, if necessary, to forcibly
intercept unauthorized boats headed in the direction of tankers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet no matter how treacherous the region's ocean routes become,
shipping experts say there will always be some tankers willing to
take the risk -- if the price is right.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of tanker operators made a fortune from the last Gulf War,"
said David Osler, industrial editor for Lloyd's List, which tracks
the maritime shipping industry. "Some tanker owners were willing to
brave it. Some crews were willing to serve for double pay. It can be
good business."</TE>

<HD>Threat of U.S. Role Aided Port Deal</HD>
<DH>The union and shipping lines resolved issues with an
imposed settlement hanging over them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The contract that promises labor peace at West Coast ports for six
years was months in the making, but only in the last few weeks did
dockworkers and shipping lines move beyond acrimonious posturing to
serious deal-making.</LD>
<LD>   The deadlock between the International Longshore and Warehouse
Union and the Pacific Maritime Assn. broke when federal mediators and
a veteran AFL-CIO negotiator convinced both sides that any contract
they reached on their own would be preferable to one forced on them
by Congress or the courts. Under the Taft-Hartley Act, which was
invoked by President Bush in early October to restore the flow of
transpacific commerce, those options were possibilities.</LD>
<LD>   "When I was able to convince both sides that an imposed settlement
was not the way to go, that's when we saw some movement," said a
weary Peter J. Hurtgen, director of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service who jumped into negotiations as they broke down
in late September. He had pushed for an agreement by Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Two other events this month also changed the dynamics of
negotiations: Republicans won a majority in both houses of Congress,
diluting the union's power in Washington. Then the U.S. attorney's
office declined to pursue shipping company claims that the union was
orchestrating disruptive slowdowns on the docks, sending a clear
message that the industry could not count on further White House
intervention.</TE>
<TE>   A deal on the tough issue of technology was announced three weeks
ago, leaving pension and wages as the final obstacles to a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Those were resolved over the weekend, when shipping companies
agreed to boost pensions by more than 50%, to a maximum benefit of
$63,000 per year, according to officials involved in the talks.
Wages, which now start at about $27 per hour, will rise by $3 an hour
over six years, they said.</TE>
<TE>   For the last several weeks, negotiators regularly worked past
midnight as Hurtgen shuttled between conference rooms at a San
Francisco hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a tremendous amount of movement," he said. "It was
painful, but without the pain I don't think you would have gotten to
the end point, which is an agreement that both the parties can live
with."</TE>
<TE>   A rank-and-file vote is probable in early January, said union
President James Spinosa, who was optimistic the accord would be
approved.</TE>
<TE>   "I think once they understand what we've done here they're going
to be pleased with the efforts of our negotiating committee," he said
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The deal would have a substantial effect on marine clerks, who are
among the highest-paid dockworkers, earning on average $118,000 last
year, according to industry records. They would relinquish control
over information flowing into the ports by computer.</TE>
<TE>   Under previous contracts, clerks had the right to retype every
cargo list and trucking order as it entered, which port terminal
operators said was highly inefficient. An estimated 400 to 600 marine
clerk jobs are expected to be eliminated during the next few years as
a result. However, the contract guarantees lifetime employment to all
1,600 registered clerks in the union.</TE>
<TE>   In return, the union maintains jurisdiction over all remaining
clerk jobs and gains control over certain planning positions, which
are now nonunion.</TE>
<TE>   The length of the contract, at six years, is double the term of
recent contracts. Lengthy contracts often are viewed as concessions
by labor. In this case, however, the amount of time was needed to
fund the pension increases sought by union negotiators, Hurtgen said.
Shipping lines said the longer contract should help ensure stability
as the new technology is implemented.</TE>
<TE>   The contract also sets out a collaborative process for
implementing labor-saving technology.</TE>
<TE>   "It requires the parties to sit down and talk about technology,
what the process is, how it gets implemented, rather than using the
adversarial process of implementing it and then fighting over it,"
said Joseph Miniace, PMA's president and lead negotiator.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now forcing ourselves to sit down and act like
businesspeople taking care of a business that has a lot of public
impact," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The conciliatory words Sunday were a far cry from the tough stance
Miniace took heading into negotiations last spring, when he warned
that shipping companies would not tolerate union slowdowns and were
prepared to shut down the ports if they were staged.</TE>
<TE>   In late September, after the union rejected a technology proposal
and shipping companies reported signs of a slowdown, Miniace made
good on that threat. He closed ports along the coast for 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   They were reopened Oct. 9 under a federal court injunction, after
Bush invoked the Taft-Hartley Act for the first time in 24 years. The
lockout stranded more than 200 enormous container vessels, disrupted
retailers and manufacturers, and underscored the nation's dependence
on global trade. About $300 billion in goods, from produce and
automobiles to electronics and clothing, flow through West Coast
ports each year.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Miniace declined to discuss the shutdown, other than to
say it was "necessary." But he added that he was deeply troubled by
its effect on the U.S. economy. "You hate to hear about the personal
problems that you have been part of creating," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the negotiations have caused the ILWU to reassess
its long-standing tradition of feisty independence. The unusual hard
line of shipping companies, which the union said was bolstered by
support from the White House, forced the union to seek allies.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-summer, the AFL-CIO sent senior officials to the talks. And
when they deteriorated, Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka, the
federation's No. 2 official, joined the talks in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Trumka, the former president of the United Mine Workers and a
skilled negotiator, was credited by all sides with being a
stabilizing force at the table. A union spokesman said his presence
persuaded the ILWU to become more active in the labor federation,
which it joined only in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "The culture of the ILWU will never be the same when it comes to
bargaining," said Ron Judd, the federation's regional director. "They
realize now there are forces out there they have to contend with.
They can't be an isolated island in the greater sea of the labor
movement anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Ponce de Leon, president of the ILWU's Local 13 in Los
Angeles who sat in on negotiations during the last week, conceded
that all sides in the long, contentious process made mistakes. But he
insisted the shipping companies were the aggressors by ordering the
lockout.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no template for negotiating after a lockout when the
whole economy is dependent on your industry. It all has to go on
instinct," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a learning process for everybody. You know, you learn in
the valleys, when your back's against the wall. That kind of
experience brings you knowledge. What we do with that knowledge over
the next six years will show whether we gained wisdom or not."</TE>

<HD>SLA Fugitive Found a Place to Hide and Live Openly</HD>
<DH>In South Africa, one view of James Kilgore was, 'There but
for the grace of God go I.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAPE TOWN, South Africa</DL>
<LD>For a radical leftist accused of murder and terrorism in America,
southern Africa was a good place to hide. In a society making a
transition from apartheid, it was easy to blend into a world where
lots of people had pasts they'd rather not discuss.</LD>
<LD>   Here James Kilgore, a former member of the anti-government
Symbionese Liberation Army and a fugitive for 26 years, left behind
his radical militancy for a robust career as a neo-Marxist researcher
and activist.</LD>
<LD>   While on the run, he taught school in Zimbabwe, married an
American woman and earned a doctorate through correspondence courses.
At the birth of post-apartheid South Africa, Kilgore settled in Cape
Town under an assumed name, but otherwise lived an active public
life.</LD>
<TE>   The man South Africans know as John Pape has a national profile
among unionists. For more than a decade, Kilgore held seminars for
union members and published books and essays and sent letters to the
editors of newspapers on poverty, union activism and global
capitalism. He worked for a prestigious, left-leaning university
think tank in the Cape Town community of Woodstock.</TE>
<TE>   In this relatively affluent, seaside resort town, Kilgore found a
lifestyle very much like what he had had as a youth in Northern
California. He raised his family in the comfortable suburb of
Claremont, rode in an annual long-distance bicycle race, doted on his
two sons, now 8 and 12, and became an avid soccer and cricket fan.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the once-outlawed African National Congress and counted
among his friends some of the most powerful people in the country:
academics, politicians and national union leaders in a society where
Marxism is still credible and labor shares power with government.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest Nov. 8 on charges of possessing a pipe bomb and
participating in the 1975 killing of Myrna Opsahl during a botched
Sacramento bank robbery to fund SLA activities, a number of Kilgore's
friends showed up for two court hearings to support him and his
family. They have even set up a John Pape Legal Fund to pay for
lawyers here and in New York as they negotiate with U.S. prosecutors
over his impending return to America. The search for Kilgore had
intensified in 1999 after federal investigators arrested another SLA
fugitive, Katherine Ann Soliah, who had changed her name to Sara Jane
Olson. She was charged with planting two pipe bombs underneath Los
Angeles police cruisers in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators later learned that she had hidden in Zimbabwe in the
1980s and began to suspect that Kilgore -- her former boyfriend --
had also been there. But he did not emerge until a few weeks ago,
after Olson and three other former SLA members pleaded guilty to the
Sacramento crimes. Kilgore's attorney has suggested he is prepared to
also plead guilty to those state charges, but it is unclear if a deal
can be reached on the federal pipe bomb allegation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Militancy to Activism</TE>
<TE>   More than disappointment, South Africans who know Kilgore -- and
many who don't -- see in the former SLA leader's story their own
national narrative: from brash militancy to mature activism, then to
resignation and contrition.</TE>
<TE>   "South Africa is a nation full of secrets," said Rick De Satge, a
rural development consultant to the government and a family friend
for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go down to a suburb or to a township and start pulling
people out of homes and ask them, 'What is your history?' you're
going to find people who were in the defense forces and committed
civil rights abuses. You're going to find people in the townships who
executed suspected collaborators with very little evidence. You're
going to find government officials involved in forced removals of
people from their homes, decisions that resulted in the deaths of
thousands.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of blood on the hands of South African people," De
Satge said. "You could almost describe South Africa as a nation of
fugitives."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their close friendship, De Satge said he did not know
anything about Kilgore's SLA past until several weeks ago, when
Kilgore contacted U.S. authorities about returning to America to face
the charges against him.</TE>
<TE>   Still unclear is whether Kilgore will return under a quick
agreement between the United States and South Africa or whether he
will go through full extradition proceedings -- a process that could
take two months.</TE>
<TE>   South African law prohibits jailhouse interviews, and Kilgore's
wife, Theresa Barnes, declined to comment when approached at home.
Kilgore's friends and co-workers say they were surprised by the news
of his alleged involvement in the SLA murder, but not dismayed.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, Kilgore's family stayed at the home of De Satge,
who had met Kilgore in Harare, Zimbabwe, where Kilgore is presumed to
have lived from 1982 to 1991. In the early 1980s, the city was a way
station for African National Congress exiles, freedom fighters from
other liberation movements around the continent and fresh-faced
college graduates from Europe and the U.S., bound by idealism
bordering on naivete.</TE>
<TE>   In that small community of expatriate activists, Kilgore's
unassuming manner and his immersion in the local culture gained him
respect. Kilgore taught high school and in a university in Harare,
and in Avondale he taught night school for domestic workers. He
published an adult literacy magazine called Read On, which offered
critiques of the economic policies being imposed on Zimbabwe by the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore and Barnes, a young feminist historian, also created a new
history curriculum for schools in Zimbabwe. This was an important
step for a nation where the contributions of black people and the
history of brutal white domination had been effaced by the white
government when the country was known as Rhodesia.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore took correspondence courses and earned a doctorate in only
18 months from Deakin University in Victoria, Australia, in 1990. He
wrote his dissertation on domestic workers in Zimbabwe.</TE>
<TE>   Having mastered one of the major languages in Zimbabwe, Shona,
Kilgore became a favorite of the local Africans and was often invited
out of the city to visit their countryside homesteads. As much as
Harare drew young, idealistic sympathizers, it also drew spies
looking to prop up the apartheid regime in South Africa. On the
northeast border of South Africa, Zimbabwe was a sanctuary and
staging area for anti-apartheid fighters who periodically infiltrated
South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "People didn't talk about their pasts much," said De Satge. "There
was a state of emergency on in South Africa, with bombs going off
every other day, and from 1985 on, South African agents were in
Zimbabwe recruiting ex-Rhodesian soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people there were leading double lives," De Satge said.
"They might tell you that they're going on holiday, but they were
really going to [a neighboring country] for secret military
training."</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1980s, members of the African National Congress were
flooding into Tanzania because South Africa's white supremacist
government had banned the organization. Among the exiles was Derek
Hanekom, an Afrikaner farmer who joined the movement after he became
disgusted with the government's treatment of blacks.</TE>
<TE>   There Hanekom, now a member of the South African Parliament, met
Kilgore and his wife. Hanekom was one of the friends who attended
Kilgore's hearings this month.</TE>
<TE>   "Where I come from, you don't abandon people in political trouble,
however misguided," he said. Hanekom said that he knew little about
the charges against Kilgore and that what he did know, he did not
condone. But he also said he could sympathize with a man who had
taken up arms to fight for something he believed in.</TE>
<TE>   But Annette Seegers, a political science professor at the
University of Cape Town, said comparisons between South Africans'
principled struggle against apartheid and the bungling crimes of the
SLA are unfair.</TE>
<TE>   The African National Congress headed a mass liberation movement
carried on by the majority of South African society, she said, while
the SLA was composed of a few marginal extremists with the dubious
goal of overthrowing a representative government.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Resenting Comparison</TE>
<TE>   "Every fanciful political cause isn't justified in its use of
arms," she said. "Especially when it comes to the point-blank
shooting of innocents. I supported armed struggle here, but I don't
support what Mr. Pape did. In fact, I resent the comparison and I
think it cheapens us."</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore's friends say that, while he supported the anti-apartheid
cause, he stopped short of taking up arms to further his belief,
unlike many of his neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Hanekom, then a high-ranking member of the South African
government, wrote a letter on Kilgore's behalf to ease his passage
into the country. Kilgore and Barnes settled in Johannesburg and
joined the ANC.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore conducted voter education seminars and registration drives
in advance of South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994. He
also continued teaching, at Khanya College. Leonard Gentle worked
with Kilgore in Johannesburg and Cape Town, and described his friend
as a reserved and patient man dedicated to a thankless job.</TE>
<TE>   "On one particularly hot day in Johannesburg, John was sitting in
his office working with students who were queued up right out of the
door," Gentle recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "People were all shouting at the same time, making demands on him,
being really forceful, you know. And here's this big white American
guy who you would expect to be arrogant and bossy, just kind of
sitting there and taking it."</TE>
<TE>   Glynn "Moses" Cloete, co-director of the International Labor
Resource and Information Group, a University of Cape Town research
center, hired Kilgore five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He had published, he had taught, his answers to my questions were
straightforward and to the point and full of nuance," said Cloete.
Kilgore eventually became the co-director of the labor think tank and
its most prolific writer.</TE>
<TE>   "John's simple way of presenting complex concepts like
globalization endeared him to many of us," said Tony Ehrenreich,
provincial secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
the nation's biggest labor organization. Unions across South Africa
use Kilgore's white papers. In August, Zed Books published a study
co-written by him that criticized the government's inability to
provide water services to the poorest townships.</TE>
<TE>   Another treatise Kilgore recently wrote, "Down With Missionaries
and Objective Academics: Some Thoughts on Political Education for
Unions," argued that union leaders had to cultivate critical thinking
among their members, not lock-step militancy.</TE>
<TE>   "It is dishonest to pretend we don't have opinions," he wrote.
"But it is also destructive to use our views as a sledgehammer to hit
people over the head. Sledgehammer tactics will silence differing
opinions."</TE>
<TE>   Though U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and other American officials
have condemned Kilgore as a terrorist, local opinion pages and
Internet sites show that ordinary South Africans have mixed views,
generally supporting the man, if not his past.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Jinny Mullins, a retired schoolteacher who lives
around the corner from Kilgore's house, said she was conflicted about
her neighbor's plight.</TE>
<TE>   "One side of me says that when somebody is involved in murder,
there must be a consequence; one has to take responsibility," she
said. "But the other part of me says ... I was a young radical
myself, and I know what it is to be swept up in a revolutionary
movement.</TE>
<TE>   "There but for the grace of God go I."</TE>

<HD>As Killings Ebb and Flow, Fear Keeps Its Grip on South L.A.</HD>
<DH>Residents watch the smallest detail, for the wrong word or
clothing can spark a gang killing. Heartbreakingly, such care often
isn't enough.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Los Angeles' murder count climbed to 612 for the year, South Los
Angeles experienced a bit of a respite over the weekend. But it
didn't matter, the rhythm of life south of the Santa Monica Freeway
was long ago altered by gang killings, which ebb and flow but never
stop.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the six slain in the city since early Saturday died in
South-Central, which has suffered the most in the recent rise in
street violence. As police wrapped the area in a quilt of black and
whites, the residents of South Los Angeles spoke of another toll with
which they are intimately familiar: the one exacted on the smallest
details of ordinary life.</LD>
<LD>   Where they go, what they wear, what they say, how loudly they play
their car stereo: All are infused with -- and circumscribed by --
fear of an unexpected bullet. On peaceful looking, palm-lined
streets, residents hurry inside when the light fades. They try not to
draw attention. This is the way it is and has been for years.</LD>
<TE>   On Western Avenue on Sunday, 41-year-old Cheryl B. said the recent
spate of violence is alarming but not surprising. "I believe it's
getting worse, but that's because of poverty," she said as she sat in
front of a discount gift shop she manages. "A lot of people out here
are homeless, jobless, futureless, and that leads to rebelliousness,
resistance. You got so many kids out here acting crazy, wanting to
flex some muscle. They don't have respect for life."</TE>
<TE>   When Cheryl, who was born and raised in South L.A., hears of the
latest street killings, she reminds herself of the first commandment
of day-to-day living: Don't leave the house at night "unless
mandatory, unless you just can't prevent it .... I like to stay
planted or stationary," said Cheryl, who asked that her last name not
be used.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Way of Life</TE>
<TE>   It's a way of life -- paranoia, fear -- that Cheryl B. said wasn't
always part of the South L.A. fabric. "I was here before the gang
violence, the red and the blue. This used to be a good town. Now it's
like a lot of people who came from the South or back East, they're
going back home."</TE>
<TE>   Shopping at the farmers market near Crenshaw Boulevard and Slauson
Avenue, Sufia Giza talked of a recent night, when she was headed to a
market to buy bottled water. Gunfire crackled and she did what South
Los Angeles residents routinely do when they hear that sound. She
dropped to the floor. As quiet returned and she started out the door,
her brother asked her incredulously: "What are you doing? When the
shooting stops, they're reloading."</TE>
<TE>   She stayed inside. "I needed water that night, and I couldn't get
it," said Giza, 41, who lives near Vernon and Vermont avenues.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Riverside, Giza moved to South Los Angeles several years
ago to teach and "do something positive." She puzzles over why the
nation is so preoccupied with international terrorism when there is
so much random violence in its cities.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I'm concerned, I don't see why we have to go across the
sea to fight a war on terrorism when we're being terrorized here,"
said Giza, who is preparing to move to West Africa, partly to fulfill
a dream -- but also because she wants to live without fear.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Watkins Sr., president of the Watts Labor Community Action
Committee, said his Central Avenue center tries to offer a safe haven
for children and teenagers. They shuttle kids to the center in vans
so they don't have to walk the streets. They drive older teens to
junior college so they don't have to risk standing at a bus stop.
They pack the center's cupboards with juice, snacks and fruit to lure
youngsters off dangerous corners.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, they cannot shield their charges.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost midnight and I hear a gun -- five shots," wrote an
11-year-old boy in a school essay that Watkins read from. "The next
day I got up to go to school and they had killed my neighbor. His
stairs were full of blood."</TE>
<TE>   As the child left for class in the morning, he saw police remove a
white sheet from the corpse. "He was pale. He was my neighbor. He
never bothered anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins said Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton is right
to tell Angelenos to be angry about the killings.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day someone down here -- a child, a child's parent, a
child's sibling -- is losing their life. We should be besides
ourselves over it," Watkins said. "But the propensity and frequency
of killings is numbing to the collective psyche of Los Angeles. It's
like it is something that we have just decided to live with."</TE>
<TE>   As teenage males, Michael Pye and his friend John Wilson abide by
stringent codes of conduct and dress -- not to be cool, but to avoid
being shot.</TE>
<TE>   Don't wear blue and red, said Pye, 17, as he and Wilson, 15,
stopped on their way to a Sunday morning service at the West Angeles
Church of God in Christ, in the Crenshaw area. Wear black or gray;
neutral colors that will not attract attention. "Don't wear loud
colors, no yellow. If you do, make sure you are going to a place with
a lot of security or people," Pye said, adding that jewelry or
attention-grabbing sneakers are also no-nos.</TE>
<TE>   Once out the door, know where you are going, they instructed.
Avoid side streets, stick to main thoroughfares and don't look tough.
"You can't look too hard [at anyone]. Don't mad-dog anyone," Wilson
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rules of Survival</TE>
<TE>   If, despite all those precautions, someone approaches you, pick
your words carefully. "Certain slang can get you in trouble," Pye
said. The same rules apply to music. Certain songs in certain parts
of town invite trouble. Don't crank up your car stereo so much it
drowns out somebody else's. They may take it as the ultimate offense,
a sign of disrespect.</TE>
<TE>   Pye and Wilson resent having to live this way, but they know that
if they don't, they could die. "It's not fair," Pye said. "But
there's never anybody who steps up and does anything about it."</TE>
<TE>   The ravages of gang violence observe no borders. In Athens, just a
few blocks from South-Central, the Rev. M. Andrew Robinson-Gaither of
the Faith United Methodist Church scans the block when he pulls up to
his house after dark. "When I come home late at night, I don't get
out of my car until there are no vehicles moving on the street," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   People in the neighborhood talk about the man who was killed at
the bus stop or the guy fatally shot while sitting on his lawnmower.
They pass on a rumor that there are more weapons on the street
because gangbangers raided a train filled with guns in Watts.</TE>
<TE>   Walking down Hobart Boulevard, Robinson-Gaither stops at Mary
Wilson's house. Like nearly all the homes in the neighborhood, it is
well-kept, with a tidy frontyard. Except for the bars on the windows
of every house, this could be a middle-class neighborhood almost
anywhere in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, Wilson's 14-year-old son was riding his bike
outside the house when five gangbangers drove past in a car and shot
him in the head. He died a few hours later. It was a case of mistaken
identity, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies told her.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson had just asked her daughter to call in her brother, since
the day was turning to night. "I don't allow my kids out out after
dark," said Wilson, a beautician. "I told them nighttime is when evil
comes out."</TE>
<TE>   Next thing she knew, bullets were flying into her house and
Leonard Dean Gilmore Jr. was dying on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a baby," she said, holding back tears. "He was into
cartoons. Even though it's been two months that my son is gone, my
heart is still in pain. It's still fresh in my heart as a mother."</TE>
<TE>   Many in the community, which is patrolled by the county Sheriff's
Department, complain about the lack of deputies in the neighborhood.
But residents are ambivalent about deputies. They want more of them
on the street to curb gang activity, but they are wary because of the
way officers have treated blacks in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson-Gaither said the LAPD's crackdown on gangs is
misdirected. "I'm projecting you will see massive violations of civil
rights, which will alienate people," he said. "That's what you saw in
New York, but in New York, the politicians turned their head because
the crime rate was going down."</TE>
<TE>   As Sgt. Shannon Allan began her noon-to-midnight shift Saturday in
the 77th Street Division, she worried that "It's going to be hot
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   But the expected carnage never came, perhaps because 15 extra
officers on loan were crisscrossing the 77th in unmarked cars. So
Allan spent most of her shift doing the small things.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Six Killings</TE>
<TE>   When she spotted officers questioning several suspects near a
liquor store, she stopped to see if she could help. Ten people had
been traveling in two cars. When officers searched one vehicle, they
found two handguns and arrests were made. "This definitely saved
somebody's life tonight," a satisfied Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's homicide count rose to 612 over the weekend as six more
people were killed, three by gang members. Two fatalities were in
South-Central, the rest were scattered from the San Fernando Valley
to San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   The toll is the highest since 1996, when there were 707 homicides.
The city's record was in 1992, when 1,092 people were killed, or
three a day. The low of 419 was recorded four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same old, same old," Syelester Jackson, 44, of South Los
Angeles said of the recent murder spike. Asked if Bratton's proposal
to add 3,000 officers to the LAPD would make a difference, he
replied, "How about 3,000 more schools?"</TE>

<HD>Atrophy to Action at YWCA</HD>
<DH>Having lost more than half its 700 chapters, and soon the
one in Orange, the organization tries to regain relevance and a
healthy balance sheet.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The YWCA, which started the nation's first day-care center and has
championed women's rights for 144 years, is struggling to reverse a
decline that has forced more than half its chapters to close.</LD>
<LD>   The latest is the YWCA of Central Orange County, which announced
last week that it will shut down at the end of June after 81 years,
no longer able to cover the costs of providing child care,
after-school programs and other services for needy families who
depend on the center.</LD>
<LD>   In the last three decades, almost 400 of the 700 chapters of the
Young Women's Christian Assn. have closed. Many officials at local
YWCAs blame the decline on previous national leadership that allowed
the nonprofit to lose its mission and become, in many cases, a social
service agency burdened with increasing debt.</LD>
<TE>   Those leading the effort to rebuild the organization said the YWCA
lost its public identity and failed to keep up with the times. While
its brother organization, the Young Men's Christian Assn., attracted
thousands of new members by building state-of-the-art coed gyms and
promoting other popular programs, many YWCAs stuck with outdated
facilities and women-only events, said Sherri Rice of Reno, director
of Nevada's only YWCA before it closed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Mothers stopped bringing their daughters to the YWCA," Rice said.
"People saw it as a waning organization. The nation had passed it
by."</TE>
<TE>   The YWCA's new leaders, elected after a nationwide revolt by
chapters, are moving quickly to save ailing YWCAs by adopting new
strategies for fund-raising and changing the institution's profile to
fit the 21st century. Resources will be funneled back to
neighborhoods to help train local Ys to run more businesslike
enterprises that can balance the needs to raise money and provide
assistance to the community.</TE>
<TE>   "We're refocusing ourselves.... There needed to be a change," said
Audrey Peeples of Chicago, chairwoman of the YWCA's new National
Coordinating Board. "We are strengthening the chapters that exist and
strengthening the movement."</TE>
<TE>   This is a formula that has proved successful for two of Southern
California's healthiest YWCAs: chapters in Los Angeles and Fullerton.
They tap anything from government grants to celebrity golf
tournaments to raise money for their shelters and programs.</TE>
<TE>   The YWCA of Central Orange County failed to make similar
adjustments and racked up $600,000 in debt before opting to close.
The demise of the institution leaves the county with just the
Fullerton chapter, down from the five that once thrived in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the services provided by the Orange-based YWCA chapter,
while valuable to the community, were becoming too costly to support.
The infant-care program lost more than $5,000 a month for years until
it folded in early November. Even when contributions started to dry
up after the recent downturn on Wall Street and last year's terrorist
attacks, the chapter's previous boards hesitated to cut services.</TE>
<TE>   At the chapter's 1940s-era community center in Old Towne Orange on
Friday, children made Christmas cards and tossed balls on the
playground. The center serves about 100 children a day. While other
groups are stepping in to keep many of the services going for now,
some parents are scrambling to find other accommodations.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of hit like a bombshell," said Randy Levy, who must
find a new child-care facility for his 8-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Darlene Alvarez of Orange, who has three kids in the YWCA's
after-school program, said she hates to see the center close because
it has been a big part of her life.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been here for years. It's going to be sadly missed," she
said, even though she won't have any trouble finding a new
after-school program for her children. "It's the nostalgia. We all
know what the YWCA stands for."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clarity in Hindsight</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Tucker, executive director of the YWCA of Central Orange
County, said the chapter would have been wise to take a more
businesslike approach to raising funds and cutting services.</TE>
<TE>   But even when money was coming in, the money was going out just as
fast, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no regrets," said Tucker, who has worked without pay since
summer. "We could have been better businesspeople, but at the same
time, look at the [programs we provided]. No one else was willing to
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Tucker said that if the new YWCA reforms had been adopted just a
few years earlier, her chapter may have survived. The changes also
came too late for chapters in Torrance, Redlands, Denver and Macon,
Ga., and scores of others on college campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The problems were so severe that in September 2000, chapter
leaders staged a nationwide coup d'etat, voting to oust the YWCA's
national board and focus the headquarters on raising the
organization's national profile to bring more money and members to
the chapters. The national YWCA has slashed its staff to 15 from 50
and is moving from New York to Washington, D.C., to amplify the
organization's voice on civil rights and women's issues.</TE>
<TE>   The YWCA also set up nine districts in the country to assist
neighborhood associations. Chapter dues will stay within each region
and, to a limited degree, help shore up financially troubled
chapters.</TE>
<TE>   Chapters are offering more fee-based programs and increasing
fund-raising efforts while, in some cases, paring expensive social
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Because chapters no longer pay dues to support the national and
international YWCA, the national office will rely exclusively on
earnings from the YWCA's $55-million endowment.</TE>
<TE>   This leaves it up to chapters to balance their own budgets and
determine what services they can provide.</TE>
<TE>   In Fullerton, the YWCA of North Orange County survived a financial
crisis in the early 1990s by aggressively courting local corporations
for donations and pressing for grants from governments, foundations
and other sources, said Executive Director Diane Masseth-Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the chapter closed its day-care center because of
the expense of complying with state codes. The chapter replaced it
with a scholarship program that pays for day care for the children of
temporarily unemployed or ailing parents, an effort funded by an
annual charity golf tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "If you diversify your funding base, you can make a really strong
YWCA," she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s Strong Chapter</TE>
<TE>   One of the best examples of this is the YWCA of Greater Los
Angeles, one of the strongest chapters in the nation financially.</TE>
<TE>   Along with receiving a $15.8-million federal grant to run the
local Job Corps program, the chapter had a $21-million annual budget
in 2000 that allowed it to offer an array of programs, including an
infant learning center and swim classes for seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Faye Washington, executive director of the Los Angeles YWCA, said
the key to the chapter's success has been aggressive fund-raising
from a variety of sources, such as government grants, L.A.
philanthropists and a $25 annual membership fee.</TE>
<TE>   Some chapters, however, have cut swimming and other programs that
earn money to preserve those that don't, leading to a downward
spiral.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't eliminate those things close to their heart:
domestic violence shelters, programs for the homeless," said Judy
Brown of the YWCA of Pasadena-Foothill Valley and a YWCA national
board member. But "we need to have income if we're going to continue
to do the work that we do."</TE>
<TE>   During the time the YWCA was struggling, its YMCA counterpart was
flourishing throughout the country. Executive Director Kenneth L.
Gladish said the YMCA thrived because it offered programs that
appealed to the entire community, serving both the less fortunate and
those with means.</TE>
<TE>   The YMCA has 2,434 chapters nationwide and serves more than 18
million people annually with its family-oriented sports programs and
community outreach, which includes drug-abuse prevention and Indian
Guide programs.</TE>
<TE>   While the YWCA and YMCA trace their Protestant origins to 19th
century England, when their precursors provided religious guidance
and aid to young men and women moving to industrial cities, the two
national organizations are independent.</TE>
<TE>   The YWCA, since its founding in the United States in 1858, has
been an advocate for workers' rights, sex education, civil rights and
freedom and justice for women. It has played a significant role in
almost every issue affecting women in this country, and at the same
time was a leader in racial equality, said Nancy Robertson, a
professor of history and philanthropic studies at Indiana
University-Purdue University Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Today, some supporters fear that reforms in the YWCA may not go
far enough. Men are still not allowed to serve on local or national
boards, a policy to ensure that women can become community leaders.</TE>
<TE>   But the policy hurts the chapters' ability to build community
support and raise money, said Rice, of the defunct Reno YWCA.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an archaic philosophy," Rice said. "I understand the origin
of some of their feminist beliefs, but I think it's time for the YW
to move to a more inclusive state of mind."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Breaks Old Legal Ground</HD>
<DH>Precedents of WWII are cited in jailing of alleged 'dirty
bomber' since May without charges.</DH>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>This is where Jose Padilla was first arrested. A short, chubby kid,
he was picked up by police for everything from stealing a doughnut to
killing a rival gang member. He lived across from his old grade
school, where teachers viewed him as "silly and disruptive."</LD>
<LD>   Here too is where he stepped off a flight from Pakistan last
spring and into the grasp of federal agents on the jetway at O'Hare
International Airport. The attorney general of the United States
labeled him a "known terrorist" who was planning an attack with a
radioactive "dirty bomb" that could cause "mass death and injury."</LD>
<LD>   For six months now, he has been hidden away, not charged and not
released. He was taken first to New York to appear before a federal
grand jury investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and
since then has been held in the brig on a military base in South
Carolina.</LD>
<TE>   At first, it appeared that the U.S.-born Padilla fit in the same
legal category as John Walker Lindh, the "American Talib" -- that he
would face federal criminal charges, be entitled to a lawyer and have
his day in court, as any U.S. citizen would.</TE>
<TE>   But the federal government concluded that Padilla is a wartime
security threat and has held him without charge. Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft, citing World War II legal precedents, contends that in
wartime the nation has authority to take extraordinary steps to
protect the public.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's case has attracted the attention of civil rights groups
such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which have asked a
federal district judge in New York to "charge him or release him," in
the words of attorney Donna R. Newman. Judge Michael B. Mukasey is
expected to rule any day now.</TE>
<TE>   So far, little is known about the government's evidence against
Padilla because of the lack of legal paperwork. An affidavit from a
Defense Department official indicates, however, that much of it was
gathered after senior Osama bin Laden lieutenant Abu Zubeida was
captured in Afghanistan in March and began talking to U.S.
interrogators.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla -- born in Brooklyn, N.Y., raised in Chicago, married in
South Florida and arrested on U.S. soil -- has been afforded fewer
legal rights than such notorious foreign-born terrorist suspects as
Zacarias Moussaoui, the Frenchman accused of being the would-be 20th
hijacker, and Richard C. Reid, the British "shoe bomber" caught in
the act of trying to blow up a commercial jetliner in flight. Both
were charged in court and have had lawyers arguing their cases.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla is being handled differently than Lindh, the only other
born-and-bred American suspect in the post-Sept. 11 investigations.
The Marin County youth who was captured on the battlefields in
Afghanistan was prosecuted in federal court in Virginia. Once
threatened with the death penalty, Lindh, with a top-flight lawyer
retained by his affluent family, agreed to a 20-year prison term.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's limbo status most closely resembles that of Yasser Esam
Hamdi, who was born in Baton Rouge, La., and moved to Saudi Arabia as
a child with his parents. Captured in Afghanistan, Hamdi was taken to
the U.S. prison camp for terrorist suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
and is being held without charge at a military brig in Virginia.
Authorities said he holds dual U.S.-Saudi citizenship."One of the
most remarkable aspects of this case," said Steven R. Shapiro, ACLU
legal director, "is that the government has offered no cogent
explanation for its decision to treat Padilla differently."</TE>
<TE>   A highly placed official in the Justice Department, who requested
anonymity, said: "In wartime, you have options. You do what is best
for the nation's security."</TE>
<TE>   For now, the government has no plans for Padilla. Even if Mukasey
orders them to act, the government likely will appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "People say he's a small fish," the Justice official said. "Well,
the small fish are the ones who do the most damage. Osama bin Laden
is not going to come over here and strap on dynamite and blow himself
up.</TE>
<TE>   "But Padilla was in the process of planning this dirty-bomb
attack.... He was going to look for sites that would be good targets.
He was looking for places where they could get the material for the
bomb."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He was born to Puerto Rican parents. His mother, friends and
relatives said, had four children, and his father died when he was a
child.</TE>
<TE>   They moved to Chicago before Padilla was 5. His mother took
low-paying jobs at hotels, and the family lived in a small two-story
gray-stone. The young Jose slept on a bunk in a cramped room near the
kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The home sits across from Darwin Elementary School in Logan Square
on Chicago's near northwest side. The neighborhood was 90% Latino,
mostly poor Puerto Ricans, when young Padilla was trudging to class
in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   School counselor Art Ryden can still hear the boy speaking English
with no accent. But mostly he recalls Padilla's eyes, his dark-marble
stare, and his early flirtation with such groups as the Imperial
Gangsters and the Latin Monsters.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when he was a young kid, about 10 years old," Ryden
said. "It's considerate for many children in his culture to look away
when an adult is talking to you. Actually, they are being respectful.
But this kid was just the opposite. He looked at you straight in the
eye and you felt like he was sizing you up. Even at that age.</TE>
<TE>   "But he wasn't a bad kid. He was more silly and disruptive than
dangerous. I never saw the kid get into a fight. But I always had a
feeling that if anyone started trouble with him, he would finish it
on his own terms. He would not leave anything up in the air."</TE>
<TE>   His grades were not good. He preferred playing basketball and
watching football on TV. He hung out with friends on his front stoop,
and from school Ryden could see the young boy learning to flash hand
signs, slowly becoming a "mule" for older gang members.</TE>
<TE>   He took on a series of nicknames in various street gangs. His
arrest records show he gave the police fake names as well, like Jose
Hernandez, Jose Rivera and Julio Rodriguez. On the street he was
often known as "Pucho," slang for chubby.</TE>
<TE>   His earliest capers seem trivial. He broke into an apartment
building. He obstructed traffic while flashing gang signs and wearing
the colors of the Latin Disciples. He was picked up for battery and
theft and resisting arrest. He threatened a pair of school security
guards. He was caught with 18 clear plastic bags of marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Almost always he was sent home on probation, and back to jobs as a
busboy at the River Club or working in the laundry at the
Ritz-Carlton hotel.</TE>
<TE>   School never took. Instead, in 1983, when he was 13, he and a
friend were arrested in connection with an armed robbery that ended
in the death of a rival member of a Mexican gang. Stolen were a
watch, $107 and some Mexican pesos.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's court records on the slaying are sealed because he was a
juvenile. But the friend was tried as an adult, and the prosecutor
alleged Padilla helped by punching, kicking and clubbing the victim
with a baseball bat. Padilla later told a judge that he spent two
years in detention.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the 1980s, Padilla had left Chicago. He moved to
Broward County, Fla., joining his mother and two half brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a regular guy," half brother Tomas Texidor said. "Only
those that know him the closest and grew up with him would know that.
He was a good guy at heart."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The police in South Florida came to know him well. So did Victor
Lento. So did Mohammad Javed.</TE>
<TE>   Lento was confronted by Padilla in a 1991 road rage incident in
Sunrise, Fla., in which Padilla was arrested for firing a .38-caliber
silver revolver from the window of his black Toyota Tercel.</TE>
<TE>   Lento was uninjured. But he remains troubled today, not so much by
the roar of the gun blast as the look on Padilla's face. "He had dark
eyes that could see right through you," Lento said.</TE>
<TE>   In a court hearing, Padilla became extremely agitated, saying he
was upset that court officials were not leveling with him about the
status of his case. He also described a fight with jail guards
because he was frustrated about his uncertain future.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want people to be honest with me," he complained to the
judge in Fort Lauderdale. "Tell me what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   He was convicted and served nearly a year in the Broward County
Jail.</TE>
<TE>   After his release in 1992, Padilla married a Jamaican-born woman,
fathered a child and divorced. That year he found a job at a local
Taco Bell, and there he met Javed, his boss, who also is a founder of
the Broward School of Islamic Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Javed said Padilla constantly marveled at how peaceful he seemed.
"He asked me where could he go to be a Muslim."</TE>
<TE>   Javed directed him to several local mosques and there, he said,
"something touched his heart."</TE>
<TE>   "He said he had wanted peace of mind, and now he said he felt at
peace with himself," Javed said. "He changed his demeanor. The same
progression took place with him as with John Walker Lindh. The head
covering he wore, the moving from one mosque to another, looking for
a connection in the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla started calling himself "Ibrahim." Eventually he legally
changed his name to Abdullah al Muhajir, even though "Jose" was
tattooed on his arm.</TE>
<TE>   He quit the Taco Bell in 1994, and by 1998 was headed to Egypt,
telling friends he hoped to teach English in Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   "That was odd," Javed said. "He didn't even complete high school
in Chicago."</TE>
<TE>   Javed said he would occasionally hear from Padilla's ex-wife that
he was "doing fine, that someone had provided him shelter, that he
was listening and learning."</TE>
<TE>   "And so we forgot about him.</TE>
<TE>   "And then we saw his picture on the news."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's alleged activities abroad were recounted in August in a
court affidavit by Michael H. Mobbs, a special advisor in the Defense
Department, that laid out some of the case against him. Much of the
information apparently came from Al Qaeda kingpin Zubeida after his
capture.</TE>
<TE>   Mobbs said Padilla traveled throughout Pakistan, Afghanistan and
Saudi Arabia, and became "closely associated" with Al Qaeda. The
terrorist network knew him as the "immigrant."</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan in 2001, he and an unknown associate "approached
Zubeida with their proposal to conduct terrorist operations within
the United States," Mobbs said. As a U.S. citizen who could readily
reenter the country, Padilla would have been an attractive recruit
for terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The pair was sent to Al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan for training
in wiring explosives. Secreted at an Al Qaeda safe house, they
researched how to build a "uranium-enhanced explosive device."</TE>
<TE>   The plan, Mobbs said, was to build and detonate a dirty bomb in
the United States, possibly in Washington, by stealing radioactive
material in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Early this year, under Zubeida's direction, plans were stepped up
to explode bombs in hotel rooms or gas stations, Mobbs said. Senior
Al Qaeda operatives directed Padilla to return to the U.S. to scout
for possible targets and "conduct reconnaissance."</TE>
<TE>   But in the meantime, Zubeida was captured and began talking. And
on May 8, when Padilla flew from Pakistan to Chicago via Switzerland,
undercover U.S. agents were aboard. He was seized at O'Hare, and
Ashcroft proudly announced the capture.</TE>
<TE>   He was first held as a material witness for the New York grand
jury. Then on June 9, President Bush said in a written statement that
Padilla reentered the U.S. as an enemy combatant by engaging in
"conduct that constituted hostile and warlike acts."</TE>
<TE>   That finding sent Padilla to the brig, where his family hasn't
been allowed to visit him.</TE>
<TE>   New York lawyer Victor Olds was hired to represent Padilla's
mother, Estela Ortega LeBron, who testified before the grand jury
last spring. He said she told the panel that her son is not a
terrorist. She has written her son, but has no idea whether he
received the letter. She has received no reply.</TE>
<TE>   LeBron declined to speak about her son for this story; his former
wife could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   At the Broward County Jail, where Padilla earlier served time, his
other half brother, Ilan Ojeda, is awaiting trial on attempted murder
charges. Ojeda said he was immediately moved to an isolation cell in
the jail's maximum security wing after Padilla was arrested in
Chicago.</TE>
