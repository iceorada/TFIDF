<HD>Austrian Clergy's Support for Hitler Detailed</HD>
<DH>Bishops and priests in the largely Roman Catholic nation
ignored or abetted Nazi horrors, author says. Church denies
wrongdoing.</DH>

<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>Some Austrians were clearly not ready for Stefan Moritz's book about
their country's pro-Nazi priests -- bishops who hushed up the
Holocaust and a prelate who helped thousands of Hitler's henchmen
escape justice.</LD>
<LD>   "A woman just screamed, 'Heil Hitler,' and hung up," Moritz said.
"Another caller asked me if I were a Jew because only a Jew could
write garbage like this."</LD>
<LD>   Moritz, who isn't Jewish, has shaken up his country with a book
asserting that Austria's Roman Catholic Church ignored and even
abetted Nazi horrors.</LD>
<TE>   By publishing "Gruess Gott und Heil Hitler" ("Hail God and Heil
Hitler"), Moritz, 36, is treading on sensitive ground. After all,
nearly 80% of Austrians are Roman Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   Not all Austrian clergy were cowards or collaborators. Moritz
cites the case of Franz Reinisch, banned from preaching because of
his critical stance toward the Nazis. The church, instead of backing
Reinisch, expelled him from his Pallottine order. He was executed in
1942 after refusing to swear loyalty to Hitler and join his army,
Moritz writes.</TE>
<TE>   That's only one example in his argument that the Austrian church
struck a bargain with the devil to survive, and that many priests and
bishops went beyond silence to actively support the Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of documents -- many from parish archives -- include:</TE>
<TE>   * A chillingly dispassionate entry dated Nov. 26, 1942, from the
Austrian Bishops' Conference, which skims over the mass deportation
of Jews to Nazi death camps by noting that over one year, "33
transports of 1,000 each have gone to Poland." By that time, some
bishops were signing off with "Heil Hitler" on official letters and
priests were authorized to display the swastika.</TE>
<TE>   * Influential Jesuit Mario von Galli described Jews as "God's
murderers" who deserve persecution. In 1940, as Gypsies started
joining the Jews on death trains packed to the suffocation point, the
Vienna archdiocese urged all parishes to do their utmost to "combat
the Gypsy chaos" in the Austrian capital by reporting Gypsies to
police.</TE>
<TE>   * The parish newspaper "Erdberger Pfarrblatt" urged Catholics to
support Hitler by declaring: "One people -- one Reich -- one Fuehrer
-- one God!"</TE>
<TE>   * Rural priest Franz Mandl, in a lectern-thumping speech, called
Hitler "the greatest human being" -- one of dozens of priests who
were documented praising the Nazi dictator.</TE>
<TE>   * An internal church document blamed Jewish politicians and
writers for the decline in pure-race Germanic births.</TE>
<TE>   * A listing of pro-Hitler Austrian clergy staying in or promoted
to leading positions after the war. It included Bishop Alois Hudal,
who boasted of helping about 50,000 war crimes suspects hide or
escape. Among them was Franz Stangl, commander of the Treblinka death
camp in Poland, where 800,000 Jews were killed. He was arrested in
Brazil after two decades on the run, using a false passport procured
through Hudal.</TE>
<TE>   After decades of denial, Austria has come a long way in
acknowledging that Hitler, its native son, counted Austrians like
Stangl among his most ruthless henchmen and that he had more rabid
supporters here than in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   While latent anti-Semitism still is exploited by a few far-right
politicians, government leaders now publicly condemn the country's
Nazi past, and laws regulating restitution have paid out millions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Austria's Gothic cathedrals and onion-domed village churches have
resisted scrutiny, however.</TE>
<TE>   Few cardinals and bishops have spoken forthrightly about the links
of some of their predecessors to the Nazi regime. Revelations two
years ago that slave laborers tilled church fields in Austria were
only acknowledged after media reports could no longer be ignored.</TE>
<TE>   In neighboring Germany, too, allegations persist that the Roman
Catholic Church failed to speak out against the Nazi Holocaust and to
properly acknowledge its silent complicity.</TE>
<TE>   "A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Catholic Church in the
Holocaust and Its Unfulfilled Duty of Repair," a new book by American
historian Daniel Goldhagen, reexamines the case against the church,
and has been attacked by critics and church officials as lacking
historical foundation.</TE>
<TE>   It ran into more controversy a few weeks ago when a German court
ordered a picture caption blacked out in the German translation. The
court was acting on a complaint by the Munich diocese that the
caption misidentified a church official at a Nazi event as Michael
Faulhaber, then the cardinal of Munich.</TE>
<TE>   Goldhagen claimed that it was "a desperate attempt on the part of
the church to try and torpedo this book and avoid a real discussion."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, influential prelates in Germany now appear ready to deal
with the past; Cardinal Karl Lehmann of Mainz urged the Vatican
earlier this year to open its Nazi-era archives for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   No such calls have come from Austria's clergy, and those still
alive with personal memories of the church's role more than half a
century ago are either reluctant to talk or plead fading memory.</TE>
<TE>   "Mayer, the principal of our school, he was an 'illegal one,' "
said Hermine Reiterer, 83, using the term for the keenest Nazis, who
joined Hitler's party in the early 1930s while it was still banned in
Austria. "He was extremely active in our church."</TE>
<TE>   Maria, 85, who refuses to give her full name, recalls that her
parish priest in Hitler's boyhood city of Linz rang the bells to
celebrate Nazi Germany's annexation of Austria in 1938. Three years
later, she says, he exhorted parishioners from the pulpit against
"the godless Bolsheviks" as Hitler invaded the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Moritz, however, gives names, dates and concrete examples.</TE>
<TE>   Historian Erika Weinzierl, a Roman Catholic and Austria's lay
authority on her church, calls his book "accurate and solidly
crafted."</TE>
<TE>   Like the Vatican, Austria's Roman Catholic Church spokesman, Erich
Leitenberger, describes the clergy as a victim of the Nazis. But even
he acknowledges the existence of "misguided Catholics" in the church
hierarchy, "who thought their prejudices were confirmed by National
Socialism" -- the Nazi ideology.</TE>
<TE>   Weinzierl, however, suggests such statements fall short at a time
when the Vatican is under pressure to open its archives.</TE>
<TE>   "There has never been a broad acknowledgment of guilt on the part
of the church, either here or for the whole church in general," she
said. "It's time for a sign that this chapter, too, is thrown open."</TE>

<HD>Nazis Paid Bounty Hunters to Turn In Jews, Book Says</HD>
<DH>Writer contends up to 9,000 Dutch -- three times more than
previously thought -- were rousted from hiding for a price.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anthony Deutsch</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>AMSTERDAM</DL>
<LD>Dutch bounty hunters in the pay of the Nazis captured thousands of
Dutch men, women and children during World War II and sent them to
their deaths in concentration camps, a new book says.</LD>
<LD>   "A Price on Their Heads," by Dutch author Ad van Liempt,
highlights a dark page in Dutch history -- a band of 54 middle-aged
men who scoured the land in search of Jews in hiding.</LD>
<LD>   Van Liempt asserts that 8,000 to 9,000 people -- three times more
than earlier estimates -- were turned in for cash.</LD>
<TE>   The findings could help explain why the 108,000 Dutch Jews forced
out of their homes totaled far more per capita than in Belgium or
France, said David Barnouw of the Netherlands Institute for War
Documentation.</TE>
<TE>   "What his work reveals is that, contrary to earlier beliefs, it
was largely the Dutch themselves and not the Germans who turned in
the Jews," Barnouw said.</TE>
<TE>   Van Liempt said in an interview that he was shocked by the extent
of this "painful chapter of human betrayal" in his country, famous
for being the place where Anne Frank hid for two years.</TE>
<TE>   Van Liempt takes a close look at the bounty hunters, describing
them as family types, often unemployed or in low-end jobs, who
volunteered for the work out of greed and hatred of Jews and knew
that their victims would probably be killed.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dutch Department," as the Nazis called it, was also known as
the "Colonne Henneicke," after its leader, Wim Henneicke. He had been
trafficking in stolen Jewish property until the Nazis began offering
cash for Jewish prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Workers were paid about 15 guilders a week, or $75 at today's
exchange rate, plus 7.50 guilders or $37.50 per captured Jew, van
Liempt writes.</TE>
<TE>   He says that to make a man named David Sanders reveal where his
children were, they knocked out his teeth, and that they traveled for
days to capture a 3-year-old girl, Floortje Citroen, who was later
gassed at a camp in Sobibor, Poland.</TE>
<TE>   The hunters would pose as friends or relatives to trick people
into revealing hiding places and would use papers taken from captives
to find new victims.</TE>
<TE>   Van Liempt says he pored over 450,000 prosecution files on Nazi
sympathizers, many of them kept secret until recently. A few
perpetrators received the death penalty after the war, but many more
fled to Germany and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   One is known to be alive in Holland but is 90 and too incoherent
to recall the events, van Liempt said.</TE>
<TE>   Other than Henneicke and his partner, Willem Briede, the names of
the bounty hunters have been changed to protect the privacy of their
children.</TE>
<TE>   "After the war, the Dutch children of collaborators were unfairly
punished for the deeds of their parents," van Liempt said. "Some of
them are still traumatized today. I didn't want to contribute to
that."</TE>

<HD>Carbon Cloud Linked to '97 Asian Wildfires</HD>
<DH>Ecologists believe heat-trapping gases triggered by the
blazes may play a key role in global warming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Evans</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wildfires that raged in Indonesia in 1997 charred millions of acres
and spread a thick haze in the Southern Hemisphere, threatening the
health of millions of people and dealing a severe blow to the
region's economy.</LD>
<LD>   Now, ecologists have discovered another alarming effect: The fires
may have spewed enough carbon to significantly affect the climate.</LD>
<LD>   In 1997, extreme El Nino conditions triggered a drought in
southeast Asia and elsewhere. Examining satellite images and using
field measurements on the island of Borneo, peat-land ecologist Susan
Page at the University of Leicester in England figured that about
3,000 square miles of unusually dry swamp forest and peat bogs
burned.</LD>
<TE>   As much as 2.6 billion tons of carbon were released into the
atmosphere from that area during the fires, she said.</TE>
<TE>   That's an amount equal to 40% of the total amount of carbon
released annually in the combustion of fossil fuels worldwide.
Scientists believe that rising levels of carbon dioxide and other
heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere play a key role in global
warming.</TE>
<TE>   With the wildfires' help, she said, 1997-98 marked the world's
largest increase in carbon emissions. She said the carbon volume
"came as a bit of a surprise."</TE>
<TE>   The result, she said, may push scientists and government leaders
to pay closer attention to the global environmental effects of
wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   Page's findings appear in the Nov. 7 issue of the journal Nature.</TE>
<TE>   She said peat lands in tropical areas are likely to be a major
source of carbon emissions for years unless they are protected from
fire and damaging human activities, like logging.</TE>
<TE>   In an accompanying commentary, David Schimel and David Baker of
the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., said
the findings show that the global carbon cycle can be dramatically
affected by abrupt events.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially in areas of high carbon density, catastrophic events
affecting small areas can evidently have a huge impact on the global
carbon balance," they wrote.</TE>

<HD>Pan-American Highway Just a Road to Nowhere</HD>
<DH>Envisioned in 1923, the project was intended to link North
and South America. Reality fell short, but that may not be all bad.</DH>

<DL>PIJIBASAL, Panama</DL>
<LD>Painted chin to toe with the black juice of the jagua fruit, the
bare-chested 19-year-old mother sits atop her raised wooden hut and
wonders about a place far away.</LD>
<LD>   Marta Manjoma says she would never go to Panama City, a 12-hour
canoe trip down the Pirre River to the nearest road, followed by a
day-long bus ride along the muddy track that leads to the developed
world.</LD>
<LD>   "People can't bathe in the river there, and I imagine that would
make them feel bad," the Embera Indian said, smiling shyly. "Besides,
I think I'd get lost."</LD>
<TE>   Surrounded for miles by a jungle of monkeys, iguanas and spiders,
Manjoma's village, a collection of 15 thatched-roof huts on stilts,
has never seen electricity, running water or a telephone.</TE>
<TE>   And yet it was supposed to be at the center of the most ambitious
development scheme in the Western Hemisphere, a broad road leading
from Alaska to Argentina that was to spur commerce, tourism and
development throughout the Americas.</TE>
<TE>   Designed early in the 20th century as "the greatest single
achievement towards the goal of American unity and solidarity," the
Pan-American Highway stands unfinished at the dawn of the 21st, a
crumbling monument to the ephemeral dream of an Americas united.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like many grandiose schemes, this one was hatched in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   It was the early 1920s, a time of grand visions and hope for the
future. The stock market was booming; prosperity was in the air. A
recent invention, the automobile, was revolutionizing the way that
people and products moved. And the United States, triumphant in World
War I, was trying out its new role as a world leader.</TE>
<TE>   Although ambitious, the vision seemed natural enough: a road that
would stretch for thousands of miles through mountains and marshes,
jungles and deserts, from the United States' southern border to the
far reaches of South America.</TE>
<TE>   In early 1923, leaders of the Americas endorsed the proposal for a
Pan-American Highway.</TE>
<TE>   With infusions of U.S. cash, laborers and construction equipment
began to work their way out from the major cities, leveling dirt and
laying asphalt along trails previously used only by horses and
pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   The original route of the Pan-American Highway now traverses 8,909
miles from Laredo, Texas, through 13 countries to Buenos Aires,
Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Head north from Laredo and you can travel on good highways all the
way to Alaska. Head south, and it is a different story.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All along that highway, people are trying to get to the end of the
road: the promised land of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The pilgrimage north is a rite of passage in many Latin American
towns. Young men -- and, less frequently, women -- find work in the
United States and send money home to their families. In some regions,
entire towns are empty of working-age men.</TE>
<TE>   "We old people are the only ones left here," Roberto Chantac said
in his roadside shack in El Salvador, Mexico. It is his 63rd
birthday, but he is alone. None of his 12 children lives near enough
to celebrate it with him. All have made the journey north.</TE>
<TE>   The money these workers send home is the largest source of foreign
income in some Central American countries. It accounts for billions
of dollars a year in Mexico, where President Vicente Fox calls the
migrants heroes.</TE>
<TE>   But the journey becomes more dangerous and arduous every year.
Completing the Pan-American Highway would make that trip easier; that
is one of the main arguments against finishing it.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government doesn't want to make it easier for immigrants
to illegally cross its borders. Mexicans don't want to make it easier
for South Americans to use their country as a way station to the
promised land.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just as there is no completed Pan-American Highway, there is no
Pan-American identity. Scenes along the roadway reveal a continent
still struggling with its sense of self.</TE>
<TE>   The highway passes skyscrapers and hovels, computer factories and
subsistence corn plots, dust storms and blizzards. It cuts through
civil war and enduring peace, oil booms and mineral busts, pristine
rainforests and toxic rivers. It passes a variety of races, religions
and languages; it glimpses dreams and disappointments.</TE>
<TE>   The very concept of Latin America has little meaning along the
road.</TE>
<TE>   It is a term used by outsiders to refer to those Spanish- and
Portuguese-speaking peoples living in all those culturally diverse
countries south of the border. Within the region, it has never
coalesced into an identity.</TE>
<TE>   "Latin America is a North American idea," said sociologist Marcos
Gandasegui in Panama. "That identity doesn't exist."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The nations along the Pan-American Highway have failed to come
together internally as well. Throughout the region, rich and poor

<TE>   Latin America's upper classes employ families of servants, shop in

<TE>   All along the Pan-American Highway, signs of American corporate
influence abound.</TE>
<TE>   Domino's dominates the pizza delivery market in many countries.
Roads are clogged with Fords and Chevrolets. Televisions light up
with "Temptation Island." People shampoo with Clairol.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, the Pan-American Highway was envisioned as an
artery for American goods and influence. Even though the road was
never finished, both have arrived in abundance -- an invasion that
does not always benefit the people of Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   One of the clearest signs of U.S. influence is widespread official
use of the greenback. But the transition isn't always smooth.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, a coup brought down President Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador
after he proclaimed the country's change from the sucre to the
dollar, but his successor, Gustavo Noboa, went ahead with the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very unpopular measure," Noboa said. "But I'm not Mr.
Congeniality."</TE>
<TE>   The last sucres were exchanged at 7:35 p.m. June 8, 2001, when
18-year-old Juan Vallejos, at the very end of a long line at Quito's
Central Bank, finally got to the teller windows.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't know how many sucres he had in the plastic bags he
carried. He knew only that his mother had told him to exchange them
rather than watch their savings disappear. After his sucres were
counted, he timidly reached out for his dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The teller deposited a nickel and two pennies in his hand.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Every year, billions of dollars in goods and millions of carloads
of people move on sections of the Pan-American Highway. But there is
still no road linking North and South America. A single break still
separates the road systems of the two continents.</TE>
<TE>   The highway peters out in the Panamanian jungle outpost of Yaviza,
crawling to life again 85 miles to the southeast in the Colombian
countryside amid guerrillas and poppy fields.</TE>
<TE>   There are no prospects that this gap will be closed. The final
stretch through the jungle was scheduled to be built in the late
1950s, but the United States, concerned about cattle diseases
spreading north and security along the Panama Canal, backed out.</TE>
<TE>   In the years since, politicians have cited engineering hurdles and
the multimillion-dollar cost. But there are larger problems too.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists worry that the road would encourage development
and deforestation in Central America's most diverse ecosystem.
Panamanians fear the spread of Colombia's civil war and refugees
crossing their border. Americans and Mexicans worry that the
completed road would make it too easy for migrants and drugs to move
up from the south.</TE>
<TE>   "The continuation of the highway makes no sense," said Jose Manuel
Perez of Panama's Economics and Finance Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   The men who devoted their youth to building the road are dying off
now, disillusioned with the dream of bringing the Americas together.</TE>
<TE>   Amado Araus, 79, says he is the only surviving member of a
four-month expedition that felled trees and improvised rafts to
travel from Panama City to Bogota in a publicity stunt for the
unfinished road in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   "Time tells us that our project is a failure," he said. "This is
no longer a matter for politicians. It is a matter for dreamers, like
we were so many years ago."</TE>

<HD>AIDS Ravaging the Teachers, Education Systems of Africa</HD>
<DH>More than 1 million African children lost an instructor to
the disease last year, U.N. records show. Some schools have been
forced to close.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dina Kraft</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>LUSAKA, Zambia</DL>
<LD>Almost every hand in the sun-washed classroom at Kaplunga Girls High
School shoots up in stark answer to a simple question: How many of
you have lost a teacher to AIDS?</LD>
<LD>   One lost a religion teacher. Another recalls a geography teacher
who was especially nice. Others sigh about the civics teacher who
died just before exam week.</LD>
<LD>   As AIDS spreads across Africa, it cuts a path of devastation
through every aspect of society. It crushes economies, leaves
millions of children orphans and casts a cloud over the continent's
future by killing its teachers.</LD>
<TE>   More than 1 million African children lost a teacher to AIDS last
year, according to UNAIDS, the U.N. program set up to fight the
disease.</TE>
<TE>   Some remote schools with only one teacher have been forced to
close. In others, class sizes have surged, and underqualified,
hastily trained substitute teachers have struggled to ensure that
students get some sort of education.</TE>
<TE>   And in countries like Zambia, where one-fifth of the adults are
thought to be infected with HIV, the disease is killing teachers at a
rate too fast to be replaced, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Ofusu-Barko, a UNAIDS advisor in Zambia, says the loss of
teachers is felt far beyond the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers "tend to be community leaders, so when they are gone,
they create a vacuum ... communities tend to lose their cohesion and
there is an element of hopelessness," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the capital, Lusaka, music teacher Remmy Mukonka helped found
the Anti-AIDS Teachers Assn. of Zambia after watching many of his
close colleagues die.</TE>
<TE>   Mukonka, 31, and colleagues provide information about counseling,
testing and AIDS drugs to teachers. But most of all, they try to
fight the stigma surrounding AIDS that makes it so difficult to talk
about the disease, let alone tackle it.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers say that as public figures, they find it even more
challenging to discuss their condition.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting of teachers at a Lusaka elementary school, those used
to standing at the blackboard take seats behind rickety wooden desks
and speak about the disease that is decimating their ranks and making
quality teaching all but impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Every day, someone is absent because of illness and can't be
replaced, said Monica Chibuye, 29. "We try to distribute kids to
different classes, but they are already overloaded."</TE>
<TE>   Some classes spill over with as many as 100 students. Teachers
cover only part of the curriculum and struggle to keep up with
grading students and monitoring their progress. They also must cope
with new challenges of teaching in the AIDS age, such as dealing with
orphaned students.</TE>
<TE>   With low salaries and no health insurance, HIV-positive teachers
feel doomed.</TE>
<TE>   If they retire for health reasons, their pensions will not go into
effect for about four years, by which time they could be dead, they
say.</TE>
<TE>   In the front row of the classroom is Delphia Akafumba Mwanagala,
43, an elementary school teacher. She is HIV-positive and has a
hacking cough from tuberculosis.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get sick, you waste away," Mwanagala said.</TE>
<TE>   One of Lusaka's few teachers to openly declare herself
HIV-positive, Mwanagala said she was infected by her husband, a
retired soldier.</TE>
<TE>   He died four years ago, and his family took over the family home
and all their possessions.</TE>
<TE>   Now Mwanagala and her three sons, ages 9, 13 and 19, live in a
two-room cinderblock shack at the end of a dirt path in Lusaka.</TE>
<TE>   There is no electricity, but the door is cracked open to admit a
beam of sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   Gaunt and exhausted, skin drawn tightly against high cheekbones,
Mwanagala doubts that she will have the strength to return to
teaching when her three-month sick leave ends. She has no money for
doctors, and the dusty air worsens her cough.</TE>
<TE>   Her $50 monthly salary isn't enough to live on after paying school
fees, rent, transportation and food.</TE>
<TE>   So she pounds aloe vera leaves to prepare something to ease her
coughing and writes notes to her fellow teachers asking for help.</TE>
<TE>   "But unfortunately they also have very little salaries," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At Kaplunga Girls High School, girls in the schoolyard laughingly
call the school by its nickname, ABC -- AIDS Breeding Center. And
they talk about the disruption and sadness of having six teachers die
in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   School administrators said classes were canceled for teacher
funerals in the past. But no longer. There are too many funerals.</TE>
<TE>   At one of the school's AIDS clubs, students from the neighboring
boys' school join in for meetings about safer sex and reaching out to
the sick.</TE>
<TE>   They exchange memories of friends and teachers who have died and
are more outspoken about the disease than many adults are.</TE>
<TE>   "We are losing the people who are educating us," said Andrew
Mwape, 18.</TE>
<TE>   "What are we going to do?"</TE>

<HD>Danger, Courage Found Underground</HD>
<DH>The nation's worst mining disaster in 17 years began with a
whisper from the earth. The sound became a groan, then a roar.</DH>
<SE>Thirteen men lost their lives on Sept. 23, 2001, in America's
worst mining disaster in 17 years. This is Part I of a three-part
weekly serial that tells the story of what happened and why.</SE>
<AU>Michael Luo</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>BROOKWOOD, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Half a mile underground, the earth talks. Usually it just murmurs,
but when a few million tons of rock come alive overhead, it makes a
racket.</LD>
<LD>   On the evening of Sept. 23, 2001, when most of the country was
still caught up in the aftermath of 9/11, Tony Key stood in the
middle of a 20-foot-wide tunnel burrowed through the heart of
Alabama's Blue Creek coal seam, his helmet light tracing an arc
through the blackness.</LD>
<LD>   The earth groaned and rumbled like a restless beast as rock
shifted above the mine's Four Section.</LD>
<TE>   A foot above his head, cracks big enough to poke a fist through
snaked across the ceiling. Water dripped from steel rods drilled into
the roof to secure it.</TE>
<TE>   The soft-spoken husband and father had 20 years of experience
underground, most of them here, at Jim Walter Resources No. 5 mine,
the nation's deepest vertical shaft coal mine. He knew what had to be
done.</TE>
<TE>   Working quickly, he and two other miners stacked chunks of wood
Lincoln Log-style to bolster the ceiling. As one wedged in a final
piece, a foot-long rock broke loose and hit him square on his hard
hat. The three men stepped back.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the rumbling increased. Roof rods began snapping like
.22-caliber rifle shots. Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</TE>
<TE>   Then, with a loud "whoosh," a section of roof as big as a house
crashed down just 200 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody got too excited.</TE>
<TE>   Roof falls are not uncommon underground. As his companions sat
down to swig water from their jugs, Key started back toward the
section entrance to find a phone to notify federal mine inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   As he trod down the tunnel, the mine's air currents blowing flecks
of coal dust into his face, the mine was quiet -- but not for long.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The No. 5 mine lies about 40 miles southwest of Birmingham in
Brookwood, population 1,500.</TE>
<TE>   Riding an elevator that drops 15 feet per second, it takes miners
3 1/2 minutes to descend the 2,140 feet to the bottom. There, they
enter a maze of interconnected caverns and honeycombed tunnels that
cover 9.2 square miles. Working three round-the-clock shifts, seven
days a week, the 382 employees mine one of the most fertile coal
seams in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The work area called Four Section lies at the end of a tunnel
about 3 miles east of the elevator shaft, the closest way out.</TE>
<TE>   Workers there first noticed the roof creaking on Friday, two days
before the roof fall.</TE>
<TE>   A miner spent several hours on the day shift pumping 30
10-foot-long steel rods into the roof to bolster it.</TE>
<TE>   The mine's government-approved roof control plan called for steel
I-beams and straps to be used when the cracking became severe, but
supervisors didn't think they were needed. The diminished clamor
seemed to indicate that the rods were doing the job.</TE>
<TE>   Four Section and adjoining Six Section were "under development."
Mining machines, with large, rotating, drum-shaped heads studded with
teeth, were hollowing out the coal in a carefully engineered pattern
that left large walls of coal, more than 120 feet long, in place to
help support the roof.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was to connect the two cavernous sections in the back to
form a straight, 850-foot "longwall" across the face of the coal
seam. Then a machine would cut steadily back and forth across the
coal face.</TE>
<TE>   Friday evening, miners brought in some heavy equipment, including
an 8-ton battery-charging station. With the roof fixed, it seemed
safe to leave the high-voltage electrical equipment there over the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   But on Sunday, an employee making safety checks noticed a chunk of
a concrete wall crumbling under the ceiling's weight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The men who work Jim Walter Resources No. 5 mine labor daily in a
permanent night. A misstep can lead to crippling injury or even
death. The specter of black lung disease always looms.</TE>
<TE>   Their lives, and the lives of 95,000 other coal miners across
America, connect directly to yours every time you turn on a light or
recharge your cell phone. Today, more than half of the nation's
electricity is still generated by burning coal.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, coal mining is a resurgent industry, recovering from
nearly two decades of environmental backlash that made
cleaner-burning natural gas the darling of utility companies.</TE>
<TE>   As coal company profits have rebounded, so have fatal mine
accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Death has always haunted the mines. A century ago, 2,000 to 3,000
men perished annually in coal mine accidents. By the 1980s, safety
regulations and better technology had driven annual fatalities down
to double digits. Fatal accidents reached a low of 29 in 1998,
according to the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, they have been on the rise again. Last year, 42 coal
miners perished.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials like Joe Main, head of safety for the United Mine
Workers of America, say enforcement declined during the Clinton years
and has gotten worse under the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   As evidence, Main points to a steep drop nationwide in citations
for "serious and substantial" violations, the kind that draw the
stiffest penalties. But MSHA's head, Assistant Secretary of Labor
David Lauriski, says the numbers simply mean that mines are becoming
safer.</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 was a comparatively dangerous, problem-plagued mine.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, it led the country in safety violations and had one of
the highest accident rates. Injuries and fines for violations dropped
sharply over the next three years as Jim Walter made improvements.
But then both began increasing again as production boomed.</TE>
<TE>   MSHA records for No. 5 show some oddities. The mine had the third
most violations in the country in 2000 but ranked only 62nd for
serious and substantial violations.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, of 520 violations cited in 2000, all but 16 were
recorded as affecting only one miner, diminishing the fines faced by
the company. Some of these single-miner violations were for powdery
coal dust in thousands of feet of tunnels. Coal dust makes a mine
prone to explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials say the figures reflect how quickly they respond
to safety issues. Main, however, says MSHA inspectors were cutting
breaks for Jim Walter Resources, a Florida-based conglomerate that
brings in $2 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   Main says that the company was routinely warned ahead of time
about "surprise" inspections, that federal mine safety agency bosses
frequently overrode their inspectors' citations, that inspectors
often failed to follow up to see if violations had been remedied.</TE>
<TE>   Lauriski declined to comment on the allegations, but the agency
has launched an internal review.</TE>
<TE>   In September 2001, the No. 5 mine was in the midst of a quarterly
inspection. MSHA officials had found more than 50 violations,
including 10 "significant and substantial ones."</TE>
<TE>   On the day things suddenly went wrong, the mine had 31 outstanding
violations, including an accumulation of combustible coal dust and
ventilation problems on Four Section. The deadline for fixing them
had passed; no inspector had followed up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The roof in Four Section was rumbling. A few men in the skeleton
crew of 32 workers that started their shift at 3 p.m. that Sunday
needed to get to work building wooden roof supports called "cribs."</TE>
<TE>   Michael McIe was among the men assigned to support the roof.</TE>
<TE>   He and three others waited for a manbus, a motorized rail cart, to
take them on the half-hour ride to the section. By the time the men
got to Four Section and started building the cribs, it was 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   They had been at it for about an hour and 15 minutes when the
house-sized section of roof fell.</TE>
<TE>   As Key, foreman on the job, turned away to find a telephone to
alert inspectors, his first thought was of gas -- the colorless,
odorless methane that lurks in the Blue Creek coal seam.</TE>
<TE>   Methane is commonly associated with coal, but Jim Walter Resources
No. 5 is an especially gassy mine. Here, boreholes driven into the
coal beds to free trapped methane are not only a safety measure but a
profitable enterprise. Twenty million cubic feet of methane a day are
liberated from No. 5 and sold to a natural gas company.</TE>
<TE>   Roof falls can release pockets of gas into the tunnels; if the air
in them becomes 5% to 15% methane, the slightest spark can cause an
explosion.</TE>
<TE>   As a precaution, mining machines are built to automatically shut
down when gas levels exceed 2%, and company and union policy
discourage workers from operating equipment when concentrations
reached even 1%.</TE>
<TE>   However, miners in No. 5 say they were feeling ever-increasing
pressure to meet production goals. Mike Boyd and several other miners
said workers often got flak from company bosses if they turned off
machinery because of concerns about gas. Company officials denied it.</TE>
<TE>   In the 10 days leading up to the accident in No. 5 mine, workers
in Four Section and neighboring Six Section had put out three
"ignitions" -- intensely hot flare-ups in which small pockets of
methane gas caught fire.</TE>
<TE>   Key had walked only a few feet up the tunnel when a tremor of
worry passed through him. He couldn't see what had happened to the
battery charger that had been brought in on Friday. Had the roof fall
crushed it?</TE>
<TE>   Unseen behind the wall of rock, the charger was still running, its
electric arc sparking in the darkness, waiting for fuel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Next week:  Like firefighters on Sept. 11, miners rushed toward
danger.</TE>

<HD>Harvard Roommates Living in FDR's Footsteps</HD>
<DH>Trio win a lottery to live in the same suite that the late
president used as a student there. A letter he wrote to his parents
hangs on the wall.</DH>

<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Matthew Ferrante opened the door to his Harvard dorm room and walked
into a bit of history.</LD>
<LD>   Alongside the regular college fixtures -- a "Harvard Class of
2005" poster and paper lamps -- was a framed letter that a student
named Franklin Delano Roosevelt had written to his parents from the
room at the turn of the last century.</LD>
<LD>   Ferrante and his two roommates are the first students in decades
to live in the FDR suite, where the 32nd president resided during his
Harvard years, 1900 to 1904.</LD>
<TE>   Furnishings from the Bed Bath and Beyond store fill the rooms that
were bedecked by a Paine Furniture rug and Jordan Marsh curtains in
Roosevelt's times.</TE>
<TE>   The three-room suite -- which the roommates consider one of the
best on campus -- takes visitors back a hundred years, with its
15-foot ceilings, an oak fireplace with Doric columns and French
windows lining an entire wall. The bathroom, with its claw-foot tub
and a pull-chain toilet, also hasn't really changed since Roosevelt
used it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's weird knowing that you're sitting on the toilet where FDR
sat," said roommate Stephen Stromberg, a 19-year-old Russian studies
major.</TE>
<TE>   The suite was occupied by students until the late 1950s, when it
was converted into a study and then into a professor's office.</TE>
<TE>   House Master Sean Palfrey had always taken a personal interest in
the suite because of family connections: He is Teddy Roosevelt's
great-grandson. Due to a housing crunch, Palfrey decided to open it
up to students this past summer, after the professor vacated it in
the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Stromberg, of Los Angeles; Ferrante, a 19-year-old sophomore from
Arlington Heights, Ill., and Michael Donahue, 20, of St. Louis, were
the lucky ones who landed the suite through a lottery system.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a political junkie. FDR is one of my heroes," Stromberg said.
"I definitely never expected to be living here."</TE>
<TE>   The roommates struggled at first with the century-old toilet tank
that ran all day and the recently added showerhead in the bathtub
that just dripped water instead of spraying.</TE>
<TE>   "But then our friends look at us strange, like, 'Why are you
complaining about your bathroom, when you're living in FDR's room?' "
Ferrante said. "That shuts us up, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   Some of his friends are jealous, Donahue said, and people
sometimes stop him on campus to ask to see his famous suite.</TE>
<TE>   An official plaque on a wall commemorates Roosevelt's years in the
rooms. Around it, Ferrante has erected a makeshift shrine of pictures
of Roosevelt, wife Eleanor, Teddy Roosevelt, the "Big Three" -- FDR
with Josef Stalin and Winston Churchill -- and charts showing
Roosevelt's presidential election victories in 1936 and 1944.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't quite done the fireside chat yet," said Ferrante, a
theater enthusiast and history major, referring to Roosevelt's
presidential radio addresses. "It's definitely on our list of things
to do."</TE>
<TE>   It was probably a fluke that the framed handwritten letter from
Roosevelt to his parents was left behind in the room, instead of
being moved to the Harvard archives, Palfrey said.</TE>
<TE>   In this pencil-written, slightly smudged letter, Roosevelt
describes his first few days at Harvard, where he studied history.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw many rooms but the pick was at Westmorly," Roosevelt
wrote, referring to the old name of this part of Adams House. "First
floor, corner, looking on the Southwest and guess the price. $400
without extras. The floor is roughly like this," he wrote, sketching
the floor plan.</TE>
<TE>   "The sitting room is large enough for two desks. The bedroom and
bathroom light and airy. The ceilings are very high," Roosevelt
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Stromberg says the history in the room leaves him in awe.</TE>
<TE>   "You see pictures of FDR approving the New Deal and then you
think, he also wrote that letter and it hangs in our room. His hands
drew that picture," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrante has been given a glimpse into a different side of the
legendary president.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of neat to see him not just as a president or
historical figure, but as a student," he said. "It's like one of us
writing to our parents."</TE>
<TE>   But their stint in FDR's suite may be short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   Palfrey said that although there are no definite plans, officials
are considering preserving it as a guest room for visiting scholars.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is enough space to keep this room as a guest room next
year, we would do that," Palfrey said, adding that Adams House has no
guest rooms now. "It would be nice to have some flexibility to offer
eminent people who want to come here, to host them in this house,
maybe give talks and engage with the students."</TE>
<TE>   Stromberg thinks it is fate that he's living in this room. Exactly
a century ago, Roosevelt was president of the Harvard Crimson
newspaper, where Stromberg works now.</TE>
<TE>   "You wonder if he was a political junkie as well. Did he have
presidential aspirations in this room?"</TE>

<HD>A Toxic Fast-Food Environment Afflicts U.S., Crusader Says</HD>
<DH>Sodas, snacks and fatty meals lead to obesity epidemic,
director of weight disorders center warns. He suggests a tax on such
items.</DH>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW HAVEN, Conn.</DL>
<LD>All Kelly Brownell wants is a breakfast that won't kill him.</LD>
<LD>   In this diner on the outskirts of New Haven that requires some
difficult negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   He has just ordered a bowl of oatmeal, with skim milk. Now he asks
the waitress: "Do you have any fresh fruit? Cut up bananas or
something? Fruit salad, maybe?"</LD>
<TE>   No, no and no.</TE>
<TE>   "The closest thing we have is blueberry pie filling," the waitress
tells him apologetically. "You know, in a can."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll live with the oatmeal then," Brownell says, sighing, not
happy, but trying to be pleasant about it.</TE>
<TE>   The waitress walks away.</TE>
<TE>   "No fruit," Brownell says, shaking his head in disgust.</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder that America is in the throes of a raging obesity
epidemic, he says. Over the last 20 years, childhood obesity has
tripled and adult obesity has doubled. Now one child in six and
nearly one adult in three is obese.</TE>
<TE>   Only one thing can account for such a rapid change over the last
20 years, Brownell says, and if people would just open their eyes,
they would see it all around them.</TE>
<TE>   The waitress comes back with his oatmeal, and Brownell asks her
why they don't have any fruit in the place. Is it because nobody
orders it?</TE>
<TE>   Pretty much, she responds.</TE>
<TE>   "We have one old guy, brings his own banana."</TE>
<TE>   The waitress has no way of knowing it, but she is talking to a man
who has been on a crusade for much of the last decade against the
proliferation of junk food in America. Director of the Yale Center
for Eating and Weight Disorders, Brownell believes that the nation is
plagued by a "toxic food environment."</TE>
<TE>   Sodas, snacks and fast food have taken over America's culinary
landscape, Brownell laments, much the way mini-malls and office parks
have scarred the nation's scenery. It has become about as hard to get
a decent, healthy meal of reasonable proportions in this country as
it is to locate a thriving five-and-dime. Worst of all, few people
seem to have noticed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God. I didn't even see that," Brownell exclaims.</TE>
<TE>   He's in this Walgreen's drugstore to point out some of the tricks
that corporate marketing savants use to entice people into buying
food they otherwise wouldn't. After a stroll down the aisle leading
to the pharmacy (mostly candy), Brownell stands before it like a man
who has just had a cold drink tossed in his face.</TE>
<TE>   There on the prescription counter, right where people go for
medicine that's supposed to make them better, is a cardboard display
hawking cookies and Kit Kat bars.</TE>
<TE>   "So this," Brownell pronounces in an ironic tone, "is a
drugstore."</TE>
<TE>   He turns to walk out, only to find himself having to negotiate a
shelf of Fiddle Faddle.</TE>
<TE>   Humans are biologically designed to hoard calories. The gift
protected the species from extinction during prehistory, when long
periods of starvation were the rule. But now that we live lives of
relative ease in a land of abundance, the gift has become a curse.</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to give in, of course. Many of Brownell's critics
argue that people become obese because they lack self-control, not
because sinister corporations force them to eat.</TE>
<TE>   The public appears to agree. A 2001 poll by Princeton University
researchers found that most people consider obesity a problem of
individual willpower, not the increased availability of unhealthy
food.</TE>
<TE>   But people shouldn't have to struggle to maintain a healthy
weight, Brownell insists. Forced to live in an environment that is
specifically designed to lead them into temptation, many, if not
most, will succumb.</TE>
<TE>   Brownell himself is an example. He sports a good-sized paunch --
thanks, he says, to a book project that has kept him relatively
sedentary and snack-prone for the last year or so. In photographs
taken a few years back, he looks much trimmer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is 10:15 a.m. The cafeteria of the public high school in
Branford, Conn., a wealthy New Haven suburb, is buzzing with students
in study hall. They are milling, chatting, reading, posing, laughing
-- but most notable to Brownell, they are munching on snacks
purchased at the school's 13 soda and snack machines.</TE>
<TE>   "This is awful," Brownell says with a moan.</TE>
<TE>   Soda and snack companies pay for the right to put machines in
schools. In an era of shrinking budgets, schools use the money for
band uniforms, sports equipment, sometimes even textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   To corporate marketing executives, putting vending machines in
public schools amounts to sheer brilliance. Not only does it sell
snacks, it develops brand loyalty in a lucrative demographic.</TE>
<TE>   To Brownell, the practice is a menace to public health. All around
him, kids are gulping sodas, quaffing sports drinks, nibbling candy
bars. The tables are littered with crumbs and wrappers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is America," Brownell says.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Brownell wrote an op-ed column in the New York Times
suggesting that a junk food tax might help alleviate the obesity
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Fatty foods would be judged on their nutritive value per calorie
or gram of fat; the least healthy would be given the highest tax
rate," he wrote. "Consumption of high-fat food would drop, and the
revenue could be used for public exercise facilities -- bike paths
and running tracks -- or nutrition education in schools."</TE>
<TE>   The government taxes alcohol and tobacco, two notorious scourges
of public health, Brownell argued. Obesity is beginning to rival
smoking as a public health hazard. Why not slap a tax on the foods
that cause it?</TE>
<TE>   Food industry lobbyists and conservative pundits soon lambasted
the idea as another meddlesome intrusion on personal liberty. They
called it the "Twinkie tax."</TE>
<TE>   Brownell was lambasted by Rush Limbaugh, the Wall Street Journal
editorial page and even supermarket tabloid columnist Ed Anger of the
Weekly World News.</TE>
<TE>   "The high-fat Gestapo is trying to follow in the footsteps of the
smoking Gestapo, in an effort to force the American people to act in
the 'proper' way," Limbaugh complained on his radio show.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now Brownell is in the grocery store. All he can talk about is
cartoons. Every box of sugary cereal or gummy snacks has a picture of
some TV character beloved to America's children. If it isn't that
blue dog, it's that yellow sponge guy or the kid with the weird hair.
Brownell can't remember most of their names.</TE>
<TE>   With a few rare exceptions (Apple &amp; Eve "Elmo's Punch"), he
pronounces every product with a cartoon character on it pure junk. If
they'd only use their influence to sell healthy foods instead of this
junk, kids might eat better.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to get mad," Brownell says, pointing to a box of
"Blue's Clues" fruit snacks (mostly sugar, not fruit). "The parents
need to put pressure on Nickelodeon not to do that kind of thing."</TE>
<TE>   The average child sees 10,000 food commercials a year on
television, many of them featuring charismatic celebrities such as
Michael Jordan, Britney Spears and Shaquille O'Neal. How can a parent
compete with that?</TE>
<TE>   Imagine a world where those ads featured Jordan endorsing oranges
instead of McDonald's, Brownell says. O'Neal could sell asparagus
instead of Burger King.</TE>
<TE>   It's a pity so much attention, and bile, has been directed at his
tax proposal, Brownell says, because his other ideas get lost in the
bedlam.</TE>
<TE>   He has almost finished writing a book about cleaning up the toxic
food environment, and indeed the tax is last on a list presented in
the chapter on public policy. The first four:</TE>
<TE>   * Encourage physical activity with more recreation centers, bike
paths and school physical education programs.</TE>
<TE>   * Regulate food advertising aimed at children, perhaps by
mandating equal time for messages touting healthy foods.</TE>
<TE>   * Ban snacks, fast food and sodas from schools.</TE>
<TE>   * Replace the pizza, burgers and fries that are staples on most
school cafeteria menus with healthy alternatives, and use the lunch
program to teach kids how to eat right.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brownell is sitting in a hot little seminar room on the second
floor of Yale's psychology department with 15 slim students. They are
debating the significance of a recent announcement by McDonald's that
the company is changing the composition of its fry oil to one
containing a healthier combination of fats.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's fries will still have the same total calories. But with
more "good" polyunsaturated fats and less trans-fats, the fries will
do less damage to arteries.</TE>
<TE>   But will they do less damage overall?</TE>
<TE>   Brownell worries that people will eat more of the newfangled fries
in the mistaken belief that a slightly less unhealthy food is
actually good for them.</TE>
<TE>   He calls it "the Snackwell effect," after the popular fat-free
cookies. Under the false impression that Snackwells are intrinsically
"healthy," Brownell says, many people eat a dozen Snackwells at a
time and end up consuming the equivalent of eight Oreos.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, he suggests, McDonald's expects to see a similar response
to its new fries.</TE>
<TE>   "They may know this is going to help their business and ultimately
lead to more calorie consumption -- more total fat consumption,"
Brownell speculates.</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether they believe French fry sales will rise or fall
as a result of the McDonald's decision, every student predicts an
increase.</TE>

<HD>Mementos of Robert E. Lee's Daughter Found</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Wheeler</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More than 80 years after the death of Mary Custis Lee, eldest and
most headstrong daughter of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, two
steamer trunks full of her papers and travel souvenirs have been
found in a bank vault in suburban Alexandria, Va.</LD>
<LD>   The wooden trunks -- containing family letters, photographs,
clippings of her father's obituary, strands of hair collected from
royalty on European trips rarely taken by other single women of her
era -- came to light after an inquiry from a descendant.</LD>
<LD>   Rob E. L. deButts Jr. (who prefers that shortened version of his
famous name) knew that Mary Lee used Burke &amp; Herbert Bank &amp; Trust Co.
as her permanent address when she left on her travels abroad. While
doing some family research, deButts -- whose great-grandfather was
Mary Lee's brother -- sent an e-mail to an old classmate from a high
school in Alexandria, bank Vice Chairman E. Hunt Burke, asking
whether the bank had any records or artifacts associated with his
ancestor.</LD>
<TE>   "I was asking about things in general but did mention trunks,"
said deButts, a New York lawyer. "I never dreamed there would
actually be trunks."</TE>
<TE>   The request sent Burke to the bank's "silver vault," where it
stores items too bulky for safe-deposit boxes. The trunks "were
dusty. They were in a corner," Burke said. "On the inventory, they
were carried as two trunks. We didn't have a name."</TE>
<TE>   But he saw that one of them was stenciled on the side with "M.
Lee."</TE>
<TE>   DeButts came right away to look at the find. Last month, he
returned and delivered both trunks to the Virginia Historical Society
in Richmond in hopes that it will catalog and preserve their
contents.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything in the trunks is Lee-related," said Charles F. Bryan
Jr., society president. "They were stuffed full. This is a very
exciting find."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Custis Lee was the second child of the four daughters and
three sons born to Lee and his wife, Mary, granddaughter of George
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Price Coulling, author of "The Lee Girls," said Lee was
unusually bold for her time. Daughters were expected to live at home
until they married. If they remained single -- as many Southern girls
did after the Civil War because there were so few men left to marry
-- their role was to care for their parents.</TE>
<TE>   "She took off and did what she wanted to do," Coulling said. "She
left her sister Mildred to cope with everything."</TE>
<TE>   From 1871 to 1914, when the outbreak of World War I brought her
home to Virginia, Mary Lee was abroad so much, traveling in Europe
and Asia, that very little is known about her life. "Hopefully, these
papers will fill out those 40 years," Coulling said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, who was 36 when she set out, had an inheritance to help
finance her travels, but she was not reluctant to supplement it by
playing up her family name, according to Coulling. She would write
ahead to tell royalty that Lee's daughter was arriving -- and the red
carpet would be rolled out.</TE>
<TE>   It was then common to use one's hometown bank as an address during
extended travels.</TE>
<TE>   Burke &amp; Herbert, founded in the early 1850s and still
family-owned, then required no written rental agreements for vault
space. Burke said it is likely that no fee was ever charged,
explaining why the connection to Mary Lee was lost.</TE>
<TE>   The vault is frequented only by customers who pay for space, so
employees hadn't tripped over her trunks and wondered to whom they
belonged.</TE>
<TE>   DeButts, one of six Lee descendants who agreed that the trunks
should be taken to the Historical Society for the time being, has
sorted through their contents.</TE>
<TE>   "There are thousands of letters in there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan said the society is waiting only for a formal agreement with
the family to begin cataloging and preserving the contents, a project
that could take two to three years.</TE>

<HD>Arson Suspect Acquires a New Fiancee; Law Closes In</HD>
<DH>John Veysey was running short of cash again, investigators
discovered. Would he harm the new woman he claimed to love?</DH>
<SE>Last in a weekly series</SE>
<AU>Sharon Cohen</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>CARY, Ill.</DL>
<LD>THE STORY SO FAR</LD>
<LD>   Investigators probing disasters in John Veysey's life detect a
pattern: When his bank balance drops too low, fires occur and he
collects insurance on his homes and even on those close to him. Now
there's a new woman in his life, and he plans to take out a life
insurance policy on her.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   CARY, Ill. -- She folded her arms in cold defiance and glowered as
she listened to the painful words.</TE>
<TE>   Two investigators were in Callie Hilkin's office, telling her that
the man she loved, John T. Veysey III, was dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "You are in jeopardy," said John Korth, a Jo Daviess County deputy
sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe he'd hurt me," Callie insisted.</TE>
<TE>   Tina Sherrow, a U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
agent, persisted, her voice kind but firm.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't be here if we didn't think there was a real
possibility of something happening to you and the children," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Did Callie know Veysey's first wife, Patricia, had died, and that
authorities were looking into it, the investigators asked.</TE>
<TE>   And that Veysey had life insurance policies on his second wife,
Deserie, and his son, Little John -- and they almost died in a fire?</TE>
<TE>   "He got Little John out of the fire," Callie blurted.</TE>
<TE>   "He did not," Sherrow quickly corrected her.</TE>
<TE>   Callie sat disbelieving in the conference room of the Dubuque,
Iowa, financial services company where she worked. Tears welled in
her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful relationship," she protested. "He takes very,
very good care of me and my children."</TE>
<TE>   Veysey took her two sons hiking. He picked them up after school.
She trusted him. Maybe he was a bit of a rogue sometimes, but he was
good to her.</TE>
<TE>   Her train of thought was interrupted by a question from Sherrow:
Why were Callie and John visiting an insurance agent that very
afternoon?</TE>
<TE>   Car insurance, Callie replied.</TE>
<TE>   Sherrow took the phone and called the insurance agent.</TE>
<TE>   "Will you please tell her about the insurance she's coming in
for?"</TE>
<TE>   "Life insurance," the agent said -- $100,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   The words hit Callie like a fist. John had lied: She already had
life insurance, and he had said this appointment was for auto
coverage. It didn't make sense.</TE>
<TE>   Only the day before, she'd signed a will leaving everything --
mostly life insurance, but also her 401K retirement plan -- to John.
Her death would fatten Veysey's wallet by $750,000.</TE>
<TE>   Could John really be what they were saying, a time bomb?</TE>
<TE>   It was all a shock. Not that she had never had questions about
John. She had, many times. But he always had an explanation. John was
so charming, so convincing.</TE>
<TE>   But this was different. He had betrayed her. The call seemed to
prove that. And there were other things that the investigators had
said. John's story of the High Road fire in Cary also was a lie -- he
told her that he had almost died.</TE>
<TE>   The more she heard, the more her doubts grew -- although there was
one thing that she was immediately certain about. She had to deal
with the will. She would tear it up.</TE>
<TE>   As she crossed the Mississippi into Illinois on her way home that
warm spring afternoon, she wondered: Should she stand by the man she
loved? Or cooperate with the authorities?</TE>
<TE>   At a service station, she abruptly pulled over and called the
county sheriff's office.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to talk," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Agents had heard stories like Callie's before as they followed
Veysey's path from woman to woman and fire to fire.</TE>
<TE>   A single mom on the rebound from a nasty divorce, Hilkin had
hooked up with Veysey through a personals ad in 1998. She had met him
two years earlier in the same way and thought that he looked like "a
Greek god," tall and blond with rippling muscles.</TE>
<TE>   Callie was naive, she admitted. She never questioned things that
Veysey said, even his claim that he didn't need to work because he
had so much money. He dazzled her by flashing wads of $50s and $100s.
Gradually, his bankrolls thinned and the bills were $5s and $10s.</TE>
<TE>   Veysey was running short of cash.</TE>
<TE>   One night in January 1999, she found him crying. He said he had a
premonition that she would be killed in an automobile accident, that
she wouldn't see her boys grow up.</TE>
<TE>   Callie, who had been in a serious head-on collision two years
earlier, believed him.</TE>
<TE>   It was time, he said, to get her affairs in order.</TE>
<TE>   He urged her to get two life insurance policies, each paying
$250,000. That way the boys could go to college and he could fight
her ex-husband for custody. She obediently got the insurance.</TE>
<TE>   But Veysey wasn't satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   Soon he was speaking feverishly of an elaborate insurance hoax.
They would fake her death in a boating explosion.</TE>
<TE>   The cops and insurance companies were dumb enough to buy it if she
were willing to make a small sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   "A finger or two," he said. They wouldn't bother to look for the
rest of her.</TE>
<TE>   "You're nuts," she thought.</TE>
<TE>   Veysey tried a new tack.</TE>
<TE>   What she really needed, he said, was a will. It should specify
that she wanted to be cremated. Somehow, he claimed, that would help
him leave town with the boys before her ex-husband could get custody.</TE>
<TE>   It sounded ghoulish. But again Callie went along.</TE>
<TE>   One night, he came home with a draft of the will. They sat on the
sofa in the family room and he put his arm around her as he explained
the fine print.</TE>
<TE>   By the time she finished reviewing all of this with investigators,
Callie had made her decision: She wanted out.</TE>
<TE>   The morning of May 20, 1999 -- 16 months after the Cary, Ill.,
fire that got the investigation rolling -- she gathered clothes in a
basket and told Veysey, still in bed, that she was going to the
cleaners.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want you to know that I love you," she said. "Goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon, ATF agents escorted Callie and her sons to a hotel
room. She planned to leave town in a few days -- and chose her new
home by studying a map of the United States in a phone book. For now,
it was just a matter of waiting a few hours.</TE>
<TE>   Veysey was driving along Longhollow Road outside Galena that
afternoon with Little John when police pulled him over.</TE>
<TE>   "This is outrageous!" he thundered as the handcuffs were slapped
on.</TE>
<TE>   When Callie got home that night, agents had searched the house and
found Patricia's engagement ring, artwork and other possessions that
Veysey had claimed as lost on insurance reports.</TE>
<TE>   She spotted Veysey's reading glasses on a nightstand.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to go see him," she sobbed. "He needs his glasses."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   She did not see Veysey again until two years later -- in federal
court in Chicago, when he went on trial for arson and fraud.</TE>
<TE>   His insurance claims had netted nearly $1 million, prosecutors
calculated.</TE>
<TE>   They called nearly 100 witnesses, including medical and fire
experts. They hauled out that narrow window frame the 6-foot-5 Veysey
claimed that he'd leaped through during the High Road fire.</TE>
<TE>   And they presented jurors with some telling numbers:</TE>
<TE>   Some 74% of Veysey's income, going back nine years, had come from
insurance; just 4% came from paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   And another number: An insurance actuary was asked what the odds
were that four homes at random would have serious fires in nine
years. On a pad projected for jurors to see, he began writing digits,
13 in all, running down the side of the pad -- 1.7 trillion to 1.</TE>
<TE>   After a six-week trial, the jury deliberated just one day before
returning the verdict: Guilty on 18 counts of insurance fraud and
arson.</TE>
<TE>   He was sentenced in November 2001 to 110 years -- the
extraordinary length due, in large part, to the jury's conclusion
that Veysey was responsible for Patricia's death as part of an
insurance scam. (He was not charged with homicide.)</TE>
<TE>   Veysey is appealing.</TE>
<TE>   The ordeal finally over, Deserie Beetle, who had almost died in
the fire on High Road, hugged Ron Delelio, the Cary detective whose
suspicions had sparked the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, she took the courthouse elevator down with her mother
and sister.</TE>
<TE>   "He got what he deserved, only not enough," she said as they
descended. Then, under her breath, she muttered: "He's still alive."</TE>
<TE>   As Delelio walked outside, he carried a commendation plaque that
ATF agents had given him that day.</TE>
<TE>   Heading home, he remembered the promise he had made years earlier
to Patricia Veysey's parents. "It may not be today or tomorrow or
next month," he had vowed, "but justice will prevail."</TE>
<TE>   Delelio smiled. That day had come.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   How This Series Was Reported</TE>
<TE>   From Associated Press</TE>
<TE>   The story of the investigation into John T. Veysey III is based on
interviews with numerous officials, including Pat Layng and Lori
Lightfoot of the U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago; members of the
Cary, Ill., police, including Det. Ron Delelio, Deputy Chief Ed
Fetzer and former Det. Denise Bradstreet; Cary firefighters Brad
Dellatore, Andy Veath, Scott Mohr and Robert Deau; U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents Jack Malooly, Tina Sherrow, Jane
Balkema and Jim Allison; Deserie Beetle and her mother, Irene Beetle;
Betty and Gerald DeBruyne, and Kathleen Hilkin. It also draws on
thousands of pages of court testimony from Veysey's arson and fraud
trial and sentencing, as well as a transcript of an interview
conducted by Sherrow and John Korth, a sheriff's deputy in Jo Daviess
County, Ill. Through his attorney, Veysey declined to be interviewed.</TE>

<HD>The man who sold the world</HD>
<DH>Journals Kurt Cobain Riverhead Books: 280 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jim Carroll</AU>
<BD>Jim Carroll is the author of "The Basketball Diaries."
His album "Catholic Boy" was released in 1980.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although peppered with coy phrases such as "if you read you'll
judge," I doubt if the man you get to know throughout the pages of
"Journals" by Kurt Cobain would, when the end came, have wanted this
book published. It's fascinating like a car wreck, and I, for one,
wish that only the music survived his death.</LD>
<LD>   As leader and songwriter of the band Nirvana, Cobain proved
himself to be one of the most innovative musicians in the history of
rock 'n' roll. He certainly re-energized it at a time when it was
foundering in the hairsprayed heavy-metal period of the late '80s.
More than anything else -- his rage, his musicianship -- he was
genuine. These journals bear out that fact. They are angry, they are
sad, they are whiny, they are naive and heart-wrenching, but they are
always genuine.</LD>
<TE>   But genuineness isn't enough. In these undated letters, poems,
lyrics in various drafts, imprecations against the media, scenarios
for videos, caviling political and social furor, cartoons, schematic
drawings for guitars and various lists (he repeats his favorite album
list over and over, ad nauseam), he doesn't reveal himself in any
coherent narrative, only through bits and pieces that only the most
ardent rock fan would want to wade through. His writings contain the
same passion and rage his lyrics do, but without the music, there is
no heart quality (or "inner register," as Henry Miller would call it)
to give the pieces their flow and their edge.</TE>
<TE>   When he writes letters to friends, usually fellow musicians, he is
sweet, enthusiastic and generous in his praise of their work. In a
letter firing early Nirvana drummer Dave Foster, he is businesslike
and almost apologetic. When he writes about himself, he is usually
either defensive, captious or utterly self-deprecating:</TE>
<TE>   "I need to re-learn the English language. I seem insincere because
I can't choose or decide fast enough. My penmanship seems
scatological because of my lack of personality .... I am obsessed
with the fact that I am skinny and stupid."</TE>
<TE>   The last line is a constant theme whenever he writes about
himself. From the time he was a young child, he writes, he was so
skinny that his entire body could fit in the leg of his pants. One
page is practically blank but for the words "Nordic trac," along with
the 800 number to order one.</TE>
<TE>   As to his numerous references throughout the diaries of himself as
stupid, while you can't be a rock star without a sense of cockiness,
he understood the limitations of his genius and knew he could write
with authority only coming from the place of a musician.</TE>
<TE>   It is a gorgeous book, containing selections from 20 notebooks
locked in a vault since his suicide in 1994. They are reproduced
elegantly by digital photography, right down to the spirals from the
Mead notebooks Cobain favored. Cobain's handwriting comes in various
stages of legibility (he printed almost exclusively) and at times
paid little attention to punctuation and spelling. When using a felt
tip, his hand is more easily read than in ballpoint. Some of the more
illegible pieces toward the end of the book are set in type in the
notes section in the back. The drawing in his cartoons is fairly
good, but what is more interesting are his illustrations of his
fantasy guitars. Guitar players and gear heads will love this stuff.
Most are variations on an amalgamation between a Fender Jaguar and
Mustang, with notes beside them describing types of pickups,
humbuckers, headstocks, etc. He also doodled designs for Nirvana
T-shirts and album covers.</TE>
<TE>   But what Cobain does not do in these pages is elucidate his
creative process. We just see the lyrics on the page; there is no
explanation for them. While it is rock 'n' roll tradition from Bob
Dylan on down that to explain a lyric is to crush its diamond-hard
center, we don't get a good look into Cobain's mind as to how he
arrived at those lyrics -- an anecdote describing under what
condition they were written or what might have prompted their
writing:</TE>
<TE>   "[M]y lyrics are a big pile of contradictions. They're split down
the middle between very sincere opinions and feelings that I have and
sarcastic and hopefully -- humorous rebuttles towards cliche --
bohemian ideals that have been exhausted for years.... I mean I like
to be passionate and sincere, but I also like to have fun and act
like a dork.</TE>
<TE>   Geeks unite."</TE>
<TE>   That's about as much as you get when it comes to self-insight into
the lyrics. Then again, it is nice to see them printed out in their
various drafts -- sloppy, and with surprisingly few changes. It's
likely these were rewritten from earlier lines on napkins and
envelopes. They don't have the feel of first drafts. Late in the
book, Nirvana fans will cringe when they read:</TE>
<TE>   "Within the months between October 1991 thru december 92 I have
had 4 four Notebooks filled with two years worth of poetry and
personal writings and lyrics stolen from me at separate times. two 90
minute cassettes filled with new guitar and singing parts for new
songs damaged from a plumbing accident, as well as two of my most
expensive, favorite guitars. I've never been a very prolific person
so when creativity flows, it flows. I find myself scribbling on
little note pads and pieces of loose paper which results in a very
small portion of my writing to ever show up in true form. It's my
fault but the most violating thing I've felt this year is not the
media exaggerations or the catty gossip, but the rape of my personal
thoughts ripped out of pages from my stay in hospitals and aeroplane
rides hotel stays etc. .... You have raped me harder than you'll ever
know."</TE>
<TE>   This is a typical Cobain invective. It is easy at first to see
this passage as simple moaning or to wince that someone of such
talent would not take the time to make copies of his work. However,
by the end of the excerpt you realize that his attitude is befitting,
especially in the ethic of punk rock. Friends who would make an
artist stand guard over his notes, lest they rip them off, deserve
Cobain's execration. As for his indolent work habits, this was simply
the only way he knew how to get it done.</TE>
<TE>   When he speaks about his decline into a daily use of heroin after
returning from his second tour of Europe with Sonic Youth, he
justifies his habit:</TE>
<TE>   "I decided to use heroine [he always uses this misspelling when
referring to the drug] on a daily basis because of an ongoing stomach
ailment that I have been suffering from for the last five years had
literally taken me to the point of wanting to kill myself .... Every
time I swallowed a piece of food I would experience an excruciating
burning nauseous pain in the upper part of my stomach lining."</TE>
<TE>   He goes on to describe the 10 gastrointestinal procedures that he
had since the start of this disorder, the 15 doctors he consulted and
the 50 types of ulcer medication he has taken. "The only thing I
found that works was heavy opiates," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   This stomach illness, which he describes in another diary with
less dramatic symptoms, remained uncured and a problem until his
suicide. From this period of daily use, he goes on to say, touring in
any country where he could not score seemed impossible, so he would
detox and deal with the stomach ailment. At one point, down to 110
pounds and unable to eat, he found an experimental drug that
alleviated the pain for nine months with no opiate side effects. Soon
afterward, however, he slipped back into a desire to curtail the
burning in his mind as well as his stomach and returned to heroin.</TE>
<TE>   I doubt if he read many books. He was sadly unworldly, painfully
shy and filled with self-loathing. Cobain despised the hippies for
not succeeding in their original revolutionary mission, as if his
generation was entitled to be born into an idyllic world. This, of
course, has been the complaint of many generations before, but it's a
bit shocking when you realize that a man capable of such musical
genius could be so naive and, at times, sniveling. Even here,
however, his authenticity comes through. No matter how juvenile,
querulous or brilliant, it's impossible to find any lacuna between
the writings and their writer.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most telling pages comes toward the end of the book,
although it seems like something written much earlier:</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, I played the snare drum in school band from grades five to
nine. during this time I didn't bother learning how to read sheet
music, I just waited for the geek in first chair to learn each song,
then I simply copied him. I managed to do well without ever having to
read music. It took me 5 years to realize how rhythmically retarded I
was as a drummer, so I sold some of my father's guns then used the
money to purchase my first six string electric guitar. I learned
everything I needed to know from one week of lessons which resulted
in the famous musical knowledge of the louie, louie chords E A B."</TE>
<TE>   The irony of young Kurt selling his father's guns to get the money
for his first guitar is obvious and unsettling. In fact, the reader
will find a number of passages in this book that are either ironic or
prescient of his death. That's strange because Cobain himself, at
least judging from these writings, had a damaging paucity of irony
and, more so, humor. The book's nearly complete lack of the latter
may be the saddest thing about it, and about him, for that matter. If
Cobain could have filtered his many grievances, justified or
imagined, through some notion of humor, maybe he could have avoided
trading in his guitars for a shotgun.</TE>

<HD>Gossip from the War Room</HD>
<DH>Bush at War Bob Woodward Simon &amp; Schuster: 378 pp., $28</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edward N. Luttwak</AU>
<BD>Edward N. Luttwak is a senior fellow at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. He is the author of numerous
books, including "Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone understands why foreign policy should often be made in
secret: If baddies overseas are involved, as they often are, it is
not a good idea to give them intelligence of forthcoming moves. Yet
at the same time it is almost universally agreed (sitting presidents
beg to differ) that the American people have a right to know how the
great decisions of war and peace are made in Washington, even if
important secrets are sometimes revealed. Many newspaper reporters
strive to find out who said what before this or that was decided, but
Bob Woodward has made it his full-time business, periodically
publishing book-length accounts compounded out of interviews with all
the significant participants who were willing at the time to be
interviewed by him.</LD>
<LD>   Now we have his latest, "Bush at War," starting from the intense
trauma of Sept. 11 and ending somewhat inconclusively with the
unresolved question of Iraq, still the subject of vehement debate
inside the Bush administration. Foreign policy is a worthy subject of
serious reflection, but most of us are unworthy enough to be
interested not only in the process but also in the people ("Gentlemen
talk about things, servants talk about people," was the Victorian
reprimand). Woodward satisfies our craving, never letting the issues
of foreign policy get in the way as he concentrates on the cast of
characters.</LD>
<TE>   In his version, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld is
arrogant to the point of treating the most senior generals as office
boys, an egomaniac who understands nothing but the "wanton" use of
force, even to change regimes, in Iraq for example. Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell, on the other hand, is wise and considerate,
the man who single-handedly ensures allied support for American
purposes with his superb and patient diplomacy. Guess who of the two
talked to Woodward?</TE>
<TE>   As for President Bush, he too talked with Woodward, knowing that
Powell would otherwise write his own version of instant history, as
he did in Woodward's book on the 1991 Gulf War, casting himself as
the politically correct hero of cautious restraint in contrast to an
impulsive George Bush senior. Thus in Woodward's latest, we are given
a George W. who is very different from the simplistic, indeed
downright foolish, warmonger featured every day in the world media
and in the diplomatic chatter of foreign ministries. He is a
president firmly in control of his government, including the
Pentagon's civilian hawks, a president who successfully mediates the
contending forces around the United States and not merely the
conflicting opinions of his advisors.</TE>
<TE>   Woodward's method, such as it is, has produced a systematically
biased book, the product of a type of journalism that virtually
amounts to tacit blackmail: Talk to me, spill your share of secrets
-- or at least your personal touchy-feely confidences -- or I will
cast you as the villain. So systematic is the bias that it extends
down to the second level of government in which, for example, Richard
L. Armitage, Powell's deputy secretary and a Woodward source, appears
as an extraordinarily modest man who merely wants to serve his boss
and must be compelled to appear on television news programs (true
enough), while Paul D. Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld's deputy secretary and not
a Woodward source, shows up at meetings meant for "principals" only
and speaks out of turn, so that he has to be told to shut up by the
president's chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr. Even entire
institutions can be beneficiaries of Woodward's indulgence with his
sources: George J. Tenet, head of the CIA, was obviously one of them,
and the result is that the book sustains the CIA's delusion of
adequacy -- grandeur would be a bit much -- even while unwittingly
providing plenty of contrary evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Woodward reveals the CIA's Operation GE/SENIORS obviously without
realizing that it was a ludicrous exercise in futility: Thirty Afghan
agents were paid $10,000 per month to track Osama bin Laden,
miraculously doing so to the point of perfection ("the Seniors seemed
to have him located most of the time") yet somehow never able to
inform headquarters quickly enough to allow the launch of cruise
missiles from submarines offshore. We now know, however, that Bin
Laden lived a remarkably normal family life in the Taliban's
Afghanistan, surrounded by the wives, children and servants of his
large household, hardly the elusive fugitive he has now become. What
made the operation ludicrous was, of course, the absence of a CIA
officer on the scene to remind the brave 30 of their duties. This has
been a constant of CIA operations in dangerous territory for many
years: the agency's intelligence officers are just that, analysts,
while its operations people are remarkably unoperational. Tenet
himself has done much to change this, reviving the almost defunct
"paramilitary" subset of the operations' directorate, but a culture
of risk-avoidance is not easily changed.</TE>
<TE>   Woodward's failure to recognize self-serving bureaucracies when he
sees them is apparent in his account of the "combat search and
rescue" issue that delayed the start of the bombing of Afghanistan
for two weeks. It refers to the helicopter units that lift downed
pilots parachuted into enemy-held territory to safety. Military
chiefs insisted that combat search and rescue units had to be ready
for action in nearby Uzbekistan before they would allow manned
aircraft to bomb Afghanistan. Never mind that the Taliban had no
integrated air defenses with netted radar to aim missiles and guns.
Never mind that they had very few antiaircraft guns and hardly any
missiles in any case.</TE>
<TE>   In the end it was the "hip-shooter" Rumsfeld and his hawkish
civilian aides who ensured the swift and elegant defeat of the
Taliban by rejecting the conventional slow buildup-large force
methods favored by most of the top military chiefs. Rumsfeld instead
backed the novel combination of U.S. Special Operations forces and
CIA paramilitaries with as much use of precision air power as
Afghanistan's poverty in useful targets would allow. U.S. troopers on
the ground quickly energized the Tadjiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras of the
Northern Alliance to attack the Taliban with real conviction not only
because of their magical ability to direct airstrikes with great
precision but also because they fought like the skilled and brave
warriors they are, attracting the admiration of the Afghans as well.</TE>
<TE>   Air-ground operations in Afghanistan quite unexpectedly validated
the new style of "network-centric" warfare that Rumsfeld has been
trying to propagate in the Pentagon from his first days in office. It
evoked -- and still does -- the vehement opposition of most top
generals, who naturally favor conventional methods and the big
battalions. It is they who are now calling for 250,000 soldiers if
there is a war against Iraq, in contrast to the smaller and more
agile force that Rumsfeld evidently favors, though in a desert war
against a large army, even lighter, swifter forces must include
hundreds of battle tanks and all that goes with them.</TE>
<TE>   The debate on the most effective operational method for defeating
Saddam Hussein, therefore, continues, as does the debate over the
role of Colin Powell in this conflict. He is both the secretary of
State who urges diplomacy first and foremost at every juncture -- as
indeed he should -- and the ex-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
who keeps in touch with his military friends still in uniform, who
have their own ways of resisting Rumsfeld's alarming innovations and
impatience to act. Even in the annals of Washington intrigue, this
"triangulation" around the Pentagon's civilian leadership -- indeed
the very principle of civilian control -- is unprecedented and adds
to the burden on National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, her
deputy Stephen Hadley and Vice President Dick Cheney as they strive
to keep the "decision making process" in some sort of balance. In
that task, Rice does not need Woodward's benevolence: It is
universally agreed in Washington that she really does perform her
duties as the president's national security advisor. Which is, of
course, no more than her job description -- except that most of her
predecessors preferred to usurp the roles of the secretary of State
or secretary of Defense, or both, serving their presidents much less
well in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Woodward's reporting of these machinations is nothing more than
high-level gossip about meetings about war and foreign policy rather
than the substance of either. It is pretty clear from all his
writings that Woodward is simply not interested in foreign affairs as
such. The result is that whenever he must mention other countries,
other cultures, foreign leaders or their doings, Woodward's comments
reveal an amazing degree of plain ignorance as soon as they extend
beyond mere banalities. Nobody has told him, for example, that the
perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks and of many lesser attacks since
then were not orthodox, traditional Muslims at all -- or just
Muslims, to keep things simple -- but rather followers of the extreme
and once very small Salafist (or Wahhabi) sect of Islam, which has
only very recently been propagated around the world by the schools
and mosques funded by the Saudi ruling family and its favored
businessmen, like the Bin Ladens.</TE>
<TE>   Lacking this bit of information, Woodward cannot explain why Bush
completely disregards the potentially catastrophic repercussions on
the Saudi rulers of any war against Iraq, in contrast to Bush senior,
who viewed them as precious allies (as his former advisors still do,
judging by their TV appearances). Because he knows little of their
substance and cares less, Woodward's reporting of the difficult and
nuanced discussions that drive the decisions of war and diplomacy is
not only incomplete but also badly distorted. Woodward's tales of
white hats and black hats do not begin to tell us the real story.</TE>

<HD>Divided loyalties on the eve of war</HD>
<DH>December 6 A Novel Martin Cruz Smith Simon &amp; Schuster: 340
pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Harris</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martin Cruz Smith's readers have come to expect vivid prose, engaging
characters and meticulous research into the settings of his thrillers
-- Russia in "Gorky Park," Cuba in "Havana Bay." They won't be
disappointed by "December 6," set in Tokyo on the eve of the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.</LD>
<LD>   Smith's hero, Harry Niles, is the son of missionaries who grows up
in Japan, absorbs its culture and speaks its language -- but, because
he is a gaijin, or foreigner, he never quite fits in. In school, when
his fellow students drill with wooden bayonets, Harry is used as a
target. He becomes a consummate survivor.</LD>
<LD>   Harry is embarrassed by his parents, who are self-righteous and
smugly ignorant of the Japanese they aim to convert. Visits to
America leave him feeling no less an outsider. As a boy, he seeks out
other marginal people and finds them in Tokyo's colorful Asakusa
district: theater managers, chorus girls, yakuza (organized-crime
figures) and gamblers.</LD>
<TE>   By the time "December 6" opens, Harry is 30 and renowned both for
his slick business dealings and his cynicism. He owns a nightclub,
the Happy Paris, where one of his two mistresses, a former geisha and
communist agitator named Michiko, is the star. His other mistress,
Alice Beechum, is the wife of a British diplomat. Harry's friends in
high places include Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto, a sometime poker partner
who is planning to bomb Pearl Harbor. Yamamoto, aware of America's
superior industrial capacity, is reluctant to go to war. Japan is
short of oil because of a U.S. embargo. For an attack on Pearl Harbor
to at least temporarily even the odds, the Japanese must blow up the
naval oil storage tanks there. Harry concocts a scheme to make the
Japanese high command worry that some tanks remain hidden.
Uncertainty, he hopes, will cause more delay.</TE>
<TE>   Harry's reward for trying to preserve peace between his two
countries is the distrust of both. The U.S. Embassy crosses him off
its list of people to evacuate. Japanese police tail him everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Colonel Ishigami, an army officer who lost face when Harry,
dealing in black-market goods in China, rescued several Chinese
captives that Ishigami was about to behead with a samurai sword
during the Rape of Nanking, is back in Tokyo and itching for revenge.
Hardly less to be feared is Michiko, who suspects that Harry is
skipping town (in fact, he plans to flee with Alice) and would rather
kill him than let him go.</TE>
<TE>   Smith can't change history. We know what happened at Pearl Harbor,
and how the war would end. To maintain suspense, he creates
converging plot lines. The chapters set in late 1941 alternate with
flashbacks into Harry's past. We see him become a man of divided
national and romantic loyalties, an ostentatious tough guy, a closet
humanitarian. On Dec. 6, he has to choose -- or so it seems.</TE>
<TE>   Like Junichiro Tanizaki, whose "The Makioka Sisters" lovingly
chronicles life in Osaka up until the moment the bombs begin to fall,
Smith re-creates a world of wood-and-paper houses, of bittersweet
romance, of artistic freedom, that is doomed by Japanese militarism
and American incendiaries alike. Harry has seen Tokyo burn after the
great earthquake of 1923. He knows that the city -- that all of Japan
-- is just tinder waiting to be lighted.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's portrait of this time and place, as with Tanizaki's, is
stunningly detailed. It's hard to imagine that he could pack any more
information about prewar Japan into a 340-page thriller. The
difference is that Tanizaki relaxed and made his characters
universal. Smith stuffs his characters so full of national traits of
one kind or another that there's no room for anything else.</TE>
<TE>   Thrillers, after all, have limitations -- even accomplished
examples such as this one. Harry is complex, but he also has to be a
hero, cool, quick-witted and irresistible to women. His foresight,
like our hindsight, is 20-20. He's sure how the war will end before
it starts, whereas in real life, few on either side of the Pacific
could have had that much certitude, come Dec. 7.</TE>

<DH>Nothing That Meets the Eye The Uncollected Stories of
Patricia Highsmith Patricia Highsmith W.W. Norton: 456 pp., $27.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charlotte Innes</AU>
<BD>Charlotte Innes is a critic and essayist who is an
occasional contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sculptor is sick of his wife's being the perfect wife and mother.
She's given up her art for him. She cooks. She takes care of their
baby. She's happy. Despite his urging, she won't even have an affair.
So he kills her. For being too nice. And then he kills himself. By
bashing his head against his jail cell wall.</LD>
<LD>   This melodramatic reversal of the usual
man-threatened-by-wife's-career theme is as contrived as it sounds.
And yet, somewhere in the midst of the contrivance, one gets a little
chill. One starts to think about love and all its delusions, about
marriage and how hard it can be, about the way love can die slowly,
almost imperceptibly, and how life is filled with losses -- until one
is just about ready to do oneself in.</LD>
<LD>   That's the Patricia Highsmith effect, as demonstrated in "Things
Had Gone Badly," one of 26 stories in "Nothing That Meets the Eye," a
posthumous collection of Highsmith's short stories. Not previously
collected (or in some cases never before published) and spanning 1938
to 1982 (she died in 1995), these stories are classic Highsmith fare.</LD>
<TE>   Not all of them succeed. Some of the narrative tricks are too
obviously manipulative, and there are just too many stories that end
abruptly and unconvincingly in suicide. Perhaps that's why Highsmith
held some of them back from publication. Nevertheless, whatever their
flaws, they all have the Highsmith magical narrative pull. One wants
to keep reading, even when the payoff isn't as strong as it could be,
because, however artificial the plot, there is usually a nugget of
bitter truth at its heart. Highsmith understood the psychology of
people's darker urges.</TE>
<TE>   It's startling to realize that some of these stories were written
while she was still at Barnard College at New York and, though they
may lack the fluency and the light sardonic humor of some of her
later work, they are nevertheless extraordinarily accomplished. All
the noir themes that characterize her great novels, such as "The
Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Strangers on a Train," are here. There are
stories about bad marriages, loneliness, madness, murder, the
emptiness of modern life, told with typical Highsmith wit or,
occasionally, with a kind of spare, unsentimental lyricism, proving
yet again the long-standing critical mantra that Highsmith is Not
Just A Genre Writer.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the critical acclaim is that Highsmith doesn't
write typical murder mystery stories. Her heroes often get away with
their dastardly deeds and manage to be simultaneously appalling and
likable (Mr. Ripley being the most famous and perhaps most convincing
example). In contrast to the feel-good narratives of lesser literary
thrillers in which good triumphs over evil, Highsmith's novels are
vehicles to explore the dark side of the human psyche -- the urge to
do violence that most people occasionally think about but never
pursue. And the murders in her books are the logical outcome of the
kind of contorted thinking that hampers everyone from time to time,
prompting people to make odd choices that in saner moments they might
reject.</TE>
<TE>   There are similar psychologically truthful murder stories in
"Nothing That Meets the Eye," even though, along with most of her
previously published short stories, they lack the complexity of her
novels. Usually, the stories' originality comes in the form of a
clever twist. In "It's a Deal," a man kills his wife, who's already
been beaten nearly to death by her lover. The husband just finishes
her off, then frames the lover. In "The Second Cigarette," a man's
subconscious self materializes to taunt him. When the man tries to
throw the annoying shadow off a balcony, the shadow throws him off
instead, suggesting that, in fact, the man wants to kill himself.</TE>
<TE>   These murder stories are tinged with the kind of irony that is
Highsmith's trademark in story collections such as "The
Animal-Lover's Book of Beastly Murder," in which animals get their
revenge on humans. In "Music to Die By," a story in this new
collection, a post office employee fantasizes about murdering his
colleagues. When he confesses to the bombing of a post office where
he used to work, he is imprisoned (even though he didn't do it)
because people believe he is crazy enough to have committed the
crime.</TE>
<TE>   What's different about "Nothing That Meets the Eye," however, is
that the majority of the stories do not involve a murder. Suicide and
accidental death, yes, but not murder. In the book's afterword,
German critic Paul Ingendaay suggests that Highsmith may not have
attempted to publish some of her earlier work because it didn't have
the commercial allure of a suspense story. And it's true that these
stories focus more on ordinary yearnings and disappointments, such as
the loneliness of a working woman in New York City in "Where the Door
Is Always Open and the Welcome Mat Is Out" or a woman's depression
and alienation when she marries a Mexican hotel manager in "The Car."
(Though Highsmith was an American who lived most of her life in
England and Switzerland, she took many trips to Mexico. A sense of
displacement is a common theme in her work.) Many of these stories
also feature female protagonists, which is unusual for Highsmith.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, she said she preferred writing about men because
they were more active and therefore more interesting than women. And
she has been criticized for her negative portrayals of women in, for
example, her collection of short stories, "Little Tales of Misogyny,"
in which each heroine represents a female stereotype -- although, as
some critics have pointed out, these stories may also be seen as
satire. Highsmith also was a product of the conservative 1940s and
'50s. But she didn't always fall in with traditional views. The one
early book with sympathetic heroines and a happy ending was "The
Price of Salt," about a lesbian relationship, which she published in
1952 under the pseudonym Claire Morgan. Highsmith was a lesbian who
didn't want to be typecast as a lesbian writer. But in 1991, the
novel was reprinted in England under her own name with the title
"Carol."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the women in "The Price of Salt," career women who
found love and happiness, most of the women in "Nothing That Meets
the Eye" are victims, reflecting Highsmith's belief that women are
"pushed by people and circumstances instead of pushing," as she put
it in her nonfiction work "Plotting and Writing Suspense Fiction"
(1966). Her heroines in the short stories are bitter, unhappy women,
including the nagging mother in "A Girl Like Phyl" or the childlike
hypochondriac Agnes in "The Pianos of the Steinachs" whose only
happiness comes from a fantasy that a visiting music student is in
love with her.</TE>
<TE>   At best, the women in these stories are bored housewives cheating
on their husbands. The overtly good women are locked into classic
sacrificial female gestures. Dying Mrs. Palmer in "The Trouble With
Mrs. Blynn, the Trouble With the World" selflessly decides to give
her treasured amethyst pin to the mean-spirited nurse who covets it,
in protest against life's "flaw," the "long, mistaken shutting of the
heart." Or they are given the traditional reward for stereotypical
female virtues. The working woman in "Doorbell for Louisa" stays home
from work to take care of some sick neighbors and is subsequently
asked out on a date by her boss, who misses her presence at work.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, the men in "Nothing That Meets the Eye" don't hold up
too well either. Many also suffer loneliness and disappointment. Many
cheat and lie. And there's at least one child molester, possibly two,
if one reads between the lines. But when men are rewarded in these
stories, they, unlike the women, undergo an affirmation of self. In
"Man's Best Friend," a man who idolizes a woman who's not quite the
goddess he thought learns that he can live happily alone with his
dog. And men's kindnesses are not quite so saintly as the women's. In
"A Bird in Hand," a man makes his living off reward money for
returning missing birds to their owners -- not the actual birds but
similar-looking ones he has bought at a pet store. Yet he is seen by
his victims as a sort of Santa Claus, spreading kindness throughout
the world, even though they are on to his game.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever one makes of Highsmith's biases -- and I confess I have a
built-in antipathy for writers who see the world in such a lopsided,
cynical fashion, as a dark place where meanness and manipulation are
the dominant emotions -- there's no doubt that this new collection,
however uneven, reminds us that Highsmith was a literary artist who
was so accomplished she could seduce the reader even with work that
was less than her best.</TE>

<HD>How to describe poet James Merrill?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only a serious misreading could allow Caroline Fraser -- in her
review of "Collected Novels and Plays" by James Merrill (Book Review,
Nov. 10) -- to suggest that, in writing about Merrill in the New
Republic, I "dismissed" his poetry or "defamed" his "homosexuality
and wealth." In fact, I wrote that "there was no American poet more
artistically serious than Merrill" and that he was "one of the finest
American poets of the last half-century." The point of my essay,
which was a lengthy and detailed study of his work (and not, like
Fraser's review, a summary of his life), was that Merrill's
aestheticism, his concern with surfaces, was the key to his
accomplishment, and therefore also to its limits. I do not see how
words like "aesthete" could be avoided in discussing Merrill's
poetry. Above all, I reject with indignation Fraser's offensive and
ludicrous suggestion that this was a coded slur directed at a poet
whom I admire very much.</LD>
<LD>   Adam Kirsch</LD>
<LD>   New York</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Caroline Fraser replies:</TE>
<TE>   Adam Kirsch can't have it both ways. Whether he admires Merrill or
not, his descriptions -- which certainly are lengthy -- trivialize
and dismiss Merrill's work as that of "a serious poet whose language
outstrips what he has to say" and one whose "major work was left
unwritten." The fact that Kirsch contradicts himself -- praising
Merrill's achievement while criticizing his "superficiality" -- is
not my fault; it's his. As for those slurs, Merrill possessed an
uncanny ear for nuances of language, and he deserves better than to
be denigrated by critics tone-deaf to the implications of the diction
they have chosen to employ.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Cockburn's usually perceptive article about the impending
war with Iraq (Book Review, Nov. 3) is marred by two erroneous
details about the company I work for, Hill &amp; Knowlton. We had no hand
in thinking up the congressional hearing to which he referred, at
which a witness testified to seeing Iraqi soldiers come into the
hospital where she worked and remove an incubator after first leaving
the baby in it on the floor. That Iraqi soldiers did indeed take
babies from incubators and then pack up the incubators to go to Iraq
has since been verified by, among others, the world's leading
investigative agency, three major wire services and the U.S. Army.
The witness was the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the U.S.,
who asked that her identity not be revealed publicly, although it was
readily available from the committee's witness list.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Mankiewicz</TE>
<TE>   Vice chairman</TE>
<TE>   Hill &amp; Knowlton</TE>
<TE>   Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Cockburn replies:</TE>
<TE>   Frank Mankiewicz would apparently have us believe that his firm
had nothing to do with the myth of Kuwaiti babies tossed out of their
hospital incubators by fiendish Iraqis, and even that this legend had
some basis in fact. History indicates otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990 Hill &amp; Knowlton was on retainer from Citizens for a Free
Kuwait, a front for the Kuwaiti government, to win U.S. public
support for war with Iraq. In this capacity the firm, according to
"Second Front," John MacArthur's authoritative book on propaganda in
the Gulf War, arranged for the Kuwaiti ambassador's 15-year-old
daughter, Nayirah, to testify in front of a congressional panel in
October 1990 that she had personally seen Iraqi soldiers decant at
least 15 babies from their incubators in a Kuwait hospital, leaving
them "on the cold floor to die." Nayirah's full name and family
connections were certainly unknown to observers at the hearing,
including co-chairman Congressman John Porter, not to mention the
many media organizations to whom Hill &amp; Knowlton speedily relayed her
colorful and, as it subsequently emerged, fictitious testimony.</TE>
<TE>   The "world's leading investigative agency" cited as having
confirmed the story would be Kroll and Associates, paid by the
government of Kuwait to prepare its report. Kroll claimed to have
found witnesses to one incident in which babies were removed from
incubators but produced no evidence to this effect. So far as I can
establish, the U.S. Army and wire service reports cited by Mankiewicz
were drawing on the fruits of Kroll's labors.</TE>
<TE>   Following the Gulf War the alleged atrocity was thoroughly
investigated by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, as well
as various news organizations. Eyewitnesses interviewed by ABC News,
including the director of Kuwait's primary health-care system and the
chief of obstetrics at the maternity hospital, stated that the story
was not true. Human Rights Watch called it a "complete hoax."</TE>
<TE>   Several senators cited the tale of the incubator atrocity as the
decisive factor influencing their vote in favor of war with Iraq. A
powerful myth indeed.</TE>

<TE>   A good short crime story is like a "knocked back cocktail," James
Ellroy tells us in his typically jazzy introduction to "The Best
American Mystery Stories 2002." "It hits strong, it's over quick, it
induces heat and lingers when it's done." A sampling of the 20 tales
that he and Otto Penzler consider the best of last year's crop tends
to back up that analogy. Imbibing Michael Malone's darkly funny
Southern gothic tale "Maniac Loose," or the Brendan Dubois entry that
pits a Little League coach with a dark past against an abrasive
baseball dad, or Joyce Carol Oates' chilling exploration of the mind
of a suspense writer can be a heady experience.</TE>
<TE>   That the book features recent work by these and other bestselling
novelists, such as Robert B. Parker and Michael Connelly, is an
indication that the mystery short story, which had been drifting in
the direction of such infrequently employed literary formats as the
epic poem or the novel of whimsy, has returned to prominence with a
vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the form's descent into the maelstrom had been the
decline of fiction-bearing magazines. Its recent rebirth (the
Amazon.com Web site lists more than 1,200 crime story collections)
has been largely due to a cadre of anthologists who have proved to
publishers' satisfaction that groupings of original short works can
turn a profit.</TE>
<TE>   Chief among them are the aforementioned bookman-essayist Penzler;
the ubiquitous Martin H. Greenberg, a co-editor of countless
anthologies (more than 100 since 1990); his frequent cohort in
crime-editing, novelist Ed Gorman; Robert Randisi, whose compilations
usually feature members of the Private Eye Writers of America, an
organization he founded; and Marilyn Wallace, the primary editor of
what has become a continuing series of collections by the members of
Sisters in Crime.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of these anthologies depends heavily on the participation
of famous authors whom the editors are able to intrigue or cajole or
guilt-trip into trying their hands at the short form for considerably
shortened monetary compensation. A prime example is Elizabeth George,
the popular Orange County author whose novels set in England usually
run to 400-plus pages. She was moved to minimize by an invitation to
contribute to the second Sisters in Crime anthology. The result,
reworked and renamed "Exposure," is one of five novellas that
constitute her new book, "I, Richard."</TE>
<TE>   In spite of an ominous night-on-the-moors dust jacket, several of
the quintet are surprisingly light in tone, satirically skewering a
variety of unpleasant types while paying homage to time-honored plot
devices. There's a whodunit enhanced by her series hero Thomas Lynley
and a smattering of British architecture history, a horror story
involving rodents, the chronicle of a widow's reaction to the
surfacing of secrets from her late husband's past and two accounts of
wannabe perfect murderers on the way to their inevitable
comeuppances. As engaging as George's writing is, these tales all
seem a bit too familiar. You half expect them to lead into the
black-and-white appearance of Alfred Hitchcock delivering a closing
quip.</TE>
<TE>   Though George's shorter works were written after she had
established her bestseller bona fides, the bulk of the 84 stories in
Lawrence Block's "Enough Rope" were penned before and during his rise
to prominence. Among them you will find surprise endings ("Sometimes
They Bite"), playful riffs on suspense conventions ("Strangers on a
Handball Court"), even twisted shaggy dog stories ("One Thousand
Dollars a Word").</TE>
<TE>   Most of the author's popular protagonists are present, including
the cheery but sinister defense attorney Martin Ehrengraf (with 10
successful cases); Bernie Rhodenbarr, who finances his used bookstore
with burglaries (three thefts here, including a classic involving
Elvis Presley's revered homestead); the wistful assassin Keller (five
hits); and, best of all, Block's pensive private eye Matthew Scudder
(with nine superb sleuthings).</TE>
<TE>   It is a bit of a leap from Block's tales to "Tart Noir" with its
martini and stiletto heel-bedecked cover. Edited by British authors
Stella Duffy and Lauren Henderson, the book promises entries
featuring "20 edgy, outrageous, and badly behaved heroines." Janet
Evanovich's Stephanie Plum would seem to be the exemplar for this
group, but, alas, she is a noticeable absentee. And in fact, these
tarts may be bold and brassy, but they're not having much fun. By and
large, they're angry, resentful and/or homicidal and their stories,
while rich in attitude, are generally lacking in style or substance.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few exceptions. Jenny Colgan has delivered a stirring
action-adventure yarn in which an administrative assistant in
Britain's secret service takes "The Wrong Train" in the London
Underground. Lauren Henderson extracts every bit of amusement from
Lady Macbeth, Medea and Phaedra discussing their dysfunctional
families on a confessional TV show. And Laura Lippman comes through
with a shrewdly satirical tale of a woman seeking surcease from the
smothering effect of an over-possessive husband.</TE>
<TE>   The selections in the Southern California Sisters in Crime
concoction, "Murder on Sunset Boulevard," provide much better measure
for measure. The authors' use of this city's famously noir boulevard
is generally imaginative and organic to plots that are properly dark
and satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the short story's heyday, a collection devoted to humorous
crime was a rarity. It is further evidence of the format's revival
that three are currently available. "Murder, Mystery and Malone" by
Craig Rice and "Hildegarde Withers: Uncollected Riddles" by Stuart
Palmer are the latest trade paperbacks in publisher Crippen &amp;
Landru's "Lost Classics Series." Not only do they demonstrate how
charming, funny and durable the short form can be, they call
attention to two wonderful but nearly forgotten characters from the
genre's past.</TE>
<TE>   The often besotted but never less than brilliant Chicago criminal
lawyer John J. Malone was popular enough in his day to land his
author on the cover of Time magazine. Withers, the acerbic
schoolteacher who can't keep her nose out of murder, served as the
subject of several movies and at least two television pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer's previously uncollected Withers "Riddles" date to the
1930s -- little gems of wit and deduction set in Manhattan in the
midst of the Great Depression. The stories in "Murder, Mystery and
Malone" are from the 1950s, Rice's final decade. Though suffering
from depression, alcoholism and neurological disorders, she somehow
was able to produce these effervescent, unique, beautifully crafted
wonders. She also had a little help. The publisher made a
post-publication discovery: One of the stories in the collection was
ghost-written by Lawrence Block. It's offering a free book from its
list to the first reader who can sift out the pseudo Rice.</TE>
<TE>   The third new book of comic crime stories, John Mortimer's
"Rumpole Rests His Case," finds the grumpy, rumpled barrister
continuing to mock the British legal system while railing against
snobbery, fads and the sort of politically correct small-mindedness
that forces him to leave his chambers to enjoy a mid-afternoon
stogie.</TE>
<TE>   Horace Rumpole's international fame probably stems from his
television adventures (on PBS' "Mystery!" series). However, the
courageous curmudgeon is just as entertaining on the page, a point
underscored by the fact that his courtroom capers now fill 12
volumes. Leo McKern, the actor who perfectly embodied the character
for more than 20 years, passed away recently, and the new
collection's title and final story suggest that Rumpole may be
following his example.</TE>
<TE>   But fans shouldn't approach the book fearing the beloved
barrister's mortal farewell. Though the series' literary future seems
doubtful, Mortimer is too wily a wordsmith to cancel all options.
Especially when Rumpole's favorite format seems to be on the upswing.</TE>

<HD>The flowering of artistic activism</HD>
<DH>Chicano Visions American Painters on the Verge Cheech Marin
Bulfinch Press: 160 pp., $19.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert J. Lopez</AU>
<BD>Robert J. Lopez is a Times staff writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a seminal essay published shortly before his death in 1970, Los
Angeles Times columnist Ruben Salazar asked: "Who is a Chicano? And
what is it the Chicanos want?" It was a time when tens of thousands
of Mexican Americans, fueled by anger and a newfound sense of
cultural and political awareness, waged open rebellion against a
system that for generations had repressed and marginalized them.</LD>
<LD>   Across the Southwest, these Chicano activists were demanding
better educational opportunities, a respect for civil rights and an
end to the war in Vietnam, where Mexican Americans were dying in
disproportionate numbers.</LD>
<LD>   It was amid this political backdrop that Chicano art was born.
Whether painting symbols of solidarity on walls and banners or
entertaining striking farm workers with one-act plays, these
artist-activists helped define the diverse Chicano experience. They
illustrated the triumphs, frustrations and aspirations of a
little-understood yet significant part of the American cultural
fabric. In essence, their art helped answer the question posed by
Salazar and illuminate through pictures and performances what the
newsman tried to articulate in his writings.</LD>
<TE>   Now, more than 30 years later, the works of some of the country's
preeminent Chicano painters, their artistic roots tracing back to the
Mexican American civil rights struggle, are featured in Cheech
Marin's "Chicano Visions." Known best for his acting and
counterculture comedy performances, Marin also is the owner of one of
the largest private collections of Chicano art. The book, a
coffee-table complement to a nationwide tour highlighting pieces from
Marin's collection, is a portfolio of 96 dynamic and sometimes
poignant paintings from more than two dozen artists. Accompanying the
works is a series of essays by Chicano scholars explaining the
historic, cultural and social underpinnings of the art.</TE>
<TE>   One can criticize "Chicano Visions" for narrowly focusing on
images that fail to capture the full breadth of this vibrant
community. Numerous pieces, for instance, depict aspects of typical
barrio life. Little in the book enlightens us about an entire
generation of Chicanos -- doctors, lawyers, engineers, journalists
and others -- who have integrated into the mainstream. Also absent
are paintings from the civil rights era that spawned the works, a
curious omission given the inextricable link between the two.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the notion of being Chicano also can be as diverse as
the places where Chicanos are found. Growing up in Cesar Chavez's
Central Valley town of Delano is a world apart from being raised in
the barrio on San Antonio's west side. Yet we all share common
historic and cultural bonds, many of which are highlighted by the
paintings in the book.</TE>
<TE>   The featured painters -- ranging from such pioneers as Carlos
Almaraz, Frank Romero and Patssi Valdez to relative newcomers like
Vincent Valdez -- draw upon the influences of impressionism and
expressionism, as well as that of pre-Columbian symbols, religious
icons and the Mexican mural movement. Through their works, we learn
of a culture steeped in the Catholic faith. We experience the
realities of racism and police abuse. We come to understand the
importance of family and tradition. And we see the less-flattering
aspects of machismo and gang violence.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to the sociopolitical upheaval of the 1960s and early '70s,
Mexican Americans by and large accepted their place in society. A
notable exception were the pachucos of the 1940s, who were
immortalized some 35 years later in "Zoot Suit," an acclaimed play
and later a film by Chicano writer and director Luis Valdez. With
their wide-brimmed hats, long hair and baggy, colorful zoot suits,
the pachucos thumbed their noses at convention. But they paid dearly.
In 1943, encouraged by a wave of sensational media coverage, U.S.
servicemen cruised the streets of Los Angeles, beating the zoot
suiters with bats, fists and other weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The violence is captured in vivid detail in "Kill the Pachuco
Bastard!" (2001), one of the showcased paintings by Vincent Valdez.
The central figure in this barroom free-for-all is a fedora-wearing
pachuco, his nose and arm bloodied as his fingers rip at the face of
a soldier wearing dog tags and holding a broken beer bottle. A woman,
blood dripping from her forehead, clutches a rosary and looks upward.
She's cradling a man. In the darkness, on a table, lies a copy of one
of the newspapers blamed for inciting the violence -- the Los Angeles
Times. The irony of the Zoot Suit Riots was that they occurred at a
time when Mexican Americans were distinguishing themselves in combat
overseas. A poster in the bar highlights this contradiction. Looking
on as the men and women are pummeled by soldiers, Uncle Sam
proclaims, "I Want You."</TE>
<TE>   The softer images of church and family are portrayed in Carmen
Lomas Garza's "Quinceanera" (2001). Using primary colors, she tells
the tale of a traditional rite of passage for many Mexican American
girls. The quinceanera, a celebration of a girl's 15th birthday, is
an elaborate church ceremony and reception in which her family
presents her to society as a woman. We see the young girl, in
headdress and white gown, driven to the front of the church.
Anxiously waiting are the boys and girls in the procession, with
tuxedos, pink dresses and white bouquets. The importance of family is
highlighted by the father, escorting his daughter, and by an elderly
grandmother tending to her granddaughter on the steps of the church.</TE>
<TE>   The book points out how many of these painters have largely
operated within an artistic vacuum. "With little commercial
encouragement," Marin writes, "these artists have struggled to gain
acceptance in the gallery world. Many painters show their works in
restaurants, coffeehouses, or wherever there is a wall or audience.
What matters is that they continue to create." Indeed, therein lies
the value of "Chicano Visions." It provides a platform for
accomplished artists who present a vibrant visual interpretation of
family, politics and spirituality from a unique cultural perspective.
Their works, along with the book's essays, are insightful and
thought-provoking and help promote a better understanding of the
Chicano experience.</TE>

<HD>Portrait of a father who won't give up</HD>
<DH>Born Twice A Novel Giuseppe Pontiggia  Translated from the
Italian by Oonagh Stransky Alfred A. Knopf: 198 pp., $23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas McGonigle</AU>
<BD>Thomas McGonigle is the author of "The Corpse Dream of
N. Petkov" and "Going to Patchogue."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the father of two children who were born healthy and who, in the
mystery of the phrase "God willing," have remained so, I began to
read respectfully and with foreboding attention the novel "Born
Twice" by Giuseppe Pontiggia. It is a fictionalized memoir, though
the fiction seems hard to find in a story with such idiosyncratic
authenticity as a father's coming to terms with his son's birth
condition, dystonic spastic quadriparesis, which causes him to lack
control of his limbs.</LD>
<LD>   Never mawkish or comforting, the story's protagonist, Professor
Frigerio, refreshingly avoids being a tower of strength or an
exemplary figure. Pontiggia throws the reader into Frigerio's
lifelong unrelenting situation as father to a child who will always
be different no matter how society changes or doesn't change. The
terrible truth begins from the first moment: "I can't remember now
who mentioned that the baby didn't cry right away.... I remember the
word: catatonic. The surgeon said it on his way out. The only
question you want to ask is the one they don't want to hear: what are
the consequences?"</LD>
<TE>   Despite the phony consolations of friends and relatives and the
obscurantism of most doctors, Frigerio holds to the words of one
doctor who foretold the situation of his son, Paolo: "The cerebral
lesions, though not deep, have damaged his language and motor skills.
The child will begin speaking late .... His motor skills will be
imperfect. His intelligence will be intact yet he will seem immature
because of his incomplete experience."</TE>
<TE>   Frigerio, recalling those words, wants to thank the doctor for
what he said next: "These children are born twice. They have to learn
to get by in a world that their first made difficult for them. Their
second birth depends on you.... Because they are born twice, their
journey through life is a far more agonizing one than most. Yet
ultimately the rebirth will be yours too."</TE>
<TE>   "Born Twice" focuses narrowly on the experiences of Frigerio (the
mother is off somewhere in the background), chronicling the endless
physical therapy, the sure necessary expectation that the son is more
than just his birth defect, the patient attention to teaching skills
that come so naturally to other children but not to Paolo. He battles
constantly with those who want to help but always on terms that never
put Paolo at the center.</TE>
<TE>   Because Frigerio is an observant teacher and is gifted with a real
sense of language, Pontiggia allows him some victories against the
so-called helping professionals. But the irony is ever present: What
if your father is not so gifted, so articulate? The horror is too
awful to contemplate, and the results are every day in our
newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Pontiggia is really interested, however, in something far more
suggestive and intangible than the conventional day-in, day-out
portrayal of a father dealing with his son's defect. At one point the
author deftly turns from Paolo to his father, who is trying to help
him with math. After an angry exchange with Paolo, who wants to give
up, Frigerio says: "I don't want to give up.... In life when there's
no alternative, we give up. A lot of people can't wait for anything
else. They live so that one day they can give up. There, I'm doing it
again. I magnify other people's shortcomings in order to minimize my
own. Why don't I give up? Is it because of me? 'No,' I say out loud,
'it's for him.' He looks at me: I'm talking to myself. No, I think to
myself, it's for me."</TE>
<TE>   As in Pontiggia's previous novel "The Invisible Player," which
concerned itself with a professor trying to identify an anonymous
attacker and the paradox that nothing is less mysterious than the
solution of a mystery, Pontiggia has taken the obvious in "Born
Twice" and created a novel in which a father is allowed a second
chance without sacrificing the dilemma and integrity of the child.
"People who see him for the first time are not always satisfied with
one glimpse," Frigerio says. "They have to stop and turn around and
look at him closer. He knows it when they do; I think he walks off
with a pained expression. But maybe not, maybe he's just being
careful. He's used to being watched. It's me who's relentless. It's
my face with the pained expression. That's what unites us, from a
distance."</TE>

<LD>The Moon</LD>
<LD>   and the Bonfires</LD>
<LD>   Cesare Pavese</LD>
<TE>   Translated from the Italian</TE>
<TE>   by R.W. Flint</TE>
<TE>   New York Review Books:</TE>
<TE>   154 pp., $12.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   In the 1930s, Cesare Pavese was exiled for anti-fascist activities
from his home in Italy's lower Piedmont to Calabria. He was an
America buff. He had written his thesis on Walt Whitman and
translated American classics for an Italian publisher. In "The Moon
and the Bonfires," his final novel (Pavese died four months after its
publication in 1950), Eel, now 40, returns after 20 years in America
to his childhood home in Italy. "It wasn't a country where you could
resign yourself, rest your head and say to others: 'For better or
worse, you know me. For better or worse, let me live.' That was the
frightening part. Even among themselves they didn't know each other,"
he thinks of America. Eel's friend Nuto knows that if you make a
bonfire on the edge of a field, you will get a better crop. He knows
that if you graft trees on the first days of the new moon, you will
get better fruit. These are things that Eel has forgotten during his
time in America.</TE>
<TE>   There are many postwar novels that are meditations on the idea of
home. From a distant perch, the smells and the feel of home are made
sharper, bigger than life. Like an old puzzle piece, a person's edges
crumple and crack so that they don't fit even when they go back. "The
world had changed me," he thinks, and perhaps not for the better.</TE>
<TE>   Amerika</TE>
<TE>   The Man Who Disappeared</TE>
<TE>   Franz Kafka</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the German</TE>
<TE>   by Michael Hofmann</TE>
<TE>   The New Press: 218 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   "Amerika" was written in 1914 and edited in 1927 by Kafka's
friend, Max Brod. It was translated the next year by Edwin Muir. The
author's original title for the book, "The Man Who Disappeared," was
dropped because Brod thought that this was a book about a place, a
mythical place, a faraway paradise for Europeans, who dreamed of it
the way Easterners in this country dream of the West.</TE>
<TE>   In Hofmann's translation, two previously unpublished sections have
been restored. His "Amerika" is more a book about a person. Karl
Rossmann is exiled to America by his parents, after he is wrongfully
accused of seducing a servant. The novel opens as the ship is docking
in New York harbor. Like most Kafka characters, Karl is drawn into a
whirlpool seemingly without a will of his own. Life propels him up
and down fortune's ladder, perhaps at a more reckless pace because
this is, after all, America, so that within a matter of weeks he
finds himself homeless, then working as a lift boy in a grand hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything that happened in the little smoke-filled compartment,"
thinks Karl, on a train bound for who knows where, "paled into
insignificance compared to what was outside."</TE>
<TE>   The Shaman's Coat</TE>
<TE>   A Native History of Siberia</TE>
<TE>   Anna Reid</TE>
<TE>   Walker &amp; Co.: 226 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   "The state of Siberian shamanism," writes Anna Reid, correspondent
for the Economist and the Daily Telegraph in England, "would be an
indicator of the extent to which the indigenous peoples had preserved
their identities under Russian rule. The tsars tried to replace
shamans with priests. The Communists ostracized and imprisoned them,
and under Stalin, shot them or threw them out of helicopters, saying
if they could fly, now was their chance." As a result, Reid finds
only scant evidence of shamanism in an area that is 1/12 of the
world's land mass, 5 million square miles, where, out of 32 million
people, only 1.6 million are indigenous.</TE>
<TE>   But what a journey. Reid tells the story of Siberia, itself a
movie peopled with wealthy boyars (the Stroganovs, who came to
Siberia for iron and ore), diamond plunderers (not unlike our
gold-rush pioneers), Khans (all magically related to Genghis),
pirates like Yermak (the Cossack version of Robin Hood). Perhaps Reid
only scratches the surface (how could it be otherwise?), but the
culture of shamanism lives, resplendent, beneath the gray villages.</TE>

<DH>Scars of the Spirit The Struggle Against Inauthenticity
Geoffrey Hartman Palgrave Macmillan: 280 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Merle Rubin</AU>
<BD>Merle Rubin is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We live in an age that hungers for authenticity. "Real" is one of our
favorite terms of approbation, and to call someone a "phony" is never
a compliment. Surrounded by ads, propaganda, double talk and
stimulation, we search for things, experiences and people that are
"authentic."</LD>
<LD>   But the quest for authenticity, Yale professor Geoffrey Hartman
warns, can be dangerous as well as desirable. Indeed, the very title
of his new book, "Scars of the Spirit," is a direct rebuttal to a
statement of Hegel's, quoted by Hartman in his epigraph: "The wounds
made by the spirit leave no scars."</LD>
<LD>   What is "authenticity" anyway? In his influential 1972 work,
"Sincerity and Authenticity," Lionel Trilling saw our modern idea of
the authentic as stemming from a Rousseauvian belief that the
strictures of civilization had alienated us from our true natures.
Out of this, eventually, came bizarre notions like R.D. Laing's
belief that sanity itself was a kind of straitjacket. Trilling found
in Freud's "Civilization and Its Discontents" a better, more complex
model of authenticity: one that involved recognizing our primal
instincts and the need for sublimating them.</LD>
<TE>   Hartman approaches the question from a different angle. He begins
by pointing out two meanings of "authentic," a word etymologically
linked to the notion of authority. Authenticity was once "the power,
legal or moral, vested in those who founded an institution or claimed
they were transmitting vital truths from an ancient source." Now, in
"nontheocratic societies," he notes, "authenticity ... signifies a
moral strength not based on formal or institutional authority." Real
by definition, yet ineffable by its very nature, authenticity, as
Hartman understands it, is often related to spirituality: the wisdom
of the Holy Scriptures, the prophecy of the oracle or the sense of
one's own "inner light." Hartman venerates authenticity but shares
Trilling's distrust of the wrong sort. For many, he feels,
authenticity seems to be a matter of being true to one's self --
whoever or whatever that may be: not always necessarily one's best or
deepest self. For others, authenticity is vested in group identity:
ethnic, religious or sexual. One form easily degenerates into
self-indulgence or self-idolatry; the other may lead to fanaticism
and violence.</TE>
<TE>   Not only can the quest for authenticity be dangerous to questers
of the wild-eyed sort who, like poet Arthur Rimbaud, derange their
senses to get in touch with their inner essences, there can be danger
to innocent bystanders as well. The murderous passion for racial
"purity" often begins in the revulsion from the shallowness of modern
life and a desire for something more "authentic." So, too, the quest
of the "true believer" -- religious or ideological.</TE>
<TE>   "Except for 'spiritual' itself, 'authentic' may be the most
inauthentic word around," notes Hartman. "There is a temptation to
use these charged phrases for trivial or masked purposes." A pastoral
Rousseauvian vision of authenticity as rural simplicity can become
the fodder for labor camps and killing fields. Or, as Hartman
reflects in his epilogue, written in the wake of the events of Sept.
11: "A spectacular act can give the illusion of agency or
self-identity, even at the cost of unleashing disaster." The critic
ponders the terrorists' motives: "The call may ask believers to
change their life and 'put away childish things.' But what does that
mean? What mode of maturity or authentic existence is implied? I find
it impossible to respect a culture that in fact denies childhood, and
trains children to grow into warriors or even suicide bombers. Or
movements that wound secular time by seeking to end it.... The Ground
Zero left by the collapse of the Twin Towers is literally a scar of
the spirit. It testifies to more than an attempt to shatter icons of
capitalism and U.S. power. The smoldering devastation of those ruins
creates a new icon, a permanent mental image of how violence can
cloak itself as spirituality."</TE>
<TE>   Hartman, a Jewish refugee from Hitler's Germany, has spent the
bulk of his professional life at Yale, where he has taught in the
departments of English and comparative literature and is the
co-founding director of a video archive for the testimonies of
Holocaust survivors. Romanticism, Judaic studies and critical theory
are but a few of his many areas of expertise. Like a vast, finely
spun web, this book touches on a dazzling array of subjects, from
religious fundamentalism and reality television to the confusions of
the contemporary art scene, the sorry state of literary studies and
the failure of humanities departments to transmit culture.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the kindest spin that Hartman can put on the proliferation
of tasteless talk shows, sensationalistic "news" and lurid exposes is
that they too bespeak a hunger for authenticity. But how "authentic"
are they really? Shallow, strident, predigested, often slanted, the
sensationalistic versions of "reality" proffered by the media may, in
the long run, only increase our sense of unreality. The hunger of
some individuals for publicity at any price, the prurient curiosity
of audiences for ugly and embarrassing self-exposure strikes Hartman
as a grotesque parody of authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   For Hartman, the true struggle for a deeper form of authenticity
is exemplified in someone like Emily Dickinson and her lifelong
"resistance to the limelight." Citing her poem "I'm Nobody! Who Are
You?," he dryly notes: "She wished to attain immortality, not
publicity." He also finds sustaining -- and sustainable -- forms of
authenticity in the immediacy of aesthetic experience, the unshaped
testimony of Holocaust survivors and the process of interpreting
texts, both sacred and secular. (Curiously, the once-popular notion
of true love as the ultimate "authentic" emotion does not enter into
his discussion.) The authentic, he would remind us, is not to be
found in crude or oversimplified versions of reality but in the
recognition of its -- and our own -- intricacy.</TE>
<TE>   A champion of the tentative who writes in praise of complexity,
Hartman's watchwords as a critic are "patience" and "attention." He
is adept at seeing several things at once, whether it be two sides of
a question or multiple layers of meaning in a novel, a poem, a line
of verse or a single word. His style -- limber, erudite, often
playful -- ranges from engagingly informal to pithily epigrammatic
and sometimes, alas, to dauntingly convoluted.</TE>
<TE>   If Hartman has a besetting flaw (which, seen from another
standpoint, might be accounted a virtue), it is that he tends to be
too reticent in advancing his own theses and too ready, not just to
understand, but sometimes also to rationalize the faults of others:
Heidegger, for instance, whose philosophy of sorge (care) did not
prevent him from actively supporting the Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the ideas and apercus contained in these essays speak to
the concerns of the general reader, although Hartman's argument seems
aimed at an academic audience, and a discerning one at that. His
refinement and cautiousness can be maddening at times yet bespeak a
profound recognition of the weight and value that words can have.
Hartman's intensely scrupulous manner of scrutinizing things is in
itself a form of authenticity.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Any day now, a bug-eyed, green-complexioned civilization in a galaxy
far, far away should be intercepting one of the Voyager space probes
launched from Earth back in 1977. The aliens, depending on how far
they've developed technologically, will either marvel or chuckle at
the tangle of wires beneath Voyager's hood. They'll study with either
great amazement or great amusement the computer system that guided
the spacecraft throughout its celestial journey. Then they'll
discover the gold-plated copper record inside: an LP featuring the
most impressive musical achievements of mankind, a sort of
"Humanity's Greatest Hits." Assuming they can figure out how to work
the accompanying cartridge and needle, they'll experience Bach and
Mozart and Beethoven for the very first time.</LD>
<LD>   And then, eventually, they'll hear it -- one of the most instantly
identifiable musical passages in all of modern history: the opening
guitar riff of Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode." If these
extraterrestrials are made from any of the same stuff as we are,
they'll immediately feel the visceral thrill that comes with hearing
this explosive intro, the calling card of rock 'n' roll. In this
sequence of cascading runs and blues-note bends, one encounters the
seeds not only of a style of music, but of a cultural revolution that
would eventually cohere into one of the most electrifying forces of
the 20th century.</LD>
<TE>   John Lennon suggested that Berry and rock 'n' roll were virtually
synonymous; the teenage Keith Richards built his guitar sound, the
gritty foundation for the Rolling Stones, from a handful of Berry
licks he copped as a rhythm-and-blues cultist growing up in England.
Some dispute whether Berry invented rock 'n' roll in the mid-1950s;
historians with bones to pick are always citing this or that obscure
pre-Berry recording as its true origin. But few contest that Berry
did more than anyone else to infuse rock 'n' roll with the wit,
originality and energy that would take it from an interesting
experiment in musical cross-pollination to a powerful, liberating art
form.</TE>
<TE>   The line that passes through Lennon and Richards to contemporary
popular music begins with Berry, and given his importance it's hard
to believe that we've had to wait practically half a century for his
biography. (Berry's 1987 autobiography seemed designed to obscure as
many facts about his life as it illuminated.) Now Bruce Pegg,
assistant director of the Syracuse University writing program, gives
us "Brown Eyed Handsome Man," the first book to provide an objective,
comprehensive look at Berry's life. Pegg is clearly a fan, but his
book is by no means a starry-eyed hagiography. In his
acknowledgments, he expresses his great regret that Berry, 76, chose
not to "be a part of this project," resulting in a decidedly
unauthorized affair. As it turns out, Pegg probably couldn't have
presented us with anything approaching the true story of Berry's life
and exploits had his subject cooperated -- though the result might
have been a richer study of Berry's profound effect on American
music.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in the Ville, a segregated neighborhood in Jim Crow-era St.
Louis, Charles Edward Anderson Berry nonetheless had a middle-class
upbringing that afforded him the opportunity to attend one of the
nation's most prestigious black high schools. His first tangle with
the law, which would result in the first of several jail sentences,
occurred just before his 18th birthday, when Berry and two friends
went on an armed-robbery spree. While incarcerated he formed a band;
when he got out three years later, he would perform a number of jobs
before finally leading several groups in the St. Louis area.</TE>
<TE>   By mid-1955, Berry had gone to Chicago and met Leonard Chess, the
Polish-born record impresario whose eponymous label specialized in
electric blues by the likes of Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. Chess
thought that he heard in Berry's melding of fast urban blues and
countrified skiffle something new; together, over the next five
years, they would release many of the songs that make up the early
rock 'n' roll canon: "Maybellene," "Roll Over Beethoven," "School
Day," "Rock and Roll Music," "Sweet Little Sixteen" and "Johnny B.
Goode," among many others.</TE>
<TE>   When disc jockey Alan Freed entered the picture -- promoting
Berry's records, arranging concerts and putting him in a string of
music-oriented films -- the artist's popularity soared. By 1957,
Berry was at the top of the singles charts and playing sold-out shows
all over the country with Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and Jerry Lee
Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   By 1962, however, Berry was creating fewer and fewer three-minute
masterpieces, essentially rewriting old hits and coasting off past
triumphs. Rock 'n' roll was about to change significantly; the
Beatles and the Rolling Stones, Berry's British disciples, were just
around the corner. But more than anything else, it was Berry's
conviction in federal court in 1962, after a series of appeals, of
violating the Mann Act -- a Progressive Era law prohibiting the
transportation of a female across state lines for "immoral purpose"
-- that put an end to his reign. Even though the government had all
but stopped prosecuting Mann Act violations by the 1950s, the law was
still on the books and could, as Pegg notes, "be used to entrap any
citizen of the United States who traveled from one state to another
with a member of the opposite sex."</TE>
<TE>   The law, in other words, was only pulled out when circumstances
raised the ire of prosecutors. Pegg is not the first to suggest that
in Berry's case those circumstances included -- in the eyes of
zealous U.S. attorneys and at least one clearly racist judge -- the
fact that the teenager whom Berry took across state lines wasn't
black and wasn't yet 18. Berry served 20 months in federal prison;
when he got out, he discovered that he was an elder statesman at age
37. Though he would continue to have hits, he would no longer be the
dominant force whose songs ruled the airwaves and filled stadiums
with screaming teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Pegg's scholarship is tidy; his writing is clear and
straightforward. Why, then, does this biography seem so hollow at
times? The answer may be that Pegg never takes any leaps, only
prudent baby steps, toward understanding Berry's complicated
character or his role in history. We never learn, for instance, what
led Berry to start playing music in the first place. For so many rock
musicians that came after him, everything began upon hearing that
opening riff from "Johnny B. Goode."</TE>
<TE>   But what was Berry's rock 'n' roll epiphany? Pegg doesn't even
speculate; he just notifies us that after working at a series of odd
jobs, "Berry began to turn his attention to music." Pegg can tell us
everything we could ever want to know about where the young Berry
performed, on which night and with whom. The problem is, that's not
all that we want to know. He never shows us the steps Berry took in
building some of the very first rock 'n' roll songs, just as he never
explores the origins of Berry's distinctive guitar sound, about which
entire volumes could be written. It's as if Thomas Jefferson's
biographer had failed to mention where Jefferson got his ideas on
democracy, noting only that one day he "began to turn his attention
to declaring independence from Great Britain and creating a sovereign
nation."</TE>
<TE>   As brilliant a songwriter and performer as Berry was, his creative
star hasn't really burned since 1960. Any biography that spends half
its time focusing on Berry's life since -- his legal troubles, his
woman troubles, his taxman troubles -- is perhaps misspending its
energies. One of the best books written about popular music is still
Greil Marcus' "Mystery Train." What made that book so unique was that
its writer didn't spend too much time relaying details of the record
deals or concert dates of those he profiled (Sly Stone, Randy Newman
and the Band, among others). Instead, he intensified his focus,
taking as his subject a particular body of work he considered seminal
and studying how it changed music, changed the culture, changed us.</TE>
<TE>   If any one of rock 'n' roll's forefathers deserves the Marcus
treatment, it's Chuck Berry. "Brown Eyed Handsome Man" is a valuable
resource, but for all of the facts contained in its pages, the book
doesn't even attempt to answer the most important question of all:
Why is Chuck Berry included along with Bach, Mozart and Beethoven on
Voyager? Here's hoping we don't have to wait for a rock 'n'
roll-loving alien to give the man his due.</TE>

<HD>Jonathan Franzen corrects himself</HD>
<DH>How to Be Alone Essays Jonathan Franzen Farrar, Straus &amp;
Giroux: 278 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D.J. Waldie</AU>
<BD>D.J. Waldie is the author of "Holy Land: A Suburban
Memoir."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>[F]or a moment, though I'm alone in bed with a book, I don't feel
alone. For a moment, I belong to a group neither as big as a
statistically significant sample nor as small as the naked self. It's
a group of two, the faithful writer and the trusting reader. We're
different but the same.</LD>
<LD>   -- "Books in Bed" from "How to Be Alone"</LD>
<LD>   Life may be a cabaret, old chum, but Jonathan Franzen, author of
"The Corrections," won't be joining you at your table. As the author
who famously blindfolded himself to complete his acclaimed novel,
distilling Proust's cork-lined room to a bandage wrapped around his
head to keep out the distractions, Franzen has a reputation for
solitude. Even more famously, he dithered for several days in public
and then spurned an appearance on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" after "The
Corrections" became a selection of Oprah's Book Club.</LD>
<TE>   Uncomfortable with the company at Winfrey's televised dinner
table, Franzen had finally refused to be chosen, but whether he likes
it or not, he is still an Oprah media "content provider." "The
Corrections" is warmly presented on Winfrey's Web site
(www.oprah.com), which provides thoughtful questions (cribbed from
Franzen's publisher) about structure and characterization designed to
spark a conversation in a circle of female readers yearning for
communion.</TE>
<TE>   These readers, their expectations and the risks they pose to
Franzen's self-regard surround the pieces collected in "How to Be
Alone," a miscellany of Franzen's magazine essays, book reviews and
bits of memoir written mostly from 1995 to 1997, when their author's
depression, marital discords, looming middle age and parents' illness
blocked his ambition to render the instructive "social novel" that he
thought his corrupt times deserved. His way through his block was
writing "The Corrections," a novel in which the enchantments of the
personal only partly obscure how much of the book is clogged with the
merely social.</TE>
<TE>   "How to Be Alone" is many things: an account of malfeasance in a
Chicago post office, the operation of a monstrous new model prison,
his father's Alzheimer's disease, Franzen's taste in sexual display,
and his love of New York and rummaging in Dumpsters.</TE>
<TE>   Just about everything in "How to Be Alone" comes from the
uncertain space in between the personal and the social, the public
and obsessively private, "high-art type" brilliance and the
autobiographical. Before Oprah and "The Corrections," Franzen was
best known for writing a cranky essay for Harper's Magazine in which
he made something of a fool of himself (as he now admits), writing
15,000 words about not writing because he was stuck in this hapless
zone from which he could no longer extract another significant but
unpopular novel. That essay, originally published in 1996 as
"Perchance to Dream," has been revised for "How to Be Alone" and
retitled "Why Bother?" It's surely the reason this collection is
being published now, in conjunction with the paperback edition of
"The Corrections," because nearly every reviewer of the novel
referred to "the Harper's essay" and, Franzen felt, misread it.</TE>
<TE>   Franzen now has rewritten it. Edited out is a long passage
slamming the folly of English departments and their "therapeutic"
curricula. Gone is a cruel burlesque of Franzen as an incredibly
gullible screenwriter getting screwed in Hollywood (now that "The
Corrections" has a producer); gone too is a colloquy with David
Foster Wallace in which Wallace defends the notion that writers who
are "straight white males" are mainstream culture. (Franzen agrees
that they also are mainstream culture's marginalized victims because
straight white males don't write novels about the particular sorrows
of troubled families and the small heroics of mothers and fathers.)</TE>
<TE>   "The Harper's essay" has been misunderstood either as Franzen's
challenge to himself to write the first post-postmodern novel or as
Franzen's farewell to the rigorous world-spanning fiction of his
heroes Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo. His essay pointed to neither
of those deterministic dead ends, Franzen insists; it's about how he
made himself into a new kind of Social Novelist. In 1996, he was "a
very angry and theory-minded person," Franzen writes in the
introduction to "How to Be Alone"; now, he's been corrected "from an
angry and frightened isolation toward an acceptance -- even a
celebration -- of being a reader and a writer."</TE>
<TE>   The irony is intended, isn't it? Past the romantic spleen and the
familiar critique of American popular culture, "the Harper's essay"
is the record of a therapeutic conversation in which Franzen's
special nature as a writer was revealed to him by a linguistic
anthropologist from Stanford University. "You are a socially isolated
individual who desperately wants to communicate with a substantive
imaginary world," Shirley Brice Heath told him.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt as if she were looking straight into my soul," Franzen
says. "Simply to be recognized for what I was, simply not to be
misunderstood: these had revealed themselves, suddenly, as reasons to
write." Winfrey and her audience understand that moment. It's their
sacrament. Once a life's affliction, endured alone, has been expertly
named and the wounds it made publicly exposed, the revived soul can
go on. The audience that understands the humiliation of being
ordinary crowded around Franzen after the success of "The
Corrections," appropriating his "substantive imaginary world" and
expecting media agents, like Winfrey, to breach his solitude and
expose his wounds.</TE>
<TE>   However, celebrity is not what Franzen wanted, but readers who
know their place. Habitual readers gain substance in the act of
reading and assemble a community by sharing texts (not gossip),
Franzen says approvingly of Heath's sociology of books, but for
writers, Heath tells him, "the important dialogue in your life is
with the authors of the books you read."</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between ordinary reader and extraordinary writer,
for Franzen, is a loneliness made sacred by the knowledge -- not the
fact -- of each other's presence. When, in "How to Be Alone," Franzen
complains of television, the Internet and globalization -- that is,
the general distractiveness of culture today -- he's talking about
straying from a Puritan faith in the received Word: reading novels as
a substitute for Calvinism.</TE>
<TE>   "Though it hasn't quite happened yet," Franzen writes in the essay
"Scavenging," "we writers now easily foresee the day when the old
generation of readers has gotten tired and no new generation has
taken its place: when we ourselves are all that will remain of our
audience." Then, they'll be like today's poets. Franzen calls that
foreboding "tragic realism"; it is another moment (often in "How to
Be Alone") when Franzen conflates existential questions and the
details of his biography. There is an unpleasant, grasping quality in
this, as though Franzen actually thought Winfrey's approval had
damaged his reputation, and "How to Be Alone" is the means to keep
his membership in the New York writers' boys club while he waits
alone, melancholy but brave, to be famous for the writers who will
come after him.</TE>
<TE>   Blaise Pascal, who was more than half a Calvinist himself, once
said, "I have often said that all of a man's misfortune comes from
not knowing how to sit quietly in his room." To which Franzen
seemingly would agree -- with a modification -- that one should sit
quietly in one's room reading a book by Jonathan Franzen.</TE>

<HD>A Western legacy of dreamers</HD>
<DH>Promised Lands Promotion, Memory, and the Creation of the
American West David M. Wrobel University Press of Kansas: 336 pp.,
$34.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Kirsch</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch is a contributing writer to Book
Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New West magazine was launched in the mid-1970s with high hopes and
not a little hype. As the title implies, its editors and contributors
were full of confidence about their ability to put their readers on
the cutting edge of life in California -- "newness," after all, is
the essence of "Westness."</LD>
<LD>   As we discover in "Promised Lands" by David M. Wrobel, however,
the phrase "New West" was first used in the title of a guidebook in
1869, and by the time of the publication of the first New West
magazine in 1909, the phrase was already a cliche -- a manifestation
of the "newnessphilia" that has always characterized the Western
imagination.</LD>
<LD>   "Promised Lands" traces the origins of the California dream to a
singular struggle that defined us and shapes us still. Vying for the
claim to California's image are the "reminiscers" and the "boosters,"
those clinging to a nostalgia for the past and those longing for the
future.</LD>
<TE>   Western mythmaking has always depended on the visual arts, this
much we know, whether it is map making, landscape painting, movies or
music videos, as pointed out in several books recently reviewed here
(Book Review, Nov. 17). But Wrobel shows how the entire enterprise
begins at an even deeper place in human consciousness -- the most
willful and determined of the mythmakers "literally tried to imagine
western places into existence."</TE>
<TE>   "[W]estern promoters hurriedly raced toward the future, often
announcing its presence before it had actually arrived," he writes,
"while old settlers lamented that arrival and expressed their
reverence for past times."</TE>
<TE>   Wrobel, a history professor at the University of Nevada, Las
Vegas, has tapped into the considerable resources of the Huntington
Library in San Marino, where he worked through a vast accumulation of
mostly overlooked writings and publications -- a "mountain of printed
promises," as he puts it, and the "[t]riumphal tales of white pioneer
males (and, to a lesser extent, of white pioneer females)." To his
credit, he succeeds in wringing new meanings out of these
mostly-overlooked sources.</TE>
<TE>   The claims that the boosters made for the "New West" ranged from
the sublime -- "[R]ainbows cast their glittering coronets around the
mountains," wrote one panegyrist about Colorado, "and radiant irises
dance in many a romantic gorge" -- to the divine: "This is the happy
Canaan -- the holy land," wrote one newspaper editor in describing
Riverside in 1885.</TE>
<TE>   Other propagandists were more down to earth. Cheap and fertile
land was the most powerful magnet, but the boosters also advertised
the social and cultural advantages of the tamed frontier. "[B]etween
the Missouri River and the Pacific Coast," boasted the Boise City
(Idaho) Board of Trade in 1887, "there is no school superior to, if
any equals, our city school in discipline, equipment, or any other
advantages." The author of "Homes and Happiness in the Golden State"
(1884) engaged in special pleading for California, warning readers
that California was free of the "fevers and diseases of the malarial
character" afflicting other Western states.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in opposition to the boosters (whose descendants are
today pushing the boundaries of L.A. farther out) were the old-timers
who blazed the trail to the West in the first place. They felt
estranged from the drumbeat of development, and they indulged in fond
recollections of a simpler and livelier era. In books and broadsides,
posters, pamphlets and countless newspapers, readers were reminded of
the time, not long before, when the West had been "a howling
wilderness," as Alfred Lambourne wrote in an account of his own
wilderness experiences, "inhabited by bands of savages and penetrated
only by intrepid trappers and hunters!"</TE>
<TE>   As the West became a more orderly (and less exciting) place, the
appetite for such tales grew ever sharper. Indeed, it was the closing
of the American frontier in the late 19th century that prompted what
Wrobel calls "frontier anxiety," a phenomenon that expressed itself
in recollections of the struggle to explore and settle the West.
Faced with the realities of "a terrible economic depression,
heightened agrarian protest, industrial strife, urban squalor, and
continued political corruption," readers all over America found a
certain consolation in the heroism of "Death Valley in '49," William
Lewis Manley's account of his own adventures during the Gold Rush.</TE>
<TE>   The contrast between promotion and memory, Wrobel demonstrates,
created frictions between the boosters and reminiscers. "Those who
questioned the feasibility of the dream," Wrobel points out, "were
labeled 'knockers' and were often the objects of social ostracism."
Yet the promoters were ready to co-opt even the most irascible old
pioneers through a curious exercise in nostalgia called "journey
reenactment." The St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, for example,
organized a rail excursion to the Red River for some 350 "Old
Settlers" in 1871, thus promoting travel and tourism while
celebrating the life of the hardscrabble pioneers.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though they were the ones riding in luxury in the present,"
Wrobel writes, "these old pioneers could take pride in the fact that
they had experienced the journey under more trying experiences."</TE>
<TE>   At certain moments, the two elements were combined into a single,
potent and uniquely American expression. The single best example is
Buffalo Bill Cody, frontiersman turned showman, whose reenactments of
the "Wild West" attracted nearly 6 million paid spectators during the
Chicago World's Fair in 1893 and countless millions more during a
career that lasted more than 30 years. "Of all the creators of the
mythic frontier western heritage, Buffalo Bill Cody is surely the
most memorable," writes Wrobel. Not much has changed since the first
mythmakers went to work in the invention of the West. "We continue to
hold onto our own selectively remembered mythic visions of western
pasts, just as we continue to construct visions of western futures,"
writes Wrobel, "and these contemporary creations are often no less
fantastic than those of earlier pioneers and promoters." What we
learn here is that our own "newnessphilia" is rooted in a tradition
that is very, very old.</TE>

<LD>The title: "28 Days Later"</LD>
<LD>   The tagline: "The nightmare begins here. The days are numbered."</LD>
<LD>   Where it's charting: Currently No. 2 at the U.K. box office;
opened at No. 1.</LD>
<TE>   The story line: Animal activists accidentally unleash a highly
contagious virus onto an unsuspecting British populace during a raid
on a primate research lab. The virus, code-named "Rage," spreads
across England, turning people into angry, murderous (but
well-dressed) zombies known as "The Infected." Twenty-eight days
later, a small group of survivors forges its way through
zombie-infested territory to a distant army stronghold, all the while
eyeing each other for signs of infection.</TE>
<TE>   What the reviews are saying: The Independent calls it "a zombie
movie with a head and a heart -- as well as the obligatory severed
limbs, gouged eyes, punctured organs."</TE>
<TE>   How they're selling it: Publicity campaign includes "Danger of
infection" biohazard stickers plastered on phone booths.</TE>
<TE>   Why they're buying it: Brits are in love with scenes of a
deserted, post-apocalyptic London. And the film taps neatly into
current fears. "The filmmakers have made much of the contemporary
relevance and plausibility of their story," notes Glasgow's the
Herald, "road rage, germ warfare, AIDS, Al Qaeda, soccer violence --
you name it...." But mostly, it's about the fantasy and frisson of
seeing one's own city gone awry.</TE>
<TE>   When the zombies arrive stateside: 2003.</TE>

<HD>An odd couple with Oscars</HD>
<DH>James Cameron and Steven Soderbergh may be poles apart as
directors, but they met midway for 'Solaris.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick Goldstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having James Cameron and Steven Soderbergh at the same table, doing a
joint interview about their new movie, is sort of like watching
Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant in a Venice Beach pickup game together
-- two pros having some fun at a game they take very seriously.</LD>
<LD>   The King of the World jokes about his five marriages and his
self-taught movie education, saying "most of what I learned about
film was at a drive-in. It was a long time before I heard a film in
stereo." The Prince of the Independents broods about love and death,
then mocks show-biz insiders' disdain for "My Big Fat Greek Wedding"
("It's gonna top out at $200 million -- big deal!").</LD>
<LD>   Oscar best director winners don't mix it up every day. Film
directing is one of those jobs, like a baseball manager or a platoon
lieutenant, where there can only be one boss. Explaining why he hates
to visit another director's set, Soderbergh says, "It's like hanging
out in somebody else's bedroom."</LD>
<TE>   But when Soderbergh decided to adapt Stanislaw Lem's classic
science-fiction novel "Solaris," filmed in 1972 by Russian director
Andrei Tarkovsky, he struck an alliance with Cameron, whom you might
recall as the director of "Titanic," the top-grossing movie of all
time. Cameron had acquired the rights to "Solaris" as a directing
project for himself, but he got involved with producing the TV series
"Dark Angel" and several documentary projects, including an upcoming
3-D film featuring underwater photography of the real Titanic.</TE>
<TE>   When Soderbergh, 39, having just finished "Erin Brockovich,"
offered to write and direct the film, Cameron, 48, instantly gave his
blessings, staying on as producer. The resulting $47-million movie,
which opened Wednesday, stars George Clooney as a psychologist
brought in to explain the bizarre behavior of a group of scientists
on a remote space station. Once aboard, Clooney's character is
mysteriously reunited with his wife, played by Natascha McElhone, who
committed suicide years before.</TE>
<TE>   In Soderbergh's hands, "Solaris" is less a look at the future than
it is a kind of "sex, lies, &amp; videotape 2," a brooding meditation on
the quest for romance and redemption. Even with Clooney in the lead,
the movie represents a marketing challenge. Though it has its
supporters, Variety called it "a study of the deepest emotions that
doesn't engage the heart for a moment." It's tempting to imagine what
a more visceral filmmaker like Cameron would've done with the same
material.</TE>
<TE>   But while their career arcs have led them in different directions,
the two filmmakers have a strong regard for each other's work. Up
close, the two men could be cousins: They're tall, lean and pale,
with strong, aquiline noses. They voice even stronger opinions,
sounding off on studio timidity, fickle critics and the arrogance of
artists. Sometimes teasing each other, often finishing each other's
answers, they have an easy rapport. When asked if they'd met before
embarking on "Solaris," they both say, "No." After a beat, however,
Cameron adds dryly, "But I had heard of him."</TE>
<TE>   Steven, you'd never made a sci-fi film. So what attracted you to
this material?</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: When I was almost done with the first draft, I was
thinking, why did these weird happenstances occur? Why did I pick
this title out of anything [Cameron's company] had? Why do I want to
write it? I realized that it's about love and about death and clearly
something is pulling me to that. I didn't realize until way into the
process that I was working through, in some very oblique way, what
had happened with my father who died very suddenly and to whom I was
very close.</TE>
<TE>   I spoke to him the afternoon before he had the cerebral hemorrhage
that killed him, and the good news was there wasn't any unfinished
business. I would hope that of all the feelings we take with us when
somebody is gone, love is the most impervious to rust. That anger and
jealousy would fade and a feeling of love is somehow like a diamond.</TE>
<TE>   You wrote the film on spec. Why?</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: In case I failed I wanted to be able to walk away with
no questions asked.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: I was kind of shocked by that, but I loved it. Here was a
guy who was willing to do a significant amount of work based on a
handshake. It put me on my honor in a way that I wish this business
worked all the time. When we got his first draft, we were willing to
go off and shoot the film. Little did we realize that it was just the
first step in his process. Steven said, "No, guys, this is where we
start the writing process." We then went through this deconstruction
process of attacking every single idea and every single concept and
making sure it resonated properly.</TE>
<TE>   Jim, this movie has so many themes, especially the focus on the
conflicts between men and women that I couldn't help but wonder --
why didn't you want to direct it?</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: That was the original intention. I probably wouldn't have
made it as rigorously minimalist in terms of the science-fiction
visual set-pieces as Steven did, but that purity is one of the big
pluses of the film. I did some similar stuff in "The Abyss," which
was also about love, separation and loss, except that I cluttered
that film up too much and people reacted negatively. . A more
minimalist version of that would've been a better film.</TE>
<TE>   One of the great opportunities for a director doing a movie set in
the future is, what does the future look like?</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: Didn't care. Didn't care.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: [Our producers] were so shocked when they saw the first
dailies. It was like, where's the future? [laughs] It's just a guy
walking in the rain.</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: The movie really isn't about the future, so I wasn't
interested in what the world was going to look like. I was interested
in what it was going to feel like. So purposefully, there are no
establishing shots, no product that's recognizable. I stripped all of
that out because I just thought it was, in fact, distracting. It was
a 75-page screenplay. I'm only interested in the people. There are
more close-ups in this movie than in any movie I've ever made.</TE>
<TE>   Is that minimalism an extension of your personality? If I walked
into your home, would it look neat and clean?</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: I have a real desire to keep things as lean and simple
as possible. I have one home, one car, one child. It's very easy for
me to imagine myself, if I didn't have someone in my life that I
loved, living like Dr. Chris Kelvin at the beginning of the film,
just throwing myself into my work.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: How about the economy of Steven's writing? Here's a
psychologist in his office and he says over the phone, "I have an
opening at 7 a.m. and another one at 6:30 p.m." It's like, you know
his life just from that.</TE>
<TE>   Jim, you were in the editing room a lot when Steven was cutting
the film.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: He had a cut that he wanted to show after three weeks.
Sucker bait. Because he then tore it all apart and anything I liked
in that cut, I had to fight for. Steven has this architecture he
creates -- we're going to shoot, then edit, then shoot some more,
then edit again. It was built into the budgetprocess. I'm gonna do
that from now on. With me the problem is that I'd go over budget and
they'd say, "OK, we can take those days away later" and I'd agree to
that and then later [laughs] I'd shoot them anyway.</TE>
<TE>   So Jim, since 1997, when "Titanic" came out ...</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: [to Soderbergh] You see where this is going ...</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: You want me to leave?</TE>
<TE>   Steven has directed seven movies ...</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: Which if you added them all together ...</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: [laughs] I didn't go there.</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: No, I'm going there.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: [laughs] If you added them all together, the entire
shooting schedules would still be less than "Titanic."</TE>
<TE>   But with all due respect to all your other projects, you haven't
directed a movie ...</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: You can't say with due respect, just because I haven't
played in your ballpark doesn't mean I haven't been busy.</TE>
<TE>   OK, but why have you decided not to play in the feature-film
ballpark?</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: Been more interested in other....</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: [laughs] You have to say "stuff." It's the L.A. Times.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: Making "Solaris" is cool and fun, but it doesn't hold a
candle to going on a deep submersible dive with an ultimate imaging
system that allows you to see a real living animal that no human
being has ever seen before. People think of documentaries in a very
dismissive fashion, as if feature films are somehow inherently higher
on the evolutionary scale. But one of the hardest disciplines I've
ever had to learn was to be a good documentary filmmaker. And I don't
think I'm there yet. I'm struggling for mediocrity.</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: But here's the question on the table. "Titanic," being
the culmination in a lot of ways of your aesthetic, where you
marshaled everything you learned about filmmaking and narrative --
and it worked -- did you feel free to say, "OK, I want to see what
else is going on?"</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: Yes, it was the most liberating experience. People have
attributed [my not making another feature] to a kind of performance
anxiety or stage fright. But to be perfectly honest, I've spent 500
or 600 hours at 6,000 feet [underwater], so I'm not really too afraid
of what folks like you have to say. There are certain things that I
can do when I'm 48 and still fit that I won't be able to do when I'm
60. But I know I can still direct a movie and that's going to be
around until I cork off, which hopefully will be like John Huston,
with an oxygen tube up my nose, directing from a wheelchair when I'm
85. Once you're a director, you never stop.</TE>
<TE>   There's a line of dialogue in the film that goes, "There are no
answers, only choices."</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: I want that T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: Actually, it's my political platform.</TE>
<TE>   Well, it summed up what I liked most about "Solaris," that it
doesn't tell you how to feel, the opposite of what studios want from
their movies. Why has ambiguity become such a dirty word in today's
Hollywood?</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: Hollywood is desperate to be loved, and that desperation
to be loved causes them to follow you out of the movie theater and
down the hall and put a synopsis of the plot in your pocket. It's
pathetic. Nothing must be left to chance. You can't get to the
closing credits without everything being nicely tied up with a bow
around it.</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: I don't blame the studios for bad movies. I blame the
filmmakers. Nobody puts a gun to your head and says, "Make a piece
of.... "</TE>
<TE>   Steven, the critics loved you when you made "Out of Sight" and
"Traffic" and "Erin Brockovich," but then you did "Full Frontal" and
they abandoned you.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: You're celebrated and then you're trashed. It's so
predictable that it almost didn't matter what the film was. It had to
happen. You look at a sine wave or an oscillation in physics, well,
that's how energy propagates in our business. You go up, then you go
down. Thank God you got "Full Frontal" out of the way. [laughs] Maybe
we're on the up curve with this one!</TE>
<TE>   But you still care what critics say about your films?</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: It's like a New Yorker getting insulted. You prefer not
to be, but you can handle it. Let's face it, a bad review is an
insult. The critic is basically saying, this guy is a complete idiot.
The sad part of it is that reviewers are generally the best-informed
moviegoers around. The praise you get from your friends or the studio
is kind of mushy and inarticulate. You really want someone to say,
"You know, in that scene, that line that he says really resonates at
the end and has a double meaning." And the only people qualified to
do that are reviewers. [laughs] But they're fickle ... !</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh:  I don't care.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: He says he doesn't care.</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: You don't make "Schizopolis" or "Full Frontal" if you
really care what critics think.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron:  You can't tell me you don't want somebody somewhere to
articulate exactly how they reacted in a way that is in someway
congruent with what you intended.</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: I don't need that to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: Then why show the movie to anybody?</TE>
<TE>   Someone once said to me that the same supreme self-confidence or
arrogance that makes someone a great filmmaker is what causes their
downfall.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: I heard Ray Bradbury do 30 minutes on that. He called it
the sublime ego. Nobody writes anything or creates a work of art
without thinking they can inherently do it well enough that other
people are going to stop what they're doing and look at it.</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: The sad fact is that my job [as a director] is to use
people, to suck the brain out of everybody I encounter to make my
movie better. I just try to go about it in a way where they don't
feel like they're missing their brain, that in fact it's happened
while they were asleep.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: That's like the anesthesia that's in the saliva of a
vampire bat.</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: [after a long, quizzical pause] Exactly.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: The second I'm off the set I don't want to be in control
of anything. I tell my wife, "You make the dinner reservations. You
drive. You figure everything out." I get paid to make decisions. I'm
not gonna do them for free.</TE>
<TE>   Did you tell that to each wife?</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: Every last one of them. [laughs] I guess some of them
couldn't deal with the pressure of being in charge.</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: What is the definition of insanity? You play out the
same scenario each time and expect a different result?</TE>
<TE>   Cameron: Well, you know what, I played out the same scenario four
times and it didn't work. And the fifth time, bingo!</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh: See, this man's an optimist.</TE>

<LD>I thoroughly enjoyed your background article on PBS' "Skinwalkers"
("The bestseller they couldn't sell," Nov. 17). I, and probably all
of Tony Hillerman's loyal readers, have been waiting a very long time
to see if his Navajo mysteries would ever be made for television. How
fortunate we are that Robert and James Redford have such an avid
interest in filming these stories. Adam Beach and Wes Studi -- actors
whose work I greatly admire -- have been well cast as Jim Chee and
Joe Leaphorn.</LD>
<LD>   I haven't been this excited about television in ages. Thank you,

<LD>"Reality" is not apparently enough of "a hot commodity" for the Walt
Disney Co. to include the larger political and economic context of
last July's Pennsylvania mine calamity in its docudrama ("The art of
the ordeal," Nov. 24). Disney was so concerned with "getting the
details right" that its producers missed the opportunity to reveal
the larger causes of this and numerous other mining "accidents" --
company greed and lack of government oversight of mine safety
conditions.</LD>

a one-man acting business that uses a unique formula of study,

includes meeting and learning from casting directors in workshops.
Any state invention to thwart my chosen efforts is tyrannical in

<LD>Lynn Smith's article ("Attack of the 40-foot ads," Nov. 17) presumes
that there are no moviegoers who enjoy on-screen advertising. Maybe
I'm in the minority, but my first instinct when planning to see a
current release is to choose a theater where one is guaranteed a
"pre-show entertainment" segment and usually at least six previews.</LD>
<LD>   But then I'm British and theaters always ran commercials and often
they were large-screen versions of the very ones that you saw on
regular television. There's something great about seeing an ad you're
used to seeing on a small TV screen blown up to movie-theater size!
Surely, advertising is all part of the grand moviegoing experience.
Your article talks about some theaters allowing advertisers to target
the audiences by movie rating. Surely this is just an extension of
the practice that currently exists whereby trailers are tailored to
suit the audience of the accompanying feature.</LD>
<LD>   Pardon me, but it all makes tremendously obvious commercial sense.</LD>

<LD>As an actor who has worked extensively with the Malibu Stage Company,
I was shocked when I returned from a recent trip to London to learn
of the board's termination of Charles Marowitz's as the company's
artistic director (Arts Notes, Nov. 17).</LD>
<LD>   Far from being fired, Marowitz should be honored as one of Los
Angeles' and Malibu's greatest artistic treasures. An artist and a
visionary who is an absolute joy to work with, he is a true
professional, and he brings with him an unparalleled wealth of
experience. With more than 30 books published, his work is taught at
universities worldwide, and he's credited with a unique vision for
contemporary theater.If Charles Marowitz's term as artistic director
of the Malibu Stage "falls prey" to the current board's "medicine,"
then both Malibu and Los Angeles will miss out on one of the greatest
theater practitioners alive today.</LD>

<LD>Michael Dampier blasts Tom Hanks for declining to kiss Antonio
Banderas in "Philadelphia" (Letters, Nov. 17). "Did Mr. Hanks think
he was going to ruin his career, or was it all a money choice?"
Dampier wonders.</LD>
<LD>   There are at least two other possibilities. Hanks may have thought
that a kiss would become a media spectacle that would take the focus
away from the movie's central message of compassion for people with
AIDS. He may also have decided that a kissing scene would keep some
people from seeing the movie -- the very people who most needed to
see it. Perhaps Hanks didn't see any point in "preaching to the
choir."</LD>
<LD>   In 1993, Hanks was coming off a pair of blockbusters ("A League of
Their Own" and "Sleepless in Seattle") that all but define the term
"mass appeal." Probably no other actor could have brought such a
broad, mainstream audience into the theater. Hanks should be
commended for taking the role. Instead, Dampier questions his motives
and integrity and suggests that he isn't a "true actor." It proves
the wisdom of the adage, "No good deed goes unpunished."</LD>

<LD>What is this compulsion Kenneth Turan has to begin writing incisive
editorials and then backpedal from his own remarks ("Film: war's foot
soldier?," Nov. 24). In his otherwise excellent editorial concerning
Hollywood and the coming war with Iraq, Turan nullifies every
critical remark he makes by saying things in the last paragraph like:
"Perhaps it is asking too much of the movies [Hollywood] to explore
these dark and pessimistic thoughts" or "even if it's not Hollywood's
place to do anything differently...."</LD>
<LD>   Puleeeease! It is Hollywood's place to do things differently.
That's the point I thought he was making. Movies like "Armageddon,"
"The Sum of All Fears," "Pearl Harbor" and even "Saving Private Ryan"
are responsible for selling a glorified vision of American hegemony
that blunts our own ability to think critically of ourselves. We
should be asking questions about whether America truly is unbeatable
and whether war will irreparably destabilize the Middle East. At the
very least we should expect the movie industry to not make us wholly
stupider as a culture. These are tricky times. Our lives may depend
on the choices we make in coming years.</LD>
<LD>   Mr. Turan ... let it rip. Stop backpedaling and make your point.</LD>

<DH>Why have U.S. architects largely left behind the idea of
work with a social impact?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicolai Ouroussoff</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The past few years have been bountiful ones for American
architecture. It is hard to name a major American city that doesn't
have a significant civic project in the works, most by big-name
talents. Art institutions, philharmonic boards and universities have
turned to architects to raise their public profiles with flamboyant
new buildings. The newly minted rich commission houses by
cutting-edge talents as a way of achieving the cultural status they
crave.</LD>
<LD>   What is more, the stylistic range of these works makes this one of
the most creative times in recent architectural history. Free of
Modernism's once dogmatic formulas, architects continue to push the
limits of aesthetic experimentation. The dynamic, futuristic forms of
Zaha Hadid, the stoic mysticism of Tadao Ando, the aggressive
conceptual constructions of Rem Koolhaas -- such visions and others
represent a remarkable range of competing values. Each is leaving its
mark on the architectural landscape.</LD>
<LD>   But if architecture's creative resurgence has once again caught
the attention of the American public, that resurgence has also been
relatively shallow. Half a century ago, architects could believe,
with some justification, that they were drafting the cities of
tomorrow, and that the work they did would have significant social
impact.</LD>
<TE>   Today, architects working in America are confined to serving a
relatively small and entrenched elite -- the corporate kingpins and
aging philanthropists who typically make up the boards of the
country's major cultural institutions. The success of the
conservative political agenda has meant that the kind of visionary
public works projects that remain possible in Europe are no longer
part of the public dialogue here. The nation's faltering economy,
meanwhile, has resulted in cuts in philanthropic spending.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that architecture risks being reduced to a purely
aesthetic game -- one that offers the veneer of progress without its
substance. At best, the high end of the profession is able to produce
the occasional transcendent masterpiece. At worst, it functions as a
mere plaything for the rich and their institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a time when everything seems possible but nothing is," says
Koolhaas, architecture's reigning radical voice. "There is this cult
of the masterpiece and the rest -- a generic, unimaginative
landscape. The middle ground is lost."</TE>
<TE>   Culture and commissions</TE>
<TE>   The shift away from work that serves a broader public is not
essentially the fault of architects. They do not set the country's
political agenda, nor can they create commissions out of thin air --
someone has to pay for them. But the explosion in high-profile
cultural commissions has produced a sort of feeding frenzy among many
architectural firms, which regularly vie against one another for the
most prestigious -- and lucrative -- jobs. And that new focus has
turned attention away from issues that once were at the heart of the
profession.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest monuments being built in America today are part of a
cultural rather than political agenda. British high-tech Modernist
Norman Foster, for example, is completing a major addition to
Boston's Museum of Fine Arts; Daniel Libeskind, the designer of
Berlin's celebrated Jewish Museum, is working on an addition to the
Denver Art Museum; Koolhaas' Seattle Public Library is under
construction; and Ando's Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth opens later
this month.</TE>
<TE>   Other projects are conspicuous emblems of American affluence.
Richard Meier, the designer of the Getty Center, is completing two
shimmering glass condominium towers overlooking Manhattan's Hudson
River. Most of the apartments have been snatched up by such
celebrities as Calvin Klein and Nicole Kidman. (Plagued by insider
trading accusations, decorating doyen Martha Stewart is reportedly
trying to unload her duplex for $8 million.)</TE>
<TE>   Meier has also designed a stunning house in Malibu for billionaire
Eli Broad. The house's pristine, sharp-edged white forms evoke the
precision of a fine-tuned Swiss watch. In Napa Valley, the Swiss team
of Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron is completing a residence for
the art collectors Richard and Pamela Kramlich. The project's
undulating glass walls, set underneath a swooping faceted roof, evoke
the intricacy of a Faberge egg. Koolhaas' most recently completed
design is a $40-million Prada boutique in Manhattan's SoHo district.</TE>
<TE>   Such commissions have made these architects international
celebrities. Their names are regularly sprinkled across the pages of
glossy magazines; the unveiling of one of their buildings is often a
major media event.</TE>
<TE>   What that popularity has not given them, however, is access to the
kind of large-scale public projects that could have a deeper social
impact in this country. The American nuclear family, for example, has
undergone a seismic shift in its identity in the postwar years --
including the growth of single-parent households and gay marriages.
These shifts raise profound questions about housing design, yet
architects have barely begun to explore them. Big commercial and
retail developments, meanwhile, are typically entrusted to
mainstream, commercial architects who churn out the same formulaic
atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   No American city reflects this condition more pointedly than Los
Angeles. The city has embarked on a number of major civic projects,
from Jose Raphael Moneo's recently completed Cathedral of Our Lady of
the Angels to Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall, scheduled to
open next fall, and Koolhaas' plan for a new Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, currently in design stages. (Koolhaas' project is now
on hold after voters defeated a bond measure to fund the building.)</TE>
<TE>   These are all significant designs, and their addition to the
city's civic landscape is invaluable. But the location of these
projects is telling. The most visible cultural complex completed here
over the last decade -- the Getty Center -- looms over one of the
city's most exclusive neighborhoods, on a hilltop overlooking the 405
Freeway in Brentwood. Disney Hall and the cathedral are located
downtown amid a mix of corporate towers and government offices that
civic boosters are seeking to make palatable for tourists and
middle-class suburbanites.</TE>
<TE>   The notion of a similar civic undertaking being built in the
Latino enclave of Boyle Heights or the predominantly African American
neighborhoods of South-Central Los Angeles, by comparison, seems as
likely as Steven Spielberg holding a premiere party in Watts.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a bond issue that would have raised nearly $200 million
for the expansion of two of the city's most important cultural
institutions -- the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum
of Natural History -- failed to pass in November. Another bond
measure, which will provide $2.1 billion for the creation or
renovation of up to 134,000 units of public housing in California,
was approved. Yet state officials have no plans to explore how the
new housing could fit into a larger conception of the region's
growth, nor have they given any thought to how imaginative
architecture could contribute to the lives of its inhabitants.</TE>
<TE>   American architecture was not always so lacking in idealistic
fervor. In the 1930s, when Frank Lloyd Wright first began promoting
his Usonian houses, his intent was to offer a radical model for the
American middle-class way of life. The houses' modest scale,
horizontal profiles and free-flowing interiors evoked an Emersonian
vision of man in harmony with the natural world. About the same time,
inspired by the grand urban schemes then being proposed by the
European avant-garde, Wright designed Broadacre City, a theoretical
suburban arcadia of single-family homes and sweeping landscapes
punctuated by the occasional skyscraper.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, faith in architecture's transformative powers
survived through the early 1960s, when mainstream developers were
churning out suburban middle-class housing tracts whose streamlined
appearance, two-car garages and humming appliances were held up as an
emblem of America's unwavering faith in its own future.</TE>
<TE>   That faith collapsed in the 1970s, when it became apparent that
Modernism could not solve society's ills; at its worst, it
contributed to them.</TE>
<TE>   "The Modernist Utopia was only achieved in a negative way,"
Libeskind says. "In the name of helping people, they only created
dull, conformist environments. And that was the end of ideology in
architecture."</TE>
<TE>   But broader political forces were also at play. By the 1980s, the
social activism of New Deal-era America was beginning to fade, picked
apart by the advances of free-market capitalism and corporate
globalism.</TE>
<TE>   In architecture schools today, it is still possible to find
programs like Auburn University's Rural Studio, which designs and
builds low-cost homes for Alabama's poor. But such programs are
limited in ambition, and students now are far more likely to be
engaged by issues like "corporate branding," as if the profession's
function were no different from that of a national advertising firm
-- to create slick, captivating images for high-profile clients.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the most important change has been the rising
adulation of the market," Koolhaas said, "and the disappearance of
the state. It has reduced everything [in America] to this question of
profit and consumption."</TE>
<TE>   That assessment only gets bleaker when compared with what
architects have been able to accomplish in Europe over the past
decades. While Americans were loudly proclaiming the death of the
Utopian dream, Europe went on tinkering with the old models,
fine-tuning them, lowering -- but not abandoning -- expectations.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, for example, groups like the London-based Archigram
and the Italian collaborative Superstudio were producing a stream of
theoretical projects that sought to transform Modernism's
increasingly limiting formulas into a less oppressive vision of the
future. Superstudio's 1969 "Continuous Monument," for example,
proposed gargantuan rationalist glass-and-steel structures that would
have extended endlessly across a medieval European landscape and were
meant to function as refuges from commercial culture.</TE>
<TE>   Such projects were essentially theoretical fantasies, but their
impact was felt nonetheless. With its scaffolding-like exterior of
steel pipes and transparent tubes, Paris' Pompidou Center, for
example, was a direct descendant of Archigram's Fun City proposal.
Both were conceived as flexible frameworks for a more spontaneous
culture.</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, French President Francois Mitterrand launched one
of the most ambitious building programs in recent Parisian history,
creating half a dozen major civic monuments, most of them in the
city's working-class eastern sector. The idea was to rectify the
imbalance between the city's traditional core, packed with historic
monuments, and an area of the city that had none.</TE>
<TE>   In preparation for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, the Spanish
government devised a plan that created a vast range of new public
spaces, significantly enriching the city's civic identity. The scope
of the development also spawned a major revival in contemporary
Spanish and Portuguese architecture, uncovering a range of new
talents like Alvaro Siza, Carme Pinos and Enric Miralles.</TE>
<TE>   And in the Netherlands, a more egalitarian country than the U.S.,
government planners have created hundreds of thousands of new units
of social housing in the past decade, asking many of the country's
emerging architectural talents to come up with a humane vision for
their design.</TE>
<TE>   Clumped in a core</TE>
<TE>   It is not hard to imagine the impact such strategies could have
had on a city like Los Angeles. Rather than concentrating the
majority of our civic and cultural institutions in a single civic
core, they could have been dispersed across the city -- a Latino
museum in East L.A. or a LACMA branch in South-Central. (Vague
promises of extensive new development  in South-Central, in fact,
were made after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, but they were never
kept.)</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, L.A.'s Catholic archdiocese might have considered
building a network of parish churches in the city's most blighted
areas rather than concentrating all of its resources on the Cathedral
of Our Lady of the Angels. The cathedral is a monument to the
church's power; the smaller churches might have signaled a more
egalitarian spiritual vision. (In Rome, Richard Meier is completing
just such a project, a stunning church whose gleaming white forms act
as a spiritual beacon in an otherwise bleak landscape of decrepit
housing blocks.)</TE>
<TE>   Such an approach could have given these communities a deeper sense
of cultural identity. It could make invisible communities suddenly
visible, weaving them into the city's broader cultural fabric. But
the idea was never discussed.</TE>
<TE>   Like other architects who have struggled with how to recapture
architecture's social relevance, Libeskind claims the answer is not
to abandon hope, but to return to a more humanist vision of
architecture's role.</TE>
<TE>   "A life without utopian dreams would not be worth living," he
says. "But I think the ethics now evolves from dealing directly with
the human condition. Architecture should be thought of more like
surgery than mathematics."</TE>
<TE>   Pipe dreams? Maybe. But architecture and city planning in this
country could use an infusion of idealism. We are the richest country
in the world. Our architects rank among the most creative. Why not
invest some of that creativity where it is needed most?</TE>
<TE>   Nicolai Ouroussoff is The Times' architecture critic.</TE>

<HD>Some real grace notes</HD>
<DH>'Will &amp; Grace's' Megan Mullally goes far off the well-trod
'moon/June' path to find songs for her new album.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Dutka</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hard to believe, but Megan Mullally -- the pampered, helium-voiced
Park Avenue socialite-cum-office assistant Karen Walker on "Will &amp;
Grace" -- can sing. Among her credits: recording jingles and
performing in a rock band, a jazz trio and a four-part harmony group.</LD>
<LD>   After landing in the Broadway revivals of "Grease" and "How to
Succeed in Business Without Really Trying," the Oklahoma City native
appeared in "Sweetheart," a 1999 one-woman show at West Hollywood's
Coast Playhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Recently, she released her second album, "Big as a Berry" -- an
eclectic mix of standards, rock, country and blues that she and her
band, the Supreme Music Program, recorded in 2 1/2 days.</LD>
<TE>   Some critics speculated that this album was a way of
differentiating yourself from your TV character -- playing different
notes, literally and figuratively.</TE>
<TE>   I actually formed my band five years ago, before "Will &amp; Grace."
Singing isn't an attempt to branch out, but who I really am. I like
less commercial and conventional material than the acting jobs I get.
Those roles are flights of fancy. Though I collaborate with my band,
it's my music, my vision. I pick the songs. I'm a control freak, very
hands-on.</TE>
<TE>   Some songwriters -- Bertolt Brecht &amp; Kurt Weill, Randy Newman, Tom
Waits -- surfaced in both of your albums. Why are you drawn to them?</TE>
<TE>   Singing, to me, is acting on pitch. I decided not to go for sound,
vocal gymnastics, but for songs that tell a story. Each of them is
written in the voice of a character who drops you off in a little
world. Newman's "Real Emotional Girl" and Bobbie Gentry's "Fancy"
could probably be done as monologues. I try to avoid generic "June,
moon, spoon" pieces ... ear candy without content. What matters is
creating something people can connect with. And my approach: very
lo-fi. Albums can be flat-lined when you overproduce them, spending
six months in the studio. "Big as a Berry," by the way, is selling
great ... without a single, a video or radio play.</TE>
<TE>   Critics panned "Sweetheart," your one-woman show. Was that a
setback?</TE>
<TE>   "Sweetheart" was an assault, a dark piece of performance art that
didn't pander to expectations. Audiences loved it, but critics didn't
want to play along. In the wake of "Will &amp; Grace," someone said, they
expected me to adopt a Park Avenue persona, singing Judy Garland
songs on a little pink poof. People get stuck because they're afraid
to fail.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't the role of Karen strain your vocal cords?</TE>
<TE>   Nah.... It involves my tongue more than my voice. It's nasal, in
fact. And a lot of that stuff is psychological. Some singers wear a
wool scarf in the summer but, during "How to Succeed," I didn't even
warm up sometimes. And I never took singing lessons because I'm
intuitive rather than analytical. When I was 4, I began singing songs
from the radio and my parents' albums. As an only child, I had a
desperate need for self-expression.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike a lot of singers, you don't change the lyrics of songs
written in the male voice.</TE>
<TE>   I sing a song the way the writer wrote it. I want to be
respectful. And why can't a woman sing love songs like "Ruby's Arms"
or "Marie" without changing it to "Rudy's Arms" or "Murray"? People
want to prescribe rules but I don't want to be limited. Everyone is
innately bisexual. Some people just realize it to a greater degree
than others.</TE>

<LD>Percussionist Ravi Jakhotia, a.k.a. Ravidrums, spun through the
warmly lighted dining room, firing off anecdotes and observations so
rapidly that he eventually had to stop to catch his breath. It was a
busy night for the Indian artist, just back from a tour with J
records' new artist Lamya. He had his hands full coordinating
performers for the Ahimsa Music Group show, which stopped at the
Sunset Room in Hollywood on Nov. 21.</LD>
<LD>   "It's crazy!" he said as a woman draped in a shimmering tangerine
sari danced amid blooming pink trees on giant television screens
behind him. Nearby, a flock of young women draped in a rainbow of
saris distributed metal bangles and bindis to female guests.</LD>
<LD>   As Jakhotia's eyes searched the vast nightclub, he listed the
performers on the evening's bill -- all of whom incorporate South
Asian culture into their music. Later, the Doors' Ray Manzarek would
take the stage, as a personal favor, Jakhotia explained. The two men
met recently in a New Jersey airport. As Jakhotia's story goes, he
approached Manzarek and said, "Thank you for all the music." Now
they're performing on each other's new records. The Doors "were so
hip to the Indian thing the first time around," Jakhotia said.</LD>
<TE>   The evening was hosted by the Ahimsa Fund, a San Francisco-based
charity founded after 9/11 to promote cultural understanding among
American, South Asian and Arab communities. ("Ahimsa" means
nonviolence.) Three Indian Americans in their mid-20s -- Vijay
Chattha, Nihal Mehta and Tejas Patel -- launched the fund after two
South Asians were killed in hate crimes after the terrorist attacks.
"We wanted to find a way to unite all these groups, to create a
dialogue with events and do it through music," Chattha said.</TE>
<TE>   Through ticket sales during the last year, the Ahimsa Fund has
raised $20,000 for its parent charity, Shakti Krupa, a Florida-based
group that funds education and hospital construction in India. Ahimsa
has also raised funds for the families of the two hate-crime victims,
has donated equipment to a Hindu temple in Ontario, Canada, that was
burned down, and is helping fund development of the first gallery of
Sikh heritage at the National Museum of Natural History in
Washington, D.C. The recent L.A. show raised $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   At the Sunset Room, club co-owner Raj Kanodia got comfortable on a
leather chair the color of caramel. He motioned subtly to Tarsem
Singh, director of "The Cell," slouched low in the next chair. "He's
the next M. Night Shyamalan," Kanodia said conspiratorially. Then he
regained his sense of purpose. "Being a plastic surgeon, I want to
inject my Indian culture, with its sound, movies and fashion.... I'm
more like a cultural ambassador." He paused and waved at a woman as
she walked by. "She represents Botox," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Around 11 p.m., the club erupted into a storm of drumming and
dancing, with Jakhotia behind a rock drum set on stage and a stout,
white-robed man in the crowd pounding a two-sided drum, his white
turban vibrating with every beat.</TE>
<TE>   On the TV screens, the words to the John Lennon song "Imagine"
appeared over Bollywood film clips of gorgeous women dancing in a
gilded palace. Two Anglo guests seemed especially intoxicated by the
evening. A man with shoulder-length hair and a knotted goatee leaned
toward a woman wearing a thigh-length sari that was sky blue and
glitter-shot, and said: "You do have kind of like an aura around
you." She smiled appreciatively.</TE>

<LD>Sure, there was too much lag time between dinner and the awards
ceremony. And maybe the puppies on the auction block got more
attention than the honorees. But the annual Imagine Awards benefit
for Inner-City Arts had its heart in the right place, honoring
co-founder Bob Bates and raising $350,000 for its arts school for
impoverished kids.</LD>
<LD>   "They say that time is infinite -- and so is the duration of this
event," quipped "Friends" co-star Lisa Kudrow, winner with Bates and
philanthropist Wallis Annenberg of Imagine Awards at the Nov. 21
event at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Humbly, Kudrow kept the spotlight
on Bates when she was recognized for her long support of the free
South-Central school founded in 1989. "Bob Bates is what Inner-City
Arts is all about. I love the story of how, when he was meditating,
he heard a voice telling him to 'create an art space.' He kept
saying, 'No, I can't!' " Kudrow said. "And when he finally did,
everything fell into place. Learning to open up to things that don't
seem possible is what art is all about. That's why I'm a big fan of
Inner-City Arts."</LD>
<TE>   Serving 8,000 students each year, the school broke ground last
month on an addition that will "more than double its size," said
executive director Cynthia Harnisch. Besides honoring its supporters,
the celebration of the opportunity to give more children a chance to
explore dance, drama, music and animation is what the gala was all
about, she said. "We serve the downtown children, the children in
extreme poverty who have all the bright promise of all children --
absolutely gifted, absolutely capable."</TE>

<HD>Six poets on the fast track</HD>
<DH>The Underground Poets Railroad, merging verse and a hip-hop
vibe, won't stop till it reaches spoken-word success.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The warmup act is a DJ who's spinning Chuck D, A Tribe Called Quest
and other rappers at the Knitting Factory. On this weeknight, the
main-stage headliners -- not music, not comedy, guess again -- have
sold out the sleek Hollywood club, which offers Internet stations and
a candlelit balcony for guests with a certain wristband. Lights dim.
The crowd surges.</LD>
<LD>   The poets are in the house.</LD>
<LD>   Six poets in their 20s and 30s take the stage, the rock stars of
an emerging spoken-word scene that merges poetry, hip-hop culture and
theater into a polished production package. The ensemble, known as
the Underground Poets Railroad, is banking off the popularity of
other high-profile spoken-word productions such as the hit show
"Russell Simmons Def Poetry Jam on Broadway," a spinoff of the HBO
poetry jam series.</LD>
<TE>   The underground poets recently completed a national tour produced
by acclaimed filmmakers Kip and Kern Konwiser, who filmed the
eight-day road trip for a documentary. Now, in private workshops in
Los Angeles, the Konwiser brothers are inviting industry
professionals to pitch in with suggestions on staging and content
that could help catapult the show to bigger venues. Plans also are in
the works for the group to do another national tour next year and
other projects that will be developed with the Konwisers' partner,
Bruce George, executive producer of HBO's show.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe spoken word is the next major movement in hip-hop
culture that will cross over into the mainstream," said Kern
Konwiser, 34. "We've seen it happen with rap and fashion and street
basketball, and we think spoken word is next.... We want to be part
of that trend."</TE>
<TE>   These days, spoken-word events are hot tickets, with theatergoers
willing to pay as much as $65 a pop for the Broadway show or $10 each
at the Knitting Factory -- unreal admission prices to poets who
usually read at donation-only open-microphone events or poetry slam
competitions.</TE>
<TE>   "We sold over 500 tickets to this joint for poetry in a few days,"
Kip Konwiser told members of the Knitting Factory audience, who
ranged from their 20s to their 50s, wearing an eclectic mix of blue
jeans, pearls, knit caps and nose rings. "In Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The Konwiser brothers, who produced the multiple Emmy-winning HBO
movie "Miss Evers' Boys," plucked the little-known poets from local
venues such as Da' Poetry Lounge. The lounge, one of the country's
hottest spoken-word events, is held in the Fairfax district at the
Greenway Court Theatre, also the breeding ground for Def Poetry
performers.</TE>
<TE>   The underground poets ensemble is made up of Steve Connell, Gina
Loring, Sekou (Tha Misfit), Jerry Quickley and Jaha Zainabu of the
Los Angeles area; and Laura "Piece" Kelly of Seattle. They are poets
who are more accustomed to shouting over the whir of coffeehouse
blenders than performing at places like the Knitting Factory, where
patrons watched the show on video monitors or stood on the dance
floor. The recent performance at the Knitting Factory, a benefit for
KPFK-FM (90.7), was an encore presentation of the national tour; no
other dates are scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   The Knitting Factory's national booking director, John Pantle,
said he wouldn't hesitate to book the underground poets again. "It's
a fantastic synergy of art forms ... and a genre that is
underappreciated in the Los Angeles market," he said. "We hope to
become a catalyst to do more of these events."</TE>
<TE>   The Konwisers came up with the underground poets concept at the
request of Green Bay Packers defensive end Joe Johnson, who had asked
them to develop a project to pay tribute to the 12 African American
firefighters who died in the Sept. 11 attacks. Proceeds from the sale
of TV rights for the documentary, along with video and CD sales, will
go to the families of the firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   Melding Ginsberg and Eminem</TE>
<TE>   On stage, at the Knitting Factory, the poets basked in spotlights
that turned amber or periwinkle or watermelon-colored, and in front
of a burnt-orange backdrop with the group's lantern logo. They
recited poems individually and together, with the rat-tat delivery of
rappers (except these are poets, and you can understand every word)
or the soulful lyricism of Alicia Keys.</TE>
<TE>   They pranced, Eminem-style, or they chanted in a Greek chorus
drone, accompanied by a five-piece jazz group. They pumped their
fists in the air and ranted, with the same fire and swagger of Allen
Ginsberg and Lenny Bruce, touching on topics of love and war and the
importance of airing voices in any military action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In the opening number, the group, standing at microphones, hummed
and whispered and echoed the prose of Connell, who wore jeans and an
untucked collared shirt, as his voice rose to a blistering pitch:
"Thoughts will jabber about for lifetimes and, if their forms cannot
be fastened in prose, then their form will take shape elsewise. They
will come out.... You cannot kill a poet."</TE>
<TE>   After the 75-minute show, the crowd erupted in applause. Some
reached up to the stage to hug or shake hands with the poets. "I
thought it was raw, in your face, like, 'Wake up!' " said Chuck
Crook, 40, a meditation teacher in Malibu. "I felt like I was in a
march.... I got my heart, my humanity back."</TE>
<TE>   Later, underground poet (Tha Misfit), 30, said he loves the feel
of a professional show and doesn't worry about alienating his core
audience, the poetry fans who prefer the indie vibe of small,
bare-bones performances. "We are the core audience," he said of the
underground poets. At a bigger venue, with proper lighting, "you can
capture the mood. You can capture the theatrical element.... You
really have all the dynamics going. Light and sound, a little reverb,
the band playing. You can really capture the essence of the poetry."</TE>
<TE>   He and the rest of the group, including Loring, 24, stuck around
after the show to sign their CDs. "It's really nice to be taken
seriously," Loring said. "This really allows us to be literally in
the spotlight. That's what poetry deserves." She apologized for
having to break away from a conversation. Her manager kept pulling
her away. He had people for her to meet.</TE>

<LD>There's a new man in town -- the New York Times' Charlie LeDuff,
who's dusting off his parachute and, like many a transplant before
him, discovering the shocking truth about Los Angeles. (It's in a
desert! Traffic's terrible!) A sampling from the dispatches:</LD>
<LD>   On wildlife: "Across Beverly Hills and the other lush corridors of
Los Angeles, rats -- yellow-bellied, pink-tailed, flea-bitten rats --
are wriggling through the woodwork and rooftops. They have come down
from the trees and in from the fields, forced into neighborhoods by a
strangling drought that has gripped the region. They are eating from
dog bowls and drinking from swimming pools and acting in surly ways
not normal to the genus."</LD>
<LD>   On Hollywood Boulevard and the drug trade: "The whole spectrum of
the human condition is on display on the boulevard: the homeless,
prostitutes, a methadone clinic, the Greyhound bus terminal, neon
lights, tourists, the Walk of Fame, Grauman's Chinese Theatre. It is
without question the most famous street in Los Angeles. It hums like
an electric razor; midnight shadows creep along just enough to make
it feel dangerous."</LD>
<TE>   On the weather: "The city is uneasy this afternoon. A plague has
descended from the sky and shattered the warm, mundane bliss. It is
raining in Los Angeles, a rare and frightening thing.... Rain is a
dark and destructive stranger to Angelenos, who draw their water not
from local lakes and rivers, but from hundreds of miles across the
desert...."</TE>

<LD>Considering the general inanity of the stuff that network television
successfully foists off as family entertainment, CBS' plan to
resurrect the "Beverly Hillbillies" of the 1960s with real-life
hillbillies in the role of Jed Clampett's brood should be a big hit
and a gonzo moneymaker -- and another swipe at rural America.</LD>
<LD>   Auditions underway in Appalachia and the rural South are in search
of new "stars" who will soon hie off to Southern California to be
settled in opulence, furnished with undreamed quantities of cash and
set loose to explore strange and wonderful new circumstances.
Naturally, they will be followed by cameras recording their
slack-jawed amazement and grateful appreciation of Beverly Hills'
(read modern or enlightened) civilization, culture and amenities.</LD>
<LD>   A new generation will be as amused as the last one was when old
Jed, awash in money from oil discovered on his land in the Ozarks,
moved Granny, his buxom daughter, Elly May, and cousin, Jethro, to
Beverly Hills. The saga of the Clampetts attracted as many as 60
million viewers each week. In spite of CBS' solemn assurances that
the forthcoming "Real Hillbillies" will be rich with social insight,
the setup assures that the production will be offensive.</LD>
<TE>   In the original, the actors left no doubt that they were engaged
in outlandish buffoonery. This time we shall see real rural people
put on display in circumstances reeking of condescension. Young
urbanites and recent immigrants unfamiliar with Jeb, Granny, Elly May
and Jethro will be left to conclude that the bumfuzzled new
hillbillies are more or less typical of rural Americans, who
constitute 20% of the nation's population.</TE>
<TE>   If the production comes to pass, this social commentary will no
doubt enjoy huge ratings in the very areas being scoured for its
unwitting stars, but a great many activists, academics and proud
ordinary folk regard the prospect with revulsion. They have not been
in such a snit since Robert Schenkkan was awarded the 1992 Pulitzer
Prize for "The Kentucky Cycle," an epic play sodden with violence,
greed and depravity, and presuming to offer profound insight.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Southerners and mountain folk are somewhat culpable
for their region's image as Dogpatch incarnate. Entertainers from the
region have eagerly promoted the hillbilly image. Across the region,
hillbilly motifs are on exhibit nearly as prominently as Old Glory.</TE>
<TE>   But there is quite a difference between self-deprecation and being
manipulated, stereotyped and commercialized by outsiders. The plan to
use real-life Clampetts for mass amusement is more than a cute scheme
to cash in again on a weathered target of ridicule. Rather, it is a
symptom of the mass media's lack of regard for rural America, a
detachment manifest not only in sitcoms' affinity for Southern
hillbillies, hicks and rubes but in urban news organizations' general
disinterest in rural issues.</TE>
<TE>   The point was well made by novelist Gurney Norman after "The
Kentucky Cycle" fizzled on Broadway (after an enthusiastic West Coast
opening). The essential problem with the play, Norman wrote, was not
that it dwelt on stereotypically violent, cruel, greedy and ignorant
people but that it willfully omitted positive images that were
equally relevant.</TE>
<TE>   CBS has not heard the last protest against the reality
hillbillies. Rural Strategies, a new nonprofit organization created
to give voice to rural America, will soon undertake a national
campaign featuring paid ads to shame the network for perpetuating
negative rural stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately, the group is based in Whitesburg, Ky., home of the
late Harry Caudill, author of the saga "Night Comes to the
Cumberlands." Caudill's chronicle of central Appalachia's
impoverishment by corporate plundering of the region's mineral and
timber wealth provided important political stimulus for the War on
Poverty and passage of federal legislation on strip mining and mine
safety.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Caudill's stark portrayal of mountain people provided
the fodder for the dark characters of "The Kentucky Cycle" and for
television producers who continue to find nonurbanites quite funny
and altogether irrelevant.</TE>

<HD>Keep Bush Out of the Forests</HD>
<DH>President's public lands policy is baloney.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What is it that the vast majority of Americans want but aren't
getting? What is it that Democrats stand for but are willing to fight
for only fitfully? What is it that Republicans claim they favor but
really don't?</LD>
<LD>   Call it common sense. Or, more grandly, our future.</LD>
<LD>   Either way, it's time to say "enough" to the Bush administration's
baloney about restoring balance to the management of our public lands
and our environment. Restoration? Let's quickly restore some fairness
and foresight before it's too you-know-what.</LD>
<TE>   Last week's decision by George W. Bush to open our national
forests to more quick-profit exploitation by lumbermen, oilmen and
barons of industrialized recreation is a shocking step backward to
the profligate ways of the 19th century. No, it's worse than that. In
the 19th century Americans at least had Teddy Roosevelt to raise
their awareness of nature's fragile treasures. To do worse by
Roosevelt now in the 21st century is an affront. The eye of history
will record it as a scandal. It's a body blow to our shared wild
lands, our wildlife and what remains of our heritage of nature.
Enough.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how you want to read the elections just concluded, there
was no mandate, or even the hint of one, for this kind of
return-to-pillage across 192 million acres that Americans hold in
communal trust. A postelection CBS/New York Times poll found that
voters, by a margin of 2 to 1, still believe that even in wartime,
environmental protection is more important than oil development, let
alone stepped-up clear-cutting of forests.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a day after that poll was published, in an announcement timed
to land when families were preoccupied with the Thanksgiving holiday,
this president, who promised to be president for us all, opened our
155 national forests and 20 national grasslands to industry
management. Instead of having a national policy for protecting
wildlife and scenic values, instead of giving the health of the
environment a legal edge over exploitation for profit, the decisions
for use of our forest and grasslands will be handed over to foresters
at each site.</TE>
<TE>   No, not to independent-minded forestry professionals. These forest
managers are political appointees who answer up a military-style
chain of command to the administration's chief environmental hatchet
man, Mark Rey, a career lobbyist and mouthpiece for the timber
industry who now sits as undersecretary of the Department of
Agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   This is how the new forest management will work: From the mouth of
logging companies to Rey's ear down to his underlings, who will march
in step or get stepped on, hut, hut. The administration calls it
public involvement. Enough.</TE>
<TE>   In some quarters, this decision is being cast as the Bush
administration merely undoing the extremist work of the Clinton
administration. But that's far from the real story. In truth, Bill
Clinton was anything but an extremist on forestry. As on many issues,
he was a eager compromiser. The timber industry got what it could
from him, and now has made its grab for all the rest.</TE>
<TE>   A logging industry spokesman was quoted as saying that the new
system would merely restore "common sense ... and I don't think it
will necessarily mean more tree removal." But if you have covered the
timber wars as I have, you'd know different: If the loggers were
handed a policy that didn't allow them to "remove" more trees and
fast, they'd be screaming mad.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, they're cheering. You figure it.</TE>
<TE>   The administration says its new rules, which take effect in 90
days, will cut the time it takes to devise management plans for
individual forests from six years to two. But wait, folks. What's the
hurry? Aren't forests supposed to be forever? These management plans
will guide decisions for the next decade and a half. The
administration says the public needn't worry, even though the new
rules no longer require protection of troubled fish and wildlife.
Imagine. As for assessing the environmental consequences of forest
uses, Rey's troopers will now have the path clear to do it in
shorthand.</TE>
<TE>   Common sense? Don't believe it. I've spent hours flying over our
public forests in survey planes. Yes, sometimes clear-cuts mimic the
fires of nature, and landscapes re-bloom quickly. But there are huge
swaths of our public lands ruined for short-term gain: great
hillsides now barren because seedlings won't grow in the hot sun of
our changing climate, vast mountain slopes stripped by landslides
when trees are cut and nothing is left to hold back erosion, webs of
streams and rivers choked with debris and rendered lifeless by mud,
wildlife habitat chopped into incoherent pieces.</TE>
<TE>   That's what forestry regulations are supposed to regulate: the
good from the bad. This remaining slice of our shared lands should
serve more than logging companies trying to drive up their quarterly
stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   Balance? Try this experiment in resource management. Take a sheet
of paper and call it your forest. Tear it in two, saving half and
using the other half. A balanced approach, you see. Then, take the
preserved half and apply the same rules by tearing it in two again.
Carry on for a while and you'll see that what you end up with is a
pretty tiny scrap of paper. There comes a time to say "enough."</TE>

<HD>'Nonlethal' Weapons Put Humanity at Risk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Hatch Rosenberg and Mark L. Wheelis</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The same technological revolution that is now accelerating the
development of new medical products is also making it possible for
coercive regimes to manipulate human beings by altering their
psychological processes, controlling their behavior, interfering with
reproduction or tampering with inheritance -- and even to do so
without the knowledge of the victims.</LD>
<LD>   The International Red Cross, not usually alarmist, has taken the
unusual step of issuing an urgent appeal to prevent the use of this
technology as a weapon through hostile manipulation of fundamental
life processes.</LD>
<LD>   Weapons with these unprecedented capabilities have been outlawed,
along with other chemical and biological weapons. Some nations,
however, are trying to legitimize the development of so-called
"nonlethal" weapons, citing their potential usefulness in situations
like the recent Moscow hostage crisis.</LD>
<TE>   The United States has been trying for years to find a chemical
incapacitating agent that would act rapidly and safely, but one of
the participating scientists says that what happened in Moscow, where
the "nonlethal" aerosol used to subdue the hostage-takers killed
about 120 of the 750 hostages, is indicative of the problems they
face. With any substance delivered through the air in an emergency
action, it is impossible to control individual doses. A significant
degree of lethality is inevitable. If development of "nonlethal"
weapons is allowed, chemical agents will soon be available for
incapacitating human beings by inflicting intense pain, altering
bodily functions or controlling mood, thought and consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Delivery methods include dart guns, aerosols, even viruses. The
temporary advantage these weapons might provide in a hostage
situation will soon be countered by terrorists in gas masks, but the
potential for controlling human beings will persist. The power of
"nonlethal" weapons -- not simply death and destruction but
manipulation of people and populations -- will constitute an enormous
temptation.</TE>
<TE>   The risks for humanity go far beyond the threat of terrorism. We
are on the verge of an arms race sparked by the misleading term
"nonlethal" -- which was coined to sell this weaponry to the public
-- and the Moscow hostage crisis, which is providing an excuse for
nations to acquire such weapons. Yet as a military contractor in the
field acknowledged just after the surviving hostages were rescued,
such weapons are "not the silver bullet that some people think."</TE>
<TE>   When one country develops these weapons, there will be a strong
impetus for other countries to do so, lest they be threatened by
them. History shows that once a weapon is in a country's arsenal, it
is likely to be used, not always for the purpose originally intended.
For example, tear gas, a riot-control agent, was used in the Vietnam
War to increase the reach and deadliness of conventional weapons.</TE>
<TE>   That is why the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993 and the
Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972 outlawed the
possession of chemical and biological weapons, even though their use
was already prohibited by the Geneva Protocol of 1925.</TE>
<TE>   Most "nonlethal" weapons are toxin derivatives. The biological
convention categorically prohibits them, but this has been routinely
ignored. The chemical convention also prohibits them but contains an
undefined exemption for "law enforcement," a gaping loophole that
threatens to undo the ban.</TE>
<TE>   The 153 chemical convention signatories will have an opportunity
to limit that loophole in April, when the convention is scheduled to
be reviewed. Yet it is already apparent that many governments want to
leave their options open. Unless there is public pressure, there will
be no barrier to the development of toxin weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The technology to develop semi-lethal and potentially manipulative
weapons is not just a future possibility; it is here now. In many
ways, "nonlethals" are more frightening than nuclear weapons. Once
they proliferate, it will be too late to stop them.</TE>
<TE>   We need to insist on immediate action by our government, jointly
with other countries, to prevent the exploitation of biotechnology in
ways that could threaten not just life but human autonomy and the
most basic human rights.</TE>

<HD>India's Voiceless Women Are Easy Prey for AIDS</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Meena Seshu and Joanne Csete</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The $100 million that Bill Gates' philanthropy will add to the battle
against HIV and AIDS in India is a welcome expression of concern for
what Gates rightly portrays as one of the worst epidemics in the
world. But the Gates Foundation's generous support may be undone by
factors that neither the government of India nor its donors are
addressing: the voicelessness of women and increasing violence
against those most affected by the epidemic.</LD>
<LD>   The Indian government clings to the idea that the epidemic is
limited to such "high-risk groups" as sex workers, drug users and men
who have sex with men and that targeting these groups with
information about condoms and how AIDS is transmitted is the best
strategy to contain the epidemic.</LD>
<LD>   Yet this no longer reflects the reality of AIDS, at least for the
Indian states where it is in the general population. In these states,
women who have sex only with their husbands may be the group at
highest risk of HIV transmission.</LD>
<TE>   The long-standing subordination of women and girls in Indian
society takes on lethal dimensions with the rapid spread of HIV.
Though men can experiment with sex outside of marriage without any
social stigma, women do not even have the status to demand that
husbands who may bring sexually transmitted diseases home use
condoms.</TE>
<TE>   Many Indian women are experiencing what their African sisters have
known for years: that being left a widow by a man who dies from AIDS
is a ticket to abandonment by his family and dire poverty and
discrimination. And although they are a high-risk group for HIV
transmission and the worst consequences of AIDS, most government
programs ignore married women.</TE>
<TE>   Even in those Indian states where the epidemic may still be
contained among traditionally vulnerable groups, violence undermines
HIV and AIDS programs. Prostitutes are continually subjected to
violence by police officers, who take their cue from society's
condemnation of these women. All of this stands to get worse as
religious fundamentalism and the moral judgments that go with it
increasingly become defining features of political power in India.</TE>
<TE>   The violence of AIDS-related stigma also confronts AIDS educators,
homosexual men and other marginalized people.</TE>
<TE>   The most effective education on HIV transmission is done by those
trusted by the community at risk. This means that sex workers have
the best chance of helping other sex workers protect themselves from
HIV. But peer education is not getting a fair chance in India. The
police apparently do not recognize the lifesaving work done by AIDS
educators, and these people face consistent abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Indian government and its well-meaning donors seem to
think that HIV prevention alone can succeed, ignoring the needs of
millions already living with HIV and AIDS. These people continue to
face abuse and discrimination in the health-care system, and unless
they are rich they can hardly hope for the basics of treatment of
even secondary infections, let alone medicines for HIV itself.</TE>
<TE>   India is one of the biggest producers of the drugs that have
transformed the lives of people with AIDS in wealthy countries, yet
millions of Indians cannot get these medicines.</TE>
<TE>   The Gates Foundation can do India and its own investment a favor
by insisting that the money be used to help the voiceless women with
HIV and AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Meena Seshu, founder and general secretary of the organization
Sangram, which works with sex workers and rural women in Sangli,
India, was named a Human Rights Defender by Human Rights Watch.
Joanne Csete is director of the HIV/AIDS and human rights program at
Human Rights Watch.</TE>

<LD>I admire Susan Baskin's courage to confront her painful identity with
Judaism ("Out of Hiding," Oct. 27). Many of us who are the offspring
of Holocaust survivors grew up in the shadow of trauma and loss,
whether it was discussed or not. In my field of clinical psychology,
the term "vicarious traumatization" describes how one can be
indirectly emotionally injured by hearing or knowing of the horror
that someone close to them lived through. Like Baskin, I have
struggled to come to terms with how people can perpetrate such
horrendous acts on others and how we are to feel safe in a world
where this can happen. The answer still eludes me.</LD>

<LD>For whom are you writing these Sunday magazine stories? Or, more
importantly, who comes up with your story and issue ideas? As I read
the Nov. 10 issue ("The Art of Entertaining," Special Design Issue),
I couldn't help thinking that I, as a regular Times reader, have no
place sticking my nose in your glossy (in both prose style and stock
type) magazine pages.</LD>
<LD>   I've concluded that the editors and writers must come from the
ranks of [those] who read and relate to your magazine. Who else would
find the parties of entitled, ennobled, enlightened 20-something
designer couples interesting ("Life of the Party," by Peter McQuaid)?
They party in the hotel they helped design and are so socially gifted
that they can flit from one brief conversation to another, all the
while claiming how well they're getting to know their new friends.</LD>

<HD>Admiring Willis Edwards' Ideals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your wonderfully crafted cover article on thorny social entrepreneur
Willis Edwards resonates with truth ("The Fixer," by John L.
Mitchell, Nov. 3). I worked with Willis for several years at USC in
the late '70s and early '80s, and I can tell you that he is one of
the most creative and intelligent people I have ever met. As the
article pointed out, his love and dedication to the plight of the
common person is extraordinary. He advised students on their problems
and life choices, and he mentored a new class of future American
leaders in business, entertainment and politics.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, Willis is a "fixer" and an ideas man, but he's also an ideals
man. Everything in the world was once, at some time, just an idea in
someone's mind. We are blessed and made richer and better as a
society by those who fix our conscious minds on our real treasures.
Thank you for some good news.</LD>

<HD>An Inside Look at Prison Rape</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The article on prison rape could not have been clearer ("Rape. How
Funny Is It?" by Fred Dickey, Nov. 3). California prison guards do,
in fact, use rape as a tool for obtaining confidential information
from gang leaders and gang members about inmates involved in drug
trafficking, stabbings and so on. Prison guards do not care about who
rapes whom because they know that the public doesn't care. I believe
that California prison guards should be considered co-conspirators to
these sexual crimes because they don't do anything to stop them. As
for the "Booty Bandit" who raped inmate Eddie Dillard, more than
1,000 of us inmates and more than 200 prison guards knew who the
bandit was. What makes society believe that this could not have been
prevented? Keep your focus on prison rape. Help stop it now!</LD>

<TE>   The California Department of Corrections' indifference to the
spread of HIV among inmates can be summed up easily: Condoms are
prohibited in the prisons. While the Los Angeles County and San
Francisco jails make condoms available, the inmates in California
prisons (many of whom return to society and join the dating pool) are
denied basic protection. The AIDS epidemic cannot be fought with such
a primitive policy. Denying condoms to inmates defies logic.
California would rather spend millions of dollars on medical care for
HIV/AIDS inmates than permit condoms in prisons.</TE>

<HD>Environmentalists, Vintners Face Off in Napa Valley</HD>
<DH>Guidelines are issued on ecosystem management and natural
resource conservation. But activists say there have been abuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louise Chu</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. HELENA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>To the 5 million tourists who visit Napa Valley each year, the quiet
community offers an idyllic escape to a place where the wealth and
the wine are always flowing.</LD>
<LD>   But behind the picturesque charm of this viticultural Mecca brews
an ongoing battle between vintners and environmentalists over the
narrow stretch of land, 40 miles north of San Francisco, that has the
wine industry looking for ways to stave off increased government
regulation.</LD>
<LD>   The Wine Institute and the California Assn. of Winegrape Growers
recently released the industry's first set of statewide environmental
standards, including a 490-page workbook that offers vintners and
growers guidelines on natural resource conservation, ecosystems
management and employment practices.</LD>
<TE>   "The wine industry is one of the most regulated industries in
America and whenever there's a problem, there's always a tendency to
impose laws," said Dennis Groth, chairman of the San Francisco-based
Wine Institute, which represents more than 600 wineries producing 92%
of California wine. "We would like to think we don't need government
telling us how to farm."</TE>
<TE>   But as Napa Valley's wine industry has soared to new heights in
the last decade, local environmental activists say too many bottom
line-driven companies have used unlimited farming methods that
pollute the land, drain natural resources and kill wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a small sector among the vintners whose projects have
been most controversial, but it is pervasive in that people want to
do what they want with their land there," said James Conaway, who has
written two books chronicling the rise of the Napa wine industry and
its bitter conflict with environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   In his new book, "The Far Side of Eden," Conaway indicts the wave
of new-money millionaires from Silicon Valley, who have brought with
them gaudy displays of wealth -- building so-called "McMansions" and
planting "vanity vineyards" -- and little agricultural integrity.</TE>
<TE>   Their presence has created a backlash, as Napa County residents
have passed dozens of local ordinances and environmental groups have
filed lawsuits to preserve the area's natural beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Among the biggest environmental issues in Napa has been soil
erosion and watershed contamination caused by increased hillside
development. Napa County has since enacted an ordinance requiring
county approval of vineyards on slopes of 5 degrees or more.</TE>
<TE>   The local government has also acted to enforce urban limit lines
and create watershed task forces.</TE>
<TE>   Napa County has had good ordinances but hasn't enforced them well,
Conaway said.</TE>
<TE>   The local Sierra Club sued the county in 2000, calling for
stronger implementation of the hillside ordinance, and it has another
suit pending to protect the wetland habitat of vernal shrimp from
development by Beringer Blass Wine Estates.</TE>
<TE>   "Napa's a microcosm of what's going on statewide," said Chris
Malan, political co-chairwoman of the Redwood chapter of the Sierra
Club, which filed the lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Similar issues with vineyard development have sprung up around the
state, including the Central Coast and Central Valley, although it's
been happening at an "exponential rate" in Napa, Malan said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Napa Valley, much of the development is driven by the high
demand for Napa grapes and the scarcity of available agricultural
land, said John DeLuca, Wine Institute president. That's also led to
changes in growing practices necessary to keep the area healthy for
generations to come. California vintners want to keep the thriving
industry in the state and not just become "the international bottlers
of other people's juice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The code earned the support of a number of government agencies and
environmental groups, including the California Department of Food and
Agriculture, the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Protection
Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Stephens, assistant secretary for environmental management
and sustainability at the California EPA, said that the program is a
"good start" and that his agency is planning to send the Wine
Institute and grape growers a proposal to partner with them in its
development.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to encourage them to fully implement it to yield
results," Stephens said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Sierra Club, however, have had a mixed reaction to
the industry's effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say they're environmentally conscious," Malan said. "I
would say that they are waking up, and now they have to walk the
walk."</TE>
<TE>   She added that there were still significant issues with habitat
protection and chemical pesticide use that need to be addressed.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry is not embracing true sustainability until they move
toward organic production," Malan said.</TE>
<TE>   But Tim Frank, legislative representative for the state chapter,
said it would be a mistake to expect the code to solve every
environmental problem. "There's a difference between ideal and a step
moving in the right direction, and this is just a matter of the
industry adopting a best practices guide that we would consider steps
in right direction."</TE>

Encounters," the half-hour cable access shows that bring together
young musicians and elementary or secondary school students.</LD>
<LD>   The three new shows, featuring violinist Tami Kawakubo, pianist
June Asai and soprano Jessica Tivens, will be broadcast by Los
Angeles cable-access channel LA36, bringing to 60 the total of
televised "Musical Encounters" Kunin has produced in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Now 89, Kunin, founded the Debut Orchestra and Young Musicians
Foundation 50 years ago. "As always," she says, "our purpose is to

<HD>Hope for a community in a few lines of verse</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Poetry, W.H. Auden famously said, "makes nothing happen." Can it keep
a bunch of hippies from being evicted from their canyon hideaways?
Whether verse can stop the bulldozers ... well, you can't blame the
Lower Topanga Community Assn. for trying.</LD>
<LD>   Today they're staging "Lost Lives," a concert, poetry reading and
appearance by "performance painter" Norton Wisdom, to protest the
uprooting of residents from their homes and the likely closing of
restaurants and shops along Pacific Coast Highway.</LD>
<LD>   "This little community is such a utopia," says Will Willoughby,
Topanga resident and organizer. "It's a throwback to the '60s -- the
people really look out for each other. They're writers, they're
artists."</LD>
<TE>   But not for long. Say goodbye to those groovy homes and funky
shops like Malibu Feed Bin and Ginger Snips Salon and Spa. "We'll
probably end up becoming a Gray Davis Visitors Center," he says,
conjuring up the image of tourists relieving themselves on a site
that once made up the Reel Inn's picnic tables.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Los Angeles Athletic Club sold a patch of land --
1,659 acres from the Pacific Coast Highway to Topanga Canyon Park --
to the California Department of Parks and Recreation. Residents
received a letter from the deal's broker saying they'd have to clear
out by Dec. 12 or be evicted. That day's getting close.</TE>
<TE>   The parks department, though, says it's acquiring the land for
pretty, uh, utopian reasons. "Mostly, it's to turn it back to
nature," spokesman Roy Sterns says. "We'll be restoring the creek,
rehabilitating the fish runs, bringing back native plants. No plans,
he says, for a visitors center or commercial development, though some
of the homes will be converted into park offices. So which side
really wants to get back to the garden?</TE>
<TE>   Either way, "Lost Lives" kicks off at 4 p.m. at the Rose Alley
Theater, 318 Lincoln Blvd. in Venice. Admission is $5. For
information, call (323) 650-3013.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A lot of theater folk saw the renovated 2,000-seat Orpheum Theatre in
downtown L.A. last Sunday, at the Ovation Awards ceremony. Now comes
word that the first multi-week production to be scheduled since the
renovation is "The Taming of the Shrew," in a Zoo District production
next August.</LD>
<LD>   No, the sub-100-seat Zoo District isn't planning to take on the
expense of producing at the 2,000-seat level. Instead, the production
will be based primarily in the enormous lobby. Capacity will remain
at 99.</LD>
<LD>   Orpheum operator Steve Needleman has agreed to waive the rent on
the space for five weeks. The L.A. Conservancy, which has long
promoted the use of the old vaudeville movie palaces, including the
Orpheum, will provide marketing services.</LD>

<HD>A rare show for a reclusive artist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzanne Muchnic</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The UCLA Hammer Museum has a coup on its exhibition lineup for next
fall. "Lee Bontecou: A Retrospective" -- co-organized with the Museum
of Contemporary Art, Chicago, but scheduled to debut in Los Angeles
(Oct. 7, 2003 to Jan. 12, 2004) -- is the first major exhibition in
more than 30 years to survey this famously reclusive artist's work.
Bontecou rose to prominence in the 1960s with abstract steel and
canvas sculptures, but withdrew in the early '70s when her new,
figurative work confounded critics and collectors.</LD>
<LD>   The show was organized by Hammer director Ann Philbin and the
Chicago museum's chief curator, Elizabeth A.T. Smith, in cooperation
with Bontecou, who will lend works that have never been exhibited.
What's more, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which usually
organizes its own exhibitions, has booked the show for Aug. 18 to
Nov. 8, 2004, following its Chicago appearance, Feb. 23 to May 24,
2004.</LD>
<TE>   Bontecou's reemergence began in 1994 with a small exhibition of
her 1960s work at Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art, organized
by Smith when she was a curator there. Smith failed to enlist
Bontecou's help with that show and proceeded on her own. But, at the
invitation of an old friend, the Rhode Island-born artist went to see
the show and approved of Smith's efforts. The upcoming retrospective
will feature about 75 drawings and 50 sculptures, including major new
pieces, Smith says.</TE>

<LD>In 2001, the NAACP Theatre Awards ceremony took place on the same
night as the Ovation Awards -- a conflict that both organizations
said they hoped could be avoided in the future.</LD>
<LD>   They succeeded.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the Beverly Hills/Hollywood branch of the NAACP moved
its annual ceremony to Jan. 27 -- not to avoid Ovations conflicts,
but to be a part of what branch President Ron Hasson called "African
American awareness season," which begins with the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.'s birthday and continues through Black History Month in
February. Nominations will be announced in mid-December.</LD>

<HD>A first-time stuntman foiled by 007 and Madonna</HD>

<AU>Richard Cohen</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I'd sit down if I were you," said the old waiter. "It's going to be
a long day." He wasn't a real waiter, of course -- just one of the
many extras for "Die Another Day," the latest Bond movie. He was in
his late 60s, at a guess, and had been around Pinewood Studios for a
good many years. I took his advice; after all, I was a first-timer,
invited on the set as one of the "stunt artists" needed for the scene
in Bond's gentleman's club, off St James's. The club was introduced
in the 1955 Bond adventure "Moonraker" and fortuitously christened
Blades. In the new film, Bond goes there for a fencing lesson and
ends up fighting for his life.</LD>
<LD>   "Background action," shouts the assistant director. I start to
move across the set, as rehearsed. Pierce Brosnan resumes his pose on
the fencing strip. Opposite him glowers Toby Stephens, real-life son
of Robert Stephens and Maggie Smith, but now Gustav Graves, shortly
to be bent on world domination (what else?) but for the moment intent
only on separating Bond's head from his body.</LD>
<TE>   How had I found myself an extra on , the latest movie in the Bond
franchise? I was close to finishing my book on the history of
swordplay, and had phoned my old fencing master, Bob Anderson, to ask
if he was supervising the fight scenes in any new movies, and if so
could I come watch. He explained that he was fight master for a new
Bond. "But you can't come and watch," he'd told me, and before I
could remonstrate he added, "You can be in it."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson is not any old fight master. He began as a double for
Errol Flynn in the 1953 swashbuckler "Master of Ballantrae," and in
the years since has worked with nearly every leading actor in
Hollywood. He was even a Darth Vader stunt double in the second "Star
Wars" movie, and more recently he oversaw the fights in "The Mark of
Zorro" and the "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy.</TE>
<TE>   For "Die Another Day," he trained the cast for weeks to make them
look like fencers, and carefully devised a five-minute fight sequence
for Brosnan and Stephens, going through the club's corridors and onto
a specially constructed terrace. Stephens ends up in a fountain.</TE>
<TE>   Brosnan, 48, has doubles to do his swordplay stunts, but he and
Toby Stephens still have to look convincing. Before each take, the
actors sprint on the spot, and huff and puff as if about to run an
Olympic trial. Engagingly, Brosnan takes it all with a grain of salt.
On the second day he comes over to talk, and I suggest he watch out
against moving his front foot too far to the left, as it will look
odd on film, even to non-fencers. He immediately goes into a riff
about how all the Irish Brosnans are fatally pigeon-toed and can't
walk straight to save their lives: He sets out to show how his
pigeon-toed ancestors crossed the street, leaving us in stitches.</TE>
<TE>   It is terribly hot inside the studio, and parts of the set are
dangerously close to the arc lights. Sure enough, around 7 p.m. the
automatic sprinklers come on, drenching the terrace section. Filming
is called off for the day. Miraculously, the next morning the whole
set has been restored, everything in place.</TE>
<TE>   The fight scene has reached the point where Bond and Graves go
crashing into one of the suits of armor. This involves multiple takes
from a variety of angles, and at one point, when -- for the umpteenth
time -- I have walked over to one of my fellow stunt artists, Nick
Bell, a onetime national foil champion, he says sotto voce, "Aren't
we a bit overqualified for this?"</TE>
<TE>   Among the cast there is one constant topic of conversation: Will
Madonna show up? She is said to have put off her one scene time and
time again, adding thousands to the budget, but the studio can hardly
do without her -- she not only sings the title song, her cameo
appearance is needed to buck up European sales.</TE>
<TE>   In the end she is slated to appear on the last day of filming --
well into July, and the movie has to open in November. The whole set
is "closed" -- no visitors, definitely no press. The dressing rooms
are shut off from other cast members, who gossip about her fee, said
to be half a million pounds for one day of shooting. She is 44 now, a
mother of young children: How will she look?</TE>
<TE>   Eerie arrival</TE>
<TE>   At 8 a.m. I am backstage looking at the previous day's rushes on
one of the monitors when I become aware of an eerie silence on set.
Soon the reason becomes clear: Madonna -- Mrs. Ritchie (not "Madge,"
the nickname she abhors) -- has arrived. She wanders nonchalantly
across the fencing room dressed in a black Versace outfit that
includes a figure-hugging corset, which Bond will later be asked to
do up for her. Her black leotard is so skintight it looks like cling
film. Her arms, muscular as a gymnast's, are bare, and as she
saunters across stage she casually licks a red lolly. Everyone is
looking at her.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes pass, then Brosnan appears, and the two stars eye
each other, like boxers weighing who has the heavier punch. Madonna
is playing the part of Verity, the club's head coach. Originally, she
was to have been one of Bond's ex-girlfriends, but she chafed at
being his castoff, and on-set gossip has it that she rewrote both her
lines and his, remodeling herself as a lesbian, beyond Bond's reach.
She brightly refers to "my innuendo scene," and it is soon clear why.</TE>
<TE>   I am positioned just off camera as Bond strides in and asks if he
can have a lesson from her. Madonna is standing with her back to him,
observing Miranda (Rosamund Pike) fence Graves, but turns to answer
him. Bond points his epee at her, and when she raises her own sword
to parry, he evades it. "I see you know how to handle your weapon
well," Madonna says appreciatively, catching his blade and pushing it
away. "I have been known to raise my tip from time to time," Brosnan
replies.</TE>
<TE>   Madonna, though physically adept, has trouble with the moves, and
the scene requires several takes. As the two stars stand around
waiting for the camera to be set up again, they talk easily. What
subject do they discuss so avidly? They are comparing notes about old
people's homes. Then Madonna turns to fencing. "Have you had a go at
this?" she asks. "It's great. Gives you a wonderful workout." Brosnan
looks unconvinced.</TE>
<TE>   "Right. Next take," an assistant director breaks in. By now, after
several attempts, Madonna is handling her epee with real deftness.
When the director finally says he is satisfied, she walks past me and
I say, inanely, "You could become a good fencer, you know." She gives
me the briefest of glances.</TE>
<TE>   "Gee, wow!" she says.</TE>
<TE>   It is 5 p.m. and she has been on set for eight hours. Now it's a
wrap. Within three months a London reporter will write, "Fencing has
suddenly become fashionable.... Madge has put the official seal of
cool on the sport." And Bond? I ask him where he is off to, now that
filming is over. To the South Pacific with his family, he says. No
filming, just sun and sand. "Won't that upset your fencing training?"
I ask. "Fencing?" he says and laughs, "I don't plan to handle a sword
ever again, if I can help it."</TE>

Gladiators, Musketeers, Samurai, Swashbucklers, and Olympic
Champions," published recently by Random House.</TE>

<HD>Cool, calm and a wicked comic wit</HD>
<DH>Larry Wilmore, creator and producer of 'The Bernie Mac
Show,' is subdued on the surface, hiding the sharp humor he brings to
the mix.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Braxton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larry Wilmore's set jaw and focused eyes illustrated his resolve. He
had too much to do and too little time.</LD>
<LD>   "The Bernie Mac Show," the hit offbeat Fox family sitcom that
Wilmore created for Mac, the volcanic comedian who came to mainstream
prominence with 2000's "The Original Kings of Comedy" movie and tour,
was breaking for lunch after a long morning of shooting on its Studio
City set, and Wilmore had numerous details to attend to.</LD>
<LD>   Pausing for a few moments to take some photos, he provided the
thinnest of smiles. But when Mac sneaked up behind him and began to
make faces at the camera, he knew he was in trouble. After only a few
more seconds, a laugh leaped almost involuntarily from his throat.
Mac had done it again. He cracked Wilmore up.</LD>
<TE>   The moment was a reflection of the chemistry between Wilmore and
Mac. Their pairing has been referred to as an edgier version of the
potent partnership between Jerry Seinfeld and "Seinfeld" creator
Larry David -- an odd yet perfect mix of diametrically gifted
producer and talent who have taken each other to the next level.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmore's calm exterior also seems at first glance to be at odds
with Mac's outrageousness. In his comedy routines, Mac is loud,
cocky, brash and even crass at times, with stylishly long hair.
Wilmore looks more like a college professor -- spectacles, pressed
jeans, close-cropped black hair invaded by gray.</TE>
<TE>   There is little in the way the 41-year-old Wilmore carries himself
that suggests he could write a comedy script with lines such as "I'm
gonna kill one of those kids" or "I'm gonna bust her head until the
white meat shows."</TE>
<TE>   Wilmore's wicked comic style was also evident in "The PJs," the
controversial animated series he helped create about a family living
in a housing project. The comic sensibility between Wilmore and Mac
-- sharp, culturally flavored humor that can be universally
appreciated -- seem to be made for each other.</TE>
<TE>   "God brought us together," Mac says about Wilmore during a break
in his dimly lighted dressing room. "I truly believe that. It truly
works, and it's the way it's supposed to be. I get his clean version
of me, and I can communicate the raw side of him."</TE>
<TE>   Even though Mac is the bigger name, it was the quiet Wilmore who
scored an upset victory for the outstanding comedy writing Emmy for
"The Bernie Mac Show," which is produced by Regency Television and
20th Century Fox Television. The award was for the show's pilot,
which introduced Mac as a successful African American comedian who is
suddenly the guardian of his troubled sister's three children.</TE>
<TE>   In winning the award, Wilmore became the only African American
writer to win a solo Emmy Award for writing a network show.</TE>
<TE>   But milestones are of little comfort when there are still concerns
about ratings and Mac's and Wilmore's mandate of maintaining the
series' momentum during the crucial sophomore season. And there has
already been a bump in that road.</TE>
<TE>   This season presented "The Bernie Mac Show" and its two key
creative forces with a new challenge. Fox moved the "Bernie Mac" show
from last season's 9 p.m. Wednesday slot to 8 p.m. Wednesdays,
butting heads with ABC's "My Wife and Kids" starring Damon Wayans,
the only other comedy on a major network about an African American
family.</TE>
<TE>   When Wayans protested the move, saying the two comedies should not
have to compete against each other, Wilmore and Mac stayed quiet.</TE>
<TE>   But now the outcome of the battle is clear. "My Wife and Kids"
repeatedly beat "The Bernie Mac Show" in ratings, prompting Fox to
switch the comedy back to 9 p.m. Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   If Wilmore is stressing over his competition and the post-Emmy
crunch that comes with success, it's hidden behind his soft-spoken
demeanor and hands-in-pockets stance. He remains driven.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to that drive is the energy he gets from Mac. The comedian
will come into the writers room and tell stories that often turn into
story lines.</TE>
<TE>   "Bernie is just great to feed off of," Wilmore says. "It's
marvelous to see what he responds to."</TE>
<TE>   It's not always smooth sailing between the two forces, says
Wilmore. "He helps me keep on track. It's a real collaboration. And I
push him too. There was this fantasy episode last season, kind of a
'Twilight Zone' thing, that Bernie just did not want to do. He says,
'Man, that's not Bernie Mac.' But he trusted me. He may not have
trusted anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   From stand-up to sitcom</TE>
<TE>   Pre-WILMORE, Mac had resisted television for many years. But
during the "Original Kings of Comedy" project, he was approached by
Wilmore, who seemed to know how to showcase Mac's pointed humor.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmore had already had a small taste of the stand-up life. After
graduating from Cal Poly Pomona ("It was an agricultural school, so
of course I was a theater major"), he began what he called a
successful career on the comedy circuit, performing political humor.</TE>
<TE>   He moved into writing for sitcoms. In addition to his stint on the
groundbreaking "In Living Color," he also worked on "The Jamie Foxx
Show" and "Sister Sister" before signing on as an executive producer
for "The PJs."</TE>
<TE>   That series, which ran from 1999-2000, centered around life at a
predominantly African American housing project -- complete with
crime, poverty and flying bullets. Among the residents were a crack
addict, and men guzzling 40-ounce malt liquor bottles. "The PJs"
almost immediately drew fire from some black activists who argued
that making light of urban squalor was offensive. But it was low
ratings that ultimately killed the show.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmore is still stung by the failure of "The PJs," calling it a
brave comedy that took chances but was also caring about its
characters: "I still think 'The PJs' didn't get its fair shot. Some
people took it much too seriously."</TE>
<TE>   After seeing "The Original Kings of Comedy," Wilmore says he saw
great sitcom potential in Mac -- particularly in a routine where he
made fun of taking care of his sister's three children. Mac
immediately sensed there was something different about Wilmore as
opposed to others who wanted to work with him.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmore, who's been married for eight years to actress Leilani
Jones and is the father of 6-year-old Johnny and 4-year-old Lauren,
found that he and Mac -- who has a grown daughter -- shared the same
values about life: "We both believe in pulling yourself up by your
bootstraps. We both know how important it is to be a strong father."</TE>
<TE>   For the show, Wilmore conceived a "confessional" that allowed Mac
to regularly plead his case to his audiences. Comments and
descriptions are written on screen. Mac regularly reminds viewers
that he is only saying "what the rest of you wish you could say."</TE>
<TE>   Particularly Wilmore.</TE>
<TE>   'True to his vision'</TE>
<TE>   Fox Entertainment President Gail Berman says much emotion is
hidden under Wilmore's subdued surface.</TE>
<TE>   "Behind his quiet demeanor is tremendous passion," says Berman.
"He is very clear about keeping true to his vision."</TE>
<TE>   His offbeat comedic style has resulted in some passionate creative
differences with Fox.</TE>
<TE>   "Networks are always afraid," Wilmore says. "Fox has always been
supportive of me, but we often don't see eye to eye on the way I tell
stories. I don't write plot-driven episodes. They are
character-driven. I don't have cliffhangers at the end of Act 1. I
like unpredictability, which doesn't always go over well."</TE>
<TE>   Though he sometimes ponders life after "The Bernie Mac Show,"
nurturing the comedy is his top priority. One plan is to explore the
bond between Mac and his wife, Wanda (Kellita Smith).</TE>
<TE>   Still, Wilmore is still looking forward to the future when "I can
branch out a little and do other projects, develop a brand like David
E. Kelley."</TE>
<TE>   He pauses before adding with a smile, "Funnier, of course."</TE>

<HD>She's running the show and she's heard the questions</HD>
<DH>There were doubts when Mara Brock Akil took total control
of 'Girlfriends.' But it has sunk a David E. Kelley series and other
obstacles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Braxton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MARA Brock Akil wants to make one thing perfectly clear: She did not
do a victory lap around her Paramount Studios office when her
"Girlfriends" helped knock off David E. Kelley's "Girls Club."</LD>
<LD>   Akil, the creator of UPN's "Girlfriends," about four African
American women, was more than a little concerned when the highly
touted Fox drama, created by one of the most successful producers in
television, was scheduled against "Girlfriends" on Mondays at 9 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   When the critically blasted and low-rated "Girls Club" was yanked
last month after only two episodes, Akil couldn't help being a bit
thrilled -- particularly since "Girlfriends" is having the highest
ratings of its three-year run. "It's exciting to beat David Kelley,"
Brock said. "But it's not really all about that. I feel really
triumphant this season because I had that show and other obstacles
against me. There were questions about whether a young African
American woman could run a show by herself. I'm hearing this when
there are these white guys making million-dollar deals, and their
shows are not making it. Mine is."</LD>
<TE>   At 32, Akil is the youngest female creator-executive producer in
television. Among all show creators, only Greg Berlanti, who created
the new WB drama "Everwood," is younger, at 30. (Interestingly,
"Everwood" is also scheduled at 9 p.m. Mondays against
"Girlfriends.") She is the youngest African American to run a network
show.</TE>
<TE>   "Girlfriends," which stars Tracee Ellis Ross, Golden Brooks,
Persia White and Jill Marie Jones, is UPN's second-most popular
comedy behind "One on One" and has been called a black "Sex and the
City." The show is from Grammnet Productions, the production company
of "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer.</TE>
<TE>   After two seasons of working in tandem with two other producers,
Akil has taken full charge of "Girlfriends," and the direction and
tone of the series are hers. She wants to develop the series with
more complex story arcs. The single characters will be involved with
more serious relationships, and topics such as AIDS and birth mothers
will be addressed.</TE>
<TE>   The direct approach</TE>
<TE>   With more control of her show, Akil isn't as concerned this season
with perceptions based mostly on her youth and looks. With her
striking features, Halle Berry-style haircut, off-the-shoulder
sweater and tight blue jeans, she might be initially mistaken for a
glamorous actress making a guest appearance rather than the boss.</TE>
<TE>   But her appearance is a distinct counterpoint to her no-nonsense
professionalism that leaves no doubt who is running the show.</TE>
<TE>   Said Akil: "I am aware of how people have responded to me just
based on my looks, my age, my gender. I make sure people don't
mistake my kindness for weakness. I'm not afraid to be direct."</TE>
<TE>   Grammer said, "I'm impressed by the fact that she's soft-spoken
and yet forceful. She has a clear vision but is able to collaborate.
This third season she seems really at ease, and the cast seems
comfortable. I'm really thrilled with the series and its growth."</TE>
<TE>   Akil said of her relationship with the "Girlfriends" cast:
"Sometimes they may not want to go to the places I want to go. But
there is trust. I had to get over my defensiveness. In dealing with
the cast, I was so busy protecting the show that I didn't listen as
much as I should have."</TE>
<TE>   She keeps Grammer aware of plots and story directions, but she
does not regularly consult him. "However, it always gives me comfort
to know that he's there."</TE>
<TE>   Grammer said with a chuckle, "Mara comes to me when she needs a
power call. But otherwise, she's doing it without my help. I'm very
secure with how she's running the show."</TE>
<TE>   Akil has a few ideas for other series she wants to pursue down the
line. But she is consumed with "Girlfriends" and its growing
viewership.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still growing, and we have no advertising budget like these
other networks do," Akil said. "It's word of mouth. This comedy has a
life far beyond five seasons. I feel like we've made a difference."</TE>

<HD>Making a spectacle himself</HD>
<DH>Robert Wilson's ambitious, avant-garde stagings aren't seen
much in the U.S., but L.A. is about to get more than its share.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jan Breslauer</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a leading figure of the international avant-garde for more than
two decades, Robert Wilson is one of the most influential theater
artists today. Yet he has enjoyed much greater visibility in Europe
than in the U.S. "It's still difficult to get work here," says the
director-designer, speaking by phone from his loft in New York during
the recent Brooklyn Academy of Music run of his staging of Georg
Buchner's "Woyzeck." Created with rock musician Tom Waits and Waits'
longtime collaborator, Kathleen Brennan -- and seen throughout Europe
since its 2000 premiere in Copenhagen -- the production comes to
UCLA's Freud Playhouse on Tuesday as part of UCLA Live's
International Theatre Festival.</LD>
<LD>   Why has there been so little Wilson in the U.S.? "Part of the
reason is that we're very provincial in the U.S.," says the
Texas-born artist. "We don't really know what's happening in the rest
of the world. We're such a vast country that we don't really have an
awareness of other cultures.</LD>
<LD>   "In Europe or wherever, a place like Vienna -- which is in some
ways very provincial too -- is very near all these different
countries, and they've all been invaded by one another. They're much
more aware."</LD>
<TE>   Wilson's 12-hour international epic, "the CIVIL warS: a tree is
best measured when it is down," was supposed to have been staged in
Los Angeles as part of the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival. But it was
canceled when funding fell through at the last minute. The entire
work -- which he still considers his "most ambitious" -- was never
staged anywhere in its entirety, although parts have been produced in
several countries, including the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's last outing in Los Angeles was "Monsters of Grace," an
interdisciplinary work seen in different versions in 1998 and 1999 at
UCLA. Created with composer Philip Glass, with a text based on the
writings of 13th century poet Jalaluddin Rumi, the piece mixed 3-D
computer-generated imagery with music and live performers. Prior to
that, L.A.'s last glimpse of Wilson was a 1995 lecture retrospective
given by the artist, also at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Despite strong attendance at these events, it hasn't really helped
bring more Wilson here. In part that's because his work's grand scale
makes it costly to produce.</TE>
<TE>   However, that tide is finally about to turn, with several Wilson
projects slated for the near future. The director is working with Los
Angeles Opera principal conductor Kent Nagano on an independent
project called "Manzanar," about the Japanese American internment
camps, slated for an as-yet-undetermined indoor venue here in the
early months of 2004. Later that same year, Los Angeles Opera will
present his version of Puccini's "Madama Butterfly," and UCLA Live
will present the landmark 1976 Wilson-Glass opera "Einstein on the
Beach."</TE>
<TE>   A timeless drama retold</TE>
<TE>   Buchner's "Woyzeck" is about a tortured soldier who murders his
girlfriend. The play was left unfinished at his death in 1837, at the
age of 23. The intended order of its scenes has never been
established, leaving interpreters a comparatively free rein.</TE>
<TE>   The story of "Woyzeck" is actually pretty sketchy. But then,
Wilson has never been big on story. His spectacle theater is
abstract, with striking visuals and very little interest in
conventional psychological realism.</TE>
<TE>   Structurally, Wilson's original works are often closer to a
theme-and-variations model than a linear narrative. When not using
assembled or "found" texts, Wilson has radically reinterpreted many
classics, or at least challenged conventional notions of how to
present them.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the Buchner drama can be approached on many levels.
"It's a simple story and a complicated story," Wilson says. "It was
curious to me, and touching, this complicated issue of this man being
used as a medical experiment and this simple, tragic love story." He
also found it surprisingly contemporary. "It's one of those great
works that doesn't date," he says. "You would never think of this as
something written in the first part of the 19th century."</TE>
<TE>   The play's structure, indeterminate though it may be, appealed to
Wilson. "The play is written sort of like a film, the way it's cut
and spliced and edited together," he says. "The way it's written
seemed to fit my style.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to respect the master and you try not to be a slave to
him. Hopefully, that's what Tom and I have done: taken a great author
and brought our own personalities to it."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson and Waits' desire to work with one another got the project
off the ground. "The most important reason to do it is my love and
respect of Tom Waits," says Wilson, who has collaborated with the
musician and his wife, Brennan, on two previous occasions: 1991's
"The Black Ryder: The Casting of the Magic Bullets" (also with
William S. Burroughs) and 1992's "Alice," a fantasy about Lewis
Carroll and his "Alice in Wonderland" muse. "I wanted to work with
him, and this seemed to be the right piece," Wilson says. "I could
see him as that character and hear his voice in that situation. I
thought that he could bring his own ideas to the play and they could
sit well." Waits and Brennan's music for the production is featured
on the 2002 Anti/Epitaph release "Blood Money." Waits declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   According to Wilson, "Woyzeck" bears little resemblance to any of
the previous ventures, which have little in common. "Their
relationship is that they have no relationship, which is a way of
relating," he says. "They reinforce one another by their difference."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, exploiting the tension of opposites is a technique that
Wilson favors. "Counterpoint is very difficult to do, but often I use
it in the theater," he says. "Some of these songs are quite bloody,
and the look is very slick and pretty. That's confusing to people.
Sometimes that pretty face when it has blood all over it is more
scary."</TE>
<TE>   Even though his breakthrough came with the 1970 theater piece
"Deafman Glance," Wilson remains best known for "Einstein on the
Beach." More recently, he has garnered attention for his design and
direction of works from the operatic canon, including Mozart's "The
Magic Flute" and Wagner's "Lohengrin." In addition, Wilson is a
visual artist and the founder of Watermill Center, an institute for
theater research and development on Long Island, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he still senses trepidation about his theater. "I think one of
the problems is my work in a formal theater: Ideas are expressed
formally; things are more inwardly felt," says Wilson. "It's still
very strange for an audience in New York to see a play that is
performed in a formalistic way.</TE>
<TE>   "We can look at a Rothko, and it doesn't have to tell me a story.
But in theater, opera?"</TE>
<TE>   Although there's an upward inflection at the end of his words,
Wilson leaves his own question unanswered -- a thought finished but
not resolved.</TE>

<HD>Too volatile a mix to last?</HD>
<DH>Audioslave is one part Soundgarden and three parts Rage
Against the Machine, but band members insist the group won't implode.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Audioslave's first album has been in stores only two weeks, so why is
everyone already predicting that this invigorating new hard-rock
group will break up?</LD>
<LD>   "Audioslave probably won't be a long-term commitment," declares
Blender magazine in a review of the band's self-titled album.</LD>
<LD>   "This may be the only album Audioslave generates as a unit," warns
Spin in its review.</LD>
<TE>   The reason for the pessimism goes to the history of the four
members of the band. They came together early last year, still numb
after high-profile divorces from their old bands, and they almost
split apart themselves last summer during a six-week "separation."</TE>
<TE>   All this matters because Audioslave has great rock genes. Three
members are from Rage Against the Machine, the Los Angeles quartet
that defined rap-rock in the '90s. There's Tom Morello, a
Harvard-educated guitarist whose playing invites descriptions rarely
associated with hard rock: eloquent and graceful. Bassist Tim
Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk form a rhythm section whose
cannonball force made Rage frontman Zack de la Rocha's raps about
social and cultural oppression all the more electrifying.</TE>
<TE>   Rage is the band that attracted national attention when it staged
a protest concert outside the 2000 Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles -- and came apart two months later when De la Rocha left
the group for a solo career that has yet to surface.</TE>
<TE>   Audioslave singer Chris Cornell is equally heralded. With Seattle
grunge architects Soundgarden in the '90s, the strikingly handsome
singer established himself as one of the great voices in modern rock,
someone who could match Robert Plant's wail but brought to his music
an intelligence and introspection rarely evident in Led Zeppelin.</TE>
<TE>   Cornell's reflections on insecurities and doubts spoke to a
generation of fans with much of the urgency of Nirvana and Pearl Jam,
but Soundgarden broke up in 1997 after more than a dozen years
together, partially because Cornell wanted new challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the new band, Cornell, 38, has the most stylish backing
of his career, and the Rage alumni can stretch out musically in ways
that are fresh and liberating. Cornell's lyrics sometimes rely on
images that are overly familiar and vague, but there is a strong
sense of soul-searching in his themes that is ideal for the drama and
ambition of Audioslave's sound.</TE>
<TE>   In "Like a Stone," one of the most powerful tunes from the new
album, Cornell, perhaps acknowledging the death of Kurt Cobain and
others from the grunge scene, sings about waiting for death to catch
up with him. "For all that I've blessed / And all that I've wronged /
In dreams until my death / I will wander on."</TE>
<TE>   The Epic Records release entered the U.S. sales chart last week at
No. 7, selling more than 162,000 copies in its first week. The
explosive single "Cochise" is lighting up rock radio request lines.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a band, not a one-off," Morello, also 38, says, somewhat
wearily, during an interview at the Casa del Mar hotel in Santa
Monica, where the band members met with media from around the world
for two days to stress that they are committed to the band.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand where people could wonder about what's going on, and
no one knows what the future holds," says Morello. "But I couldn't be
happier. From the moment we got together with Chris, it felt like a
runaway train, an incredible, liberating burst of creativity."</TE>
<TE>   Rising from the ashes</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to get caught up in the speculation over how long
Audioslave will be with us, but the more fascinating story may be how
they got here. The arrival of Cornell is really Chapter 2 in
Audioslave's story. Chapter 1 begins with De la Rocha's exit.</TE>
<TE>   It was a painful time, and Rage's three instrumentalists turned to
a motivation counselor for help -- a man who had worked with the St.
Louis Rams during their Super Bowl march in 1999. His message for the
musicians: Keep the lines of communication open.</TE>
<TE>   "There had been so much tension in the band that we needed to find
ways of making sure everyone felt comfortable saying whatever was on
their mind," says Commerford, 34. Drummer Wilk, also 34, also says he
went through a period of self-doubt. "When your band falls apart, you
really question yourself," he says. "Do I still want to do this? Can
I do it? You worry about your abilities."</TE>
<TE>   Also on the table were three key questions: Do the three stay
together? If so, do they stick with the name? And do they keep the
rap-rock style?</TE>
<TE>   "The worst thing would have been if Rage got another rapper and
tried to be Rage with someone else," says record producer Rick Rubin,
who oversaw "Audioslave." "Even if they found someone who was
phenomenal and we made an album better than any Rage albums, it could
be viewed as artificial."</TE>
<TE>   So Rubin suggested Cornell, who had done a directionless solo
album after Soundgarden split up.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris was also perfect from a songwriting standpoint," says
Rubin. "The distinctive thing about Rage was they played in one
chord, not the more typical three chords of rock. One chord is fine
for rapping, but it doesn't leave much room for melody.</TE>
<TE>   "With Soundgarden, Chris wrote melodies around a single chord,
which is very unique. I can't think of another songwriter in rock who
could make a melodic song out of a one-chord riff."</TE>
<TE>   The Rage trio was thrilled by the suggestion, but would Cornell
set aside his solo aspirations and return to a band? Early in 2001,
he told Morello that he would be interested in exploring music with
the guitarist, whose work he had admired -- especially Morello's
ability to create sounds on the guitar that others could find only
through synthesizers or tape loops.</TE>
<TE>   But Cornell was taken aback when Morello suggested that Wilk and
Commerford should also be involved.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing against them, but it didn't sound like a good idea to
step into an existing band that had such a unique sound as Rage,"
Cornell says. "Were they going to expect me to rap or write
politically motivated lyrics like Zack? I had no intention of doing
that, and I was very upfront about it."</TE>
<TE>   Cornell was still wary when the four musicians went into
rehearsals in Los Angeles in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't take anything for granted," he says, weighing his words
much more deliberately than did Morello. "For all I knew, I might not
be able to stand them and the music might sound like crap. That's my
nature. I'm the kind of person who worries about everything.</TE>
<TE>   "But they were gracious, open to my ideas. I was also encouraging
to them, which I don't think they were used to. It seemed like they
were used to a lot of internal scrutiny and tension, and I think that
is crippling to creativity."</TE>
<TE>   The Rage team was thrilled.</TE>
<TE>   "We were pushing ourselves in ways we hadn't imagined before,"
Morello says. "There was a tremendous release of tension."</TE>
<TE>   They came up with almost a song a day for three weeks. Music,
however, was only one challenge for Audioslave. There was also some
baggage left from their previous band marriages. They were under
contract to two record labels and signed by two separate managers.</TE>
<TE>   The labels, Interscope for Cornell and Epic for the ex-Rage trio,
worked out an agreement under which Epic would release the first
album and Interscope would release the second.</TE>
<TE>   Everything, including the record, was pretty much in place by last
summer, when Audioslave planned to make its concert debut on the
Ozzfest tour.</TE>
<TE>   But the management situation had become so draining that the band
bowed out of the tour. Cornell thought there was a real chance the
group might just put out the album and then call it quits during a
six-week break.</TE>
<TE>   "I went home to Seattle," he says. "I said, 'Unless we resolve the
management issue, I don't see how we can move forward.' I don't think
it was a matter of putting my foot down as much as just kind of
breaking the concrete in terms of reaching a solution."</TE>
<TE>   To end the impasse, they severed ties with their rival managers
and signed with the Firm, the massive management group that handles
Korn, Limp Bizkit and the Dixie Chicks, and Epic finally set a
release date for the album.</TE>
<TE>   Uneven reaction to the debut</TE>
<TE>   Reviews have been mixed. Some critics have complained that
Audioslave feels too comfortable -- that its music fails to open a
new chapter in rock the way Soundgarden and Rage did a decade ago.
"In their past lives, the members of this band were enraged," wrote
Rolling Stone "Now, fierce as they might sound, Audioslave just seems
sorta engaged."</TE>
<TE>   But that view fails to recognize that a decade has passed. This
band doesn't need to create a new sound to deserve our attention. In
Audioslave, music from the Rage alums shows new splendor, and
Cornell's writing is more personal, reflecting some of the changes in
his life (his first child is 2 1/2).</TE>
<TE>   In "Show Me How to Live," Cornell, who went through some trying
times as a youngster, searches for the wisdom and strength to be a
good father.</TE>
<TE>   Morello matches Cornell's vocals with guitar lines so closely
aligned emotionally that the guitar and voice seem like partners in a
duet. And Morello's crusade to find new guitar textures results in
some striking moments, none more so than passages in "Gasoline" in
which he shapes sounds it took a synthesizer to achieve on the Who's
"Who's Next" album.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment Weekly lauds "Audioslave," calling it a "music-world
example of opposites supremely attracting."</TE>
<TE>   The opening-week sales figure of 162,000 was less than half the
first-week total of Rage Against the Machine's last collection of
original material, 1999's "The Battle of Los Angeles." Still, that's
impressive considering it'll take some time for Rage and Soundgarden
fans to realize the connections in Audioslave. The group, which will
make its first concert appearance Saturday as part of KROQ-FM's
annual Almost Acoustic Christmas series at the Universal
Amphitheatre, hopes to escalate that education process by touring
extensively during 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Audioslave would surely have come closer to the Rage sales total
if it had kept the old name, but that would have been short-term
thinking, and this band insists that it's in it for the long run.</TE>
<TE>   "As delicate as it was when Zack left, I don't think we ever
thought about breaking up," Morello says. "We had lost a singer, but
we hadn't lost our love of playing together. I'm still proud of what
we did with Rage. My only regret is that we didn't make more music
together. I don't want to make that mistake again."</TE>

<TE>   A look at Audioslave's origins</TE>
<TE>   From Calendar's archives, a sampling of the excitement Rage
Against the Machine and Soundgarden generated with their most
celebrated albums.Rage Against the Machine</TE>
<TE>   Rage Against the Machine</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2 "Rage Against the Machine" (Epic, 1993). A striking,
politically conscious debut. Zack de la Rocha is a bona fide star who
combines on stage a Bob Marley-like charisma and a Chuck D.-style rap
command -- and the music itself is as tough and relentless as his
raps.</TE>
<TE>   -- Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   **** "The Battle of Los Angeles" (Epic, 1999). The breakthrough
here is that Rage finally begins to add some surprise left jabs and
right hooks to its musical arsenal, giving us music that is both
richer texturally and, in some places, warmer and more convincing.</TE>
<TE>   -- R.H.</TE>
<TE>   Soundgarden</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2  "Badmotorfinger" (A&amp;M, 1991). Soundgarden's inevitable
climb to primacy in the new-metal realm continues right on schedule
with its second major-label album. In this visceral, wide-ranging
panorama, the heavy stomp competes with an impulse to soar,
stretching the musical architecture into taut, fanciful shapes.</TE>
<TE>   -- Richard Cromelin</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2 "Superunknown" (A&amp;M, 1994). Soundgarden's roots remain
firmly in the Zeppelin-Sabbath realm, but with its sheer invention
and willingness to experiment, the band comes on as the Beatles of
grunge. Or its Pink Floyd.</TE>

<LD>Jesse James was grinning like a man who'd just robbed a bank. It was
midafternoon, and the scene was a massive Long Beach garage where a
Discovery Channel camera crew rubbed shoulders with an elite team of
grease monkeys. Blues and rock music from a boombox nearly drowned
out the scream of power tools, but not quite.</LD>
<LD>   Linebacker-solid, his tattooed biceps straining a black</LD>
<LD>   T-shirt, James -- along with five assistants -- was busy hammering
and welding together the team's latest automotive hybrid, a
half-gutted PT Cruiser it was converting into a tree mulcher. You
won't find it in your local Chrysler showroom, but this might be the
smartest, thriftiest thing to come out of Detroit, by way of Southern
California and cable TV, since Henry Ford rolled out the Model T.</LD>
<TE>   For Jesse Gregory James, 33, a Long Beach native and distant
relative of the legendary outlaw, it was all in a day's work here in
the Wild West of contemporary auto design. While the Big 3 are busy
cranking out more bland, boxy SUVs, James is taking apart the
cookie-cutter mind-set of the commercial auto industry -- one bolt at
a time.</TE>
<TE>   "I just like it because of the fact of all these people driving
around in their PT Cruisers, thinking they're cool," said James,
pausing from his labors. "That's how I'm secretly getting my revenge,
by taking all these cars that are weak style, weak name, and totally
obliterating them. But in a nice way."</TE>
<TE>   And that, folks, is the basic formula for "Monster Garage," which
airs weekly on Monday and Saturday evenings. Take a brand-name,
everyday vehicle. Think up some outrageous yet curiously arresting
and possibly even practical new use for it. Then turn James (the
program's host) and his rotating crew of helpers loose with a skimpy
$3,000 budget, plus a few thousand more in donated materials. Give
them just five days to come up with a functional vehicle that does
something no car of its type ought to be able to do. Whatever
materials aren't recyclable get sold on EBay.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and by the way, it has to look good too. Let's see Lee</TE>
<TE>   Iacocca take that challenge.</TE>
<TE>   You have to wonder, as James and his fellow heavy-metal folk
artisans sometimes do, what might happen if Detroit's engineers and
bureaucrats had to work under the constraints of "Monster Garage,"
where everything -- time, budget, manpower -- is severely limited.
Everything, that is, except imagination. Who knows? Maybe America's
roads wouldn't be jammed with so many dull-looking Jurassic vehicles
running on juice from the age of the stegosaurus, instead of cars
that evoke Michael J. Fox's time-tripping Delorean in "Back to the
Future."</TE>
<TE>   So what are Detroit's new ideas for the 21st century? Well,
according to a new show at L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art, one of
them is "Retrofuturism." The brainchild of Ford design guru J Mays, a
graduate of Pasadena's Art Center College of Design, retrofuturism is
a nostalgic exercise in creating updated versions of automotive
classics like the Volkswagen Beetle and Ford Thunderbird.</TE>
<TE>   MOCA has allotted several large galleries and a number of blithe
wall-text panels to Mays' designs, but not much in the way of a
critical edge. If not for the absence of female models draped across
the car hoods, museum visitors might think they'd accidentally
stumbled into the Detroit Auto Show, where several of these objects
appeared previously.</TE>
<TE>   High-powered art</TE>
<TE>   But not one of MOCA's shiny new prototypes radiates as much brash
wit and aggressive forward-thinking as the vehicles James and his
crew have made for "Monster Garage." Four-wheeled folk art, the
collection includes a Chevrolet Super Sport Impala that morphs into
an ice-rink smoother; a Geo Tracker that doubles as a hot-air
balloon(!); and a stripped-down yellow school bus, rigged up with a
propeller and rudder, that splits in two, sprouts a horizontal deck
and turns into a pontoon boat.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to see some people with the weirdest expressions you've
ever seen in your life? Drive a school bus into a lake and see what
happens," said Alex Anderson, the garage's manager. That's exactly
what James and his gang did recently, taking their monstrous creation
to Lake Havasu, where they rode it into the water and sat barbecuing
hot dogs while chatting with passing boaters.</TE>
<TE>   A self-made entrepreneur, James is the founding owner of West
Coast Choppers, a custom motorcycle shop that features a tank filled
with live sharks and crafts designer bikes for the likes of Keanu
Reeves and Shaquille O'Neal. James has spent years honing his
fabrication skills while acquiring a cult following of bikers,
celebrities and the sort of people who don't like others telling them
that something can't be done.</TE>
<TE>   In proof of his own growing celebrity, last month he made People
magazine's list of the world's sexiest men. "I'd rather be the
National Welding Society Man of the Year," he said, only half-joking.</TE>
<TE>   He runs a tight shop, but the atmosphere is relaxed enough to
allow drop-in visitors like Wayne of the band Static X, who came by
one afternoon to apply to be on an assembly crew -- if he can meet
James' tough standards. (Remember the days when rock stars and other
pop artists were inspired by cars, rather than the other way around?)</TE>
<TE>   In Detroit, "retrofuturism" means never having to say you've been
stuck in a creative midlife crisis for half a century. James'
designs, however goofy their appearance and limited their practical
application, have the guts and technical know-how needed to shake up
the design status quo, and autophiles are paying attention. Several
of his vehicles were on display last weekend at the Petersen
Automotive Museum, and they'll be touring other auto-related
functions this fall and winter.</TE>
<TE>   Mathew Zabas, who worked with James on the mulcher car and owns a
specialty motorcycle store in San Diego, said the auto industry needs
to try making big leaps in technology and design, rather than
retreating into an idealized past or doling out just enough
innovation to justify a higher-priced version of the same old thing.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the technology and we've got the money," he said. "It
needs someone who's not afraid to say, 'Let's do it differently.'
Let's jump ahead 10 steps. We'll all get there faster and pollute the
air less and be safer."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we'll even get there in style. Meanwhile, anybody out there
need a used PT Cruiser? Gets pretty good mileage. Eats branches, too.</TE>

<DH>In 'Silent Players,' film historian Anthony Slide peers
behind the public personas of some of Hollywood's early stars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the silent era, William S. Hart was the epitome of the honest,
loyal cowboy in such film classics as "Tumbleweeds." But in the new
book "Silent Players" (University Press of Kentucky), film historian
Anthony Slide says it was all an act.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think he was a very nice person," Slide says. "He was
obsessed with his leading ladies, and he wanted to marry them.
Actress Jane Novak mentions the way that Hart and his fellow cowboys
tied her hands behind her back and put emptied alcohol bottles around
her and photographed her in this very compromising pose that isn't
anything you'd expect anybody to do.</LD>
<LD>   "Today you would never get away with anything like that. You
assume that all the bad manners and sexual harassment came later, but
it didn't. Obviously, he treated women very badly."</LD>
<TE>   In "Silent Players," Slide profiles 100 silent-film stars -- 57 of
whom he knew personally -- including such well-known names as Mary
Astor, Lillian Gish and Harold Lloyd and such now-forgotten
performers as Babe London and Ethel Grandin.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of these silent performers seemed to suffer from the Norma
Desmond syndrome -- they were difficult during their career heyday
and even in the twilight of their years. "Once they became stars,
they were told to behave like a star," Slide says. "I remember one of
the actresses went to a coffee shop and her producer saw her there
and said, 'You don't drink in a coffee shop. You are a star. You must
never mingle with your admirers. You must always keep your distance.
You must be up there on a pedestal.' "</TE>
<TE>   The actors, he says, also tended to believe their own publicity,
especially when they got older. Even someone like Gish, who acted
into the 1980s, would often repeat stories that the studios'
publicity department had written about her as if they were the truth.
And in the case of Blanche Sweet, Slide says, "When academics would
come to interview her in her old age and she didn't know the answers
to the questions, she would go and research them at the Museum of
Modern Art."</TE>
<TE>   These silent-film stars often began their careers on the stage as
child performers. "A lot of them were self-educated," Slide says. "A
lot of actors and actresses back then wanted an education, but
because they started their careers as child actors they didn't have
the opportunity to go to a real school. But they were sort of
desperate to learn, so they read books. They might not know very much
about American history, but they knew geography real well because
they went from town to town."</TE>
<TE>   Actresses as moguls</TE>
<TE>   Unlike today, most of the major stars of the silent era were
female and several had their own production companies. "Once women
became more prominent, then they founded their own production
companies, which were often, of course, financed by a man," Slide
says.</TE>
<TE>   "For example, Gloria Swanson's production company was financed by
Joseph Kennedy. But at the same time I think they realized that to
best promote themselves and to make the most financially from their
careers, it was necessary to have their own production company."</TE>
<TE>   These actresses also turned to directing, like Margery Wilson, who
directed a two-reel comedy, "Two of a Kind," in 1920 and then
produced, directed, acted, wrote and sold two feature films,
"Institution" and "The Offenders," in the early '20s.</TE>
<TE>   Several performers who didn't make the transition from silent
films to talkies ended in relative poverty. When Slide met Madge
Kennedy, who had been a headliner in the late teens and early '20s,
she was living in a "little tiny apartment near the Ambassador Hotel
in a really run-down neighborhood. But she still kept up appearances.
She loved to serve pink champagne."</TE>
<TE>   One of his favorites was actress Alice Terry, who was married to
director Rex Ingram and had come to fame in the early '20s playing
opposite Rudolph Valentino in "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"
and "The Conquering Power."</TE>
<TE>   "She always had a weight problem," Slide says. "She would tell the
story that Louis B. Mayer said to her when her contract came up for
renewal at MGM, 'You have to give up candies or give up film.' Alice
said it was an easy choice: 'I'll give up film.' And she did."</TE>

<LD>Cherry Jones and Swoosie Kurtz are sprawled in the VIP lounge for
deep-pocketed supporters of the Old Globe Theatre, and quite an
irresistibly cushy lounge it is. Clearly the San Diego theater's big
donors get more for their money than just good seats and goodwill,
judging from the plump eggplant and ruby cushions singing their siren
song to Jones and Kurtz. Suddenly, they're horizontal.</LD>
<LD>   It's like that with Cherry and "Swoose," as Jones calls her
co-star in "Imaginary Friends," Nora Ephron's new play about
playwright Lillian Hellman and novelist Mary McCarthy that opens on
Broadway on Dec. 12. The two Tony winners are such fans of each
other's work and humanity that they can relax completely together. So
there's simply no reason to sit up.</LD>
<LD>   At the moment, Jones seems as if she's morphed into liquid, she's
given so much to the matinee performance that ended minutes earlier.
She's poured onto her left side so her cheek presses into a
velvet-covered bench, and she's talking about the ritual she and
Kurtz fell into during the show's October run in Southern California.
At first it sounds suspiciously like a rite of passage performed in
lock-step by numerous captains of the entertainment industry --
Mondays at Morton's.</LD>
<TE>   But take five. Not that Morton's.</TE>
<TE>   "We go to this steakhouse every Monday night to get our iron
supplement," says Jones, pulling her right heel toward her behind.
"We eat these unbelievable amounts of meat together. Meat and vodka.
And we're both convinced that if we wander away from that...."</TE>
<TE>   Kurtz finishes her sentence: "We'll have to find a place in New
York."</TE>
<TE>   "Otherwise," says Jones, 46, "we'll just be little wilting
lilies."</TE>
<TE>   Here's the good news: The two stars of "Imaginary Friends" -- who,
fear not, are no wilting lilies -- get along fabulously well. So if
the show enjoys the long run indicated by its glowing out-of-town
reviews -- "The two stage veterans prove superb," Sean Mitchell wrote
in The Times -- the experience will be pleasant for everyone
involved, which is no small thing.</TE>
<TE>   And here's the bad news: The two stars of "Imaginary Friends" get
along fabulously well, unlike their characters in the "play with
music." "Imaginary Friends," which features Broadway veteran Harry
Groener as the men in their lives, imagines the two adversaries
together in death -- hell, actually -- as they rarely were in life,
divided by their opposite natures: McCarthy was beautiful, Hellman,
plain; McCarthy grew up a Catholic orphan abused by an uncle, Hellman
was raised in a prosperous Jewish home; McCarthy was a stickler for
the facts, while Hellman wove sumptuous fictions and called them
memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Hellman's memoir "Pentimento," which was made into the
film "Julia" starring Jane Fonda as Hellman, turned out to be a
fabrication based on another woman's experience going behind enemy
lines to help a friend in the anti-Nazi resistance, and the play
supposes how a courtroom confrontation between Hellman and McCarthy
might have gone.</TE>
<TE>   The play climaxes with Hellman's libel lawsuit against McCarthy
for assailing her on "The Dick Cavett Show" in 1980 with the
memorable quote: "Every word she writes is a lie, including 'and' and
'the.' " Hellman died before the case could be tried, leaving
McCarthy to remark witheringly, "I didn't want her to die. I wanted
her to lose in court."</TE>
<TE>   When Jones and Kurtz are onstage portraying two women whose mutual
enmity reached historic proportions, they really have to work at
hating each other. Not that there aren't techniques for that. They
just don't particularly want to show you the man -- woman, actually
-- behind the curtain.</TE>
<TE>   "That was hard for both of us," says Kurtz, 58, "because we're
both basically very loving and very positive people...."</TE>
<TE>   "Who would go to China and back to avoid a conflict," says Jones
with a throaty laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably shouldn't talk about things we use to ignite and
incite our juices to get us going," says Kurtz demurely as she sits
up and leans back into the purple cushions. "We all have our things,
our little demons, whether they're jealousies or insecurities or
angers, rages, whatever. It's just a question of degree," she says,
between getting slightly angry "at somebody who takes a parking place
and being Medea and gouging out somebody's eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Jones gets her McCarthy on in part by visualizing Hellman where
Kurtz stands. "I have my substitutions that I'm struggling to work on
to get them to the heights they need to be for this," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the performers bond with their characters at least as much
as they bond with each other, so at certain points it's difficult to
tell who's who, even offstage. Jones refers to Kurtz as "you" when
she's really trashing Hellman. And Kurtz heartily defends the acerbic
playwright, whom she met 20-odd years ago, even while admitting that
she too once "bought 'Julia' hook, line and sinker."</TE>
<TE>   Jack O'Brien, the Globe's artistic director who directed this
production, is thrilled with the pair's thrust and parry. "The
chemistry is just brilliant between them," he says. "There is, for
people who admire each other, a natural disinclination to show the
blood-sport tendency. But now since they're so secure as friends and
they like acting together, there's a certain relish in it. It's like
great tennis: You want someone who can hit the ball back -- that's
part of the exhilaration -- and they're beautifully matched in that
respect."</TE>
<TE>   A different duo envisioned</TE>
<TE>   It's slightly ironic that a play about two women who competed
viciously works precisely because they're portrayed by two women who
don't. And yet Jones and Kurtz weren't the initial duo envisioned for
the parts. Jones, who won a Tony for her performance in the Lincoln
Center revival of "The Heiress" (which came to L.A. in 1996), was an
early recruit. She played McCarthy in a couple of New York workshop
readings earlier this year with Christine Baranski as Hellman.
O'Brien had worked with Jones in a San Diego production of Tina
Howe's "Pride's Crossing" that moved to New York four years ago, and
he was keen on a rematch. What's more, the play's organizers were
struck by the actress' physical resemblance to McCarthy.</TE>
<TE>   As for Baranski, family problems prevented her from joining the
cast in San Diego, O'Brien says. And then serendipity took over --
O'Brien ran into Kurtz at the opening of the "Mornings at Seven"
revival in New York. He'd crossed paths in the past with the double
Tony winner ("Fifth of July" in 1980 and "The House of Blue Leaves"
in 1986), although they'd never worked together. But when O'Brien
spotted Kurtz in the back of the theater, he suddenly thought, "Wow.
There's a great idea."</TE>
<TE>   "These women are very contrasting," says O'Brien, whose recent
credits include the Broadway smash "Hairspray," "The Full Monty" and
Tom Stoppard's "The Invention of Love," about another literary
figure, A.E. Housman. "Swoosie is petite as, in fact, Miss Hellman
was, and Cherry is tall. And Swoosie has a wicked sense of humor. By
that I mean she's one of those people who assembles her fusillade of
weaponry very, very carefully. Also, this is an actress who has been
away from the stage in the last few years. She's done an enormous
amount of film and TV, and we've missed her."</TE>
<TE>   "Imaginary Friends" turns out to be about a certain generation of
women on several levels. Certainly for the actresses, the play offers
a rare opportunity to portray extremely complex, women "over 14," as
Kurtz puts it, both in leading roles.</TE>
<TE>   And perhaps it took another woman over 14 at the peak of her
creativity and power to fill a stage with her own kind, although
Ephron, a recovering journalist who wrote and directed "You've Got
Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle," didn't set out to launch her maiden
voyage as a playwright. Her inspiration came from a couple of
biographies of McCarthy as well as her memories of Hellman, whom
she'd met years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that's delicious about these women is that
they're such a Rorschach because everyone I know who knew them tells
the story of their enmity in a completely different way, depending on
who they are," Ephron says. "Some will tell it all in terms of
jealousy, some in terms of politics, some in terms of women, and I
can tell you a version based entirely on sex. And then there's the
question of what they represented in the lawsuit, the fact versus
fiction of it. So for me they were the gift that never stops giving."
But if middle-aged, female protagonists are a rarity on stage,
consider their visibility in Hollywood. "Someone said, 'It's a play,'
" Ephron recalls. "It's so dramatic, and it's about two older women.
Who's going to see a movie about two older women? No one."</TE>
<TE>   Equally pressing was the paradox of Hellman's and McCarthy's
relationship: Though both figured so hugely in each other's lives
that they took up a chunk of their respective obituaries, the women
barely knew each other.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't possibly have made this a movie in that they were
never together," Ephron says. "It would have to take place in some
reality, and reality is not your friend when it comes to this story
because there were at most two, maybe three meetings. And we don't
really know anything that happened at any of them except that they
loathed one another, and that's over a 40-some-odd-year period. So
what's the shape of the movie?"</TE>
<TE>   'A play with music'</TE>
<TE>   Because of or despite the fact that Ephron is new to the stage,
she easily dispenses with theatrical conventions. She blasts away the
fourth wall, so her characters direct many of their barbs to the
audience -- as well as to props, which may suddenly drop from the
ceiling. And she leavens what is essentially a dialogue by inserting
musical numbers that serve as a Greek chorus and yet don't turn the
play into a musical, in part because they don't move the action
forward. Ergo, the description: "a play with music." O'Brien calls
the song-and-dance numbers composed by Tony winner Marvin Hamlisch
("A Chorus Line") merely "a sorbet between courses at dinner."</TE>
<TE>   "What is thrilling," he says, "is she has no fear."</TE>
<TE>   She may be the only one. Stage veteran Kurtz says she was
attracted to the complex role of Hellman precisely because of her
fear. "I had no idea if I was going to nail it or not," she says,
"but when you get to this point that we're at in our careers, if
somebody comes along with something that's easy or it's a part you've
done before or it's just going to be fun, you've got to say no,
because it's not challenging. Unless it's really kind of terrifying,
what's the point?"</TE>
<TE>   Jones' fear of Ephron used to be far more personal, a fact she now
merrily recounts. Her terror of Ephron's image was dispelled several
years ago by an audition for a "You've Got Mail" part she didn't get.
"I was scared to death when I walked in," Jones says. "You think
someone like Nora is going to be very cynical and hard and
terrifying, but I'd never had such an easygoing, really fun audition.
We felt like we were sitting in her living room. That's why I wanted
to do ["Imaginary Friends"]."</TE>
<TE>   Since the show's San Diego run, O'Brien and Ephron have buffed its
rough edges, although the director says the changes are largely
cosmetic with the exception of the final scene. "We changed the
ending substantially to a really shocking, remarkably original idea,"
he says, "which I have no intention of saying." Meanwhile director
and playwright are eagerly anticipating the debut in New York, where
McCarthy and Hellman enjoyed a 40-year reign.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait," says O'Brien -- and not just because he's due to
receive the prestigious Mr. Abbott Award for lifetime achievement
from the Stage Directors and Choreographers Foundation on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I've taken a lot of work from California to New York, and there's
not a lot of difference between the two audiences: Most people on the
West Coast either have contacts on the East Coast or have come from
the East Coast. But this is one piece that will hit differently. New
York audiences will much more closely identify with and know the
careers of these women because they were New Yorkers. They're not
exotic here. It's like writing a play about the New York Yankees."</TE>
<TE>   If the Yankees wore skirts and had an edge, that is. But don't
mistake any of these broads for leading ladies. "Jack calls us the
two antagonists," says Kurtz, "because we're not really the
protagonists and we're not exactly the heroines."</TE>
<TE>   Jones smiles conspiratorially. "It's a poisonous confection," she
says.</TE>

<HD>They had more than spite in common</HD>
<DH>The literary lionesses both had intense careers and
personal lives, and stirred big emotions in others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patricia Zohn</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lives of Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy are part of the
dramatic back story of American political and intellectual thought of
the 20th century.</LD>
<LD>   Although they are now posed historically as sworn enemies because
of the lawsuit at the end of their lives, they had much in common.
Both were self-made women who juggled intense and demanding careers
with Big Personal Lives. McCarthy was married four times, including a
combustible hitch with Edmund Wilson, the revered essayist and
literary journalist, all while making her own way as a critic and
writer of daring fiction among the left-wing New York intellectual
circle of the 1930s. Hellman began her storied relationship with
Dashiell Hammett, the brilliant author of detective fiction, while
she was still married to press agent Arthur Kober.</LD>
<LD>   Hellman and McCarthy kindled ardent emotions in almost everyone
they knew as well as in each other, although they barely met. Hellman
disparagingly referred to McCarthy as that "lady magazine writer."
McCarthy's salvo on the Dick Cavett show in 1980 was the basis for
Hellman's lawsuit against McCarthy for $2.25 million.</LD>
<TE>   After success as a playwright and screenwriter, Hellman reinvented
herself through her memoirs. A story from "Pentimento" about her
alleged exploits in the antifacist underground became the 1977 film
"Julia."</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy also wrote three memoirs, the first of which, "Memories
of a Catholic Girlhood," paved the way for a new genre of
confessional memoir writing now very much in vogue. Her Hollywood
career was somewhat less successful: One of her early collections of
stories was sold to RKO for a pittance, and the film made from her
most famous novel, "The Group" by Sidney Lumet, was dismissed by the
critics.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy credited her teachers at Vassar for teaching her to break
rules and take risks. She became one of the first women invited into
the boys' club at the Partisan Review, the New York literary journal
that chronicled the political Left. A beautiful woman, she was
conscious of the impact she made: She remembered how "good-looking"
she was marching on Fifth Avenue singing "The Internationale" in a
May Day parade or as the best-dressed girl at a Trotskyite cocktail
party.</TE>
<TE>   Hellman, after two years at New York University, went to work in
publishing and then to Hollywood as a reader for MGM. Soon after, she
met Hammett, who urged her to write plays, even suggesting her first
subject in "The Children's Hour." Her involvement in Communist causes
eventually landed her on the blacklist and before the House
Un-American Activities Committee, where she submitted her famous
letter stating: "I cannot and will not cut my conscience to fit this
year's fashions."</TE>
<TE>   Although no beauty, she also had a turn as a style icon in a
famous ad for Blackglama mink.</TE>
<TE>   In their time, no one did "dish" better than Hellman and McCarthy.
The biting wits, the famous dinner parties and the difficult
demeanors of these Dark Ladies left zealous partisans and poisonous
memoirs in their wake. The lawsuit found the wagons circling, with
writers and intellectuals impatient to clamber aboard to take sides.
Some thought they were just dredging up the battles among the
leftists of the '30s and '40s, but from McCarthy's point of view,
Hellman was the defining example of modern literary charlatanism and
personified the downward trajectory of honesty in writing.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hellman died in 1984 before the suit was adjudicated,
McCarthy had been punished financially and emotionally. She died five
years later.</TE>

<TE>   Since a technical snafu derailed the screening of Matthew
Buzzell's "Jimmy Scott: If You Only Knew" last July, the American
Cinematheque has rescheduled this wonderful documentary of the great
77-year-old jazz vocalist, with Scott and Buzzell again present.
Framed by clips of Scott in concert on a Japanese tour and at the
Jazz Bakery in Culver City, where he performs this week, the film is
full of insights from friends, family, colleagues and above all from
the man himself. Early on, Scott tells us the importance of learning
how "not to let the bad overwhelm the good." In his case, this is no
small trick. Born in Cleveland as one of 10 children with an often
absent father, Scott at 12 was diagnosed with Kallman's disease, a
rare hormonal disorder that arrests puberty and is the reason for his
trademark high voice; seven months later his mother was killed,
struck by a car as she shoved her daughter to safety. From then on
Scott became driven to succeed to care for his siblings. He had
initial success singing with Lionel Hampton's band, but bad luck and
the exploitation shared by countless black recording artists of his
generation dogged him into oblivion in the '60s, and he was not
rediscovered until the '80s. The past decade has seen Scott record
and perform all over the world, and it is gratifying to see that
Scott, whose slender build belies a man of tremendous wisdom,
spiritual strength and energy, so gratefully and deservedly enjoying
every minute.</TE>

<HD>A pivotal presence</HD>
<DH>Better known for her stage work, Viola Davis finds herself
in an enviable role -- as a key player in three high-profile movies
this season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Maynard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a working actress, Viola Davis would like to get something off her
chest: There are such things as small roles. "Sometimes, you just
have to come in and deliver the pizza," she says. "Because I'm a firm
believer that you have to fit into the grand scheme of the movie. It
is your role, but you also play a part in the scheme of the whole
picture, and you have to understand what your role is in that."</LD>
<LD>   The 37-year-old Juilliard-trained actor knows whereof she speaks.
Last year, for example, Davis won a Tony Award for her performance as
a disenfranchised pregnant woman in August Wilson's "King Hedley II."
Davis has done four plays with Wilson, not to mention numerous other
Broadway, off-Broadway and regional theater productions since she
graduated from the New York drama school in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood success, however, has eluded her. The same year she won
the Tony, she had one scene in a movie as Policewoman in "Kate &amp;
Leopold," berating Hugh Jackman to clean up after his dog. "I got my
first film job in 1995," she recalls. "I got the role of a nurse in
'The Substance of Fire' and it paid like $500. I had to get my SAG
card, which was like $1,300. I was begging, borrowing and stealing
for the money."</LD>
<TE>   But there are small parts and then there are pivotal parts, of
which Davis has three in high-profile movies this season. As Sybil,
Julianne Moore's trustworthy maid in "Far From Heaven," Davis has
minimal dialogue, but her presence is keenly felt as she watches her
employer's domestic dream life evaporate when she finds herself drawn
to her black gardener.</TE>
<TE>   In one look, we see Sybil's tacit disapproval of their tentative
but evolving interracial courtship. The character is a composite of
African American women who stood on the sidelines in such '50s
melodramas as "Imitation of Life" and "The Reckless Moment." True to
form, we never see Sybil anywhere but within the house she cleans.</TE>
<TE>   "In 'Imitation of Life,' there's that great moment when Lana
Turner's maid, Annie, who's dying, tells her she wants to have a
funeral with all her friends," says "Heaven" director Todd Haynes.
"Lana Turner says, 'Annie, I didn't know you had any friends.' And
Annie says, 'Well, Miss Laura, you never asked.' What's so amazing
about that scene is it implicates the viewer. We never asked what
Annie's life is like on her own terms. It took an actress with
security and a real sense of understanding history to play that."</TE>
<TE>   Davis contends that taking on the role was a challenge; initially,
she did think, "Not the maid role again for a black woman," but she
also thought it was the best script she had ever read. "Todd Haynes
is making a human statement to me that not a lot of filmmakers are
making," she says. Moore's character "doesn't know what's going on
with Sybil. No one knows what's going on with Sybil. And that's the
most insidious part of racism, that we don't know each other. You
know what I think is interesting? The film takes place in 1958, but
we're still uncomfortable in 2002."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood and beauty</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the course of this interview at a Greek restaurant full
predominantly of white patrons in Larchmont Village, Davis takes glee
in obliterating what she calls "the lie of political correctness."
She grew up in a poor family of six kids in the all-white city of
Central Falls, R.I. She says the only black actors she saw were on TV
sitcoms: Ted Lange in "That's My Mama" and Redd Foxx and LaWanda Page
on "Sanford and Son."</TE>
<TE>   She's all too aware of what Hollywood makes of her as a
dark-skinned black actress -- a point hammered home when she joined
Steven Bochco's TV show "City of Angels," which made headlines in
2000 for being the first hourlong drama with an all-black cast.
Despite the talent on board (Blair Underwood, Vivica A. Fox,
"Saturday Night Live's" Maya Rudolph), the show didn't last even a
season. (Something lasting did come out of it -- her fiance, actor
Julius Tennon, who played a recurring role as an anesthesiologist.)</TE>
<TE>   "Those characters in 'City of Angels' were people with lives," she
says. "They were doctors and nurses, but they were also people with
senses of humor, girlfriends, boyfriends, shortcomings." Davis says
she's tired of seeing black women on screen as nameless nurses,
judges and public defenders.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like with white women, there are different kinds of
beauty," she says. "You have the pre-Raphaelite beauty, then you have
the girl next door, then you have the geek princess like Janeane
Garofalo. So you have them playing the different kinds of roles. With
black women, you're either beautiful or you're not. I'm not even just
talking pretty. If you're not a classical beauty, you're nothing. And
what happens at the end of the day is you don't want to carry that
home with you. You don't want to believe that's what the world
actually sees and believes about you. That's my thing."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the double standards, Davis is also a firm believer that
good things come to those who wait. She says that everything about
acting is standing in line. "Sometimes, it's not just about being
good," she says. "It's about just staying in the line long enough for
people to understand you're not leaving."</TE>
<TE>   On screen, the first director to really notice Davis was Steven
Soderbergh. In 1998, he cast her in a bit part in "Out of Sight"; in
2000, she played a social worker to Michael Douglas' drug-addict
daughter in "Traffic." Now, she has her biggest screen role to date
in Soderbergh's film "Solaris," opposite George Clooney in a part
that was written for her.</TE>
<TE>   "I find her to be one of those actors you cannot take your eyes
off," Soderbergh says. "She has such strength and integrity on screen
that I'm just gonna keep shoehorning her in as many films as I can."
Davis' sense of gravity comes in handy in this metaphysical
adaptation of Stanislaw Lem's heady, existentialist sci-fi novel. She
plays Helen Gordon, a scientist on a remote space station who clashes
in a battle of wills with psychologist Chris Kelvin (Clooney). She's
extremely wary of the manifestations emanating from the planet
Solaris, even though they take human form, including one in the form
of Kelvin's dead wife.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about the implications of what human beings do when faced
with their past, with their shame; how much it drives their lives,"
Davis says. "And just figuring out what this planet is. Is it God?"</TE>
<TE>   In addition to relishing the film's philosophical questions, she
also confesses to enjoying the perks of a big Hollywood movie. "We
filmed it on the Warner Bros. lot. They built a space shuttle, and I
was so excited. I was always poking things on the space shuttle set,
pushing buttons. And George Clooney. I think he's my favorite. I love
George Clooney."</TE>
<TE>   'She holds on'</TE>
<TE>   Her last role this season is in Denzel Washington's directorial
debut, "Antwone Fisher," a true story about an angry young sailor who
must confront his harrowing past to get beyond it. As Eva, the
crack-addict birth mother with whom he's finally reunited, Davis
didn't have to look far to draw inspiration; two of her five siblings
are cocaine addicts whose children are being raised by her parents.
"So, I understand Eva as a woman with a different set of
circumstances," she says. "My sister, my brother, they love their
children. They struggle with it every day. So, I was an actor in what
I did. I took it from the perspective that she's a human being with
an objective, with obstacles in her path. I didn't just play the
addict."</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Davis has one scene with three lines of dialogue. It
lasts all of five minutes, but it's the emotional climax of the film.
After telling her about his life, Antwone hugs and kisses Eva. Then
she breaks down. "You know what was nice about that?" says
Washington. "She holds on and holds on and holds on. Until he leaves
and then [you see] with one tear, you feel for her, that it hurts
her. The fact of the matter is that his mother had a very tough life
too." Davis, he adds, was "just brilliant. We shot that scene in one
day, and she never broke character."</TE>
<TE>   When asked how she got to that tear, Davis makes it sound easy.
"You just have to do the work and give up your vanity," she says.
"Play the character for what she is. Just do that and kind of stay
within the parameters. And breathe. That will get you very far."</TE>

<AU>Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not a great time for movie soundtrack albums -- well, movie
soundtrack albums without Eminem, at least.</LD>
<LD>   Even though we're in the fall blockbuster season, the album from
the Eminem-starring "8 Mile" is the only soundtrack in the Top 50
album sales chart compiled by Nielsen SoundScan. And for the week
ending Nov. 24, only one other (the score album from "Harry Potter
and the Chamber of Secrets") was in the Top 100. As star and producer
of the upcoming romance "Two Weeks Notice," Sandra Bullock believes
fans will want to hear some of film's music at home. Among the
selections: the current single featuring Vanessa Carlton with
Counting Crows on a version of Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow Taxi"; an
on-screen appearance by Norah Jones singing "The Nearness of You";
and such feel-good oldies as the Brook Benton-Dinah Washington duet
"Baby (You've Got What It Takes)" (the opening title music).</LD>
<LD>   But Bullock and music supervisor Laura Wasserman couldn't justify
releasing a conventional album in the current climate. Instead,
they've made a deal to let people download music from the movie and
burn their own CDs.</LD>
<TE>   The downloads will be available via Pressplay, the Internet site
launched a year ago as a joint venture of Sony Music Entertainment
and the Universal Music Group. The pay service allows consumers to
either make one-time package buys of 5, 10 or 20 downloads, or
subscribe to monthly or yearly plans giving them unlimited downloads
with varying numbers of "portable" tracks that can be burned to disc
or transferred to digital players.</TE>
<TE>   "This came about because Sandra hated the fact that people go to
her movies and enjoy the music and then to hear it go home and have
to dig through their CD collections song by song," says Wasserman.
"There is a market for this, an audience that will want these songs."</TE>
<TE>   Pressplay will give the movie a dedicated section on its site
before it opens on Dec. 20, with special related features and artwork
that can be downloaded by those who purchase the music. The film
producers will share in the revenue and include a plug at the end of
the credits noting that the music is available on Pressplay.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance began when Pressplay was pitched to Wasserman simply
as a resource for finding songs.</TE>
<TE>   "Laura was approached by one of our board members to turn her on
to using the site as a potential source of music for her
soundtracks," says Pressplay CEO Mike Bebel. "I reached out to her
and had a conversation and we started talking about unique
opportunities. For us, this fits nicely. Some of the tracks they want
are already on our service, and others we were able to get clearance.
Some of them have been out of print and working with the
relationships we have, we cleared them too."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers, guns,</TE>
<TE>   money and friends</TE>
<TE>   The album Warren Zevon is working on in the wake of his
announcement that he has terminal cancer has turned into an all-star
affair. Don Henley and fellow Eagle Timothy B. Schmit have joined a
roster including Jackson Browne, Dwight Yoakam, T Bone Burnett, Billy
Bob Thornton, Ry Cooder and Jim Keltner, as well as Zevon's son
Jordan, who sings some background vocals. Zevon's longtime friend and
associate Jorge Calderon is producing.</TE>
<TE>   And with Bob Dylan performing several Zevon songs in concert
recently, Zevon is returning the compliment by recording Dylan's
"Knockin' on Heaven's Door" for the album. So far, the rest of the
songs are originals written since he received his diagnosis, with
titles including "Numb as a Statue" and "Prison Grove."</TE>
<TE>   Zevon hopes to finish the album soon for release early next year
on Artemis Records.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, hey,</TE>
<TE>   we're Soluna</TE>
<TE>   If the Monkees had been women and bilingual ... well, it still
might not have been like a sitcom starring pop group Soluna. But the
L.A. quartet is developing a show for the UPN TV network based on the
members' lives. It doesn't hurt that the group's management, Suzanne
de Passe and Irene Dreayer, were previously involved in the creation
of the WB's "Sister, Sister" and "Smart Guy."</TE>
<TE>   Plans for Soluna's show include episodes based on show-biz
experiences of the four members -- America Olivo, T Lopez, Jessica
Castellanos and Aurora Rodriguez -- augmented by, of course, musical
performances.</TE>
<TE>   Soluna performs on Wednesday at a gala benefit for the youth
charity Heart of Los Angeles, part of an evening honoring DreamWorks
SKG president of production Mike De Luca.</TE>
<TE>   Small faces</TE>
<TE>   His "Room for Squares" album has passed the 1.5 million sales mark
and his reissued debut, "Inside Wants Out," has reached 500,000. Now
John Mayer is putting out his first DVD, "Any Given Thursday," due in
March. Filmed at a September concert in Birmingham, Ala., the disc
features the complete performance, plus backstage scenes and a full
interview with the singer-guitarist.</TE>
<TE>   Boston-based band Godsmack has, like many New Englanders, gone to
Florida for the winter, but it's a work trip. The group is recording
its fifth album in Miami with producer David Bottrill. A March
release is the tentative plan.</TE>
<TE>   Freshly married to Jessica Simpson, 98 Degrees singer Nick Lachey
is working on his first solo album, with Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds
producing several tracks in L.A. The project, which started in a rock
direction, is now said to have taken a funk turn. 98 Degrees,
meanwhile, is planning to make another album at an unspecified time.</TE>
<TE>   An expanded edition of T. Rex's 1971 glam-rock classic "Electric
Warrior" is set for a Feb. 11 release. The original album, featuring
"Bang a Gong (Get It On)" and "Jeepster," will be augmented with five
rare tracks that originally were singles or B-sides, plus a full
interview with the late Rex himself, Marc Bolan, that was a
promotional-only LP released when the album came out.</TE>
<TE>   The reactivated Tom Tom Club is in a holiday spirit, working on
two Christmas singles: a version of the traditional French song "Il
Est Ne (He Is Born)" and an as-yet-untitled original. The songs are
expected to be available soon as free downloads on the band's Web
site, www.tomtomclub.com.</TE>

<LD>Mariah Carey</LD>
<LD>   "Charmbracelet" (MonarC/Island Def Jam)</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   What's the starting bid for Carey's next recording contract?</TE>
<TE>   No one wants to kick a pop star when she's down, even if her music
has given us the creeps as much as this New Yorker's has. Her voice
can move between octaves with the speed of an oscilloscope, but with
almost no accompanying character or soul.</TE>
<TE>   So I went through this 65-minute "comeback" disc twice, trying to
find something -- anything -- positive to say after the disaster of
the "Glitter" film and album and the humiliation of having EMI
Records pay $30 million to bail out of its contract with the singer.</TE>
<TE>   Bingo: There's a two-second guitar solo on "You Got Me" (Track 5)
sharp and catchy enough to rescue a song so undistinguished even
guests Jay-Z and Freeway can't brighten it.</TE>
<TE>   You won't have trouble finding the solo because it is repeated
something like 50 times over the course of the track -- which makes
you wonder whether it's a sample or if someone actually sat there and
hit the strings over and over.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on "Charmbracelet," beware: The album (due Tuesday) is
every bit as professional and lifeless as you'd expect from Carey,
unless you think that this mega-seller's music really adds up to
anything more than what an amateur, "American Idol's" Kelly Clarkson,
gave us in her debut hit "A Moment Like This."</TE>
<TE>   Because Carey has sold umpteen million albums, record executives
must keep thinking they can collect on these multimillion-dollar
contracts if she can only recapture the public's ear. When EMI
bailed, Island Def Jam signed her to a $20-million, three-album deal
earlier this year. After "Charmbracelet," you wonder if someone at
the label is already reading the fine print.</TE>
<TE>   - Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   J.Lo may be giving</TE>
<TE>   fluff a bad name</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Lopez</TE>
<TE>   "This Is Me ... Then" (Epic)</TE>
<TE>   * 1/2</TE>
<TE>   The singer-actress' latest pop confection is pretty insubstantial,
even for fluff. Indeed, the hip-hop-flavored single "Jenny From the
Block" is easily the best number, despite its annoyingly disingenuous
down-to-earth-diva blather.</TE>
<TE>   J.Lo's M.O. is to offer little more than shimmery dance tunes and
cloying ballads that avoid vocal histrionics and stay within her
limited range. But this batch feels particularly factory-made, even
though she co-wrote (along with a gang of song doctors) nine of the
12 tracks. Indeed, although things at times get a little too personal
-- as with the ew!-worthy treacle of "Dear Ben" (as in Affleck, her
fiance) -- the ripped-from-my-diary approach doesn't make "This" any
more intimate, or any less cliched.</TE>
<TE>   The bland sentiments perfectly match the music's generic funk-lite
and sparkly disco-pop. If the opening sitar-ish riff on "The One"
sounds familiar, that's because it's cribbed from the old Stylistics
hit "You Are Everything," which Lopez performs in an unremarkable
bonus track cheekily titled "The One (Version 2)." She also does
herself no favors by faithfully remaking Carly Simon's '78 hit "You
Belong to Me," turning an already lame song a whiter shade of pale.</TE>
<TE>   -- Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   It's a barrier buster</TE>
<TE>   from Rhymes</TE>
<TE>   Busta Rhymes</TE>
<TE>   "It Ain't Safe No More ..." (J)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Busta Rhymes has long been one of hip-hop's most innovative and
entertaining figures, spitting lightning-fast lyrics in a seemingly
limitless slew of voices that would make Mel Blanc proud. His
larger-than-life persona and in-your-face delivery have powered an
impressive string of hits, including "Put Your Hands Where My Eyes
Can See" and "Pass the Courvoisier," but Rhymes has been criticized
for not delivering essential albums. Bogged down by skits and filler
tracks, his full-lengths rarely deliver on the promise of their
singles.</TE>
<TE>   His sixth album goes to great lengths to remedy that situation.
Using top-shelf producers such as the Neptunes and Jay "Dilla" Dee,
"It Ain't Safe No More ... " is Rhymes' most consistently solid
collection to date. Brimming with radio-ready singles (the
innuendo-laden bouncer "Make It Clap"), rugged street anthems (the
bombastic "Call the Ambulance") and smooth, crossover moves ("I Know
What You Want," featuring Mariah Carey), the material finally does
Rhymes' unquestionable MC skills full justice throughout the album's
18 cuts.</TE>
<TE>   -- Scott T. Sterling</TE>
<TE>   Arthur delivers</TE>
<TE>   distinctive album</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Arthur</TE>
<TE>   "Redemption's Son" (Enjoy/Universal)</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   In his two previous albums, the Ohio native circled around a
perfect balance of accessible craft and ambitious artistry, but he
hit the mark only occasionally. This time he's on target more often
as he reins in some of his experimental leanings.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he loses none of his distinctiveness as he incorporates a
variety of pop, folk and dense rock impressionism in service of moody
explorations. Overall, his ability to slide between various styles
continues to evoke his mentor, Peter Gabriel, even if his delivery
isn't as dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   And like Gabriel, he prowls the shadowy corners of his psyche with
pen in hand. Death stalks this album, from the ghost of the bad dad
in the title song to the dead lover in "Blue Lips," with
biblical-scale self-flagellation worthy of Nick Cave ("Thought I was
Jesus Christ / As I dug out my eyes"). Glimmers of hope appear, but
they're just teases. "Will salvation only come if I fall?" he wonders
in "Favorite Girl." It's his failure to find salvation or redemption,
though, that gives the art its life.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   Even with Sisqo,</TE>
<TE>   Dru Hill lacking</TE>
<TE>   Dru Hill</TE>
<TE>   "Dru World Order" (Def Soul)</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   Funny how a little taste of failure can send a highflying artist
crashing down to earth. Two years ago, Sisqo's "Thong Song" was a
ubiquitous hit and his album "Unleash the Dragon" sold millions.
There was even talk about leaving his old group Dru Hill behind for
good, but, hey, no hard feelings, guys.</TE>
<TE>   But Sisqo's second album didn't sell nearly so well, and now the
prodigal son has come back to try to make some commercial magic with
his old mates. "I knew that we could make it," the band sings on "Dru
World Order's" "I Do (Millions)," one of many slow jams on this
enervating record. That might be wishful thinking, but Dru Hill has
certainly hedged its bets.</TE>
<TE>   This is a group that skips the preliminaries and aims straight for
the bedroom. "If I Could" and "I Love You" are simmering ballads
designed to seduce but never offend. When Sisqo sings, "I'd like to
see if I could light your fire," he adds, "would you mind?" Clearly,
Dru Hill's female audience must be wooed back with care after a
four-year hiatus, but this uninspired collection doesn't shoot off
any hot sparks.</TE>
<TE>   -- Marc Weingarten</TE>
<TE>   In brief</TE>
<TE>   Alison Krauss + Union Station</TE>
<TE>   "Live" (Rounder)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the warmth and vitality of the music itself, this live,
two-disc album is a tribute to the integrity of Krauss, a marvelous
singer who for years has resisted offers from major labels to leave
her bluegrass roots and the Union Station band and move into a more
country-pop direction. The spirit of "O Brother Where Art Thou?"
lives on in these artists.</TE>
<TE>   -- Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   Baby Da #1 Stunna</TE>
<TE>   "Birdman" (Cash Money/Universal)</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   The Big Tymers member and co-owner of the Cash Money label is one
of hip-hop's most in-demand collaborators, with his off-key delivery
and clever, consumer-conscious name-dropping. P. Diddy, Toni Braxton
and Cam'ron join him on his first solo release, but this party drags
on a bit too much, making Baby's repetitive ruminations on women,
drugs and materialism a little tiring.</TE>
<TE>   -- Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   Talib Kweli</TE>
<TE>   "Quality" (Rawkus)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   In the hip-hop nation, this Brooklyn native is regarded as an
ambassador of political and social consciousness delivered through
lyrically lethal rhymes over rock-hard rhythms. On "Quality," cameos
from Mos Def, Bilal and Res bring a neo-soulful edge to Kweli's taut
urban wordplay, such as the bouncy, dance-floor-friendly "Waitin' for
the DJ." Producers Jay Dee and DJ Quik bring the bass-heavy beats.</TE>

<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),

<LD>Are we in a golden age of violinists? It looks like it. That
astonishing young players keep coming up the ranks and capturing the
public's imagination is nothing new. But what really seems to mark
our time as special is that so many of these young players continue
to grow and to keep their hold on the public as they move through
their 20s, 30s and 40s. Record companies have noted this and, despite
cutbacks elsewhere, support violinists in expensive concerto
recordings of standard repertory.</LD>
<LD>   The Times' reviewers check out the recent releases by several of
the current generation of violin stars.</LD>
<LD>   Mendelssohn/Shostakovich: Violin Concertos</LD>
<TE>   Hilary Hahn, violin. Oslo Philharmonic, Marek Janowski and Hugh
Wolff, conductors. (EMI)</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, at 23, inhabits Shostakovich's austere and ominous world
with uncanny understanding. She unfolds the opening nocturne -- one
of the composer's most desolate landscapes -- in one seemingly
endless, breathtaking line and narrows her tone in the Passacaglia to
a thread of a personal plea. The movement itself, under the expert
guidance of conductor Marek Janowski, harks back to the police state
of the final scene in "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk."</TE>
<TE>   Where she is less successful is in capturing the wild grotesquerie
born out of pain in the Scherzo and the final Burlesque. Still, she's
fearless, taking the Scherzo at Shostakovich's fast tempo. Her
playing in the Mendelssohn Concerto, led by Hugh Wolff, is suave,
mellow and sweet, evoking the relaxed, refined sensibility of an old
master.</TE>
<TE>   -- Chris Pasles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tchaikovsky/Shostakovich: Violin Concertos</TE>
<TE>   Ilya Gringolts, violin. Israel Philharmonic. Itzhak Perlman,
conductor. (Deutsche Grammophon)</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Ilya Gringolts was 16 when he won the 1998 Paganini Competition in
Italy playing Shostakovich's First Violin Concerto. This recording,
however, even though conducted by Gringolts' mentor, Itzhak Perlman,
doesn't measure up to recent competition. The young violinist makes
short little jagged lines out of the flow of the first movement and
sounds sluggish and wiry in the Scherzo. True, his Passacaglia is
full of protest, but it doesn't begin to reflect the horrors evoked,
say, in Hilary Hahn's recording with the Oslo Philharmonic. Somehow
Gringolts suffers as himself; others suffer as Shostakovich and
humanity.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, his personal approach to Tchaikovsky's Concerto
bucks the trend to objectify this composer's music. Gringolts finds
the secret of the work in Tchaikovsky's inspiration, his love for the
young violinist Joseph Kotek. His playing ranges from the flirtatious
and beguiling to an ardent declaration of feeling. He is warmly
seconded in all this by Perlman's detailed conducting.</TE>
<TE>   -- C.P.</TE>
<TE>   Beethoven: Violin Concerto, Opus 61; Two Romances: In G, Opus 40;
in F, Opus 50</TE>
<TE>   Anne-Sophie Mutter, violin. New York Philharmonic, Kurt Masur,
conductor. (Deutsche Grammophon)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Mutter's technical control and artistic overview are awesomely
deployed in the purely musical service of the Olympian work. Fiery
authority has long since been the violinist's trademark; she uses it
here to build a virtually definitive reading of a familiar
masterpiece.</TE>
<TE>   In the opening movement, and in portions of the Larghetto, she
flirts with inaudibility, attempting to underline the dynamic
contrasts in the piece; sometimes, that distorts the longer musical
line. But this is a quibble. The work has a fresh life under Mutter's
probing; Masur and the orchestra add solidity to the enterprise.
Mutter plays Kreisler's cadenzas with her usual panache.</TE>
<TE>   -- Daniel Cariaga</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mozart: Violin Concertos Nos. 1, 3, 4</TE>
<TE>   Viktoria Mullova, violin and conductor; Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment. (Philips)</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   It is now 20 years since a young violinist dubbed "the ice maiden"
made headlines by defecting from the Soviet Union. She was
frighteningly good if a bit ferocious in her severe playing. But over
the years, Mullova has also demonstrated plenty of fire on stage and
off (there was a prominent affair with Claudio Abbado), and she has
been a favorite collaborator with Esa-Pekka Salonen for 20th century
concertos. The latest wrinkle in her career has been her rejection of
the industrial-strength Soviet school of fiddling, exchanging modern
steel strings for the gut strings of old.</TE>
<TE>   Here in three of Mozart's five concertos, which she performs with
an orchestra of period instruments, you get the best of old and new.
Her playing is as elegant, sure-fingered and marvelously in tune as
ever, but there is a new sense of coloration. The floating effect she
gets in the slow movements is especially entrancing but, in all
respects (including her conducting), these are fresh, beautifully
gauged performances.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mark Swed</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brahms: Violin Concerto, Double Concerto</TE>
<TE>   Gil Shaham, violin; Jian Wang, cello. Berlin Philharmonic, Claudio
Abbado, conductor. (Deutsche Grammophon)</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   The subject is bread-and-butter Brahms, and the latest attempts by
some of today's stars to say something fresh won't seduce you away
from the cherished recording teams of yore. In the Violin Concerto,
Abbado states most things casually at hurried speeds, and Shaham
makes attractively slender sounds that mostly skim over the music's
surface. Just another night at the concerto factory.</TE>
<TE>   Skip to the Double Concerto, recorded about a year and a half
later, and the picture changes. Abbado's tempos broaden, the textures
thicken, the weight increases to Teutonic proportions. It sounds like
the work of a different conductor, even allowing for the more
autumnal flavor of the Double. Perhaps as a result, Shaham digs
deeper, while Wang opens with sufficient gravitas, but often fades
into reticence later on.</TE>
<TE>   -- Richard S. Ginell</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maxim Vengerov</TE>
<TE>   "Maxim Vengerov Plays Bach, Shchedrin, Ysaye" (EMI)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Siberian-born violinist Maxim Vengerov, 26 and sounding like an
old, nimble soul, makes a bold enough noise to give this solo violin
recording a large, deep, mysterious presence. Although little of
Bach's music appears here, he is a strong reference point in a set
including Eugene Ysaye's Bach-based sonatas and Russian composer
Rodion Shchedrin's entrancing and virtuosic "Echo Sonata," a 300th
birthday tribute to Bach.</TE>
<TE>   Vengerov picks up a Baroque violin for Bach's Toccata and Fugue in
D minor, normally heard in its big-throated organ version. Here, it
gains a dignity and intimacy through the instrument's dry sonority
and an understated performance. For a contrasting lark of a finale,
the album closes with a live recording of Shchedrin's Balalaika, a
pizzicato puzzler written for Vengerov.</TE>

<HD>Artificial flowering</HD>
<DH>'Secretary,' 'Punch-Drunk Love' and 'Far From Heaven'
achieve their emotional impact precisely because of their
non-naturalistic acting and stylized technique.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Reed Johnson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes in the movies, the best way to get at the truth is by
getting false. In a world where massive steel skyscrapers can crumble
to dust in seconds, and demented snipers use innocent mall-shoppers
for target practice, our sense of the normal parameters of reality
grows shakier by the day. Maybe that's partly why three of this
fall's most memorable films -- "Secretary," "Punch-Drunk Love" and
"Far From Heaven" -- are able to plumb deeper emotional and cultural
realities by putting their trust in the artificial, the stylized and
the hyper-real.</LD>
<LD>   Each of these movies briefly masquerades as something that it's
not. For a while they half-lull us into believing we're watching a
wistful romantic comedy ("Punch-Drunk Love"), a kinky psychodrama
("Secretary") or a period melodrama a la "Peyton Place" with no more
substance than a Kleenex ("Far From Heaven").</LD>
<TE>   Then the veils fly off, the filters lift, and they wallop us with
the disclosure of a husband's closeted homosexuality, a town's covert
racism, a mousy secretary's secret penchant for S&amp;M or a nebbishy San
Fernando Valley salesman's pent-up desires. They jar us by showing
what was previously concealed beneath the contrivances and
conventions of cinematic genre. It's as if the directors had given us
X-ray glasses and we were finally able to see into the souls of the
characters and behind the placid, quotidian surfaces of the worlds
they inhabit.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike so many of their Hollywood peers, directors Steven
Shainberg ("Secretary"), Paul Thomas Anderson ("Punch-Drunk Love")
and Todd Haynes ("Far From Heaven") clearly aren't afraid to bend the
rules and play against audience expectation. All three directors are
acquired tastes, and tapping into their wavelengths can be a
challenge. But this may be in part the result of a shift in American
movies over the past 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   From the late '60s to the middle '70s, gritty urban naturalism was
the default mode of much serious Hollywood filmmaking. Watching
movies like "Midnight Cowboy," "Taxi Driver," "Dog Day Afternoon,"
"Klute" and "The French Connection," audiences were meant to feel as
if they were really prowling Manhattan's fetid sidewalks alongside
Jon Voight's Joe Buck or Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the default mode of many serious Hollywood films is
artifice and surrealism, a change that, though gradual, seems to have
caught audiences slightly off guard. For viewers conditioned by pop
culture standards of what constitutes psychological naturalism and
social realism, the characters may seem too stiff, formalized or just
plain weird to be credible. But asking why the people in "Secretary"
or "Punch-Drunk Love" don't behave like case studies in some
self-help bestseller is like asking why Picasso painted one half of a
woman's face red and the other blue. The simple answer is that in art
sometimes the mask, the makeup, is more expressive and revealing than
what's underneath it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all smoke and mirrors. You should see her before she gets
her face on," says Dennis Quaid's character in "Far From Heaven" when
a party guest asks how his wife (Julianne Moore) manages to juggle
her various matronly duties. It's a snide remark, made by a
half-sloshed ad executive struggling to keep his life from going to
pieces.</TE>
<TE>   But in the context of the movie's preoccupation with surface
versus substance, Quaid's retort is right on target. Moore's suburban
Hartford housewife is a woman so outwardly unruffled that she might
be a Montgomery Ward mannequin. A product of her times, she's been
put together with as much sturdy good sense and color-coordinated
good taste as her '50s-modern living room furniture.</TE>
<TE>   "Far From Heaven" invites -- no, forces -- us to see beyond this
seamless surface, to ask who is this woman leading a doll's-house
existence in the explosive period of Joe McCarthy, Rosa Parks and the
atomic bomb. And who is her husband, imprisoned in the psychological
norms (i.e. the "reality") of the day, which regarded homosexuality
as a mental illness requiring electroshock therapy?</TE>
<TE>   Constraints are key</TE>
<TE>   Film, essentially a realistic medium, has flip-flopped throughout
its history between the desire to capture "ordinary" life and the
urge to manipulate what the camera and the audience see.</TE>
<TE>   Today, weaned on self-conscious irony in everything from pop songs
to advertisements, and inundated with real-life events so bizarre as
to strain comprehension, we are gradually (re-)turning to directors
able to express their ideas through a more mannered mode of acting
and character representation, a more stylized and expressionistic
sense of design.</TE>
<TE>   But "Secretary," "Punch-Drunk Love" and "Far From Heaven" show
that artificiality needn't have an emotional impact only above the
neck. In fact, it's the formal constraints in these movies that make
the emotions go "Pop!" Fakeness makes these films more emotionally
transparent by throwing their honesty into relief.</TE>
<TE>   For some viewers, that distancing effect may be disconcerting. Can
the meek girl Friday played by Maggie Gyllenhaal in "Secretary"
really be submitting with a mischievous smirk to a vicious spanking
from her anal-retentive boss (James Spader)? In "Punch-Drunk Love,"
can Adam Sandler's character really be cooing to the mystery woman
played by Emily Watson that he longs to smash her face in, as they
lie entwined in a tender lovers' embrace?</TE>
<TE>   Yet in each film the director signals us that we're not supposed
to be taking these characters and their predicaments at simple face
value. Both movies unspool in self-contained, looking-glass worlds
where there's little awareness of outside events, allowing both to
maintain a hermetic seal of illusion.</TE>
<TE>   In "Secretary," the skewed camera angles, bizarre decor of
Spader's office suite and hairpin turns of dialogue announce that
we're not watching some literal-minded "Oprah" confessional about
people who get their kicks by slapping each other around. The
ritualized S&amp;M in "Secretary" is a screen through which we come to
understand how two off-kilter human beings find a way to connect with
each other.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, "Punch-Drunk Love" presents us with a kind of false
front, a soft-focus romantic sheen that cracks in the first few
minutes of the film when, for no obvious reason, an SUV spins out of
control and explodes on a quiet suburban street. Moments later, a cab
stops and an anonymous occupant deposits a Melodeon in the middle of
the road, while our unlikely hero, Barry Egan (Sandler), looks on
blankly. Already, we know we're not going to be watching "Sleepless
in the San Fernando Valley." "Punch-Drunk Love" upends and demolishes
the conventions of the Hollywood romantic comedy as surely as it does
that SUV.</TE>
<TE>   If "Punch-Drunk Love" feels practically like an entire new genre,
"Far From Heaven" brilliantly refashions an old one: the melodrama.
One of the film's small miracles, apart from its stars' exquisitely
calibrated performances, is that it finds wrenching emotional
credibility in what at first blush seems patently unreal. Director
Haynes, who once made a movie about pop star Karen Carpenter using
Barbie dolls as body doubles, knows what truths artifice can reveal.
By cloaking his film in alluring ornamentation, he draws attention to
the emotional longings buried below the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Much critical ink has been spent in the last few weeks noting
Haynes' indebtedness to Douglas Sirk (ne Detlef Sierck), the
German-Danish director who later migrated to Hollywood. In films like
"All That Heaven Allows" and "Imitation of Life," Sirk pulled the rug
out from under the representational cliches of the classic Hollywood
melodrama, with its gushy notions of male and female behavior and
one-size-fits-all morality, to show the sexual and social turmoil
coursing through Eisenhower's America.</TE>
<TE>   "Far From Heaven" is an obvious Sirk homage, but perhaps another
antecedent is the neo-Mannerist art that brought up the rear of the
High Renaissance. With figures that had pale, translucent skin and
stiffly contorted postures, and by using "shot" colors that blend
into each other, Mannerism sought to express a broad palette of human
emotion, to grab spectators by the throat. (In the movie's press kit,
Haynes says he hopes audiences will respond to "Far From Heaven" with
"tears of recognition -- where the heightened stylistic experience
only clarifies how much, in this all-too-human story, we recognize
ourselves.")</TE>
<TE>   Mannerism also openly and self-consciously flouted the visual and
intellectual conventions of its day and, as the Penguin Dictionary of
Art and Artists states, it "presupposed an educated spectator;
otherwise there is no point in breaking the rules."</TE>
<TE>   Haynes, Anderson and Shainberg seem to credit their audiences with
intelligence and a basic knowledge of film history. But perhaps more
importantly, they trust them to be able to see beyond the obvious, to
approach movies not as jaded popcorn munchers but as people who come
to the theater with their eyes and hearts open, hoping maybe to
experience something unexpected and intense.</TE>
<TE>   As happens in fairy tales, it is, finally, the pure-of-heart in
these three movies who engage our thoughts and feelings most fully,
who overcome enormous odds and who find, if not happiness, then at
least a better version of truth than the one they'd subscribed to
before. "Do you think we ever really do see beyond the surface of
things?" Julianne Moore's distressed Cathy Whitaker asks her friend
Raymond (Dennis Haysbert) in "Far From Heaven."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I do," replies the African American gardener. "I don't
really have a choice."</TE>
<TE>   We don't really have a choice either. So we're lucky to have
filmmakers among us who can see that "reality" isn't always as
genuine as it appears to be.</TE>

<TE>   Tapping into the truth</TE>
<TE>   Artificiality in film has taken many different forms, from German
Expressionism to MGM musicals. Here are a few well-known movies that
employ stylization and exaggeration to tap a deeper vein of
psychological, cultural or moral truth.</TE>
<TE>   The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919): German Expressionist classic
that used skewed, claustrophobic sets and other creepy effects to
convey a madman's point of view.</TE>
<TE>   Contempt (1963): Director Jean-Luc Godard invoked Greek mythology
and tweaked Hollywood in his self-conscious, multilayered satire of
filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Velvet (1986): A hyper-real quality suffused characters and
sets in David Lynch's dark comic thriller of small-town life.</TE>
<TE>   American Beauty (1999): Surreal fantasy sequences and exaggerated
emotions enlivened Sam Mendes' take on contemporary suburbia.</TE>

<HD>A muse for the masses</HD>
<DH>Free spirit James Hubbell helps create a fanciful school in
an unlikely place in Mexico.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Tijuana</DL>
<LD>James Hubbell, nearly 71 years old and still inclined to daydreams of
dragonfly wings, steers his white Dodge van with eerie calm through
hellish binational traffic. Behind him, he keeps at hand a tape
measure, a bag of mortar, a builder's level, several trowels, a tube
of sun block. Ahead, as usual, lies a building site.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't really know why I do it, except it's an excuse to do
something," Hubbell has just been saying. "I just like to build."</LD>
<LD>   For more than four decades, Hubbell has been shaping walls that
undulate, roofs that swoop and stained-glass designs of intricate
abstraction. Known among his admirers as a sort of mystic with dirt
under his fingernails, Hubbell has never landed a million-dollar
commission or won a Pritzker Prize, architecture's top honor. In
fact, as he is quick to admit, he is neither trained as an architect
nor licensed as one in the state of California. But he has conceived
and built parks on three continents, lectured at UC Berkeley and
Vladivostok, Russia, and designed (with licensed co-signers) several
custom homes in California and Washington.</LD>
<TE>   His palace doors hang in Abu Dhabi. Perhaps his most widely known
design, a jewel-box chapel that seems to flutter in the breeze,
stands in the elite Northern California community of Sea Ranch. And
every June, when he and his wife throw open the doors of their home
in the mountains east of San Diego for a single day, hundreds of San
Diegans show up to gape at all the sinuous shapes and shake hands
with the soft-spoken, blue-eyed host. He calls his style "the
architecture of jubilation."</TE>
<TE>   So why does he drive south across the border at least once a
month, then veer inland, turn off the main highway, climb a series of
rustic roads and pull the Dodge to halt on a hilltop lot amid the
heat and dust of a bedraggled Tijuana colonia?</TE>
<TE>   Because he has clients here, scores of them, from preschool
through sixth grade. For the last dozen years, Hubbell has served as
in-house artist and designer, volunteer wrangler and
construction-site grunt to the Colegio Esperanza and Jardin de Ninos
La Esperanza, a struggling nonprofit kindergarten and an elementary
school founded by a crusading mother from San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   A few strides from Hubbell's parking spot on the Tijuana hilltop
stands the campus, a complex of buildings bearing all the telltale
Hubbell signs, from curved surfaces to mosaic tile work to recycled
materials. On the bathroom walls, blue dogs cavort with red-winged
birds. On another wall, stylized horses stand against shell-fringed
starry skies. Outside, a tall, twisting trellis, devised by a group
from UC San Diego's short-lived architecture school, throws shade on
a sitting area with a broad view of the colonia.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, this marriage of site, design and social mission stops
newcomers in their tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "Es un cuento. It's a story, like a fantasy world, when you first
arrive," says Tijuana architecture student Erendira Gonzalez, 26, who
started volunteering at the site about a year ago. "It seems out of
place, with all those curves. But since I've been going more, I see
that it connects with the place, with the houses around it.... From
the moment you go in, you sense that it's a special place."</TE>
<TE>   This is the riddle built into much of Hubbell's work: Organically
inspired and whimsically suggestive, his projects look as if neither
designer nor occupant should harbor a care in the world. In fact,
however, Hubbell's entire career has been shaped by his social agenda
and his refusal to work the way most architects do.</TE>
<TE>   In many respects, the school is an emblem for all of this. But for
the man who designed it, there's nothing complicated here.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an excuse to build something," says Hubbell. "I'm always
looking for those excuses."</TE>
<TE>   Students and volunteers</TE>
<TE>   The sun is high, the roosters have retired, and the dogs are
curled up in the shade. It's a working Saturday on the hilltop, and
the volunteer crew at the Esperanza schools is larger than usual --
more than 50 workers, including several Mexican architecture students
and a group from the San Diego Junior Chamber of Commerce, all
laboring amid thick Tijuana dust and the scent of distant trash
fires.</TE>
<TE>   With noon approaching, one group of volunteers stacks stones and
cement to fortify a wall. A second group is tiling nearby steps,
while a third digs a trench in the garden. Others sort tile or pilot
wheelbarrows, and a gaggle of neighborhood kids is inexpertly washing
the volunteers' cars at 50 cents per vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner, several mothers from the neighborhood are
tiling the curb in front.</TE>
<TE>   Hubbell, unshaven and grubby in a polo shirt but pacific as ever,
chalks in the outline of a stylized white rose, then shambles off to
sort through broken tiles for the right colors.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very shy," says Christine Brady, the school's founder. To
understand Hubbell, she adds, it's important to remember that
"construction is very addictive. You know how those rock climbers go
out to Joshua Tree and climb every Saturday? Builders love to build
the same way. And Jim is an aficionado of the construction process.
He likes to bend the rebar into shapes that are aesthetically
pleasing. That's the real Jim Hubbell."</TE>
<TE>   The hillside neighborhood lies nine miles south of the border, its
streets sprinkled with the occasional middle-class home, but more
often dominated by hovels of crumbling bricks, recycled plywood and
jury-rigged tarps.</TE>
<TE>   It's a tricky place to introduce wavy walls. And Brady, who
brought Hubbell into this project, is no easy client. Raised in
Pennsylvania, trained in physics at Princeton and engineering at
Stanford, she spent most of the 1980s as a civilian employee at the
Navy's Ocean Systems Center in San Diego, specializing in
microelectronics and acoustics.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1987, she started volunteering at a Tijuana orphanage and
met a little girl she eventually adopted. Along the way she got
interested in that girl's old neighborhood, where many mothers were
working in nearby maquiladoras, leaving a day-care gap in addition to
a shortage of schools. Before long, Brady had launched the school and
stepped into a role as headmistress and cultivator of donors.</TE>
<TE>   But more than a decade later, as she hollers to round up
volunteers for lunch or blurts a corrective suggestion to the
mural-painting team, it's clear that she'll never be a smooth
operator. If she and Hubbell were a crime-fighting team, she'd
certainly be the bad cop.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more of a straight-talker," she says. "A practical thinker. I
took a personality test once, and they told me I could only do one of
two jobs. The first was running Marine Corps field operations, and
the other was being president of a corporation. With this, I got a
little of each. But I'm not going up for any diplomacy awards."</TE>
<TE>   Her collaboration with Hubbell, she acknowledges, is a complex
relationship. But in many ways, it has gotten easier.</TE>
<TE>   "The things that I thought would be the most God-awful turned out
to be the most beautiful," Brady confesses. "I learned to trust him."</TE>
<TE>   Edges of architecture's radar</TE>
<TE>   Hubbell is far from the first person to seize on the idea of
architecture as a tool for social change. But he's among a very few
working persons, architects or otherwise, to build their careers
around the idea at such a grass-roots level.</TE>
<TE>   Hubbell is revered in San Diego; the Oceanside Museum of Art gave
him a retrospective in 1998, and the local public television station
aired its second documentary on him Sept. 29. But many thoughtful,
alert architects in Los Angeles have never heard of him.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Kappe, director of the Southern California Institute of
Architecture from 1972 to 1987 and an employer of organic shapes in
his own designs, blames academic fashion for Hubbell's obscurity
outside his hometown. Basically, says Kappe, Hubbell hit his stride
in earthy design and social crusading just as this country's leading
architectural tastemakers were turning away from those things and
embracing aloof postmodernism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad," says Kappe, who recalls visiting two Hubbell
buildings years ago. "I think he's a very good architect."</TE>
<TE>   The roots beneath his nest-building, says Hubbell, are no great
mystery. Born in New England, he calculates that he attended 12
schools in 13 years of near-constant motion. Though his mother's
family had financial means, she spent much of her life on a series of
attempted new beginnings, in search of a mate and home that would
last. By the time Hubbell finished high school, they were living in
Rancho Sante Fe, in northern San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Hubbell says his first career goal was to be a steeplechase
jockey; as a boy, he loved horses. But in his late teens and early
20s, Hubbell traveled widely, served two years with the U.S. Army
(mostly in Korea) and studied at Connecticut's Whitney Art School and
Michigan's Cranbrook Art Academy. Looking at his work, you can
readily guess the most influential stops on his itinerary: the
hut-like organic forms (Africa), the leaded glass and dramatic play
of light (Notre Dame in Paris), the fractured tile work and soaring
rebar (Antonio Gaudi's works in Barcelona, Spain).</TE>
<TE>   In 1958, at 27, he started putting down roots. Back in San Diego,
he began working with architect Sim Bruce Richards and married a
teacher named Anne Stewart. For $350 per acre, Hubbell recalls, they
bought 10 acres in the mountains of eastern San Diego County, just
outside Julian, where he resolved to build a home. Digging holes for
the first footings, he collected granite chunks that became the first
walls. After so many itinerant years, says Hubbell, "I was anchoring
myself. I was saying, 'I'm tied to this earth.' "</TE>
<TE>   Over the years that followed, Richards, once a student of Frank
Lloyd Wright, came to rely on Hubbell for delicately wrought,
organically influenced detail work, from lamps to doors to windows.
Meanwhile, Hubbell's independent projects grew more ambitious, though
he never bothered to secure a degree or license in architecture.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're an artist, you're supposed to be eccentric," he
explains. "You're not supposed to know anything. If you're an
architect, you have to fit this image."</TE>
<TE>   By the 1970s, he was designing restaurant interiors, the
occasional home (with licensed collaborators) and many windows,
including the stained glass above the altar at All Souls Episcopal
Church of San Diego's Point Loma neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Back on that 10 acres in the mountains, Hubbell surrounded his
wife and their four sons with a compound that is part western
homestead, part Hobbit hole and part Yes album cover. The complex,
which kept growing until 1987, now consists of eight structures,
including a studio operation with half a dozen part-time employees.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing was nature. We put little stakes in the ground,
around the trees and rocks," says Anne Hubbell, explaining how the
home's site and floor plan evolved.</TE>
<TE>   On normal workdays at home, Hubbell might sketch building plans or
make jewelry, daub a watercolor or assemble a window, fire a
sculpture in the kiln or hire a model and do some figure drawing.
Lately, he's been working on a poem inspired by the discovery of
dragonfly wings at water's edge during a lakeside hike. His days at
the Tijuana school have evolved into a monthly routine, advertised in
advance on the Hubbell and school Web sites
(www.hubbellandhubbell.com and www.americasfoundation.net,
respectively).</TE>
<TE>   And when Hubbell needs to collaborate with a licensed architect
these days, he need only turn to his son and business partner, Drew,
who has become a proponent of ecologically sensitive design,
especially straw-bale construction.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the senior Hubbell's most ambitious project is a string of
parks around the Pacific Rim. The sites -- sculptured landscapes
built by Hubbell, collaborator Milenko Matanovic and a corps of
students and volunteers to carry a common "pearl" theme -- so far
include San Diego's Shelter Island (1998); Yantai, China (2001); and
Vladivostok (1994).</TE>
<TE>   But Hubbell is also especially excited about plans for an Earth
Discovery Institute on the state-owned 2,600-acre Crestridge
Ecological Preserve in southeast San Diego County. He's designing a
gateway.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a really interesting job," Hubbell says. "And hopefully, I
get paid."</TE>
<TE>   An alliance forms</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen years ago, when Christine Brady realized she needed an
architect, she'd never heard of Hubbell.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, Brady had made the kindergarten a full-time crusade,
operating out of a conventional rectangular building on site,
handling donations through a U.S.-based nonprofit organization called
the Americas Foundation. Though she hadn't received any financial
backing from the Mexican government -- and still hasn't, she says --
state and federal officials helped her negotiate legalities there.</TE>
<TE>   Because the colonia's population was so socially and economically
diverse, she was looking for design with a deeper identity,
"something that would transcend class differences." But her
interviews with architects didn't go so well.</TE>
<TE>   "I was extremely harsh," she admits. "I murdered their egos. I
told one guy, 'I'm not going to build a chicken coop.' "</TE>
<TE>   She had, however, always liked the stained-glass windows at All
Souls, her church in Point Loma. So when a mutual friend told her
more about the man behind those windows, Brady decided to call. Next
came a visit to Tijuana, then a meeting in Julian, where after just a
few days of pondering, Hubbell offered up rough models of three
possible designs.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1990 the two forged an alliance, and soon Hubbell was
Brady's leading volunteer, showing up in Tijuana every Friday and
Saturday. By 1992, they'd expanded their ambitions to include Colegio
La Esperanza, an elementary school about five blocks from the
kindergarten. In the surrounding neighborhood, meanwhile, there was
still no piped-in water or electricity, and the school's power
depended on "a two-mile-long extension cord."</TE>
<TE>   Utilities have since arrived. But Tijuana's colonias, Hubbell
says, "are sort of forgotten places. They spring up, and the
government doesn't have resources to help them. But say you have a
famous murder. Then you exist. Well, if you've got the most beautiful
school in Tijuana, then you exist.</TE>
<TE>   "If you do a school with all that effort, a school that people in
La Jolla would be jealous of, at least you get the kids confused,
which is probably the beginning of change."</TE>
<TE>   Brady agrees with the sentiment. But as an engineer, she can't
help but point out that these buildings are more practical than they
look: Construction costs have amounted to less than $40 per square
foot, she says -- about one-fourth the going rate for public school
construction in California.</TE>
<TE>   Along with volunteers from the U.S. and Mexico, the school's staff
can rely on a nucleus of supportive families to turn up for workdays
and student performances. But workaday operations are no fairy tale.</TE>
<TE>   "The community is so schizophrenic," says Bill Roley, a
sustainable agriculture expert who has been working on an irrigation
system for the campus garden. "Six months ago, somebody stole the
valves. Then we replaced the valves, and they stole the faucets. This
is a beautiful dream and a frustrating reality." Brady blames a group
of the surrounding area's young men, and their trade in crystal meth,
for the thefts.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, finances at the school remain tenuous. During the
academic year, Brady says, operating costs amount to about $20,000
monthly, of which $10,000 is covered by tuition payments from pupils'
families. For the rest, Brady scrounges for endowment gifts and
scholarship sponsors, and frequently digs into her own pockets. In
one respect, at least, the school matches its surroundings: Rebar
protrudes from the roof line, signaling incompletion, as it does from
so many structures in Baja. In a room where a greenhouse was planned,
hand-me-down computers are now arrayed. In a room earmarked for art
projects, a ballet barre and mirrors are found because the school
landed a pair of Russian ballet instructors who were looking for a
challenge abroad. With their help, the children present a new
production yearly. This year it was a balletic version of "The Little
Prince." Hubbell created sets.</TE>
<TE>   In the remaining unbuilt school space, Hubbell would like to see
four more classrooms, a library and storage area. Brady, who
estimates that the elementary school is 40% complete, generally
agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "We're either 20 years or three years from finishing," says
Hubbell.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had $2 million, we could finish in two years," says Brady.</TE>
<TE>   Some might see that sort of uncertainty as a discouragement, and
Brady certainly has her dark days. But if Hubbell does, he doesn't
let on. Instead, he keeps making his monthly visits, juggling the
variables along with the other daydreams awaiting release through his
sketchbook, tape measure and trowel.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty convinced," he says, "that you could draw a line, or
put three notes together, that could change the world. The trick is
knowing how."</TE>

<TE>   Hubbell's roving imagination at work</TE>
<TE>   His style runs to organic shapes and playful compositions, but
beneath much of James Hubbell's art and architecture lies a sense of
social mission. Best known for his public sculptures, buildings and
windows, he also makes jewelry, turns out watercolors and produces
doors of leaded glass.</TE>

<LD>Washington politicians have used public relations techniques to try
to control what the public sees, hears and thinks about this
country's war efforts ever since President Woodrow Wilson established
the Committee for Public Information during World War I.</LD>
<LD>   Based on past performance, both by the current Bush administration
and by its immediate Republican predecessors, there's every reason to
think that if we go to war against Iraq, Washington will exert more
control over the media than ever before, using every tactic from
manipulation to deception to disinformation.</LD>
<LD>   Military and political leaders, eager to blame the news media for
the erosion of public support for the war in Vietnam, have imposed a
stranglehold on information and pictures from combat zones ever
since. They did it in Grenada in 1983, in Panama in 1989, in the Gulf
War in 1991 and in Afghanistan last year.</LD>
<TE>   The rationale that's almost invariably advanced for keeping
journalists far from the battlefront is that journalistic disclosures
could compromise the security of military objectives and the lives of
U.S. troops. But even Victoria Clarke, the Pentagon's chief
spokeswoman, conceded last year that the overwhelming majority of
Pentagon correspondents "support completely our concerns about
operational security and troop safety." Often, she said, reporters
checked with her voluntarily before publishing or broadcasting
information they thought could put U.S. forces or operations at risk.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, the Bush administration would like to control the
information and pictures coming out of Iraq, though, in an effort to
ensure that the American public and the world at large see only what
Washington wants them to see -- reports on smart bombs, precise
strikes, highly successful missions and minimal civilian casualties.</TE>
<TE>   It would prefer no reports of high American casualty counts, no
television footage of U.S. body bags, no eyewitness journalistic
accounts of failed missions, civilian casualties, combat atrocities
or allies who prove to be reluctant or incompetent. But the only way
to avoid such coverage would be to exclude the media from the front
lines again, and some reporters think that despite the desire of Bush
and Co. to do just that, "they learned some very painful lessons from
the way the Afghanistan conflict played out," says John McWethy, who
covers the Pentagon for ABC News.</TE>
<TE>   "They realize now that a huge part of winning any war has to do
with the world's perception of how that war is being fought, and if
there are no independent eyes watching what's happening in a
particular village, with a particular unit, the people who don't
agree with what the U.S. is doing can have a tremendous advantage in
shaping public opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, late last month the Navy, Army and Marines treated 58
journalists from 30 news organizations to an eight-day media boot
camp. The question now is, was this a new sign of media-military
cooperation and cohabitation or a clever exercise in public relations
and realpolitik?</TE>
<TE>   'Embedding' reporters</TE>
<TE>   The reporters and photographers participated in military
briefings, rode small amphibious craft through rough seas, visited
the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima, toured three other Navy ships
and accompanied Marines on a rigorous training mission at Quantico,
Va.</TE>
<TE>   Grunting under the load of full packs, the journalists carried out
a live landing drill, alternately crawling and running across an open
field while under mock fire. They also participated in other
demanding drills and learned how to administer emergency first aid
and how to don respiratory masks and avoid the spread of
contamination in case of chemical and biological warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials say other media boot camps will follow in an
effort to "raise the comfort level" of media and military working
together in close quarters, as Clarke puts it. These exercises are
intended as a preparatory step toward granting one of the
journalists' major requests should war come -- "embedding" them in
front-line combat units.</TE>
<TE>   "Embedding" is crucial to providing good war coverage -- if it's
done right.</TE>
<TE>   "Embedding means being assigned to one squad, in one platoon, in
one company," says Thomas E. Ricks, Pentagon reporter for the
Washington Post. "In Somalia, I was assigned to Alpha Company, 1st
Battalion, 7th Marines. I went on night patrol with them, and I ate
what they ate, slept where they slept. When they didn't shower, I
didn't shower. That's embedding -- not taking a bunch of reporters to
one camp, marching them around as a group to give the military PR
opportunities and then, when wounded troops show up, locking the
press up in a warehouse so they can't see anything, which is what
happened in Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   A worthwhile exercise</TE>
<TE>   Ricks and other Pentagon reporters say the media boot camps, as
well as continuing discussions with Pentagon brass, give them some
hope that the unhappy experiences of Afghanistan won't be repeated in
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But other reporters wonder if the training exercises are just a
public relations gimmick -- an effort to assuage journalists and,
simultaneously, to send a muscle-flexing message to Saddam Hussein,
demonstrating anew that President Bush is serious about making war.</TE>
<TE>   "It could all have been a charade," says Carol Williams, a Times
foreign correspondent who participated in the media boot camp. "There
were times when the whole thing seemed oriented around showing us
that we didn't belong in the forward lines. We were constantly being
told, 'If this were live fire, you'd be dead now.'</TE>
<TE>   "But even for those of us who've covered the military and been in
hostile environments before, about 90% of this was very useful,"
Williams says.</TE>
<TE>   While the soldiers and Marines conducting the training seemed
offended at times by the whole exercise, Williams says she "got the
clear sense that word has come down from on high that journalists
will be embedded ... They've done everything but sign in blood that
they'll take a good number of us with forward units ... and that one
point of the boot camp was to get the message to commanders that it
was up to them to make it work."</TE>
<TE>   What if media boot camp "has nothing whatsoever to do with
access," as Mark Thompson, Newsweek's Pentagon reporter, puts it?
Virtually everyone agrees that it's still a worthwhile exercise.</TE>
<TE>   "The military often complains that reporters show up on the
battlefield wearing tennis shoes and not knowing a lieutenant from a
colonel or one weapon from another," says ABC's McWethy. "Not only
does everything have to be explained to them, but they can become a
real danger to the [military] unit they're with."</TE>
<TE>   A generation of relative peace and the end of the military draft
have contributed to a press corps woefully short on military
experience and understanding, and that's been a long-standing source
of tension and estrangement between the media and the military.</TE>
<TE>   A 1995 report by the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center found
that 70% of the military and 74% of the media agreed with the
statement that "few members of the news media are knowledgeable about
national defense matters."</TE>
<TE>   But after Afghanistan, an increasing number of journalists have
learned at least a little something about combat operations, and the
Pentagon's various training exercises are increasing those numbers
even as the buildup toward war continues.</TE>
<TE>   The question now is whether Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and their
various field commanders will allow the journalists enough access to
implement what they've learned -- or if the promises of greater
access to front-line troops will be broken as readily in Iraq as they
were in Afghanistan.</TE>

<HD>The importance of being Ealing</HD>
<DH>England's Ealing Studios, famed for its series of Alec
Guinness comedies, is celebrated by Turner Classic Movies with a
monthlong festival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though its heyday lasted less than two decades, England's scrappy
Ealing Studios produced some of the greatest and most influential
films of the 1940s and '50s including such skillfully crafted
comedies as "Kind Hearts and Coronets," "The Lavender Hill Mob," "The
Man in the White Suit" and "The Ladykillers," all of which starred
Alec Guinness.</LD>
<LD>   "Forever Ealing," a documentary premiering Thursday on Turner
Classic Movies, celebrates the history and influence of the movie
studio located just outside London. Daniel Day-Lewis, whose
grandfather, Sir Michael Balcon, ran the studio during its golden
era, narrates the documentary, which features interviews with such
Ealing actors as Richard Attenborough, John Mills, Googie Withers and
John McCallum and cinematographer Douglas Slocombe. Contemporary
filmmakers Terry Gilliam, John Landis, Stephen Frears and Martin
Scorsese discuss the legacy of Ealing. TCM also will air 17 Ealing
movies every Thursday through Dec. 26.</LD>
<LD>   "World War II gave them sort of a focus," says Frears, a lifelong
fan of Ealing who worked at the studio when the BBC owned it. "They
made a lot of war films and there were a lot of clever people there.
They started writing about postwar England in these rather charming
comic terms."</LD>
<TE>   Frears describes the studio as a "nursery" with Balcon as the
nanny who cultivated and nurtured the talent, which included such
versatile directors as Charles Crichton, Alexander Mackendrick and
Robert Hamer.</TE>
<TE>   Mackendrick, whom Frears knew, had a hard time coping outside
Ealing's gates. He had come to America after "The Ladykillers" and
directed the 1957 drama "Sweet Smell of Success." Though now
considered a classic, it was a box-office failure. By the late '60s,
he gave up directing to teach the craft at CalArts.</TE>
<TE>   "Ealing just absolutely suited his temperament," Frears says. "But
once he got out of the nursery he couldn't really cope. He couldn't
cope unless nanny was there sort of holding his hand ... and
encouraging his brilliance."</TE>
<TE>   The studio began in 1902 and celebrated its 100th anniversary this
year with the release of the comedy "The Importance of Being
Earnest," the first film to be produced by the studio's new head,
Barnaby Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   During its pivotal years, Ealing was a "cottage industry," says
the documentary's producer, Caroline Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   "People worked in different roles. Charles Crichton started as an
editor and worked his way up to being a director. They all sort of
mixed and matched and really learned their craft. And the Red Lion
pub across the road from Ealing, it was very much where they would
meet after work and discussions would carry on well into the night.
It was a very social, quite hedonistic group of people. I think it
was a very creative place."</TE>
<TE>   Balcon, she says, was a wonderful mix of being a "real sort of
businessman who could deal with the finances and distribution and
then just a real catalyst in terms of putting the right people
together."</TE>
<TE>   A different world emerged</TE>
<TE>   The documentary features many clips from Ealing films, including
the seminal horror anthology "Dead of Night," the war film "The Cruel
Sea" and the action drama "Scott of the Antarctic." The bulk of the
clips, though, highlight the "Ealing comedies" that put the studio
and star Guinness on the map -- 1949's "Kind Hearts and Coronets," in
which Guinness played several members of a snobby family, each of
whom is eventually murdered by a disowned relative; 1951's crime
caper farce "The Lavender Hill Mob," for which he received his first
Oscar nomination; and the 1955 black comedy "The Ladykillers," in
which Guinness plays the psychopathic leader of a group of cutthroat
thieves outwitted by a little old lady.</TE>
<TE>   Balcon sold the studio in 1956. "It was due to economics," Frears
says. "You also could say that the world they described came to an
end really. A new lot of films were waiting to come through."</TE>
<TE>   "People have their creative heyday," Thomas says. "I am a great
believer that the magic sort of burns for a while. But I think it's
nigh on impossible to keep working with the same bunch of people.
There was also a change in sensibility politically. London in the
'50s was becoming much more multicultural. The one thing about Ealing
is it doesn't really reflect any sort of multicultural aspects at
all. It's very much imperial Britain, isn't it?"</TE>

<DH>After 35 years abroad, Pamela Rosenberg returns to
California to galvanize the slumbering San Francisco Opera.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>San Francisco</DL>
<LD>On Tuesday nights, San Francisco's opera patrons dress. Anything else
goes in this proudly permissive city, but society stays high. So, on
a recent Tuesday afternoon, Pamela Rosenberg, who became general
director of the San Francisco Opera last year, isn't quite sure how
the evening audience will respond to the opening of a new production
of Handel's "Alcina."</LD>
<LD>   "They're the toughest crowd, the biggest sponsors," she says in
her airy office. What she doesn't say is that they are a bastion of
tradition, and what she has in store for them is Baroque opera
performed with singers they probably haven't heard of and staged with
provocative, idea-intensive, gender-bending direction. And a touch of
nudity. The production was developed at the Stuttgart Opera in
Germany in the 1990s, while Rosenberg was its head. It was a hit; it
toured, it was broadcast on European television, and it has been
issued in America on an Arthaus Musik DVD.</LD>
<TE>   A couple of men in black tie do walk out that night, and there are
a few more empty seats after intermission than before. When the
German production team takes a bow, it meets with a lonely boo or
two. But nearly everyone else is on their feet in a standing ovation.
It is possible that many in the audience have never seen opera as
dramatically committed as this, for the simple reason that the San
Francisco Opera has never before presented such opera. For that
matter, most of the United States doesn't see opera like this either.</TE>
<TE>   With the first new productions of Rosenberg's reign this fall --
the American premiere of Messiaen's "St. Francois d'Assise," which
received nearly universal raves, and Janacek's "Kat'a Kabanova,"
which featured an unforgettable performance in the title role by
Karita Mattila -- as well as with "Alcina," it feels as if this
89-year-old company has been startled awake from a decades-long
slumber. And much to Rosenberg's surprise, even conspicuously
conservative audiences, like the Tuesday night gown-and-tux crew,
have gotten with the program.</TE>
<TE>   "I expected that it would take three or four years to gain the
audience's trust," she admits. "But it's as if they were waiting for
this all along."</TE>
<TE>   A surprising choice for S.F.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the announcement of Rosenberg's appointment to
head the second-largest opera company in North America came as a
complete surprise to the opera world. The company's recent reputation
had been as a showcase for star singers and little else. Under its
previous general director, the attention-loving and often frivolous
stage director Lotfi Mansouri, the company showed little imagination
and occasionally distressing vulgarity.</TE>
<TE>   Friendly, unassuming and so uninterested in the spotlight that it
is no easy matter to get her in front of a camera, Rosenberg was born
in Los Angeles in 1945 and attended UC Berkeley. But for 35 years she
made her career in Europe, where she married German modernist
composer and writer Wolf Rosenberg (who died in 1996) and held
various positions at opera companies in Frankfurt and Amsterdam
before becoming head of the Stuttgart Opera in 1990. An advocate of
director's opera and a champion of young singers, she turned
Stuttgart into a center of operatic innovation and one of Germany's
most celebrated companies.</TE>
<TE>   "I quite frankly had no intention or ambition to come to the
States," she said last year, shortly after she had taken over the
company. "I didn't want to spend 80% of my time fund-raising. I knew
that opera in America is very, very, very conservative. And I didn't
want to spend too much time away from my grandkids. But San Francisco
just kept pestering me to at least talk. Maybe it was my vanity, but
I began to think that I would like to make a dent in the American
opera scene and get it to a place where most of the rest of the world
is. I thought actually being a Californian, maybe it was meant to
be."</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of 2001, eight months before she began her tenure
in San Francisco, Rosenberg announced a five-year plan that was
bursting with ideas. She proposed seven themes that would be
interwoven through the five seasons, among them a look at seminal
modern works, a survey of Berlioz and Janacek operas and a set of
operas based on the "Faust" story.</TE>
<TE>   Heroines such Turandot, Alcina, Madame Butterfly and Salome, she
categorized as "Women Outside of Society: Laws Unto Themselves."
Under the heading "The Nature of the Human Condition," she would
consider whether Billy Budd and Macbeth should be deemed "outsiders
or pioneers." Themes sometimes even overlapped -- Janacek's "Kat'a
Kabanova" fell under both the "Women Outside of Society" "Composer
Portrait" rubrics.</TE>
<TE>   All this context provides an operagoer with a lot to think about,
and it doesn't stop there. As a tie-in with "St. Francois," this fall
she collaborated with the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to
present a multimedia introduction to Messiaen with the help of
electronic music composer Morton Subotnick and John Zorn, a
postmodern composer and improviser. At UC Berkeley she sponsored a
free symposium that made Messiaen scholarship comprehensible to the
average operagoer. The program books handed out at performances go
far beyond the usual American product, with far-reaching
interpretations of each opera's music, words and dramatic meaning.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the process of opera -- the front-end creative
development, the rehearsals, every twist and turn of the staging --
that Rosenberg loves the most. She is an active participant of every
rehearsal. She has hired a dramaturge, the only one currently
employed at an American company, bringing Wolfgang Willaschek from
Germany to work with directors. And her evangelical zeal, her
advocacy of productions in which every small detail means something,
has paid off.</TE>
<TE>   "There had been a certain amount of nervousness around when I
announced I was doing 'St. Francois,' " she says. "I really didn't
know whether people would even want to come to see it all." But she
went all-out for this five-hour, nearly static religious spectacle,
and it so transfixed audiences that it wound up selling the biggest
percentage of tickets so far in a season that has also included such
standby favorites as "Turandot" and "Otello" -- the last three
performances were sold out with lines around the block at the box
office.</TE>
<TE>   All of this, Rosenberg says, shows that if something is important,
it will speak for itself, and that is what it's all about: "We're
doing art for a reason, and I think any time that it stimulates
people, stretches them, makes them question, thrills them, that's the
function we have. If not, then don't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Running a deficit</TE>
<TE>   The success of "St. Francois," however, did little to help the
company skirt the hard times that have affected most performing arts
organizations these days. Shortly after the raves ran in newspapers
across the country, she announced that San Francisco Opera had a
$7.7-million deficit.</TE>
<TE>   It is the result of a combination of factors, she explains. Box
office fell off precipitously last year after the Sept. 11 terror
attacks. The dot-com bust, which has been pronounced in San
Francisco, is more bad luck, arriving just as Rosenberg hoped to lure
its hippest denizens into the opera house with her cutting-edge
stagings. The general economic slowdown has prevented some donors
from fulfilling their pledges and has made others jittery about
investing in anything right now.</TE>
<TE>   Next season, she will save $2 million by canceling Achim Freyer's
Stuttgart production of Weber's "Der Freischutz," and by replacing a
Paris production of Rimsky-Korsakov's "Le Coq d'Or" with San
Francisco's own production of "The Magic Flute." More changes over
the next four seasons, which are already planned, are likely, because
it will take several years to whittle down the debt.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting a season together is complex, and deconstructing one is
even more complex," she cautions. "And without an absolutely clear
vision, you can end up throwing the baby out with the bath water."</TE>
<TE>   The core thematic programming stays, and she has just signed a
contract for a major commission intended for the fall of 2005.
Although word has long been leaked that it will be a new opera by
composer John Adams, poet Alice Goodman and director Peter Sellars,
the team that created "Nixon in China" and "The Death of
Klinghoffer," she won't release any details until she has her
co-commissioners in place.</TE>
<TE>   The fiscal crisis has made Rosenberg all the more adamant that the
only thing that matters is doing good work. "I don't think people are
going to open their wallets for something that's mediocre," she says.
"Maybe we will have to do a bit less, but there will be no compromise
in the quality of the programming or the quality of the productions."</TE>
<TE>   There is one more place where Rosenberg says she will not cut
back: the San Francisco Opera's training program for young singers.
So far, she has added to what was already something of a model
program, spending the money necessary to increase the rehearsal
period for the program's annual production from three weeks to seven,
so that the singers can get much deeper into the process of putting
opera on stage.</TE>
<TE>   Typically hands on, even with the students, Rosenberg emphasizes
that her goal is to open opera to the wider world and vice versa.
"Last season, we put on Mozart's early opera 'La Finta Giardiniera,'
in a production directed by Roy Rallo, with a set by Marcia Ginsberg,
who have done things for Long Beach Opera," she recalls. "On our
first day, before the rehearsals got going, Roy told them about the
concept and said it sort of has the atmosphere of a Nan Goldin room.
And I said, 'Let's stop right there. Who of you don't know who Nan
Goldin is?' "</TE>
<TE>   Every hand went up -- the singers were clueless about the New York
photographer. Rosenberg went into action.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'You really don't know who she is? She's exhibited all
over the world! She's an icon! She's living! You can react to her
work however you want, but you have to know that it is there. In your
field, in this field, you cannot have blinkers on. You have to know
what is going on in contemporary art, in the visual as well as the
aural arts.' "</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg drops her voice to a slightly conspiratorial laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "Lo and behold," she says with delight, "after the performance,
one of the sopranos came to me and said, 'Ask me anything you want
about Nan Goldin.' "</TE>

<TE>   Brave new opera</TE>
<TE>   Times music critic Mark Swed weighs in on three innovative
productions at San Francisco Opera, now under the guidance of general
director Pamela Rosenberg:</TE>
<TE>   "Saint Francois d'Assise"</TE>
<TE>   Olivier Messiaen</TE>
<TE>   "Messiaen wrote his opera as a series of scenes in the progress of
Francis' spiritual enlightenment. Francis overcomes fear by kissing a
leper, is transformed by meeting an angel, becomes one with nature
penetrating the Babel of bird song ..., finds ultimate joy in agony
as he receives the stigmata and moves on to higher realms at his
death, which set the very War Memorial Opera House vibrating along
with the tolling of otherworldly bells." (review, Sept. 30)</TE>
<TE>   "Kat'a Kabanova"</TE>
<TE>   Leos Janacek</TE>
<TE>   "Fears persist that [Rosenberg] will alienate the city's
traditional opera supporters, who think of the War Memorial Opera
House as a venue for star singers and a playground for high society
rather than a home for vital theater.... She has brought in a
fashionable German production team ... to give the drama's sexuality
a postmodern edge. Still, San Francisco's avid canary fanciers need
not worry. What really sets apart this "Kat'a" is singing." (review,
Nov. 5)</TE>
<TE>   "Alcina"</TE>
<TE>   George Frideric Handel</TE>
<TE>   Jossi Wieler's Stuttgart staging is a study in attitude and little
(see-through) black dresses. In Alcina's enchanted realm, now an
irrational dream world of free-flowing sex and creativity, Handel's
characters purge themselves of their inner desires. And with
Catherine Nagelstadt, a former Los Angeles Opera chorister, leading
an exceptional cast of singing actors, this production turns Baroque
opera into startling modern psychological theater.</TE>

ordeal. News here moves at such a quicker pace."</TE>

<HD>An Outsider for Ecuador</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before, it happened in Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. Last
week, Ecuadorean voters too -- dissatisfied with their political
establishment and traditional political parties -- elected an
outsider as president. Col. Lucio Gutierrez is an engineer better
known as the bookish head of the Military Academy than for his
experience in the country's complicated political arena.</LD>
<LD>   After the election, Gutierrez got a call from President Bush
congratulating him on his triumph. A meeting between the two should
be arranged soon. Ecuador needs more trade and the U.S. needs to
ensure that the drug trafficking troubles in Colombia don't spill out
to neighboring Ecuador.</LD>
<LD>   Gutierrez's task is daunting. Sixty percent of the population
lives in poverty and the country has barely recovered from the
economic chaos of 1999 that caused it to default on its foreign debt.</LD>
<TE>   An Indian protest in 2000, triggered by an economic crisis,
catapulted Gutierrez into political prominence. He led a group of
military officers who joined with the indigenous population in a
fight against poverty, discrimination and government corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Former U.S. Ambassador to Ecuador Peter Romero has described
Gutierrez as "sincere, intelligent, honest and perhaps naive, but
deserving of a helping hand from the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Avoiding the knee-jerk reaction of populist leaders in the region,
Gutierrez has acknowledged the need for Ecuador to reach an agreement
with the International Monetary Fund. He'll have to adhere to
unpopular fiscal and monetary policies in exchange for outside
financial support. Ecuador's incoming president looks poised to
become a leader that the Andean region needs as the U.S. seeks to
contain economic and political fires worldwide before they spread.</TE>

<LD>Shots ricochet off cinder block. Around a corner, 45 fifth-graders
from the city's largest public housing project pile into a bus bound
for the Getty Center. It is a Saturday, the second day in what will
stretch into six days of gun and gang mayhem, much of it in and
around this Watts neighborhood. Brewster MacWilliams couldn't have
ordered a better demonstration of why he is taking kids who keep
chattering over the stutter of a semiautomatic to an art museum. "If
you can show them another life," he says, "they'll jump at it."</LD>
<LD>   Last month's "horrific days" showed new Los Angeles Police Chief
William J. Bratton another life -- and another city. It was the
ultraviolent Los Angeles of more than a decade ago. Now Bratton is
unapologetically using his celebrity on the elite party circuit to
demand outrage from the city's comfortable about what is happening to
their neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   MacWilliams, a freckle-faced, up-and-coming director with
Hollywood's Biscuit Filmworks, was one of hundreds who answered a
similar call after the 1992 riots. He showed up at a South-Central
church and helped pass out food. Moved by the welcome he received, he
kept going back.</LD>
<TE>   The Santa Monica resident hooked up with another Westsider on a
mission that cynics wrote off as well meaning but loopy: recruit camp
counselors to take inner-city kids to the mountains and the beach,
places most of them had never seen. Volunteers would mentor
fifth-graders on the cusp of deciding which path to take in lives
that offered too few choices.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later, Los Angeles City Camp survives the skeptics. The
fifth-grade campers come from two elementary schools that bracket the
Nickerson Gardens public housing project. The 15 adult volunteers
from throughout the city are now led by MacWilliams and fellow
10-year veteran Anthony "Big A" Morland, a thick-necked ex-boxer with
the calm, round face of a Buddha. The security guard and father of
four started volunteering with City Camp when his oldest son, then a
fifth-grader, received an invitation to the camp's first meeting.
When he and his wife were two of only three parents to show up,
Morland stayed to help.</TE>
<TE>   He tells of a youngster everyone wrote off as a sure gangbanger
who now plays football for the University of Arizona and may be on
his way to the NFL. MacWilliams brags about another who has applied
to be a city firefighter. The two counselors speak of kids who marvel
at the quiet during their end-of-the-year weekend at Big Bear, away
from the drone of gunfire and police helicopters. On the yellow wall
of the private, nonprofit City Camp's rented office on Central Avenue
([323] 249-6332) is a giant blue peace symbol and signatures of 500
campers who have passed through the doors. Opposite hangs a
butcher-paper flag of red and blue handprints that last year's
campers made after 9/11. They marched that flag through the housing
project. Residents came out to sing "God Bless America."</TE>
<TE>   "We're not martyrs," MacWilliams says, explaining why he's in the
office instead of home with his wife (she volunteers too) and
9-month-old son. "We enjoy this." But he and Morland also know that a
dozen field trips aren't enough and imagine what they could do with
more than a handful of volunteers and a single year to turn around
lives.</TE>
<TE>   If the new police chief needs help convincing others in this city
why they should care -- and what they can do that cops can't -- he
can point to this 10-year-old miracle and the need for more like it
throughout the city. It's a story right out of Hollywood. It is a
story worthy of a Hollywood ending.</TE>

<LD>You don't know about Mark Twain unless you have read his books about
Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. Or maybe someone read them to you. Or
somehow you heard a wily Twain quote that makes people smile still.
But that ain't no matter. There was things which Mr. Twain stretched,
but he told the truth, mainly.</LD>
<LD>   And therein lies the enduring power of this American icon in the
white suit. This weekend, the reports of his demise no longer
premature, we mark his 167th birthday in an era of corporate
corruption, conflict and social change when, Twain might observe,
honesty is by far the best policy if convenient.</LD>
<LD>   Raised by his widowed mother on the Mississippi River in Hannibal,
Mo., Samuel Clemens made the observations and absorbed the details of
American life in the 1800s. Later, as Mark Twain, he imaginatively
reassembled them into stories that revolutionized American
literature, freeing it and later writers like Hemingway and Faulkner
from the copycat propriety of British literature.</LD>
<TE>   Twain's controversial style was realism. Having lived a real life
as a wanderer, a journalist and river pilot, he wrote about real-life
issues with real people speaking as they really did outside proper
parlors. One historian called him the Abraham Lincoln of American
literature.</TE>
<TE>   Twain's books, sold door to door, established a pre-TV
international celebrity one house at a time. He wrote and lectured
widely at home and abroad. We picture this mustachioed man, cigar in
hand, regally presiding over a porch in his trademark white suit,
actually worn only in his last four years so he'd know when his
clothes were dirty.</TE>
<TE>   Hal Holbrook, who has lived in Twain's persona onstage since 1954,
senses his resurgence in an age of spin. "Twain is scathingly,
comically honest," says the actor. "He says everything like it is,
never excluding himself."</TE>
<TE>   In some 55,000 letters and writings, Twain left a thoughtful
treasure. "Etiquette requires us to admire the human race." "Man is
the only animal that blushes. Or needs to." "In the first place God
made idiots. This was for practice. Then He made school boards."
"Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence in
society."</TE>
<TE>   Clemens is long gone, having arrived with Halley's comet in 1835
and, as he predicted, departing this world on its return in 1910. His
words, however, survive.</TE>
<TE>   There's a postscript: A few miles west of Hannibal, where Clemens
lived the childhood he chronicled later as Twain, the tiny Big Creek
Cemetery sits beneath shady cedars. A granite headstone marks the
grave of Laura Hawkins, a pretty little playmate of the awkward Sam
Clemens. As she requested, her tombstone carries two names. One is
Laura Hawkins, who died in 1928. The other is Becky Thatcher, who,
like Huck and Tom and Twain himself, lives on. And that ain't no
stretcher.</TE>

<LD>Wow, Ramadan ended quickly this year, Malik thought. He hopped out of
his warm bed.</LD>
<LD>   "Eid Mubarak [Eid blessings], big bro." Malik gently nudged his
brother.</LD>
<LD>   "Eid Mubarak, little 'Lik," Rasheed replied.</LD>
<TE>   "Hey guys, it's Eid! Let's get going!" Mom and Dad came into the
room with their younger sister, Shaheedah. They all greeted and
hugged.</TE>
<TE>   It was Eid al-Fitr, one of the two most important holy days for
Muslims. It marked the end of Ramadan.</TE>
<TE>   Malik couldn't wait to see his friends and their families at the
mosque.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as services ended, he and Rasheed dashed for the glazed
doughnuts and orange juice spread out on tables downstairs, then
raced to the nacho and chili cheese hot dog line.</TE>
<TE>   Boom! Malik ran straight into Hamza.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoa, back off there, Malik," his friend said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry. It's just that this is so cool! Sort of like all the other
holidays rolled into one."</TE>
<TE>   Hamza had to agree. "I can't wait for dinner. We're having
deep-fried halal turkey, samosas, couscous, lamb kafta and even
macaroni and cheese and peach cobbler. What more could a kid want?"</TE>
<TE>   "Don't forget about all the gifts we're going to get," Malik
added.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, but remember -- the biggest gifts of Eid are family and
friends," Rasheed reminded them.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, and since everyone's coming over," Malik exclaimed, "we can
really have fun."</TE>
<TE>   "For sure," Rasheed agreed. "Well, what are we waiting for?"</TE>
<TE>   "Eid Mubarak!" they all shouted.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Author's note: The Eid al-Fitr celebration begins immediately
after Ramadan, a monthlong period of fasting and sacrifice for
Muslims. Because its date is based on the sighting of the new moon,
Eid al-Fitr should be on Thursday or Friday of this week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Food terms: Halal means "permissible to eat." Samosas are
triangular fried pies filled with meat, potatoes and spices, couscous
is a rice-like pasta, and lamb kafta is ground lamb cooked on skewers
similar to shish kebab.</TE>

<LD>Re "91 Toll Lanes Sale to Orange County Wins Approval," Nov. 26: The
Orange County Transportation Authority will spend over $207 million
to acquire the toll lanes, then spend $1.6 billion in improvements
after motorists are still charged tolls to pay off the $207 million
for the acquisition. Here's a simple solution for our spend, spend,
spend transportation authority: Buy the toll lanes for $207 million;
take down the poles separating the toll lanes from the other lanes
and -- presto chango -- a 12-lane freeway giving harried motorists
instant relief.</LD>

<LD>Re "New Law Aids Victims of Terrorism," Nov. 27: President Bush
signed the terror insurance bill, saying that "should terrorists
strike America again, we have a system in place to address financial
losses and get our economy back on its feet as quickly as possible."
This would ensure that insurance companies and real estate developers
do not suffer overwhelming financial losses in a catastrophic terror
event.</LD>
<LD>   Would that he sign a similar bill for the more than 40 million
Americans who do not have health insurance, who may suffer
overwhelming medical bills in a catastrophic event and who do not
have a system in place to address their financial losses.</LD>
<LD>   Bush said a result of the bill would be that the nation's hard
hats will get back to work. If he were serious about getting
Americans back to work, he would provide health insurance for those
times that Americans cannot work.</LD>

<TE>   Bush heralded that "terrorism insurance will help get America's
hard hats back on the job" (Nov. 20). He looked very concerned about
the middle class as he gave his speech with a group of hard hats
standing right behind him on the podium. You would never guess this
is one of the biggest political payoffs in history. The insurance
industry gave Bush $1,644,662 (reference: www.opensecrets.org), and
that only includes the money we can trace. This law has nothing to do
with the hard hats because it is nothing but a payback to the
insurance industry for a $1.6-million campaign contribution -- and it
comes out of our pockets.</TE>

<LD>Re "Saudis' Troubling 'Charity,' " editorial, Nov. 26: Your call for
scrutinizing the charitable giving of the Saudi royal family is
reprehensible. You are calling into question the motives and
standards of the leader of a country that has been a friend and ally
for some 60 years. You say that "financial support from the royal
family for relatives of Palestinian suicide bombers in Israel also
angers the United States." This is the ultimate in hypocrisy on the
part of the U.S., the supporter of the world's largest terrorist
organization, Zionist Israel. Were it not for the terror regime
Israel operates in the West Bank and Gaza there would be no
Palestinian suicide bombers giving their lives to liberate their
country and no need for charity to support the families they leave
behind.</LD>
<LD>   You end with "Saudi Arabia must ... stop bankrolling acts of
terror." This is another outrageous statement. Where has it ever been
shown that Saudi Arabia has bankrolled any terror against the U.S.?</LD>

<LD>Re "New Anti-Terrorism Legislation Fosters a Sense of Insecurity,"
Nov. 26: Patt Morrison is right on the money but overlooks one key
factor. Americans have willingly yielded some civil liberties in
times of war and recovered those liberties at war's end. But this war
against terror is a war without end. How will we determine victory?
When will the threat be over? The clear answer is that the threat
will be perpetual and, thus, the government will never be motivated
to restore our freedoms.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout our history Americans have sacrificed their lives to
preserve freedom. Now the Bush administration has persuaded us to
give up our liberties in the face of 3,000 American deaths. It is an
insult to Americans to deny us the opportunity to make the same
sacrifice our forefathers gladly made.</LD>

<HD>Rejection of Rampart Cases Reveals a Bias</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was very excited to read that L.A. County Dist. Atty. Steve
Cooley's office is examining the efficacy of using jailhouse snitch
testimony when prosecuting criminal cases ("82 Rampart Cases Rejected
for Lack of Evidence, Other Problems," Nov. 26). That a convicted
felon with everything to gain is "essentially useless as a witness"
seems to be new information to the D.A.'s office, which in the past
has prosecuted thousands of people on just such testimony. Can we
count on this as a new policy for all people in our justice system,
or is this just a special perk for the LAPD? Also, the statute of
limitations on police misconduct cases referred to in the article,
but not defined, is one year, a travesty given the severity of many
allegations against the LAPD. If Chief William Bratton really wants
to change the community's perception of the police department, he
will start by holding it accountable to the same laws the rest of us
live by.</LD>

<TE>   Los Angeles seems to have a knack for repeating itself -- riots
followed by "official reports." To date, the 1965 McCone Commission,
the 1991 Christopher Commission and the Rampart investigation reports
all supposedly addressed the issue at hand: police misconduct. But
the issue remains, and now we have a city under siege. But the
district attorney says 82 Rampart-related cases will not be
prosecuted. There is a lesson here. "Selective justice, selective
peace."</TE>

<LD>Arianna Huffington raises excellent points in her Nov. 26 commentary,
"In the Time of Jesus, the Donkey Was the Vehicle, Not the Driver,"
about the wastefulness of sport utility vehicles. Most people
probably don't set out to be wasteful of fuel; they merely want the
convenience and luxury of the big SUVs and don't really care about
the consequences to the environment or to our national security. Is
this the mark of a good citizen -- a patriot?</LD>
<LD>   Clearly, the low cost of fuel helps drive this market, and we must
face the fact that our government significantly subsidizes the cost
of fuel. The estimated price tag on the possible Iraq war is $100
billion. Since this war is mostly about access to oil, it seems fair
that at least part of this expense should be internalized in the
price at the pump.</LD>
<LD>   Many thousands of deaths in our country each year are because of
air pollution, 60% of which is caused by automobile use. Again, it
seems fair that a dollar figure be placed on fuel to cover the
societal costs of this unnecessary loss of life. Internalize these
costs at the pump and we have a more level playing field. Then, if
someone wants to deploy a 6,000-pound vehicle to go shopping, at
least he or she will be paying more of the true cost of oil, which
all of us are now being forced to pay, regardless.</LD>

<TE>   Considering that, according to the Gospels, Jesus borrowed donkeys
in his ministry, it is doubtful he would even own a car. If he were
walking the Earth today, I believe he would ride the bus and use mass
transit. Thus, it would be an environmental action, and an action
closer to God, to consistently leave the car, truck, motor bike or
SUV at home and ride the bus and mass transit as much as possible.</TE>

<TE>   During a recent visit to Germany I drove the autobahn for many
hours and did not see a Suburban, Expedition, Navigator or Escalade.
Mostly, I saw small, fuel-efficient automobiles and the occasional
high-speed sports car. With gasoline at more than $4 a gallon in
Germany, this makes sense. Moreover, most of the German people I
encountered appeared fairly fit and trim.</TE>
<TE>   Upon my return to LAX, my first impression was the startling
preponderance of potbellied security officers in the immigration
area. Later, driving on the 405 Freeway, I was surrounded by 3-ton
SUVs. Are American obesity and our overweight vehicles connected?</TE>

<HD>Government Printing Practices Save Money</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With respect to the Nov. 23 letter from Office of Management and
Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the Government Printing
Office agrees that a number of myths regarding the OMB plan for
federal printing need to be debunked.</LD>
<LD>   Myth: The taxpayers will save money with the OMB's plan. Fact:
They'll pay much more. The GPO's central buying power regularly nets
federal agencies -- and the taxpayers -- "rock-bottom prices," in the
words of the printing industry. The duplication of agency effort that
will result from decentralizing printing in the manner the OMB is now
recommending will cost the taxpayers 25% to 50% more; in today's
terms, from $100 million to $200 million more.</LD>
<LD>   Myth: There will be more competition in federal printing with the
OMB's plan. Fact: Thousands of small-business printers will lose
printing contract opportunities. We have more than 16,000 private
printers on our master bid list. Last year, more than 70% of our
contracts were to small businesses. More than 80% of the jobs we
award are valued at $2,500 or under. The OMB's plan will allow agency
bureaucrats to buy those jobs noncompetitively with federal credit
cards, leaving only the big jobs up for grabs. One of the
government's most successful small-business-oriented procurement
programs will founder, leaving thousands of small-business printers
high and dry.</LD>
<TE>   Myth: More federal publications will be made available to the
public with the OMB's plan. Fact: The reverse is what will happen.
Right now, when agencies print through the GPO, we make sure that
their publications are made available for public access through
federal depository libraries and other channels, in a process that is
transparent and cost-free to the agencies. If, under the current
rules, agencies print publications themselves, they're required to
provide us with copies to distribute. The problem is that agency
compliance with this current requirement is abysmal, and, as a
result, upward of 50% of federal publications become "fugitive" from
the public access system. The OMB's plan is to leave it up to the
agencies to make their publications available for public access.</TE>

<BD>John Stuart Blackton, a retired senior Foreign Service
officer, was director of the U.S. Agency for International
Development in Afghanistan in the early 1990s and also served in
Kabul during the mid-1970s. E-mail: jsb44@cornell.edu.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah is worried. Western financial
commitments to Afghanistan are faltering, and the prospects are
bleak. In Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo and East Timor, he notes, aid flowed
at an average of $250 per capita per year. In Afghanistan, only $75
per capita has been pledged for this year. For the five years after
that, pledges are only about $42 per capita.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign assistance is a relatively recent invention, having really
taken root at the end of World War II. In this relatively brief
period, foreign assistance has taken various forms and directions,
reflecting changing global needs. But always at its core have been
the short- and long-term interests of the government doing the
giving.</LD>
<LD>   It is very much in the U.S. interest to make sure Afghanistan gets
the money it needs to rebuild. But what should we be funding? First,
we need to be clear about American interests.</LD>
<TE>   Americans have shown themselves to be particularly interested in
funding certain kinds of things in Afghanistan. Programs to promote
gender equality, poverty reduction, poppy eradication and the
building of a secular government are all popular with the public. But
the United States has limited and very specific, strategic interests
in Afghanistan, and we need to define and understand them before
leaping to fund specific solutions and programs -- and especially
before trying to encourage a comprehensive national transformation.</TE>
<TE>   Even as we finance the very real, on-the-ground needs identified
and agreed to by all factions in Afghanistan -- things like
reconstruction of essential infrastructure, reestablishment of basic
government functions like tax collection and the de-mining of the
countryside -- we need to keep our national interest in mind.</TE>
<TE>   America's preeminent goal must be the elimination of sanctuary for
terrorists. This means we need to support a national government in
Afghanistan that can effectively carry out the minimum basic
functions of a nation-state: enforcing laws, maintaining the
integrity of its borders, conducting foreign affairs and otherwise
meeting the health, education and security needs of its people.</TE>
<TE>   We need to support these goals without losing sight of
Afghanistan's history and political traditions. To protect itself
from Russian, Persian and British imperial designs, Afghanistan began
to take on basic elements of a nation-state in the 19th century. For
most of the 20th century, Afghanistan was a recognizable nation, with
a government that carried out the essential functions of statehood.
It was not a carbon copy of any Western democracy, but it was a
successfully functioning state.</TE>
<TE>   The balance between the capital and the outlying regions in
Afghanistan was more delicate than the models that took shape under
Napoleon or Bismarck. It was more like cantonal Switzerland, leaving
many of the details of governance, law and education to local
authorities in deference to the linguistic, religious and ethnic
mosaic of Afghan society. The division of power and authority between
Kabul and the provinces was not haphazard; rather, it was a carefully
crafted approach to the idea of a state that worked for Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Two points must be central to any Western assistance effort:
First, the job is to reconstitute, not to reinvent, the state in
Afghanistan; and second, our goal should be to reconstruct the core
functions of a central government while leaving adequate space at the
periphery to accommodate the traditional expectations of moderate
regional autonomy in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   American national interests do not require that conservative
Pushtun families unveil their daughters, nor that secular law replace
religious law in customary and tribal matters, nor that an exact
replica of Western-style governance be installed in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Aggressive foreign efforts to transform Afghan society could well
bring the fragile government of President Hamid Karzai to an untimely
end. Afghanistan's King Amanullah lost his life for his efforts to
promote Western-style social reforms in the 1920s. The Russians were
hated and ultimately expelled, less for their godless communism than
for their attempts to transform and Westernize the Afghan social
agenda.</TE>
<TE>   A Marshall Plan approach to Afghanistan, as some in Washington are
calling for, would be overkill. America's national stake in Europe at
the end of World War II was vastly larger and more complex than our
stake in Afghanistan. But one thing worth remembering about the
Marshall Plan is that, except in Germany, its goals were to restore
governments and societies, not to transform them. America helped put
Belgium and France back together again but didn't attempt to change
the fundamentals of Belgian and French politics and society.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, we have publicly articulated idealistic,
transformational goals for the country. While neither the U.S.
government nor other donors have actually yet delivered much
reconstruction assistance, our rhetoric frightens much of the
leadership in the Karzai government.</TE>
<TE>   At the last two donor summits in Kabul, Karzai and his ministers
have been very blunt about priorities. The Afghan government has said
plainly that rural health clinics and girls schools are all very well
but that Afghanistan won't survive if its major roads are not put
back in order and the core functions of his government given
sufficient wherewithal to earn legitimacy in the eyes of postwar
Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has relatively straightforward interests in Afghanistan's
reconstruction. They are limited interests, but they are also urgent
ones. After a year of foot-dragging, the American government and its
allies should move promptly to provide Karzai's government with the
capacity for minimal but effective governance. We should assist in
rebuilding the core national infrastructure without which an Afghan
nation cannot survive. We should do so because it is in our interest
and in the interest of Afghanistan.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Californians want clean water. They want beaches and wetlands
protected. They want quality water coming from their taps. And they
are willing to pay for it.</LD>
<LD>   Voters have consistently demonstrated their commitment to clean
water and coastal protection at the polls over the last few years,
most recently in approving, last month, the Water Security, Clean
Drinking Water, Coastal and Beach Protection Act of 2002, which
allocates $3.4 billion for purchasing and restoring wetlands and
watersheds and for funding water projects that will both protect the
supply and improve quality. In the last two years, Californians have
voted to spend more than $8 billion on clean water and coastal
resource protection.</LD>
<LD>   So if voters are in agreement, even during tough economic times,
why can't the agencies and regional governments responsible for
solving our water quality problems get along? Instead of taking the
voters' strong message to heart, those most closely involved with
water issues are ever more bitterly divided.</LD>
<TE>   The EPA in Washington doesn't see eye to eye with its regional EPA
office in San Francisco, which isn't getting along with the state
Water Resources Control Board in Sacra- mento, which in turn
disagrees on many issues with the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality
Control Board. The regional water board gets along with the
environmental community on some issues but not all.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County, numerous small cities, the Western States
Petroleum Assn., the California Building Industry Assn., the L.A.
County Sanitation Districts and the city of Los Angeles are sparring
with the regional water board, state water board, EPA or the
environmental community on most issues.</TE>
<TE>   Pick your water quality issue, and you'll find the regulatory
community at odds with the regulated community that is in turn at
odds with the public and community-based organizations. The level of
distrust and animosity on water quality issues has reached a level
not seen since the 1980s, when anti-environmentalist Interior
Secretary James Watt actively sought to degrade the nation's precious
natural resources, and California, led by Gov. George Deukmejian,
found it more convenient to simply ignore water quality issues.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the easier-to-solve water quality problems, like upgrading
coastal sewage treatment plants, have largely been addressed. Now we
face the more complex remaining issues of polluted runoff. The state
seems content to exert its leadership on water quality and coastal
protection issues solely through spending voter-approved bond money
on habitat preservation and structural measures to improve water
quality.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, many of the cities and counties charged with improving
water quality are crippled by fears of litigation, liability and
increased costs as developers, sewage agencies, industry and even
other cities have grown skilled in their use of the legal system to
fend off unwanted change.</TE>
<TE>   Take the case of Malibu. The California Coastal Commission
requires that every coastal city have a local coastal plan that lays
out policies and requirements for managing fragile resources. In most
of California, the plans have been expeditiously produced. But in the
current environment, the Malibu plan has become a battleground.</TE>
<TE>   Residents insist the Coastal Commission is violating their
property rights. Bitter fights have erupted over access to beaches
and protection of sensitive habitats. Residents claim the proposed
regulations are so tight that they would prohibit homeowners from
planting rose bushes on their properties. And environmentalists
accuse beachfront homeowners of trying to preserve the coast for the
exclusive use of the rich.</TE>
<TE>   The fights grew so contentious that the city refused to implement
the plan at all, and now five developers and the city of Malibu are
suing the Coastal Commission over the matter. The backlash has some
Malibu residents, developers and their supporters vowing to try to
oust Coastal Commission Chairwoman Sara Wan, the most knowledgeable,
pro-environment commissioner the agency has ever had.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles and Ventura counties, the situation has gotten so
bad that nearly every permit and regulation proposed by the Los
Angeles regional water board is now appealed to the state water board
in Sacramento or challenged in court. Discharge permits for numerous
sewage-treatment plants, a municipal storm water permit for Los
Angeles County and new trash limits for the Los Angeles River and
Ballona Creek have all been held up by appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the state seems to be working at cross-purposes with
itself. Even as the state water board spends hundreds of millions of
dollars in bond funds aimed at improving water quality, it is also
implementing regulations that severely weaken the EPA's National
Toxics Rule water quality standards for fresh water, bays and
estuaries.</TE>
<TE>   The state has also proposed removing some of California's most
polluted waters from the priority list for cleanup. In addition, the
state water board has issued statewide draft regulations on septic
systems and industrial sources of storm water that do little more
than maintain the status quo, which means that far too many waters
will remain polluted by fecal bacteria, nitrates and toxic heavy
metals and hydrocarbons.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, where two-thirds of the voters approved the
most recent water quality bond measure, nearly 40 small cities have
banded together with the Building Industry Assn. to form the
Coalition for Practical Regulation. Using public funds, the group has
developed a slick marketing campaign and retained high-priced
attorneys to oppose all new storm water quality regulations. Tens of
thousands of mailers have gone out to the public with Chicken
Little-like threats of imminent financial harm and loss of libraries,
police and firefighters if water quality regulations are promulgated.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years from now, long after the $8 billion in clean-water bonds
passed in recent years has been spent, the public will judge the
success of these bond measures in a simple way. Are our beaches safer
for swimmers and surfers? Is our tap water safer? And are our
precious coastal and watershed resources better protected?</TE>
<TE>   Capital projects to improve water quality, and spending bond funds
to purchase some of the few remaining coastal watershed natural
resources, will certainly lead to progress in these areas. But unless
the state, the EPA, the business community, local governments and the
environmental community can come together to develop and act on
solutions to California's crises regarding clean water and coastal
resource protection, then the state will have lost a tremendous
opportunity to deliver on the promise of waters that are safe and
healthy for people and aquatic life.</TE>

A Political History of the American Rich."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>If the Democratic Party's recent midterm election campaign was weak
and shallow, the same can be said of its November
post-midterm-election debate over whether to move left or right.
Bluntly put, the party of Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Franklin
Roosevelt and Harry Truman has been selling its soul to fill its
campaign wallet and is now in big trouble, especially among three key
longtime constituencies: blacks, Latinos and lower-income Southern
whites.</LD>
<LD>   This, in turn, has become a threat to the balance of power in
Washington and to the policymaking process. The "opposition" party is
verging on incapacity. Its old faces are beyond Botox or relevant
speech therapy. Few new ones are in sight.</LD>
<LD>   Not that forthright ideology is the cure -- moving leftward under
Nancy Pelosi, the new Democratic leader in the House of
Representatives, or rightward under the aegis of the Washington-based
Democratic Leadership Council. However, there is some basic
philosophy involved, and if the Democrats cannot comprehend this,
they face considerable peril.</LD>
<TE>   In some respects, to be sure, the midterm Democratic showing was
not bad. Nationally, the parties are still more or less even, and
hardly any antiwar Democratic incumbents were defeated, a striking
caveat to supposed war fever. George W. Bush, correctly, has declined
to claim an ideological mandate. Furthermore, over the last two
decades, midterm congressional results have been less and less
predictive of the next presidential election, a warning for 2002
election interpreters.</TE>
<TE>   What the Democrats must (and might not yet) fully comprehend is
their devastating "un-mandate." Turnout among the core Democratic
constituencies -- minorities and low-incomers -- plummeted, not least
in all-important California.</TE>
<TE>   The weakening economy and skewed wealth distribution were obvious
rallying points, yet Democratic leaders, despite having the freedom
that comes from being out of power nationally, abandoned them, save
for cliches about protecting Social Security and providing
prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   While hardly new, this marked an escalation in the national
party's willingness to discard old beliefs and the interests of
ordinary citizens in order to woo big-contributor money that has
captured the center of U.S. politics -- the new "venal center."</TE>
<TE>   It is a critical and depressing transformation. Fifty years ago,
historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. identified a "vital center" in
American politics, crediting Democrats with building a new and
constructive moderate coalition under Roosevelt and Truman. But they
lost their dominance and vitality some 30 years ago. Then, over the
last 10 years, especially under Bill Clinton during the money-culture
days of the stock market bubble, the Democratic Party joined in
making venality bipartisan.</TE>
<TE>   This is a losing politics, because the dominance of venality
automatically favors the Republicans. Innately on the side of money,
many, if not most, Republicans are philosophically committed to
upholding its principles and some of its excesses. By contrast, the
worthy history of the Democratic Party, especially during its periods
of dominance, has been to question those principles and to indict
related excesses. When abuses mount and Democrats remain mute, they
lose both constituency appeal and their historical raison d'etre.</TE>
<TE>   Regaining this balance is not turning left, an implausible
description for the great Democrats from Jefferson to Truman. What it
has involved is correcting the excesses of plutophile conservatives
from Alexander Hamilton through the 20th century and down to the
present day. Under current circumstances, it would take years for any
such correction to be leftish.</TE>
<TE>   Consider just how far left serious reform would have to go to
catch up with earlier Republican economics. For example, the federal
inheritance tax that conservatives are trying to scuttle, principally
on behalf of the 300,000 families with assets greater than $5
million, was imposed by wartime Republican presidents Lincoln and
McKinley and urged for peacetime by Theodore Roosevelt. In 1953,
Republican President Dwight Eisenhower declined to support GOP
congressional legislation to reduce the top federal income tax rate
of 91%, and on leaving office in 1961 he warned against the rise of
the military-industrial complex. Contempt for the politics of money,
in turn, has more recently been best expressed by Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.). This is how far left the Democrats have to go.</TE>
<TE>   That so many of today's Democratic leaders, fearful of offending
contributors and being called lefties, cannot invoke the arguments
and positions of these centrist and moderate conservative Republican
presidents underscores the increasing hold of the venal center over
the last decade. The internal debate that the Democratic Party will
need in order to break out of this trap is bound to be brutal.</TE>
<TE>   Two topics should be front and center. One is the party's
increasingly disaffected low- and middle-income constituencies. The
other is its ties to, and partial financial dependence upon, a very
powerful and rich set of business interests, in communications, high
technology, entertainment and important sectors of international
finance. The two developments are related.</TE>
<TE>   The midterm election returns make the first case. The combined war
and anti-terrorism issues were not a direct problem for the
Democrats. In fact, the Democratic Senate incumbents who lost in
Georgia and Missouri supported President Bush on war with Iraq. In
the House, there were hardly any defeats among the large bloc of
Democratic representatives who opposed a war. In the Minnesota Senate
race, Democratic war opponent Paul Wellstone was seemingly headed for
a victory, denied him by his death in a plane crash. As history's
"khaki elections" go, this one was mild, even though Senate control,
teetering by one vote, changed hands.</TE>
<TE>   Indirectly, though, the war-terrorism issues did hurt the
Democrats by cross-pressuring low-income whites, especially in the
nationalist and ultrapatriotic South. With many Democratic candidates
enfeebled by big-contributor leashes and economic muzzles, blacks and
Latinos voted in much lower-than-usual numbers, and the white "bubba"
element turned out waving flags and voting Republican, instead of
cursing bosses and $7.15 hourly wage rates.</TE>
<TE>   The poll data are striking. In California, even though voters
unhappily reelected Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, a noted habitue of
the venal center, low-income and minority turnout fell.</TE>
<TE>   According to The Times Poll, the Latino share of the vote dropped
from 13% in 1998 to 10% in 2002, the first decline since 1986; the
black share plummeted from 13% to just 4%. For another example,
battleground polls by Fox News showed similar minority declines, as
the white share of the vote rose above its 2000 level by nine points
in Florida, five in Colorado and four in Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   Given that only 38% to 40% of registered Americans vote in midterm
elections (39% this year), even small shifts can be devastating. That
happened to Democrats. But it won't be corrected easily.</TE>
<TE>   In California, for example, it is Democrats who are favored by the
state's largest and richest industry: communications and
entertainment. Davis had so much money this year that he might have
been better named Green Davis. Much of this moola, however, comes
with the same price tag that usually accompanies GOP money: fealty to
those who contribute it and diminished interest in the day-to-day
concerns of ordinary working Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Some entertainment industry money is, in a sense, worse, because
it mixes fat-wallet economics with liberal chic, the kind of cultural
politics caricatured in Middle America by jokes about Concerned
Citizens for Humane Lobster Traps or epitomized by the decision in
San Francisco last year to allow city employees to have sex-change
operations at public expense. Hollywood combines both Democratic
weaknesses in one Gucci briefcase.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why there has been so much interest in House Democrats
electing San Francisco Rep. Pelosi as their new leader. She will be
the first test of whether Democrats can make their needed change.
Republicans already chortling about "San Francisco" Democrats may be
too cocky. Pelosi grew up in Baltimore as the daughter of an old-line
Democratic machine mayor and congressman. A second important
Democratic test will be what happens to national party Chairman Terry
McAuliffe, a financial deal maker who has specialized in raising the
money that has been more crippling than enabling.</TE>
<TE>   What the Democrats have to pursue, then, is neither rightward nor
leftward movement but a double-barreled recommitment to Middle
America and the party's old Jackson-FDR constituencies. That will
require them to forswear both rightist economics and left-chic
culture. If any such effort succeeds, what opponents try to label it
won't matter. Indeed, we can reasonably speculate that any such new
politics able to overcome the venal center would also go a long way
toward recreating another vital center.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Welcome to the Wild West, Chief Bratton.</LD>
<LD>   The last thing you want after a mere month on the job is
unsolicited advice -- particularly when your plans are still
gestating. But Los Angeles' latest spasm of violence warrants some
fast action to avert a breech birth.</LD>
<LD>   Your outrage at L.A.'s recent carnage and at the public's
quiescence is justified. But until corpses start piling up in front
of Spago, don't expect much anger from the affluent about what's
happening in L.A.'s discarded neighborhoods. You were also right to
confront us for failing our children. But avoid blaming innocent
victims for your cops' bad shootings or for gang violence they don't
condone. That's what Daryl Gates used to do.</LD>
<TE>   Your mission is to make L.A. the safest big city in the country.
While not impossible, you won't succeed unless you chart an entirely
new approach to crime fighting.</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, your department must marshal community
intelligence and energy to quell the violent surge. Longer term, a
revolution in how cops do their jobs must be coordinated regionally.
It should include an army of reform-minded law enforcers, concerned
residents, modernized prison and parole departments, functioning
schools and teams of experts on everything from human services to
economics.</TE>
<TE>   Past policing here stemmed from a suppressive vision of "getting
tough on crime" in which police considered themselves a "thin blue
line" standing between chaos and civilization. The result: mass
arrests that swept the innocent along with the guilty, macho
confrontations between police and private citizens, even the invasion
of neighborhoods with battering rams. While this all made for an
impressive display of male behavior, it shattered all trust. More
important, it didn't work. Our city is still dangerously like
Afghanistan, with warlords operating unchecked in their enclaves of
power.</TE>
<TE>   Your department, which in the past has barely been able to work
with its own Police Commission, must now reach far outside its bunker
and coordinate its actions with other agencies, departments and
experts who know how to work with community members on stopping
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Combining the region's many police forces for joint operations
that deploy cops equipped with state-of-the-art systems and teams of
experts would immediately add brains as well as muscle and
efficiency. If the LAPD joined forces with the Sheriff's Department,
you'd have a force of 14,000 -- more even than you've asked for.
Teams from multiple disciplines need to be integrated into your
strategies: people standing ready to help cops put away violent
predators, deal with the mentally ill, support desperate families and
divert nonviolent kids.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD can't fight crime effectively unless probation and parole
run smoothly. Nor can you make a real dent in crime without an ear to
the ground in jails and prisons, where much of what happens on the
streets is orchestrated. And without effective rehabilitation and
reintegration strategies, far too many ex-cons end up in a revolving
door of incarceration and release that endangers their neighbors as
well as police.</TE>
<TE>   Equally critical is working with the men who know gangs because
they used to run them. Too many LAPD officers instinctively crush
these guys, but Boy Scouts aren't going to be of much use to you.
Former gang members know the streets, the prisons and what it takes
to create truces. They want to help.</TE>
<TE>   You'll also have to make it safe for the community to work with
the LAPD. Witnesses need protecting, and cops must be taught not to
"mark" complainants.</TE>
<TE>   You're not responsible, of course, for schools, charities and
churches, but you do need to galvanize them to create the competent,
citywide system of after-school and preschool programs that should
have been in place long ago. And remind the city's many artists that,
next to family and faith, their music and art have more power to move
kids away from violence than almost any other force.</TE>
<TE>   Cops aren't social workers, but if we're ever going to move from
reacting to crime waves to preventing them, your department will have
to learn to work with social workers -- and a lot of others.</TE>
<TE>   None of this can happen within the LAPD's current culture. The
force you now command has many strengths, but it also has an insular,
rigid and retaliatory culture that, unless changed, will doom it to
repeat its past failures. The LAPD has always shot down demands for
change. If reversing crime waves requires creative, data-driven,
community-savvy cops, then you have no choice but to aggressively
change the department.</TE>
<TE>   Know that those of us who live here won't take roll-call
exhortations for change seriously until we see aggressive
anti-retaliation systems that protect whistle-blowers, independent
investigations of complaints and police shootings, and the complete
reconfiguration of transfer, promotion and discipline policies to
promote community-based policing. In the past, the LAPD rewarded
"kicking butt." Now let it reward the smarter policing of
collaboration that can reduce violence, solve serious crime, salvage
nonviolent kids and create a real dynamic of prevention.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD is still feared as a hyper-aggressive force that targets
neighborhoods for unfair mass arrests and other intimidation tactics.
While we want police to vigorously respond to serious crime and
violence, encouraging this department to be aggressive is kind of
like telling Charlton Heston to protect his gun. If your goal is to
boost testosterone and dubious police shootings, continue in this
vein. But if you want to enlist community help in combating crime,
you need to send different signals.</TE>
<TE>   A case in point: your declaration of war on graffiti to show
gangbangers that you're in charge. The problem is that you're not in
charge, and they know it. Your throwing down a turf challenge
triggers precisely the wrong response. As one Grape Street Crip put
it: "How they 'spect us to respect them when they act like us?"</TE>
<TE>   Our emergency isn't broken windows; it's broken communities. And
broken children. We don't need military-style SWAT teams to remove
hundreds of our nonviolent taggers to camps that return them as
bitter and dangerous men. We don't need the homeless herded out and
locked up, only to be released a few weeks later no better off. And
we don't need mothers swept away on minor charges that inflict major
damage to children left to raise themselves.</TE>
<TE>   These tactics destroy families in our most tormented neighborhoods
and divert energy from removing the truly dangerous. We need cops who
stay in communities long enough and behave well enough to earn the
trust of residents who can help fight crime and remove the
sociopaths.</TE>
<TE>   So, fix broken windows if you think that helps. But only as one
part of a radically reconfigured regional strategy that aims at
changing not just your department but the region's exhausting dynamic
of scrambling to counter waves of violence. For years, officers have
been shoveling quicksand. Without fundamental change that includes
aggressive prevention, strong civic backup and the end of the
department's robo-cop culture, you can forget computers. What you'll
need is more shovels.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Riordan and Bill Simon Jr.</AU>
<BD>Richard Riordan was the mayor of Los Angeles from 1992
to 2000. Bill Simon Jr. was the Republican candidate for governor in
2002.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California is in crisis.</LD>
<LD>   We are struggling through the first recession in almost a decade.
The state government faces a crushing, two-year budget deficit of
some $40 billion. And we face a number of serious long-term problems:
Housing starts are meeting only 50% of our needs. More than 7 million
residents lack health insurance. Our schools remain near the bottom
of national rankings. The state's businesses are overburdened by
excessive electricity rates, strict overtime rules and soaring costs
for health care and workers' compensation insurance.</LD>
<LD>   The Democrats in Sacramento have grown complacent as their numbers
have swelled; they are reluctant to tackle these difficult problems.
But Republicans have not taken advantage of the Democrats' weakness.
On election day last month, we failed to unseat Gray Davis -- perhaps
the most unpopular governor in our state's history -- and all other
statewide offices went to the Democrats.</LD>
<TE>   The election results would seem to bode ill for the prospects of
California Republicans. But political shifts happen quickly here, and
we have a number of reasons to be optimistic. We believe that a
resurgent Republican Party will spark the rejuvenation of our state.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are currently cultivating a number of creative and
energetic leaders who will guide our party in this new century.
Arnold Schwarzenegger clearly demonstrated his potential in his
successful campaign for the passage of Proposition 49, which will
expand before- and after-school programs in our public schools.</TE>
<TE>   And other bright young Republicans are emerging throughout the
state. Abel Maldonado is a family farmer now serving as an
assemblyman in the 33rd District. Alan Autry is the dynamic young
mayor of Fresno. Lynn Daucher, a former teacher from Orange County,
is a part of the Republican leadership in the state Assembly. And
Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's national security advisor, will
one day return to California.</TE>
<TE>   These are the diverse faces of the new Republican Party in
California.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the Republican Party can offer more innovative
policies to address the real problems of Californians. Public
education, affordable housing, health care, public safety -- on all
of these issues, we can provide more creative solutions than the
Democrats can.</TE>
<TE>   We understand how powerful the free market can be, especially when
it is harnessed in service of the disadvantaged. We understand that
excessive regulation (even if well intentioned) is often harmful to
the economy. We understand that higher taxes cause pain, especially
for the most vulnerable members of our community.</TE>
<TE>   Operating with a huge electoral advantage, the Democrats have
squandered their opportunities. They have mishandled all the major
crises of the last few years: the electricity shortage, the budget
deficit and the recent recession. And they've started to treat the
state Capitol as their own private clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Californians yearn for an alternative. Independents -- and even
many Democrats -- were reluctant to vote for Davis. Despite his
spending close to $30 million (and using all the advantages of his
office), Davis received only 47% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   The state of California clearly needs a strong Republican Party.
As we all know, democracy is most effective when two powerful parties
offer competing visions of the future. As Republicans, we need to do
a better job of articulating our vision for the future of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Too often have we focused on hot-button social issues instead of
offering innovative policy solutions. Too often have we stifled
healthy debate by engaging in petty political posturing. Too often
have we capitalized on fear to gain a temporary advantage at the
polls.</TE>
<TE>   It's worth remembering that, just a few years ago, California had
a Republican governor and a closely divided Legislature. Fortune is
likely to swing back again, but only if we Republicans focus on our
shared values and offer a compelling, positive vision of the future
of California.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few years, the two of us will be teaming with
Republicans across California to move the party forward. We will be
working to broaden the Republican base of support, recruiting new
leaders from the state's many diverse communities.</TE>
<TE>   We are particularly excited about the effort to create a
Republican think tank that will generate new ideas, provide policy
support to party candidates and disseminate our messages to the
public. Modeled on the Democrats' Public Policy Institute of
California, such an organization will help us stay on the cutting
edge of public policy.</TE>
<TE>   We challenge all Republicans across California -- from moderate to
conservative -- to rally around our shared goals: economic growth,
public safety, outstanding schools, affordable housing and a better
life for the sick and the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Together we can transform the political landscape in California.
Together we can generate new ideas to revive our state. Together we
can offer Californians the visionary leadership that they deserve.</TE>
<TE>   Four years from now, we predict, the whole country will be
marveling at the incredible comeback of the California Republicans.</TE>

<HD>Beyond Regime Change</HD>
<DH>The administration doesn't simply want to oust Saddam
Hussein. It wants to redraw the Mideast map.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandy Tolan</AU>
<BD>Sandy Tolan, an I.F. Stone Fellow at the Graduate
School of Journalism at UC Berkeley, reports frequently on the Middle
East. Jason Felch, a student in Tolan's "Politics and Petroleum"
class, contributed to this article.</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>If you want to know what the administration has in mind for Iraq,
here's a hint: It has less to do with weapons of mass destruction
than with implementing an ambitious U.S. vision to redraw the map of
the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   The new map would be drawn with an eye to two main objectives:
controlling the flow of oil and ensuring Israel's continued regional
military superiority. The plan is, in its way, as ambitious as the
1916 Sykes-Picot agreement between the empires of Britain and France,
which carved up the region at the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The
neo-imperial vision, which can be ascertained from the writings of
key administration figures and their co-visionaries in influential
conservative think tanks, includes not only regime change in Iraq but
control of Iraqi oil, a possible end to the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries and newly compliant governments in
Syria and Iran -- either by force or internal rebellion.</LD>
<TE>   For the first step -- the end of Saddam Hussein -- Sept. 11
provided the rationale. But the seeds of regime change came far
earlier. "Removing Saddam from power," according to a 1996 report
from an Israeli think tank to then-incoming Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, was "an important Israeli strategic objective." Now this
has become official U.S. policy, after several of the report's
authors took up key strategic and advisory roles within the Bush
administration. They include Richard Perle, now chair of the
Pentagon's Defense Policy Board; Douglas Feith, undersecretary of
defense; and David Wurmser, special assistant in the State
Department. In 1998, these men, joined by Donald Rumsfeld and Paul
Wolfowitz (now the top two officials in the Pentagon), Elliott Abrams
(a senior National Security Council director), John Bolton
(undersecretary of State) and 21 others called for "a determined
program to change the regime in Baghdad."</TE>
<TE>   After removing Hussein, U.S. forces are planning for an open-ended
occupation of Iraq, according to senior administration officials who
spoke to the New York Times. The invasion, said Iraqi dissident Kanan
Makiya, would be "a historic opportunity that is as large as anything
that has happened in the Middle East since the fall of the Ottoman
Empire." Makiya spoke at an October "Post-Saddam Iraq" conference
attended by Perle and sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Any occupation would certainly include protecting petroleum
installations. Control of the country's vast oil reserves, the second
largest in the world and worth nearly $3 trillion at current prices,
would be a huge strategic prize. Some analysts believe that
additional production in Iraq could drive world prices down to as low
as $10 a barrel and precipitate Iraq's departure from OPEC, possibly
undermining the cartel. This, together with Russia's new willingness
to become a major U.S. oil supplier, could establish a long-sought
counterweight to Saudi Arabia, still the biggest influence by far on
global oil prices. It would be consistent with the plan released by
Vice President Dick Cheney's team in June, which underscored "energy
security" as central to U.S. foreign policy. "The Gulf will be a
primary focus of U.S. international energy policy," the report
states.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts prefer to downplay the drive to control Iraqi oil.
"It is fashionable among anti-American circles ... to assume that
U.S. foreign policy is driven by commercial considerations," said
Patrick Clawson, an oil and policy analyst with the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy, in an October talk. Rather, Clawson
said, oil "has barely been on the administration's horizon in
considering Iraq policy.... U.S. foreign policy is not driven by
concern for promoting the interests of specific U.S. firms."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Clawson, whose institute enjoys close ties with the Bush
administration, was more candid during a Capitol Hill forum on a
post-Hussein Iraq in 1999: "U.S. oil companies would have an
opportunity to make significant profits," he said. "We should not be
embarrassed about the commercial advantages that would come from a
re-integration of Iraq into the world economy. Iraq, post-Saddam, is
highly likely to be interested in inviting international oil
companies to invest in Iraq. This would be very useful for U.S. oil
companies, which are well positioned to compete there, and very
useful for the world's energy-security situation."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Iraqi National Congress leader Ahmad Chalabi, whose close
ties with Perle, Wurmser, Rumsfeld and Cheney predate the current
Bush administration, met recently with U.S. oil executives.
Afterward, Chalabi, the would-be "Iraqi Karzai" and the hawks'
long-standing choice to lead a post-Hussein Iraq, made it clear he
would give preference to an American-led oil consortium. He also
suggested that previous deals -- totaling tens of billions of dollars
for Russia's Lukoil and France's TotalFinaElf -- could be voided.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, key Iraqi exiles will meet with oil executives at an
English country retreat to discuss the future of Iraqi petroleum. The
conference, sponsored by the Center for Global Energy Studies and
chaired by Sheik Zaki Yamani, the former Saudi oil minister, will
feature Maj. Gen. Wafiq Samarrai, the former head of Iraqi military
intelligence, and former Iraqi Oil Minister Fadhil Chalabi, now
executive director of the center.</TE>
<TE>   Fadhil Chalabi estimates that total oil reserves in Iraq could
exceed Saudi Arabia's and that daily production one day could reach
10 million barrels, making it the world's largest producer. Hence, on
the center's conference agenda is a discussion of Iraq as a "second
Saudi Arabia," and the prospect of a world without OPEC. Oil
executives and analysts heading to the country retreat will also be
able to purchase the center's 800-page analysis of the prospects for
exploration in Iraq. The cost: $52,500.</TE>
<TE>   But taking over Iraq and remaking the global oil market is not
necessarily the endgame. The next steps, favored by hard-liners
determined to elevate Israeli security above all other U.S. foreign
policy goals, would be to destroy any remaining perceived threat to
the Jewish state: namely, the regimes in Syria and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "The War Won't End in Baghdad," wrote the American Enterprise
Institute's Michael Ledeen in the Wall Street Journal. In 1985, as a
consultant to the National Security Council and Oliver North, Ledeen
helped broker the illegal arms-for-hostages deal with Iran by setting
up meetings between weapons dealers and Israel. In the current war,
he argues, "we must also topple terror states in Tehran and
Damascus."</TE>
<TE>   In urging the expansion of the war on terror to Syria and Iran,
Ledeen does not mention Israel. Yet Israel is a crucial strategic
reason for the hard-line vision to "roll back" Syria and Iran -- and
another reason why control of Iraq is seen as crucial. In 1998,
Wurmser, now in the State Department, told the Jewish newspaper
Forward that if Ahmad Chalabi were in power and extended a no-fly,
no-drive zone in northern Iraq, it would provide the crucial piece
for an anti-Syria, anti-Iran bloc. "It puts Scuds out of the range of
Israel and provides the geographic beachhead between Turkey, Jordan
and Israel," he said. "This should anchor the Middle East pro-Western
coalition."</TE>
<TE>   Perle, in the same 1998 article, told Forward that a coalition of
pro-Israeli groups was "at the forefront with the legislation with
regard to Iran. One can only speculate what it might accomplish if it
decided to focus its attention on Saddam Hussein." And Perle, Wurmser
and Feith (now in the Pentagon), in their 1996 Israeli think tank
report to Netanyahu, argued for abandoning efforts for a
comprehensive peace in favor of a policy of "rolling back" Syria to
protect Israel's interests.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, Israel is given a lower profile by those who would
argue for rollback. Rather, writes Ledeen, U.S. troops would be put
at risk in order to "liberate all the peoples of the Middle East."
And this, he argues, would be virtually pain-free: "If we come to
Baghdad, Damascus and Tehran as liberators, we can expect
overwhelming popular support."</TE>
<TE>   Perle concurs on Iraq -- "The Arab World ... will consider honor
and dignity has been restored" -- as well as Iran: "It is the
beginning of the end for the Iranian regime."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has joined the call
against Tehran, arguing in a November interview with the Times of
London that the U.S. should shift its focus to Iran "the day after"
the Iraq war ends.</TE>
<TE>   The vast ambition of such changes to the Middle Eastern map would
seem an inherent deterrent. But it is precisely this historical
sweep, reminiscent of Sykes-Picot and the British arrival in Iraq in
1917, that many close to the administration seek. Publicly, Perle and
Ledeen cling to the fantasy that American troops would be welcomed in
Baghdad, Tehran and Damascus with garlands of flowers. Yet they are
too smart to ignore the rage across the Arab and Muslim worlds that
would surely erupt in the wake of war on multiple Middle Eastern
fronts.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the foreshadowing is already with us: in Bali, in Moscow,
in Yemen and on the streets of Amman. It's clear that even in Jordan,
a close ally of the U.S., the anger at a U.S. attack on Iraq could be
hard to contain.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the hard-liners in and around the administration seem to
know in their hearts that the battle to carve up the Middle East
would not be won without the blood of Americans and their allies.
"One can only hope that we turn the region into a caldron, and
faster, please," Ledeen preached to the choir at National Review
Online last August. "That's our mission in the war against terror."</TE>

<HD>Los Angeles' Toilet-to-Tap Fear Factor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D.J. Waldie</AU>
<BD>D.J. Waldie is the author of the essays in "Real City:
Downtown Los Angeles Inside/Out."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The spectacular failure of Valley secession has left behind a thick
residue of unresolved differences between breakup advocates and Los
Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn. However, one stagnant issue unites City
Hall and secessionists: Both oppose the use of waste water to
recharge Valley aquifers that supply some of the city's drinking
water.</LD>
<LD>   "Lips that touch reclaimed water," say Hahn and anxious homeowner
association presidents, "must never touch mine."</LD>
<LD>   The source of this unanimity is a plan to divert some of the 65
million gallons of processed waste water produced daily at the
Department of Water and Power's Tillman Reclamation Plant to irrigate
landscaping in the Sepulveda Basin and Hansen Dam recreation areas
and cool the steam condensers of one of the city's electrical
generating plants. Currently, most of Tillman's processed water is
dumped into the Los Angeles River, serving as the river's only
permanent water source.</LD>
<TE>   Reclaimed-water irrigation also might get the DWP off the hook to
repay the $50 million in state and federal grants the distribution
system cost. The DWP expects to get dunning letters soon because the
distribution system the department built with other people's money
has never been used as planned.</TE>
<TE>   Just three little words -- "toilet to tap" -- in newspaper
headlines in 2000 doomed the DWP's original goal to do many things
with the city's reclaimed water in order to stretch drinking-water
supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "Toilet to tap" in 2000 meant spreading as much as 35,000
acre-feet a year of highly processed reclaimed water on percolation
fields in the Valley. From there, it would migrate over time into
aquifers 500 or more feet below, mingle with the unprocessed water
that collects from the hillside watershed and flow through layers of
Pleistocene sand, gravel and silt. About five years later, the
blended water (97% from nature, 3% reclaimed) would have appeared in
city-owned wells, to be drawn into the domestic water system where,
after a lot of routine testing, more treatment and chlorination, it
would flow from the kitchen taps and hose bibs of city households.</TE>
<TE>   Intense and immediate opposition stopped the DWP's plan for
indirect reuse of reclaimed water then. What's unacceptable to Valley
and City Hall purists today is any reuse that even hints at evolving
into aquifer recharge. For them, watering golf course fairways with
reclaimed water is just the first step into a poisoned future.</TE>
<TE>   Fear is the solvent of plans in L.A. for the reuse of treated
waste water. There is more than 50 years of good science in
water-reclamation technology. The action of chemical, pharmaceutical
and biological contaminants in drinking water is well understood. The
skills to measure these constituents -- well below one part in a
billion -- are advancing. These contaminants, however, leave behind
risks that are small, but impossible to reduce to zero. Because even
reverse osmosis and other advanced treatment protocols cannot be
proved perfectly safe to the fearful, reclaimed water must be unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   Calculating the potential risk baffles many of the scientifically
trained. For the average water consumer, there's only faith and gut
reaction. And that's why any arguments about the safety and efficacy
of using reclaimed water, including direct injection into aquifers
supplying drinking water, won't hold up against the stomach-roiling
image of toilet to tap.</TE>
<TE>   It's also not enough to know that all water is reused water, and
that it has passed through a lot of lives in the last 3.5 billion
years. Or that the Valley's own watershed, like the rest of the
outdoors, is a vast latrine for everything that lives there, and all
of nature's effluent, untreated and unregulated, eventually passes
into Valley aquifers. Or that much of the water Los Angeles gets from
the Colorado River has previously seen the inside of the septic tanks
and sewage systems of upstream cities and arrives here in a condition
not much different from the tertiary-treated waste water produced by
the Tillman plant.</TE>
<TE>   It's not enough for Angelenos to know that a toilet-to-tap project
like the one abandoned by the DWP in 2000 is already in operation in
the Northern California communities of Dublin and San Ramon, where
2,800 acre-feet of reclaimed waste water recharge the aquifer
annually. Or that a significant quantity of reclaimed water is
already being used in Los Angeles for landscape irrigation and
filling man-made lakes. Or that direct injection of reclaimed water
into formations that are part of the basin's aquifers is used to
prevent seawater intrusion in the South Bay, Long Beach and Orange
County. Or that, since 1962, reclaimed water has been spread over
percolation fields adjacent to the San Gabriel River to end up, years
later and vastly diluted, in drinking water in the homes of hundreds
of thousands of southeast L.A. County residents. Or that many cities
in the southeast county have dramatically reduced their dependence on
"imported" water from the Metropolitan Water District by mandating
the use of reclaimed water for the irrigation of parks, schools,
highway medians and major businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Neither good science nor the reassuring outcome of a 40-year-long
epidemiological experiment on the residents of the southeast county
is enough to overcome the feelings that reclaimed water arouses. It's
not from the gut that these feelings come, but from the brain. In an
occult corner of the cerebral cortex, called the insula, some of the
mechanisms of revulsion and sexual arousal lie intertwined. The
insula can't be persuaded. It doesn't weigh evidence. It only knows
desire and disgust.</TE>
<TE>   There are interconnected reasons that are biological, cultural and
even religious to feel sickened by the image of reclaimed water.
Those reasons, however, are increasingly irrelevant to the situation
of Los Angeles and the region.</TE>
<TE>   Already, reclaimed water is crucial to maintenance of the region's
precarious freshwater balance. The 50,000 acre-feet a year that is
spread in the Montebello Forebay has helped restore about half of the
historic overdraft of Central Groundwater Basin, the main body of
water underlying the L.A. metropolitan area. By 2007, the badly
depleted Orange County basin will begin using 100,000 acre-feet of
waste water a year for groundwater recharge.</TE>
<TE>   That's sufficient recharge to provide water for about 300,000 to
400,000 households a year, hardly enough to slake the thirst of the
million more residents expected to arrive in the city of Los Angeles
by 2010 or the additional 6 million who will make their homes
somewhere in Southern California by 2025.</TE>
<TE>   Their arrival couldn't come at a worse time. By 2015, Los Angeles
and the region will finally be cut off from the surplus Colorado
River water that permitted relatively unrestricted growth on the
region's desert fringe in the 1990s. And if changes in the climate by
2025 follow even conservative global-warming models, reservoir levels
along the Colorado River could fall by 30%.</TE>
<TE>   To make up the region's water needs, homeowners could conserve
more, although they are already exemplary water misers, having one of
the lowest per capita uses in the West. We could desalinate some of
the brackish water beneath the South Bay.</TE>
<TE>   We'll have to use even more reclaimed water for irrigation and
manufacturing, if only to protect L.A.'s tourist destinations and its
remaining industrial jobs from increasingly higher potable water
costs. (The County Sanitation Districts, which collectively manage
the waste treatment of the other cities in Los Angeles County,

<TE>   Despite the disgust, we'll have to pass all our waste water
through the next generation of treatment facilities, spread some more
of it over the aquifers beneath our feet, and use it again ... and
again.</TE>
<TE>   There's absolutely no room for useless purism in the L.A. that's
coming, and no room for squeamishness either.</TE>

<BD>David Wise is the author of "Spy: The Inside Story of
How the FBI's Robert Hanssen Betrayed Ame- rica."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two weeks ago, a secret court that hardly anyone even knew existed
expanded the government's power to wiretap Americans and others. The
ruling was immediately hailed by Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft as a
victory in the war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   But the court's decision also raised a number of disturbing
questions.</LD>
<LD>   Not least among them is whether the new rules will really help or
actually hinder the effort to track down and penetrate terrorist
cells in the United States. And constitutional experts have expressed
concern that the decision chips away further at the 4th Amendment's
protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.</LD>
<TE>   During the Cold War, there was a continuing struggle at home
between liberty and security. Amid the climate of fear of communism,
the CIA opened first-class mail, drugged unwitting Americans and
spied on anti-Vietnam War protesters. The FBI, for its part,
conducted "black bag" jobs -- illegal break-ins at the offices and
homes of left-wing targets.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of 9/11, terrorism has supplanted communism as the
enemy, but the tension between liberty and security remains
essentially the same. The roundup of hundreds of suspects, their
names kept secret, the designation of some as "enemy combatants," the
U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo, the now-abandoned TIPS plan to create
a nation of informers -- all are 21st century manifestations of a
familiar battleground.</TE>
<TE>   The wiretap ruling, the latest salvo in this broader struggle,
came from an unexpected source, the three-member Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court of Review. The decision was the first handed down
in the court's 24-year history, which explains why even most
intelligence officials here were unaware of the court's existence.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat better known, but also operating in complete secrecy, is
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Both courts were created
by Congress in 1978 by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
(FISA).</TE>
<TE>   When the FBI seeks to wiretap or search the home or office of a
suspected spy or terrorist, it presents evidence to the Justice
Department that the target is believed to be "an agent of a foreign
power." If the department's lawyers agree, the request is forwarded
to the FISA court, made up of 11 federal judges who meet periodically
on the sixth floor of the Justice Department. The FISA court has
reportedly never turned down a request for a wiretap or physical
search.</TE>
<TE>   If, however, the FBI is investigating a criminal suspect -- a drug
dealer or organized-crime figure, for example -- it goes into a
regular federal court, under Title III of a 1968 law, to apply for a
wiretap warrant, which may be issued if the judge finds "probable
cause" that the target is engaged in criminal activity.</TE>
<TE>   The big difference is that under the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act, the FBI and the Justice Department need only to
persuade the secret court that the target is "an agent of a foreign
power," not that he or she is engaged in a crime. In the wake of
9/11, Congress passed the USA Patriot Act that amended the FISA law
to allow prosecutors to apply to the secret court so long as
collecting foreign intelligence was a "significant purpose" of the
wiretap or search.</TE>
<TE>   That opened the way for the criminal division of the Justice
Department to go after terrorists using the secret procedures of the
FISA court, an expanded power buttressed by the decision of the
review court. For years, the fruits of a tap or search under the
surveillance act could not be shared with criminal prosecutors. The
recent decision said the law never required such a wall between
counterspies and criminal prosecutors. As a result, the two groups
can collaborate.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, this might seem to make it easier to nab
terrorists. But not everyone agrees. For example, according to John
F. Lewis Jr., the former FBI assistant director in charge of the
national security division, the court's ruling could encourage the
government to pounce too quickly to arrest terrorist suspects instead
of keeping them under surveillance to penetrate their cells.</TE>
<TE>   Back in May, Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen, was arrested in Chicago
as he arrived on a flight from Zurich, Switzerland. Ashcroft, who
happened to be in Moscow at the time, announced with great fanfare
that the suspect was linked to Al Qaeda and was preparing to detonate
a radioactive "dirty bomb" in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "When Jose Padilla landed in Chicago," Lewis said, "the bureau was
criticized -- why didn't we allow him to make his contacts and find
out his network?" Lewis thought he knew why. "When there is a
problem, no one is going to say, 'Let's see where this goes.' We're
in the business of prevention, rather than follow and see where it
takes you. We're moving too fast, and we're scared.</TE>
<TE>   "What's driving this is Congress, and everyone wants to place
blame. People in the intelligence community are frightened they will
be blamed if someone is not arrested when he might have been. There
is this emphasis on nipping something in the bud. We know there are
cells here in this country -- I've been told that repeatedly -- and
we can't find them."</TE>
<TE>   The result of the review court's ruling, Lewis worries, "could be,
and probably will be, an adverse impact on intelligence gathering."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis agrees that there are circumstances where immediate action
is required. "But if he's not lighting his shoes on the aircraft,
let's see where he's getting his matches."</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists can cause havoc in a highly industrialized society such
as the United States. They can blast airplanes out of the sky, knock
over buildings and cause horrific loss of life. Perhaps they can even
blow up a nuclear power plant, disable communications networks or
create other unimagined disasters. But Osama bin Laden cannot destroy
America. We can only do that to ourselves, by gradually abandoning
our freedoms in the name of preserving them.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps it is a universal truth," James Madison wrote to Thomas
Jefferson in May 1798, "that the loss of liberty at home is to be
charged to provisions against danger, real or pretended, from
abroad."</TE>
<TE>   The danger from abroad is real. But so is the danger at home.</TE>

<HD>A wealth of advice in 'Riches'</HD>
<DH>Unlimited Riches, Robert Shemin, John Wiley &amp; Sons: 304
pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert J. Bruss</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're a serious real estate investor, or if you want to be,
you'll enjoy "Unlimited Riches." It offers advice from an experienced
realty investor who has diversified from buying and flipping more
than 400 discounted properties to dealing in mortgages, lease-options
and many other income sources connected with real estate.</LD>
<LD>   The author writes that his real estate investment career began in
1992, when he met an elderly couple who earned more than $65,000 per
month net income from 125 properties. Along the way, Shemin learned
how to assure realty success by purchasing property, mostly houses,
at least 20% below market value.</LD>
<LD>   The author calls real estate "the best wealth builder in the
universe," and it certainly has been for him. In this well-organized
book, Shemin explains the many profit-making choices that real estate
investors have, such as buying and selling property (called
flipping), buying and holding for long-term market value
appreciation, and leasing with an option to buy.</LD>
<TE>   Lease-options seem to be the author's favorite method of
controlling and profiting from property. His chapter on this topic
explains how to find, acquire and benefit from lease-options without
tying up much cash.</TE>
<TE>   Shemin uses examples throughout the book. Although most involve
other people, a few explain his personal realty escapades. The book
would have benefited from more of these.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most interesting chapters explains the pros and cons of
most types of real estate investments, such as rental houses,
trailers, apartments, commercial property and even land. The author
seems to favor houses.</TE>
<TE>   How to find real estate bargains is explained in another chapter,
where Shemin shares some offbeat techniques, such as putting a sign
on the side of your car or truck saying: "We will pay cash for your
house. Call me." Although the author dislikes the idea, he says,
"That ugly sign becomes a beautiful one when motivated sellers call
you."</TE>
<TE>   The book's strongest chapter is about negotiating, and Shemin
comes off as a relentless negotiator. "What is the absolute least
amount you would take for this property?" he keeps asking sellers to
wear them down. Then he adds, "Can you do any better?"</TE>
<TE>   The author emphasizes ethics and how to treat others, including
tenants, so you can do business with them again. One especially
valuable technique is to have lease-option tenants agree in their own
handwriting that they are to be responsible for repairs up to $300.
If they later "forget," Shemin sends them a copy of their written
promise to pay for such repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Every real estate investor should study this book. Readers need
not adopt every idea, but Shemin opens doors to the different
techniques for profiting from realty investing.</TE>

<HD>A new siren song</HD>
<DH>Los Feliz has caught the eye of L.A.'s police chief. He
plans to call it home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gayle Pollard-Terry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California's newest celebrity couple, Los Angeles Police
Chief William J. Bratton and his power-wife, Court TV anchor Rikki
Klieman, dazzled another glitzy crowd recently in a
multimillion-dollar landmark house that is a star in its own right.</LD>
<LD>   The majestic Maya-themed Sowden House, designed in 1926 by Lloyd
Wright and featured in the December issue of Architectural Digest,
provided the perfect dramatic backdrop for yet another of the chief's
pronouncements. He motioned toward the hills above the Franklin
Avenue home and told the crowd that he and the missus would live in
Los Feliz.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton, understandably, didn't discuss any details. No move-in
date has been scheduled, however, because the couple is still in
negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   Wherever they settle in the 90027 ZIP Code, their move will throw
a klieg light on Los Feliz, where the median price of a home is
$584,000. Houses in the choicest sections, such as the gated Laughlin
Park, the Los Feliz Estates and the streets north of Los Feliz
Boulevard, command millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   If Bratton becomes a neighbor, you can almost hear the new sales
pitch: "If it's safe enough for the police chief...."</TE>
<TE>   "The increased police presence would be great anywhere," said
Francis Gibbons, an agent who specializes in homes going for $1
million and up. He stood on highly polished hardwood floors of the
house he was showing, admiring the panoramic view from the spacious
Spanish villa that also features floors of marble and granite in an
exclusive hillside area north of Los Feliz Boulevard. "He'll be great
here," Gibbons said of the chief. "We're the intersection of all
cultures. Everybody comes here."</TE>
<TE>   Outsiders know Los Feliz by such landmarks as the domed Griffith
Park Observatory, currently under renovation; the Greek Theatre; the
romantic Shakespeare Bridge in Gothic splendor at Franklin Avenue and
St. George Street; and the trendy restaurants, clubs and shops along
Vermont and Hillhurst avenues in Los Feliz Village.</TE>
<TE>   In the neighborhood bordering Hollywood and Silver Lake, broad
boulevards and narrow streets twist, turn and curve high into rolling
foothills south of Griffith Park in this leafy, urban and sometimes
suburban area.</TE>
<TE>   Several years after Col. Griffith J. Griffith donated thousands of
acres of his property to the city of Los Angeles in 1896, developers
attracted the city's elite and movie royalty, including Hollywood
producer Cecil B. DeMille, Charlie Chaplin and W. C. Fields. Decades
later, Lily Tomlin owned the Fields estate for years. Madonna, Danny
DeVito and Rhea Perlman have also lived in Los Feliz.</TE>
<TE>   Many celebrities have been drawn to homes designed by some of
American's best-known architects -- Frank Lloyd Wright, his son
Lloyd, Richard J. Neutra, R. M. Schindler, Wallace Neff and Paul
Williams. Others have come for the views: sparkling city lights at
night; the ocean by day. The area has always attracted a diverse
crowd of developers, physicians, educators, entrepreneurs and
lawyers, including star defense attorney Johnnie Cochran.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson of location, location, location has not been lost on
the chief's wife, a big-time Boston defense attorney before her TV
career and marriage to Bratton. Unlike some newcomers, Klieman knew
quite a bit about the social and political geography of L.A. because
she covered the O.J. Simpson trial in the downtown criminal courts
building for Court TV. She was familiar with traffic that can turn a
six-mile commute into a 60-minute crawl. After a brief foray of house
hunting in Brentwood, West L.A. and by the beach, she decided to
focus much closer to her husband's downtown office in Parker Center,
Los Angeles Police Department headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Since the October announcement that Bratton would head the LAPD,
his wife has spent as much time as she can take away from her job in
New York house-hunting, largely in Silver Lake, the Hollywood Hills
and Los Feliz.</TE>
<TE>   In Manhattan, where Bratton once headed the New York Police
Department, the couple is selling a co-op in the historic Murray
Hills area, where a two-bedroom apartment can easily start at a
half-a-million and top $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   They have also put their sanctuary on Long Island, N.Y., on the
market. Their house sits on an acre of lush land, surrounded by the
solitude of a nature preserve, five minutes from the Atlantic Ocean
and almost as close to the scene in Southampton. Similar vacation
homes go for $2 million and up.</TE>
<TE>   The chief earns $230,039 annually. He also will get a $2,900
monthly housing allowance for half a year. Television anchors of
Klieman's stature earn much more. When she moves full-time to L.A.
next year, her paycheck could grow if she resumes the acting career
she quit to attend law school.</TE>
<TE>   In the current hot housing market, sales agents maintain that in
Los Feliz a million dollars can buy much more house than in
Brentwood, Beverly Hills or near the beach. Realtors boast of selling
homes to many who have abandoned other prestigious addresses that
required daily negotiation of the 405.</TE>
<TE>   "We're almost still reasonable," said Karen Weiss, an agent who
lives in Los Feliz and has been selling homes in the area for 23
years. That depends, of course, on what a home buyer thinks is
reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   A spectacular three-story Spanish home, built in 1929, that offers
seven bedrooms, 10.5 bathrooms, formal dining room, breakfast area,
study and maid's quarters in more than 8,000 square feet, went on the
market for $4.5 million. The asking price recently was reduced to
$3.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Central planning</TE>
<TE>   For LAPD's first couple, their commitment to the central city is
as much symbolic as it is about investment and lifestyle. They like
to eat out, jog and go to the movies, activities easily accessible in
their new neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Los Feliz "is in the heart of the city," said Los Angeles City
Councilman Tom LaBonge. "Some of my colleagues who represent other
areas will disagree, but to me, the heart of the city is Griffith
Park. If you go to the top of Mt. Hollywood, which is 1,625 feet
above sea level, on days like today, you can actually see the great
basin of Los Angeles from the Pacific Ocean, all the way to San Pedro
and the Vincent Thomas Bridge, out to the great San Fernando Valley,
and the mighty Angeles Forest sits as a backdrop to Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge tried to lure the new chief to Silver Lake, the
neighborhood where he grew up and still lives, with a personal tour.
It almost worked. The couple checked out a house there twice before
zeroing in on Los Feliz.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only is it 10 minutes to Parker Center," LaBonge said, "it's
about 25 minutes, Code 3 [lights flashing, sirens blaring], to San
Pedro or Chatsworth."</TE>
<TE>   The chief won't need a fleet of black-and-white squad cars where
he has chosen to live. Los Feliz is relatively safe, according to
LAPD records, with most calls reporting car thefts and break-ins.
Murders are rare, unlike other parts of the city where the homicide
rate keeps spiraling.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has taken on the job to make every neighborhood safe.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is a great city," he said at the party at Sowden House.
"It's going to be the safest city."</TE>

<HD>Cliquish board won't open the books</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Glassman and Donie Vanitzian Special to The Times</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: We have deed restrictions on our house in Valencia that
cause us nothing but grief because they mandate a five-member board
of directors. The president knows he only needs three votes to pass
whatever motions he wants, so he automatically discounts the other
two board members. The treasurer is part of the longtime dominant
clique of rotating owners that make sure three members from this
elite group are on the board at all times.</LD>
<LD>   Recruiting new owners for the board is a sham. For more than 10
years the treasurer has occupied the same position. She works closely
with each new president guarding the "real" financial information
from other board members.</LD>
<LD>   Non-board members are prohibited from seeing vital financial
information. Five times I've been on the board with the clique, and
five times I've been denied access to the books.</LD>
<TE>   During the past decade, two scenarios are consistent. First, at
annual and monthly meetings the treasurer explains she has not
received all the "numbers" from the management company, so will have
to get back to us; and, second, she has all the "numbers" from the
company but hasn't "fixed" them yet.</TE>
<TE>   The treasurer is provided with reams of financial documents she
shares only with the president. I suspect the treasurer, president
and their clique engage in "creative accounting" consisting of hiding
and juggling numbers. The material that is distributed is overly
broad and general in nature. The numbers don't add up, and none of
the so-called financials distributed to owners in that 10-year period
has been accurate, let alone truthful.</TE>
<TE>   From what I can tell, the clique has managed to nearly bankrupt us
through incompetence and spending sprees. I can't find anything in
the Davis-Stirling Act that gives homeowners the right to audit their
homeowners associations' books without restraints or where there are
penalties for boards that use "creative accounting" methods to cover
their actions.</TE>
<TE>   Can I audit the association's books and records without
interference? If I find wrongdoing can I sue the past presidents and
the treasurer for their years of creative accounting?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The Davis-Stirling Act gives homeowners the right to
enforce the association's covenants, conditions and restrictions. It
also requires boards to provide various documents each year at the
association's annual meeting. Documents that are sparse, general in
nature and insufficient for adequate homeowner oversight, with no way
to confirm their accuracy, are far less than the law requires.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis-Stirling Act fails to give homeowners an automatic right
to sue the association for faulty accounting or the absolute right to
review the association's books and records. Your right to review the
records, found in the Corporations Code and the Administrative Code,
is contingent upon a determination that your request relates to your
standing as a homeowner. That decision is made by the board, so it is
easy to imagine that the request could be denied. Legislative
attempts to correct this have been defeated.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the management company provides reams of documents
regarding the financial health of your association and that
information is then manipulated or kept from homeowners is
understandably cause for concern. Such acts are a breach of the duty
owed by the board to the other homeowners and can be a steppingstone
to liability.</TE>
<TE>   By the time a lawsuit is brought and comes to court, the
association books could be long gone or rewritten. At the very least,
if a court-ordered review reveals the "creative accounting" feared,
you might be able to recover some funds under the association's
insurance policy, from the board members directly or from those who
aided and abetted the practice.</TE>
<TE>   Removal of the board, even the election of board members outside
any domineering rotating clique of homeowners, is no guarantee that
there will be a change.</TE>
<TE>   It may sound fruitless, but writing your legislator and requesting
the Davis-Stirling Act be amended to include rights for homeowners to
audit their association books and records and to impose penalties
against boards that break the law, is a step worth taking.</TE>

<HD>Topanga, mountain mellow but oh so pricey</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ann Brenoff</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having years ago shunned its reputation as the region's UFO-sighting
capital, today's Topanga Canyon is home to an eccentric collection of
nature lovers, artists and anyone else willing to trade city
accessibility for open spaces. While vintage VW campers still chug up
Topanga Canyon Boulevard's S-curves, odds are high that SUVs are
barreling along behind.</LD>
<LD>   Drawing card</LD>
<LD>   Topanga is the green oasis in the greater Los Angeles concrete
desert, and its soul is the 11,000-acre Topanga State Park --
wilderness parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains just a spit from
"urbania." Topangans hike, bike and ride horses over the 36 miles of
trails, rarely encountering another soul. Secluded and virtually
crime-free, family-friendly Topanga's 18.2 square miles are home to
just 5,500 residents.</LD>
<TE>   Good news, bad news</TE>
<TE>   How much do you like nature? Raccoons in the garbage, rattlesnakes
in the woodpile and mudslides wreaking commuting havoc on the
boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's watching the deer from your deck, falling asleep to
coyotes howling and showing your kid the constellations without
interference from city lights.</TE>
<TE>   You want convenience? Move to the Valley. Real Topangans learn to
make grocery lists. And there is a certain charm to picking up your
mail at the post office from a postmistress named Cinderella (yes,
that's her real name).</TE>
<TE>   Insider information</TE>
<TE>   The Buddha mural on the boulevard, a landmark created by local
artist Kedric Wolfe, is the backdrop for many Topanga families'
annual holiday card photos. And while a true Topangan would never
leave Fido out of that photo, dogs are barred from the state park.
They are, however, welcome with open paws at Red Rock Canyon Park,
off Old Topanga Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   Hot spots</TE>
<TE>   Don't be misled by the crystal shop or the New Age restaurant that
rates its food on a spirituality scale: Topanga is among L.A.
County's priciest communities.</TE>
<TE>   Listings in the neighborhood known as the Post Office Tract are
higher because of their scarcity and close proximity to Topanga State
Park. The houses are also generally newer. Those seeking more
temperate weather head southwest to the Fernwood-Pacific area.
Spectacular views are spurring new development off Tuna Canyon Road
and in the area known as the Mesa. More than 25% of the current
listings are in excess of $1 million, and almost anything below
$600,000 jumps off the shelf.</TE>
<TE>   Housing stock</TE>
<TE>   Topangans live in everything from converted chicken coops to
multimillion-dollar contemporary architectural homes. There are some
horse properties, homes with land for vineyards and many creatively
expanded bungalows. Some houses are graced with river rock fireplaces
hand-built by the late master stonemason and Topanga resident Jack
Rice. Cabins, mansions, a hexagon house: The cookie cutter definitely
was not here. Topangans pay a premium for individuality. You won't
see many mushroom houses -- the kind that sprout up big and ugly
overnight and overwhelm their surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   Report card</TE>
<TE>   Topanga Elementary School ranks among LAUSD's finest with high
test scores. Credit goes to a strong parent base and many longtime
teachers.</TE>
<TE>   On the market</TE>
<TE>   As of mid-November, agent Casey Kelley of Coast &amp; Canyon Realtors
reported 38 homes listed for sale, (excluding the Top o' Topanga
mobile home community), ranging from $495,000 to $2.5 million.</TE>

<LD>This recently refurbished estate in Pasadena has a vineyard that
produces about 500 bottles of red wine a year. Wine from the grapes
grown here won an award this fall at the Rancho Cucamonga Wine
Festival.</LD>
<LD>   The vineyard has been a hobby of Mark Beck, a white-collar
criminal defense lawyer, and his wife, psychotherapist Bonnie Saland.
The couple have owned the property for 14 years.</LD>
<LD>   About this house: Designed by Seymour Locke in 1895, the
104-year-old home is a mix of Craftsman and Victorian styles. It was
one of the first houses in the country to have an attached garage,
according to a 1907 story in the Ladies Home Journal titled "Moving
the Car Into the House."</LD>
<TE>   The home was also an early gathering place for Tournament of Roses
dignitaries.</TE>
<TE>   The house has been used in many movies, including "Father of the
Bride" (1991).</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $2,595,000</TE>
<TE>   Size: The house has five bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms in 6,180
square feet. The lot is 27,600 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The gated estate has stone walkways and walls, which
enclose the gardens and vineyard.</TE>
<TE>   The home also has a view across the Arroyo Seco, five fireplaces,
an enclosed gazebo and a wine cellar. Among its modern amenities are
central air-conditioning and a security system.</TE>
<TE>   Where: On the east bank of the Arroyo Seco in Pasadena.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Serena Williams, the world's top-ranked women's tennis player, has
purchased a condo in a Westside high-rise for $1.4 million.</LD>
<LD>   The unit, on one of the higher floors of the tower, has
two bedrooms in an estimated 2,000 square feet. The building has
security, valet parking, a concierge, a fitness center and a pool.</LD>
<LD>   Williams--the reigning French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open
champ--and her No. 2-ranked sister, Venus, also had a nine-bedroom
home built in Florida, according to Ebony magazine.</LD>
<TE>   The sisters were raised in Compton before their father sent them
in 1991 to the Florida academy of tennis coach Rick Macci, who was
known for his work with Jennifer Capriati and Mary Pierce.</TE>
<TE>   Serena, 21, wanted to have a California condo so she could have a
second home closer to the entertainment industry. Pursuing an acting
career in her spare time, she appeared as a kindergarten teacher in
an October episode of the ABC sitcom "My Wife and Kids" and has an
acting coach, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Venus, 22, launched her V Starr Interiors, an
interior design and decorating company, but there was no word on
whether she will decorate her sister's condo.</TE>
<TE>   'Crossing' to a redesigned home in Laurel Canyon</TE>
<TE>   Jill Hennessy, who stars as the unconventional medical examiner
Dr. Jordan Cavanaugh in the TV series "Crossing Jordan," and her
husband, actor Paolo Mastropietro, have purchased a Laurel
Canyon-area home for close to $950,000.</TE>
<TE>   The home has two bedrooms and a great room with soaring ceilings
in about 1,900 square feet. There is also an office in a converted
garage. The grounds have meandering pathways. The house was built in
1923 but was redesigned by the seller, who is an artist.</TE>
<TE>   Hennessy, 34, formerly played Assistant Dist. Atty. Claire Kincaid
in the NBC drama "Law &amp; Order." She later appeared in the movie
"Autumn in New York" (2000) and played Jacqueline Kennedy in "Jackie,
Ethel, Joan: The Women of Camelot" on NBC (2001).</TE>
<TE>   Aundrelyn Knott of Coldwell Banker handled both sides of the deal,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   For sale again, but more chic now</TE>
<TE>   Actor Christian Slater and his wife, Ryan Haddon, sold their
former home in Brentwood in October, and it's on the market again,
this time at $3,295,000. The asking price when the current owner,
designer Rachel Ashwell, bought it was slightly under $3.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Ashwell, owner of the Shabby Chic stores, redecorated the house,
which has four bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms in about 4,300 square feet.
The gated estate, built in 1938, has Old World charm and up-to-date
amenities.</TE>
<TE>   The house also has a master suite with city views, an upstairs
family room and park-like grounds with a pool and spa.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after opening her first store in Santa Monica in 1989,
Ashwell opened stores in Chicago, San Francisco and New York City.
Her clients have included Madonna, Tracey Ullman and Whoopi Goldberg.</TE>
<TE>   Slater, who co-stars with Val Kilmer in the 2003 movie
"Mindhunters," and his wife bought another Westside home earlier this
fall for about $4.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Loraine Silver, with Pence-Hathorn-Silver, Coldwell Banker in
Santa Monica, has Ashwell's listing and represented her in buying;
Deborah Moore of DBL Realtors, Sunset Strip, had the listing when
Ashwell purchased the home, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   'Flyte' behind Malibu gates</TE>
<TE>   Terry Lewis, who has produced hit songs for such entertainers as
Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey, and his wife, Endora, have purchased
a Malibu home for about $3.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Mediterranean-style home, behind gates, has five bedrooms and
6.5 bathrooms in 7,000 square feet. The house is on about an acre
with ocean views and a pool. The home, built last year, also has
travertine floors, alder wood interior doors and custom cherry
cabinetry.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Lewis, 46, and Jimmy Jam have produced many top-selling
albums and are a Grammy-winning team. The pair met in high school in
Minneapolis. Lewis played bass in a band called Flyte Tyme. Jam
earned his nickname as a local DJ but joined Flyte Tyme, jamming on
keyboards.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis and Jam formalized their songwriting partnership by 1981 and
called their Edina, Minn., production company Flyte Tyme. They helped
shape the pop sound of the late 1980s and in '91 founded their
L.A.-based label, Perspective, in conjunction with A&amp;M Records. They
have since continued to produce hits and were honored at the Essence
Awards in June.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Frazier of Private Banking Realty Group represented the
Lewises in buying. The seller, an East Coast investment banking
executive, was represented by Bob Hurwitz, president of Hurwitz-James
in Beverly Hills, and Eytan Levin of Pritchett-Rapf in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy forces sale in Bel-Air</TE>
<TE>   Sukamto Sia, a former Honolulu developer and banker who filed for
bankruptcy protection in 1998 with debts of nearly $300 million, has
owned a Bel-Air home that will be sold Monday, subject to bankruptcy
court approval in Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   The former banker, a 43-year-old Indonesian businessman also known
as a high roller in Las Vegas, was sentenced in March to three years
in federal prison on bankruptcy and wire fraud charges.</TE>
<TE>   The Bel-Air home, built in 1983, has seven bedrooms and eight
bathrooms in about 9,000 square feet. The nine-acre grounds also have
a guest house, a tennis court, a monorail, waterfalls and a pool.</TE>
<TE>   The four-car garage has space for a stretch limo. The compound is
in a gated community.</TE>
<TE>   There was an opening bid of $4.6 million on the
Mediterranean-style home after it was listed at $4.75 million. The
offer could be overbid in court.</TE>
<TE>   Christophe Choo of Coldwell Banker's Beverly Hills North office
represents the bankruptcy court trustee for Sia.</TE>

<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>There's a Realty Executives office in Crows Nest, Australia. And a
Century 21 in Ho Chi Minh City.</LD>
<LD>   Along with the Golden Arches and CNN, the American way of real
estate is being offered to the world.</LD>
<LD>   The big players in American residential real estate have been
setting up shop abroad for several years. Consumers from Singapore to
Amsterdam to Sao Paolo are getting used to the sight of the Re/Max
balloon or the blue Coldwell Banker logo.</LD>
<TE>   Not that it's been love at first sight. Coldwell Banker President
and Chief Executive Alex Perriello recently visited his company's
franchises in Spain, the Netherlands and France, and he said the
"American way" has a ways to go there, at least in real estate.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no such thing as an MLS [Multiple Listing Service] there,
or even an exclusive listing," said Perriello, who was in Chicago for
an international management meeting. "You'll see a house with five
different 'for sale' signs on it, all of them from companies who are
separately trying to find a buyer. Then the owner might turn around
and sell it himself."</TE>
<TE>   But one wonders whether that kind of competitiveness just might be
a good thing for consumers in Marseilles or Madrid. Couldn't it be
viewed as Yankee hubris to go into a country and suggest a whole
different business model for a system that doesn't seem to be broken?</TE>
<TE>   But Perriello said that, even if it isn't broken, it's far from
efficient. "I think what happens [with multiple agents] is that you
end up not getting service from anybody," and the challenge is to
offer a broader range of services in exchange for exclusivity.</TE>
<TE>   He said there's a growing consumer acceptance of the U.S. realty
model abroad, "but the percentage is small," at least so far.
Coldwell Banker isn't the only American company that's trying to do
that. Its sister companies, ERA and Century 21, are aggressively
franchising around the world, as are Realty Executives and Re/Max, to
name a few.</TE>
<TE>   They're getting some help from the National Assn. of Realtors,
which is seeking to sign up agents and brokers in other countries for
training in marketing and technology. Earlier this year, for example,
it conducted classes at the University of International Business and
Economics in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   The outreach in Europe goes beyond exclusive listings. Perriello
said that the president of Coldwell Banker Europe soon will meet with
Polish officials to discuss the possibility of that government
creating a version of Freddie Mac, the quasi-governmental U.S.
institution that buys mortgages from lenders and packages them into
securities that are sold to investors.</TE>
<TE>   He said that Americans' high rate of homeownership -- not to
mention other countries' gradual embrace of "branding" -- has made
our realty companies the object of international admiration.</TE>
<TE>   "They like the way we do business. They like the system,"
Perriello said, although there may be a few thousand
anti-globalization demonstrators who would argue with him.</TE>
<TE>   "They realize that, as the world gets smaller because of
technology, it's important to be part of something bigger and not
just the local market."</TE>

<HD>Home loan ceiling raised to $322,700 starting next year</HD>

<BD>From Times wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced last week that they will
increase their single-family mortgage loan limits from $300,700 to
$322,700 effective Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The 7.3% increase in the ceiling is consistent with the increase
in the national average home price from Oct. 2001 to Oct. 2002 as
recorded by the Federal Housing Finance Board.</LD>
<LD>   Freddie Mac estimated that the higher conforming loan limit would
enable an additional 250,000 home buyers to obtain lower cost
mortgage financing and that a borrower with a typical 30-year
mortgage at the new conforming loan limit would save about $37,700 in
interest over the life of a loan.</LD>
<TE>   Fannie Mae estimated that the higher ceiling would allow 210,000
more home buyers to obtain a Fannie Mae mortgage. The company said
buyers would save up to $23,500 over the life of a 30-year mortgage
at the current difference between rates for a Fannie Mae mortgage and
a jumbo mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   Other new loan limits for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae mortgages
after Jan. 1 will be $413,100 for two-unit properties, $499,300 for
three-unit properties and $620,500 for four-unit properties.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Southland home sales recorded the strongest October since 1989,
according to DataQuick Information Systems.</LD>
<LD>   A total of 29,048 new and resale houses and condos were sold in
Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, Ventura, San Bernardino and Orange
counties in October. That was up 10.8% from 26,216 for the month
before, and up 13.1% from 26,092 for October last year.</LD>
<LD>   So far this year 284,498 homes have been sold in Southern
California, the strongest January-to-October period since 1989 when
286,515 were sold. Sales levels increased most in the Inland Empire
counties and in affordable neighborhoods elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   The median price that Southland buyers paid for a home in October
was $278,000. That was down 0.4% from $279,000 for September, and up
19.3% from $233,000 for October last year.</TE>

<LD>Demonstrating the strength of the housing market, sales of existing
single-family homes nationwide rose to unusually high levels in
October, according to the National Assn. of Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   Existing-home sales increased 6.1% in October to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 5.77 million units from an upwardly revised
level of 5.44 million units in September. The sales activity was 9.5%
above the 5.27-million unit pace in October 2001 and was tied for the
third-highest pace on record.</LD>
<LD>   David Lereah, the association's chief economist, said a couple of
factors are at play. "Obviously, historical lows in mortgage interest
rates in recent months are a big stimulus," he said. "At the same
time, the inventory of homes on the market, which was historically
lean during the first half of the year and limited housing choices,
improved in August and September."</LD>
<TE>   The national median price was $159,600 in October, up 9.8% from
October 2001 when the median price was $145,400.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>After leaving Seventh Avenue on a rainy night and passing through a
security checkpoint manned by agents with metal detectors, I came to
a ticket window at Madison Square Garden where I said, "What's the
cheapest ticket?"</LD>
<LD>   "Forty-five," said the man behind the glass.</LD>
<LD>   "Dollars?" I said.</LD>
<TE>   He gave me a Soprano look.</TE>
<TE>   I gave him the money.</TE>
<TE>   For $44.50, I bought the cheapest seat available at a
Knicks-Pistons game. Section 347, Row A, Seat 10 is seven rows from
the arena's ceiling with a sight line that passes through a
backboard.</TE>
<TE>   There is no reason to attend an NBA game in November. I went as a
fan. No press table at courtside, no press access, no crib notes from
the teams' publicists. Bought a ticket, paid $6.75 for a hot dog and
Coke, took a series of escalators and from an eagle's perch looked
down on a scene familiar and yet mystifying.</TE>
<TE>   The basketball floor was golden, even shining.</TE>
<TE>   There were tiny bodies sprawled in bunches on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Tiny men in suits sat on stools in front of bright lights.</TE>
<TE>   A rap song, gentle and insistent, being broadcast by the arena's
public address system, mixed with the sounds of bouncing basketballs
and customers murmuring in anticipation of the night's entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   How odd those sights and sounds must seem, I thought, to someone
who never had seen players stretching before a game or never had seen
television commentators talking to a light or never had known rap as
a signal of an athletic competition. Well, why not be a newbie
myself? Watch an NBA game as if I never before had seen one. As
scenes presented themselves, I would ask questions -- such as, "That
HAIR! What is THAT about????"</TE>
<TE>   From Section 347 every player on the court looked much like every
other player, except for a Piston distinguished by a crown of hair,
tall hair, untamed hair, falling this way and that, hair allowed
freedom from restraint, bending in the wind of movement, hair
encircled by a red headband.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, I listened to the Garden announcer in an attempt to
learn the name of that man with electric hair. But the announcer
intoned visitors' names in a voice so soft, so clipped, that those
men were reduced to whispered asides. So when the haired one scored,
I cupped a hand to my ear and this is what I heard: "benwallace."</TE>
<TE>   At 38-20, Knicks leading at the end of the first quarter, the
Pistons' coaches wanted nothing to do with the players. As players
took seats on chairs at the sideline, the team's four coaches -- men
in suits, anyway -- moved away from those chairs and stood out on the
court. They were almost at the free-throw line, gathered in
conversation. They came to the bench just before the second quarter
was to begin, perhaps to say, "Guys, we're outta here, we've got
tickets to The Producers, catch you later."</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe a coach said, "Somebody needs to get a hand in
SpreeeeeEEEEEEwellllllll's face," for that was the name of the
Knicks' best player, as often cited by the arena announcer who took
pleasure telling us that last field goal was made by
"La-treLLLLLLLLLL SpreeeeeEEEEEEwellllllll."</TE>
<TE>   The Garden was maybe half full, only 10,000 people, quiet people,
no Spike Lees thrashing about. What I heard mostly were the sales
pitches of vendors passing by Section 347 every 15 seconds. "Popcorn!
Getchyer popcorn!" "Hey, pretzels!"</TE>
<TE>   "Cotton candy, cotton candy, here's yer cotton candy!" "Hot dogs!"</TE>
<TE>   "How much for cotton candy?" I said.</TE>
<TE>   "How much you got?" the vendor said.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody in New York is a Soprano.</TE>
<TE>   "Naw, $5 will cover you," the vendor said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision: cotton candy or next month's house payment?</TE>
<TE>   "I'll pass," I said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a curious night with barely a murmur of interest moving
through the crowd, even when the Knicks led by 30 at halftime, 64-34.
As odd as that silence might have been to anyone ever harmed by the
sensory assault common to NBA arenas, it was odder still to realize
I'd spent $51.25 to be entertained and had yet to experience an
entertaining moment.</TE>
<TE>   Thank heaven for The Fat People's interruption.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, just when it seemed nothing would happen, fat people in
street clothes and sneakers took over.</TE>
<TE>   "If (fat person's name here) makes this shot from midcourt," the
arena announcer said with excitement, "he wins $77,777."</TE>
<TE>   Enough to buy three cotton candies, two beers and one of those
pretzels the size of Rhode Island.</TE>
<TE>   The shot fell 20 feet short.</TE>
<TE>   People booed.</TE>
<TE>   Not nice of them, but they also booed the Knicks later when
benwallace and richardhamilton led the Pistons on a long rally.
Though the Knicks once led by 32 points, the Pistons had a chance to
win in the last minute. Finally, SpreeeeeEEEEEEwellllllll's two free
throws with 4.7 seconds to play saved the Knicks, 94-91.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning's New York Times said the Knicks' collapse had
been "mental, the result of anxiety, dread and trepidation." An
earlier judgment had come from the Soprano in section 347, Row B,
Seat 8, who flipped the back of his hand toward the golden floor and
said, "Them's chokin' dogs."</TE>

<LD>When the Philadelphia Eagles released A.J. Feeley two months ago, the
third-string quarterback didn't want another team to claim him off
the waiver wire.</LD>
<LD>   Feeley got his wish, re-signed with the Eagles and will make his
first NFL start against the St. Louis Rams on Sunday in a rematch of
last year's NFC championship game.</LD>
<LD>   "It was somewhat stressful," Feeley said Wednesday of the time he
spent in limbo. "I didn't want to go anywhere. I was fortunate."</LD>
<TE>   The Eagles cut Feeley and rookie linebacker Tyreo Harrison on
Sept. 26 to create roster spots for defensive tackle Jeremy Slechta
and safety Julian Jones because of injuries at both positions. Once
Feeley cleared waivers, he immediately was signed to the practice
squad and later was added to the active roster.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to put him on the practice squad," Eagles coach
Andy Reid said. "He understood the situation of why we were doing it.
We weren't disgruntled with him by any means."</TE>
<TE>   Because of injuries to Donovan McNabb and Koy Detmer, Feeley went
from holding a clipboard on the sideline to being the starting
quarterback for the NFC East-leading Eagles (8-3).</TE>

<DH>Former NFL quarterback Doug Williams leads resurgence at
Grambling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Foster</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GRAMBLING, La.</DL>
<LD>Grambling State coach Doug Williams has perfected greeting people on
the run. He had to -- otherwise, he never would get around this
little northeastern Louisiana town.</LD>
<LD>   Everybody wants a piece of Williams. Families file into his
office, carrying video cameras, pushing shy children forward to meet
him. Stacks of letters, filled with old trading cards and requests
for autographs, topple off his desk.</LD>
<LD>   "The man is definitely a legend," senior offensive lineman Kenneth
Ogletree said. "He's lived the dream."</LD>
<TE>   From college star to Super Bowl MVP, Williams successfully
directed football teams as a quarterback. Now he's doing the same in
his fifth season as head coach at his alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into the Bayou Classic at New Orleans against state rival
Southern University, Grambling State is 10-1 -- its third straight
season with double-digit victories.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers will play Alabama A&amp;M in the Southwestern Athletic
Conference championship game Dec. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had a tough act to follow when he replaced the school's
only other coach. Eddie Robinson started coaching at Grambling in
1941, and he retired in 1997 with 408 victories -- more than any
college coach.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson's teams won all or part of 17 SWAC titles and eight black
college national championships. But his last three teams lost more
games (22) than his teams lost during the 1970s (21).</TE>
<TE>   "I'll always be in Coach Rob's debt," Williams said. "Everyone at
Grambling will be. That's why it means so much to see the program
back where it should be."</TE>
<TE>   As Robinson's quarterback, Williams was an All-American, made the
All-Southwestern Athletic Conference team and was Black College
Division Player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was a first-round NFL draft pick in 1978, and the
highlight of his career was winning the 1988 Super Bowl with the
Washington Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   "You had to have somebody like that after Coach Rob," said Dorothy
Conners, 57, a lifelong Grambling fan. "We're used to having a coach
of that stature."</TE>
<TE>   When Williams replaced Robinson in December 1997, he found a
program lacking good athletes and good work habits, according to
offensive coordinator Melvin Spears.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a list that included the kind of players we wanted and the
kind of program we wanted," Spears said. "We wanted guys that could
make plays. We wanted speed and great athletes. And we wanted a very
disciplined group."</TE>
<TE>   Williams called his first team meeting for 7 p.m. He locked the
doors a minute after. The 15 players that showed up late eventually
met with Williams, and he told them to abide by the rules or leave.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of spring practice, 35 players were gone. Those who
stayed were the kind of players Williams wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of young guys without much experience, but they
bought into what we were doing," Williams recalled.</TE>
<TE>   His transition to head coach was smooth because of what he'd been
through as a player and assistant, said receivers coach Sammy White,
who played with Williams at Grambling and for the Minnesota Vikings
for 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   In Williams' first four seasons, Grambling went 5-6, 7-4, 10-2 and
10-1. Last season, it won the Southwestern Athletic Conference and
the NCAA Division I National Black College title.</TE>
<TE>   This season the Tigers lost 22 seniors and 27 lettermen and had
only seven returning starters, just two on offense. But they have won
10 straight games since an opening 52-20 loss at McNeese State.</TE>
<TE>   After that loss, Williams benched sophomore quarterback Bruce
Eugene.</TE>
<TE>   "That hurt me a lot," Eugene said. "But it made me grow up a lot.
Before that I was all about fun, fun, fun. Now I know there are times
when I have to be serious, when I have to be tough."</TE>
<TE>   An injury returned Eugene to the lineup, and he hasn't missed a
play since. He goes into Saturday's game with 37 touchdown passes and
3,717 yards passing.</TE>
<TE>   Expectations are high, and discipline is paramount both on the
field and off.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing football because we want to play it," said
Ogletree, who graduates in May and plans to attend medical school.
"For that privilege we have certain responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson visited his players' rooms at 5 a.m. when he was the
coach, making them get up and go to class.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' approach is different.</TE>
<TE>   "I suggested they buy alarm clocks because it was their
responsibility to be in the weight room at 5:30 a.m.," Williams said.
"If they don't make it, they have to run the stadium steps after
practice and then hit the weight room."</TE>
<TE>   Promptness is only one of Williams' mantras.</TE>
<TE>   "He taught me about self-help," said Willie Gray, a senior who
hopes to play in the NFL, but if not will go to graduate school.
"Since I started playing for him, I've learned that we can determine
our own destiny on and off the field."</TE>

<HD>America's Cup Full of Troubled Waters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Angus Phillips</AU>
<BD>Special to The Washington Post</BD>
<DL>AUCKLAND, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>As far back as 1896, when the New York Yacht Club canceled Lord
Dunraven's honorary membership after he suggested the New Yorkers
cheated by secretly changing the weight of the boat, America's Cup
icons have squabbled in grand style.</LD>
<LD>   In 1983, the Australians were assailed for their revolutionary
design; in 1987 New Zealand caused the "plastic fantastic" uproar by
using fiberglass. In 1988 a long, bitter legal dispute occurred when
the Americans entered a 60-foot catamaran against a New Zealand entry
nearly twice its size.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, and Craig McCaw, a wireless
telecommunications mogul, are the latest billionaires to become
embroiled in a big-stakes spat involving big-money sailors and their
well-heeled backers. This year's event is only in the quarterfinal
stage but the Seattle-based OneWorld team funded by Allen and McCaw
already stands accused of misappropriating design secrets. Veteran
U.S. skipper Dennis Conner and his Stars &amp; Stripes syndicate and
Italy's Prada teamed up this week to argue that OneWorld should be
disqualified.</LD>
<TE>   What is it about this event that causes the wealthy and powerful
to charge each other with cheating and seek to oust their rivals by
legal maneuvers if they can't do it at sea?</TE>
<TE>   "The America's Cup is not like other sports," says former French
Cup skipper Bruno Trouble, who pioneered the Louis Vuitton Cup
challenger series in 1983 for the right to meet the defending Cup
holder (New Zealand). "You win or you die. When you are about to die,
you will do anything to survive."</TE>
<TE>   The five-man America's Cup international jury -- two members from
England, one each from Australia and Denmark plus Charley Cook from
the United States -- will be handling a holiday hot potato over the
next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "If the America's Cup had a middle name it would be
`controversy,"' says Cup historian John Rousmaniere. "The miracle is
that it's survived as long as it has. It attracts high rollers with
big egos who push the limits, and because the rules aren't
particularly well laid out, the boundaries get tested. Every year
since 1851 there's been something."</TE>
<TE>   Here in sunny New Zealand a half-dozen billionaire backers are
helping 10 teams spend more than $700 million in the 31st Cup
competition. With this competition, litigation is inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   The jury and a Cup arbitration panel this week were separately
poring over 90 pages of accusations, the theme being that OneWorld
codesigner Laurie Davidson brought his drawings of Team New Zealand's
2000 Cup winner with him when he joined OneWorld, while others on
OneWorld's design team brought secrets from other camps.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the evidence comes from a New Zealand lawyer named Sean
Reeves, who also joined OneWorld from Team New Zealand, then parted
ways from his new employers. Reeves subsequently was accused in a
Seattle court of violating confidentiality agreements in his OneWorld
contract by offering team secrets to other syndicates. He was ordered
to desist and fined.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld already has admitted to certain indiscretions in its
design process and was docked one point in early rounds of the Louis
Vuitton Cup series. But rivals argue the airing of charges before a
Cup arbitration panel was incomplete and the penalty was inadequate.
They want OneWorld disqualified.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld's Seattle syndicate, headed by McCaw and Allen, reacted
angrily to the revived charges. "There is good reason why books have
been written about the history of unsportsmanlike conduct in the
Cup," the syndicate responded in a prepared statement Tuesday. "The
same characters and organizations continue to reappear in acts of
sculdugary (sic) and underhandedness. The America's Cup deserves
better if it is to endure as the oldest and greatest sporting prize."</TE>
<TE>   The "characters and organizations" to which OneWorld refers would
includes the New York Yacht Club, holder of the Cup for 132
contentious years, and Conner's Stars &amp; Stripes, the club's entry in
this regatta.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Yacht Club, which presented the latest protest to the
jury, has a grand history of controversy. It probably came closest to
full Cup meltdown in 1983, when Conner's outclassed Liberty faced
winged-keel Australia II in a best-of-seven final. Top officers of
the club met before the showdown to vote on whether to race. Some
believed the winged keel was illegally designed with help from
European engineers and the club should simply refuse to race.</TE>
<TE>   The vote was close but the ayes had it, barely, and Australia went
on to win what was dubbed "the yacht race of the century," 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Conner's Stars &amp; Stripes and OneWorld also are locked
in a best-of-seven series, with the winner to advance to challenger
semifinals. The loser goes home. OneWorld, which compiled the
second-best record in early trials here, is favored over Stars &amp;
Stripes, a distant seventh in the early going. OneWorld won the first
race Tuesday by over a minute, coming from behind.</TE>
<TE>   In its protest, Stars &amp; Stripes cites accusations from an
affidavit filed by Reeves, the former OneWorld lawyer, in June. The
50-page document paints a picture of a design process in which
illegal documents from Team New Zealand, Prada and America True were
used by OneWorld to develop its new boats. Cup rules strictly
prohibit passing technology between syndicates.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld executive director Bob Ratliffe claims Reeves is not a
credible witness and the protest filings are "desperate acts of
desperate men."</TE>
<TE>   The jury will hear testimony after racing in the current round
ends on Sunday, and is being pressed by event organizers to issue a
ruling by Dec. 9, when challenger semifinals are slated to begin.
Timing is crucial, said Trouble, because if OneWorld is disqualified,
another team, presumably Stars &amp; Stripes, would advance.</TE>

<HD>Orlando Waits Patiently for Hill's Ankle to Heal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Branom</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>When Grant Hill sprints down the floor and finishes a fast break with
a dunk, he gives the Orlando Magic every reason to believe he can
lead them on a big playoff run.</LD>
<LD>   But when Hill's surgically repaired left ankle aches, he watches
from the sideline.</LD>
<LD>   And that's when the postseason seems a long way off: The Magic
(9-7) have lost three of the four games in which Hill failed to play
at least 10 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   "As I said all along, there's going to be some rough spots here
and there," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   This is the five-time All-Star forward's third year in Orlando,
and the bright future heralded by his arrival dimmed long ago. During
Hill's long absences brought on by three operations, the Magic have
achieved little other than two first-round playoff exits.</TE>
<TE>   Hill seems to have regained his excellence in many ways. He is
averaging 16.1 points on 59.5 percent shooting, 6.1 rebounds and 4.5
assists.</TE>
<TE>   But he recently sat out three games, most of another and the
fourth quarter of a fifth. There's nothing his team can do other than
hope the hurting stops soon. The pain never went away the last two
years, when Hill missed all but 18 games.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking big picture," said Hill, who turned 30 during
training camp. "Hopefully, we can get to a point where we look back
and forget about all this."</TE>
<TE>   Forget this? Not a chance. Not while the Magic must worry about
Hill and the three screws holding together his ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "Grant, right now, is in uncharted waters. We just don't know,"
Orlando coach Doc Rivers said. "Maybe by midseason, he has no pain
anymore, and he can play every game. But none of us know, the doctors
don't know. This is new."</TE>
<TE>   According to the team, the ankle is not causing Hill's problems,
although the joint remains swollen. Instead, his Achilles' tendon is
inflamed because his body isn't used to the rigors of an NBA season,
despite Rivers' limiting his minutes.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Hill is averaging 27.3 minutes and has yet to top his
uniform number -- 33.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic knew Hill would feel pain during the comeback; the only
question was where it would strike.</TE>
<TE>   "We assumed it would be some part of his foot, his knee or his
back," Rivers said. "Because it's his foot, we're probably more
cautious of it than anything else."</TE>
<TE>   That was evident during the Magic's 112-102 win over the Los
Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night. Rivers thought Hill was favoring
the ankle, so the coach yanked him for the night in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   When Hill doesn't play, he's missed everywhere on the court. His
versatility is the engine that drives the Magic -- he can fill every
role from ball-handler to big man.</TE>
<TE>   If Hill is out, defenders can key on superstar Tracy McGrady, who
leads the NBA with a 32.2-point scoring average. Also, Rivers is
forced to give more minutes to 34-year-old point guard Darrell
Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   The contract that brought Hill from Detroit to Orlando -- $93
million over seven years -- is one bad break away from weighing down
an organization that claimed a year ago to be losing $10 million
annually. Fewer wins means fewer fans, which means smaller revenue.</TE>
<TE>   And while Hill is as solid a citizen as they come in the NBA, his
absence on the court diminished his influence in the locker room. As
Rivers put it, nobody listens to a man on crutches.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the Magic have had to watch power forward Ben
Wallace, traded to Detroit for Hill's rights, blossom into the
league's top defender.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was a great trade for both teams," said Pistons
general manager Joe Dumars, who also acquired point guard Chucky
Atkins at the time.</TE>
<TE>   There have been glimpses this season of how strong Orlando can be
when Hill is on. During a five-game stretch, he averaged better than
23 points, seven rebounds and five assists, and the Magic scored
113.2 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   And if it isn't Hill doing the damage, it's McGrady. After all, an
opponent can double-team only one man.</TE>
<TE>   "He's helping me out on the basketball court, where I have fresh
legs in the fourth quarter to take over the game and have more energy
to defend guys like Kobe (Bryant), Paul Pierce, Vince Carter,"
McGrady said. "So he takes a lot of pressure off me."</TE>

<HD>NFL Will Do What Heisman Won't</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Oates</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So many pro clubs need what USC quarterback Carson Palmer has shown
this season -- the talent to dominate as a passer -- that he's
certain to be a first-round choice in the NFL draft this spring. But
can the same be said for Palmer's chance to win the Heisman Trophy?</LD>
<LD>   That's doubtful, for, clearly, Plaschke's Law is more than ever
applicable in 2002. On a national news program last week, for
example, the ABC network reflected the Eastern bias that Bill
Plaschke recently wrote about in The Times.</LD>
<LD>   Reviewing a big football Saturday, ABC touted an Eastern star for
the Heisman, one Larry Johnson of Penn State, a running back who'd
had a four-touchdown day.</LD>
<TE>   On the same New York broadcast, the ABC announcers, the two who
are best known for their Saturday halftime reports, mentioned (in
passing) Palmer's four touchdown passes that day. But the player both
announcers promoted for Heisman recognition wasn't Palmer but the
Penn State guy. After Penn State beat Michigan State. To most
Easterners, the West is another planet.</TE>
<TE>   Who's Pennington?</TE>
<TE>   In the West, sports fans are more likely to look at the whole
country. For one thing, they know who Chad Pennington is. They've had
him in their e-mail sights since Pennington came out of nowhere in
early November to rescue the New York Jets as Vinny Testaverde's
replacement at quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   And they know he'll be in Oakland Monday night to duel Raider
quarterback Rich Gannon. Old vs. new. Their teams have both come off
losing streaks to launch November winning streaks.</TE>
<TE>   At 37, Gannon, like George Blanda before him, is now throwing and
winning with his head, and doing it sensationally.</TE>
<TE>   At 26, Pennington seems to be proving, also sensationally, that
the Jets guessed right when they named him on the first round in the
2000 draft. He's also proving that you can rise to stardom in New
York from Marshall, which plays in the Mid-American Conference.</TE>
<TE>   More to Come</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Mid-American is grooming two or three more
promising quarterbacks, among them Byron Leftwich of Marshall and Ben
Roethlisberger of Miami (Ohio).</TE>
<TE>   What's happening around the country is that high school coaches
are producing more good quarterbacks than the I-A conferences can
handle.</TE>
<TE>   What's happening in New York is that Pennington is teaming with
runner Curtis Martin to give the Jets the two-way threat you need to
win pro games.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble is, the Raiders have that too.</TE>
<TE>   Schedule Luck</TE>
<TE>   Of all the Super Bowl contenders, the Jets have the toughest
remaining schedule. Their 31-13 conquest of Buffalo in Week 12 was
their fourth consecutive in a run that included a win over Miami; but
even if Pennington and Martin stayed hot, they could spend the rest
of the season as underdogs with only one possible breather.</TE>
<TE>   And that's on the road, against the Chicago Bears.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise for the Jets, it's Oakland, Denver, New England and
Green Bay. Thus, in this season of general parity, the key question
is getting to be, "Whom do you play when?"</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Chargers, to name one unlucky team, ran into Miami
quarterback Ray Lucas last Sunday after Lucas, a relief pitcher for
injured Jay Fiedler, had recovered from a series of ragged starts. At
his most ragged low point, he couldn't even stand to look at the
tapes of himself.</TE>
<TE>   Abruptly, with the Chargers in town, Lucas was a 194-yard passer,
which made Ricky Williams a 143-yard rusher and San Diego a 30-3
loser.</TE>
<TE>   Warner or Bulger?</TE>
<TE>   The Redskin game also settled the long-term quarterback question
for the Rams:</TE>
<TE>   In the salary-cap era, which of their two multimillion-dollar
passers should they keep next year, Kurt Warner or Marc Bulger? The
answer now, surely, is, "Not Warner."</TE>
<TE>   As great as Warner is -- coming back from injury Sunday, he
completed his first 15 passes -- Bulger is similarly accurate as a
passer and more mobile.</TE>
<TE>   That is the difference; and in these times of mobile necessity for
NFL passers, it's a big one. Though Bulger isn't a sprinter, either,
he moves well in a collapsing pocket. Whereas Warner doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier Learning</TE>
<TE>   The luck of the schedule -- whom do you play when? -- also
punished the Rams last week.</TE>
<TE>   They bumped into the Washington Redskins on the very day that
Steve Spurrier, Washington's famous new passing coach, finally
learned that you also have to run the ball to win NFL games. Spurrier
overdid it, running Stephen Davis 31 times (while calling only 23
passes), but that's another story.</TE>
<TE>   The Week 12 story is that St. Louis figured Spurrier to pass the
ball as usual while he was running it to win, 20-17, ending the Rams'
five-game winning streak, and smashing their playoff hopes.</TE>
<TE>   One-Play Disaster</TE>
<TE>   As the Rams' final play Sunday illustrated, Warner, with 17
seconds left, can be sacked on an opponent's six-yard line when his
team is losing by only three points with the tying field goal
imminent.</TE>
<TE>   The call by Ram Coach Mike Martz was, contrary to his own
statement, a good one. To rely on an overtime coin toss would have
been chancy against the combination of Davis and Spurrier's wise old
quarterback, Danny Wuerffel, who can't throw much, but who does throw
straight.</TE>
<TE>   In such a crisis -- one play, at the six-yard line, for the
ballgame -- Martz had every reason to expect a two-time NFL MVP to
take one look at his A receiver in the end zone, whoever that was,
and throw him the ball or throw it away, leaving time a-plenty for a
kick.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, like a rookie hoping to make something happen, he waited
until the game was lost.</TE>
<TE>   The next crisis for Martz is whether to use Bulger, either as
starter or in relief, before his bad finger completely heals. The
danger is that Bulger will be permanently damaged if he plays
prematurely. A ligament injury can do that.</TE>
<TE>   Best Players Gone</TE>
<TE>   For the Rams, this is a season that apparently can't be saved.
Although next year could be wonderful for Martz and Bulger, both,
they have been done in this season by too many serious injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams went into Washington last week minus their three best
players -- quarterback Bulger, running back Marshall Faulk and
cornerback Aeneas Williams -- and they will probably be without all
three again in Philadelphia today.</TE>
<TE>   Although, as the coaches say, all teams have injuries, these are
three particularly hard losses for Martz. On his offense, Faulk is
the heart and soul. On the defense, Williams is the heart and soul.
And Bulger's injury denied the Rams any thought of a relief role
Sunday for the passer who, after their 0-5 start, had led them back
to 5-5.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams did have their MVP quarterback in Washington; but after
his long injury layoff, Warner couldn't have been as sharp as he
wanted to be.</TE>
<TE>   In the Ram game, the Eagles will again be without their great
player, quarterback Donovan McNabb, who was a candidate for NFL MVP
when he was injured two weeks ago. The Eagles, though, routed San
Francisco on Monday night with surprisingly effective quarterback
replacements.</TE>
<TE>   And best of all, for them, they don't have much to beat in the NFC
East. In a 16-14 game last week, the New York Giants (Philadelphia's
foremost rival) couldn't even get past the expansion Houston Texans.</TE>
<TE>   Wanted: Vick on TV</TE>
<TE>   For Michael Vick, the Atlanta quarterback who is showing the
football world that there's a new way to play the NFL game, the next
challenge looms today in Minneapolis. Though the Vikings can't win
for losing on the road, they're tough indoors at home, where, when
Vick has the ball, the noise level will be more than he dreamed of.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking as a jury of one, I've never seen a football player who
could do what Vick does routinely -- throw long and straight if
that's open or sprint like a running back if a run is preferable.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, escaping is probably Vick's long suit. His option to
escape a hit of any kind will be there forever, once he learns to
take it -- once he learns to use his quickness to dart out of bounds
on a running play, or to instantly sprint out of danger when the
pocket breaks down.</TE>
<TE>   If you haven't seen him, what Vick does is hard to imagine. So,
come on, Fox. You can then judge for yourself that nobody else can do
-- has ever been able to do -- what he does.</TE>
<TE>   Today's Guesses</TE>
<TE>   * Denver to win by three points at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego.
It's not true that the Chargers are slumping. This is just another in
a series of hard-to-win games.</TE>
<TE>   * St. Louis by three at old Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. The
Eagles were playing erratically even before they lost McNabb.</TE>
<TE>   * San Francisco by two over Seattle at Candlestick's 3Com Park.
Does this make three losers for me with two to go? Is quarterback
Matt Hasselbeck the Seattle answer after all?</TE>
<TE>   * Tampa Bay by five over New Orleans at the Louisiana Superdome.
The Saints have the talent to take me to four for four.</TE>
<TE>   * Monday night: Oakland by a touchdown over the New York Jets at
Network Associates Coliseum. It won't be easy for Jet quarterback
Pennington to pass this test.</TE>

<DH>Three Lawyers Who Chose to Defend Accused Terrorists and
War Criminals Discover Something About Themselves, and That 'Evil' Is
Not Always Absolute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC PAPE</AU>
<BD>Eric Pape last wrote for the magazine about the
assassination of a Chilean activist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles attorney Russell Hayman sits in the United Nations
detention center at The Hague. The room is cramped, divided by glass
2 inches thick. Beside him is an interpreter. On the other side of
the divider is Tihomir Blaskic, a meaty man with a receding hairline
and round-rimmed glasses.</LD>
<LD>   It is July 1996. Hayman has flown to the Netherlands to resolve a
moral dilemma. Blaskic is a Croatian general accused of overseeing
massacres of Bosnian Muslims and, as such, is the highest-ranking
military official to date brought before a U.N. tribunal on war
crimes in the former Yugoslavia. Hayman, a former prosecutor, has
been asked to defend him, but he is hesitating.</LD>
<LD>   The case offers him a chance to be part of history, on a world
stage, and the intellectual challenge of going against U.N.
prosecutors. For countless reasons, the odds against a defense
attorney on these cases are huge, so any lawyer who pulls out a
victory becomes another Johnnie Cochran, so to speak. Also weighing
on Hayman's mind is a guiding principle of jurisprudence--every
defendant deserves representation. Certainly Blaskic should have an
attorney. Even the Nazis tried at Nuremburg after World War II had
lawyers.</LD>
<TE>   But Hayman has qualms, as do many attorneys asked to defend
accused war criminals or terrorists these days. If they agree to do
so, they enter an arena of moral uncertainty, where definitions of
good and evil can blur, where the scales of justice can seem to weigh
client loyalty against government allegiance, where legal careers can
suffer.</TE>
<TE>   In this instance, Hayman is held back by his own morals. He has
spent years defending corporations but has, until now, refused on
principle to represent terrorists, drug traffickers or violent
criminals. Yet when the request to defend Blaskic came from an
American ambassador, Hayman couldn't quite dismiss it outright.
Friends and colleagues encouraged him to take the historic case. The
Croatian government of President Franjo Tudjman offered its full
cooperation and agreed to pay Hayman's standard rate of $400 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   So Hayman began reading up on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that Blaskic oversaw many atrocities.
Specifically, they said that before dawn on April 16, 1993, shouts
and gunfire awoke men, women and children in the village of Ahmici,
in Bosnia's Lasva Valley. As they fled their houses, they were shot
down. Those who stayed inside were immolated when Croatian fighters
set fire to the village. About 100 Bosnian Muslim civilians were
killed, and the massacre became a prototype for eliminating the
Muslim presence in villages in the region. The nascent United Nations
tribunal accused Blaskic of command responsibility--the first such
charge against a military figure since World War II, Hayman says.</TE>
<TE>   However, Hayman also found indications that Blaskic may have been
set up by other Croatians. If true, then Blaskic was a victim, not a
criminal--in which case he might be worthy of defending. So Hayman
flew to the Netherlands to meet the defendant, telling himself he
would take the case only if he was convinced Blaskic been accused
unjustly. But now as he leans forward toward the glass, with the
defendant smiling from the other side, Hayman questions himself once
more: "How am I going to find the truth?" The man before him seems
kindly, bookish. Most people have a hard time believing someone
smiling gently and talking softly to them is capable of horrible
acts. What's more, Hayman is far more familiar with corporate
clients, especially hospitals in health-care fraud and abuse cases,
than he is with men accused of atrocities. "I thought he looked more
like a librarian than a war criminal," Hayman says.</TE>
<TE>   The two communicate through microphones, but the conversation is
broadcast elsewhere in the prison and can be overheard by guards.
Hayman interviews Blaskic at length, then reads more about the case.
Eventually, he concludes that Blaskic had been framed by other
Croatian military leaders who were looking for a scapegoat to save
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "There are always people who say, 'How can you defend this
person?' " Hayman says. "But there are cases where, after conducting
due diligence, you are skeptical. He was set up. If he wasn't a moral
and ethical guy, I wouldn't have been interested in defending him."</TE>
<TE>   When speaking with a trial attorney for either side, it is worth
remembering that they are storytellers, creatively scripting
plausible scenarios by sewing together interpretations of facts and
seemingly reasonable assumptions. In borderline cases, the better
storyteller often wins. According to Hayman, after several top
Croatian military and political officials were indicted, the Tudjman
government encouraged Blaskic to go to The Hague to clear his name,
knowing that his lack of knowledge of the crimes would make it
impossible for him to implicate others who had been charged. His
acquittal, the government assumed, would show that prosecutors had
overreached--probably in a misguided attempt to counterbalance the
numerous prosecutions of Serbs underway. "He was a decoy," Hayman
says.</TE>
<TE>   Showing that in court, however, would prove difficult. War crimes
are often born of extreme political opportunism and desperation.
Witnesses are ready to lie to convict sworn enemies, and impartial
witnesses are, at times, nearly impossible to find. Truth is
particularly elusive when evidence sites are despoiled, the lines of
command are blurred and official orders are secret. For lawyers,
these cases can have more in common with the complex prosecutions of
CEOs for the actions of massive multilayered companies than they do
with, say, serial killers.</TE>
<TE>   Hayman says that the Tudjman regime refused to turn over
intelligence documents that he believed would clear Blaskic and
implicate top Croatian political and military officials. "It was
obviously difficult to defend him when I was paid in part by a
government that concealed the most important evidence," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2000, 32 months after the case began, the court found
Blaskic guilty of ordering a significant number of attacks and of not
preventing others. He was ordered to serve 45 years in prison, the
longest sentence ever handed down at The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   Hayman says the verdict changed his world. "If you know someone
who gets convicted unjustly, it affects the way you view the rest of
your life. Some people don't think that is possible. I know that it
is."</TE>
<TE>   Hayman is appealing the conviction based on information obtained
from Croatian Intelligence archives following the death of Tudjman
and the loss of power by his party.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Lynne Stewart is resolute in her refusal to take certain
kinds of clients. "I don't do child cases," she says. Before becoming
a lawyer, Stewart spent 11 years as a teacher for underprivileged
children in Harlem and on Manhattan's Lower East Side. She is also a
mother of three and a grandmother of seven. "I consider children to
be the only innocents left on earth, and I don't think I can exploit
that in any way, so a client can't get my undivided loyalty."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Stewart has found it within herself to defend militant leftist
radicals, a convicted Mafia hit man, cop-killers and, for a reduced
fee, a man later convicted of plotting to destroy much of Stewart's
hometown, New York City. Egyptian Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind
spiritual leader, was eventually convicted of plotting to blow up the
United Nations, FBI offices, the Holland and Lincoln tunnels and the
George Washington Bridge. Prosecutors also asserted that Rahman was
the spiritual author of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing because
those held responsible had listened to his teaching.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, 62, took up the defense in 1995 after half a dozen other
lawyers considered representing him but were either ruled out by
Rahman or decided against it themselves. "Sometimes a case will come
in of a brutal or reprehensible murder that is particularly ugly and
I ask: Is this my kind of case?" she says. "But I had very little
doubt about this one."</TE>
<TE>   She saw Rahman through the lens of her own leftist and civil
rights activist past. In her downtown Manhattan office, decorated
with posters of Che Guevara and other leftist heroes of the past (and
a photo of the New York Mets), she hunches forward on her dilapidated
wooden desk to explain that Rahman is, in some ways, a visionary
freedom fighter, and that if people like him are successful in
bringing down Egypt's unresponsive leaders, they may be viewed as
liberators in hindsight, even in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   To her, Rahman was a persecuted non-English-speaker whom an
American jury was prone to fear for his militant calls to battle
injustice. "My assumption with most of my clients is that they are
guilty of something but not necessarily what they are accused of . .
. . With the sheik, I thought he probably wasn't [guilty] because I
knew the political climate around the case."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart is an internationalist who believes that citizens of any
nation have a right to fight their government if it is oppressive,
even if that government is an ally of the United States. She thinks
it is unacceptable for the "war on terror" to replace the Cold War as
a reason for Washington to support oppressive regimes.</TE>
<TE>   Those reasons help explain her belief in Rahman, and why she
sounds defiant when asked about defending a man many Americans regard
as a sinister killer. She contends that Rahman has done nothing more
than condemn U.S. policy for supporting what he considers to be
morally bankrupt governments in Egypt and the Middle East. "The
priest who preaches against abortion isn't blamed for people who kill
abortion doctors," Stewart says.</TE>
<TE>   He was convicted, she says, because ethnic and religious
stereotypes trumped her defense. As he was sentenced to life in
prison, tears welled up in her eyes. "As far as him personally
sanctioning any attacks against the U.S., I don't think that is true
at all, and I don't think he had any knowledge of any attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Stewart says, prosecutors
have begun encouraging top defense lawyers to refuse to defend
accused terrorists. "They are trying to get us to make a moral
judgment along the way about whether we are supposed to do this, and
I will not." Her opinions about Rahman and the conditions of his
detention even led her to defy a U.S. government requirement that led
to her own arrest in April. The government, fearful that Rahman could
communicate to terrorists from his cell, denied him any contact with
friends and limited his family to a single visit. Stewart was allowed
to see him in his Minnesota prison cell only if she agreed not to
transfer any messages from him to the outside world. But in early
2000, she agreed to issue a press release on his behalf, intended as
an open letter to his lawyer in Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart says his treatment in prison is unfair, and that the
government's practice of spying on his conversations with lawyers
reminds her of the persecution of leftists by the FBI in decades
past. She considers her violation a minor affair--and she insists
that it had no impact--but, if convicted, she could face a maximum
sentence of 40 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Ed Medvene had flown halfway around the world
to stare into the bulging eyes of Dr. Gerard Ntakirutimana, trying to
assess whether he seemed capable of evil. During the 24-hour trip to
the U.N. detention center in Arusha, Tanzania, Medvene had tried to
prepare himself for what he would find. But when a gun-toting escort
led him through a yard on the way to meet Ntakirutimana, Medvene
noticed that the bored faces of prisoners sitting on dusty wooden
stairs were the same as those in the case files he had studied. "All
the guys on the little stoops were alleged to be genocidal killers,"
he thought.</TE>
<TE>   He suddenly felt disoriented, as if his moral compass were
searching for absolute north in a universe where it didn't exist. He
had worked on cases involving brutal crimes. He helped represent Fred
Goldman in a successful civil action against O.J. Simpson over the
killing of his son Ron Goldman. He defended a Mexican businessman
convicted of torturing and killing a U.S. drug agent. He has spent a
decade trying to spare a man on California's death row from
execution. For a time, he had even prepared to defend Serbian
strongman Radovan Karadzic before the war crimes tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   Still, during that first visit to the detention center in Arusha,
the 72-year-old lawyer couldn't help but think: "I am so far from
home." It was a thought as true literally as it was figuratively.
Ntakirutimana was accused of committing unspeakable crimes at the
tail end of Rwanda's civil war, when an estimated 800,000 people were
butchered in 100 days in mid-1994. "Even if you do criminal cases,
you aren't used to the machete and what it can do to people, or
seeing rooms with hundreds or thousands of skulls laid out in
systematic order," Medvene says. "You have to find a way to deal with
that."</TE>
<TE>   So Medvene crossed the world to end up in a 4-foot-by-8-foot room,
with a simple desk and a couple of chairs. He wanted to examine the
face of Ntakirutimana, a once-respected Hutu doctor. Ntakirutimana is
accused of helping to set the stage for the massacre of ethnic Tutsis
during the Rwandan civil war. Specifically, he is alleged to have
encouraged Tutsis to gather at the Mugonero Adventist Church and
Hospital Complex on April 16, 1994. In a Hutu-led orgy of violence
that began at 9 that morning, as many as 5,000 people were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Medvene, like Stewart, had few moral qualms about defending such a
person. Yet he was looking for something, some spark of humanity in
the defendant that would serve as the decisive element in his
decision. He had already dealt with a host of other issues, some
practical, some personal, that often confront attorneys asked to
defend such clients.</TE>
<TE>   He had consulted with the partners at his law firm, Talcott,
Lightfoot, Vandevelde, Sadowsky, Medvene &amp; Levine. He was concerned
about the commitment of his time, possible public relations fallout
to the firm, and the likelihood that he would not pull his financial
weight for the duration of the trial. The most he would be paid was
$125 an hour--the maximum the United Nations pays for the defense of
suspects classified as indigent, an amount far below his standard
rate.</TE>
<TE>   At home, Medvene wanted to make sure his wife supported his
decision. "This meant defending someone accused of genocide and other
terrible things," he recalls. "I thought it might generate a lot of
bad things, like people saying, 'How could you defend someone accused
of killing hundreds or thousands of people?' I wanted her input on
how she'd feel if I did it." He also knew he would be working where
vengeance killings were common, which ruled out bringing his family,
and that they would grow lonely spending so much time apart.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, she told him: "It's your call."</TE>
<TE>   Medvene's friends, however, suggested that he had better things to
do with his time, especially with the prospects for acquittal seeming
so dim. Tutsi rebels, who eventually overpowered the Hutus, now run
Rwanda. This means that the Ntakirutimana defense team would be left
to search for witnesses and evidence in a country controlled by
victims, who are now the victors. Potential defense witnesses were
held in crowded, squalid Rwandan jails, where they have been held for
years, often without being charged with any crime. Others live
freely, but with a fear that they or their families will be harmed if
they testify on behalf of Hutu suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Medvene had been contacted about the case by Ramsey Clark, the
former U.S. attorney general whom he had met in 1996, when Clark was
representing Karadzic on a civil matter in New York and Medvene was
getting ready to defend him in absentia at the war crimes tribunal in
The Hague. (The court later decided against holding that proceeding.)
A few years later, Clark was retained to defend a Seventh-day
Adventist pastor named Elizaphan Ntakirutimana at the U.N. tribunal
for Rwanda. He asked Medvene to defend the man's son, Gerard, because
they would be tried jointly.</TE>
<TE>   Now Ntakirutimana, a stocky man in his early 40s, sat before
Medvene at last. The doctor had forgotten his round, gold-rimmed
glasses. Medvene looked into his eyes. Looking back, he says, was a
gentle family man, someone privileged and refined, like other
detainees who made up much of the cream of Rwandan society for two
decades. "I had a good feel about him," Medvene says.</TE>
<TE>   He decided to take the case, despite the concerns of friends and
colleagues. "You lose your bearings if you do like politicians and
take a poll before deciding how you think about an issue," he
explains. "The controversial nature of the case just can't be the
bright line test. The test is, how does it feel in your stomach?"</TE>
<TE>   The trial began in September 2001 and a verdict is expected in the
next few weeks. Prosecution witnesses testified against Ntakirutimana
in English, French and Kinyarwandan from behind ceiling-high
bulletproof glass. A colleague at the hospital told the court
Ntakirutimana had discharged dozens of Hutu patients one day before
Hutu militia soldiers, who were linked to the ruling party, appeared
at the village, singing, "Let's exterminate them [the Tutsis]." The
soldiers and Hutu civilians then opened fire, chasing villagers into
a church, where they were slaughtered. Many other Tutsis were killed
at the hospital as attackers fired guns and tossed grenades through
the windows.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said Ntakirutimana fired a rifle and chastised attackers
for sparing women and children. One Tutsi witness said Ntakirutimana
pursued him and a few other survivors to the nearby craggy Bisesero
hills. The witness said he thought the doctor would help him because
their fathers had exchanged cattle in the past, a sign of a familial
bond. "Instead, he shot at me."</TE>
<TE>   Medvene soldiered through the first half of the trial, vigorously
cross-examining all 19 prosecution witnesses. Then the court went
into recess for months before beginning the defense. During the
break, Medvene backed out as lead counsel because of a family medical
problem after making sure that a lawyer was prepared to replace him.
"Another lawyer was ready. They had a road map to defend the doctor."
Otherwise, Medvene insists, he would have continued, and says he
still consults with the defense from afar.</TE>
<TE>   Yet reflecting on the case amid the memories of Rwanda's hell,
Medvene does ask himself questions about taking such cases in the
future. "Would I have taken the case if the guy had told me he had
masterminded and done it? It may not be the right answer, but I don't
think I would have," he says. "If the guy did it, or if he told me

judgmental and I wouldn't have wanted to spend years working on it,

<LD>"Dogtown and Z-Boys," the recent hit documentary chronicling the
skateboard revolution launched by surf-rat teens in Venice and Santa
Monica during the mid-1970s, was an all-boys nostalgia session with
one exception: Peggy Oki. Growing up on Westside beaches, Oki surfed
and skated from an early age and joined the Zephyr skateboard team at
its inception. Alongside such Dogtown legends as Jay Adams, Tony Alva
and Stacy Peralta, Oki invaded Santa Monica's steeply banked
schoolyards and empty swimming pools and bagged trophies at
competitions. Oki, 46, now makes her way as a freelance graphic
designer and fine artist (www.peggy-oki.com), but she still carves up
the concrete at the skate park near her Santa Barbara home and chases
warm-water waves on surf safaris in the tropics.</LD>
<LD>   What got you started with skateboarding?</LD>
<LD>   My father bought my brother and me our own Black Knight
skateboards from a department store. That was back in the Fred
Flintstone [clay] wheel days. A few years later, my brother was
taking wood shop at school, and Cadillac [urethane] wheels had just
come out, so he made some skateboards, including one for me. I have a
great brother.</LD>
<TE>   How did you get on the Zephyr team?</TE>
<TE>   I had just started to learn to surf. It seemed like skating would
be helpful to my surfing when there wasn't a swell. One day I was
skating on Bicknell Hill and I was asked by one of the boys--I think
it was Jay [Adams]--on the Zephyr team if I'd be interested in
skating on a team. Jay told me to go to the Zephyr surf shop, and I
was signed on.</TE>
<TE>   You were a Z-Girl when girls were few and far between in the
skateboard and surf milieus. Why you?</TE>
<TE>   I was a tomboy all along. I used to get into rock-throwing fights
with boys, and climbed trees to play. I had raced motocross in the
two years before I took up surfing.</TE>
<TE>   It's evened up a bit, but girls are still a minority in the skate
and surf worlds. Why do you think this is?</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't say, other than change is slow in some cases. With the
increased numbers of female surfers and skaters, there is a growing
gender-based support. There are peers, magazines, clubs, [but] I have
not been closely following this topic.</TE>
<TE>   The Z-Boys' impact on skateboarding was in large part a matter of
attitude and style. What is your definition of style?</TE>
<TE>   It represents the way an individual expresses themselves in their
own personal dance. Style comes through in the physicality of skating
or surfing, just as it does in painting. It is interesting to me how
in a group of 30 people, everyone can paint the same exact subject or
object, yet you can see a unique style in each person's
representation. It's the same with surfing and skating.</TE>
<TE>   The "Dogtown" of the film was a ghostly, rundown Venice/Santa
Monica that's long gone. How has the area changed?</TE>
<TE>   This is the general course in a capitalist society, to "develop,"
especially coastal lands. I suppose to some, it would be seen as an
improvement. To me, what it was like 25 years ago has been wiped
away. If I were to see that the development in the area was one that
brought sustainable environmental, socially conscious change, I would
say it was an improvement. But I have not seen that.</TE>
<TE>   Could a cheeky tribe of mainly working- and lower-middle-class
kids start a creative movement there today?</TE>
<TE>   If there are still some living there.</TE>
<TE>   There was a sad undertone as the film tracked the Z-Boys over the
years--some flourished, some didn't. What made the difference for
you?</TE>
<TE>   We all come to our own awarenesses in our own time. I was
fortunate to realize my choices relatively early in my life. My first
travel experience as an adult was about 24 years ago, when I went to
Maui for two months. I realized that I enjoy travel and the
experiences it brings. I am thankful for having seen so many places,
and for all that I have learned in my lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Have you taken any tough slams lately?</TE>
<TE>   On May 4, I took a hard fall in the big bowl [at Skater's Point
skate park in Santa Barbara]. That really hurt! Fractured my wrist in
three places. With a 50% chance of requiring surgery, I convinced the
doctor to let me face the odds. I powered out on homeopathics and had
heaps of acupuncture, positive thinking, and I lucked out. A cast for
six weeks, and I was back to surfing a month later.</TE>

<DH>A Ventura County Rape Case Shows How Difficult It Can Be to
Judge the Truth When Sex Takes Place in a Hard-Partying Haze</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary A. Fischer</AU>
<BD>Mary A. Fischer is a Los Angeles-based freelance
writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the night his life changed forever, Andrew Luster and a friend
drove north to a bar in Santa Barbara called O'Malley's. Especially
on weekends, the bars and clubs along State Street, where O'Malley's
is located, overflow with tourists and with students from UC Santa
Barbara, many of whom fully expect, as a pretty blond 21-year-old
named Carey did on that warm Friday night in July 2000, to "get
messed up."</LD>
<LD>   Until that night, Luster's famous heritage had served him well. He
had a trust fund of nearly $1 million and a $600,000 cottage on the
beach in Mussel Shoals, a Ventura County community. He was 36,
handsome, with thick dark hair, green eyes and a trim, toned body
from years of boating and surfing. He took fishing and surfing trips
to Mexico and Costa Rica and slept with a string of beautiful young
women. Usually he didn't brag about how he got his money, but on that
summer night at O'Malley's, he wanted to impress Carey, so he says he
casually mentioned that he was related to the legendary cosmetics
tycoon Max Factor.</LD>
<TE>   What happened over the next 12 hours, after the couple left
O'Malley's together, is hotly debated. But three days later, Ventura
County sheriff's deputies arrested Luster at his house and charged
him with drugging, kidnapping and raping Carey "Doe." (Her last name
is being withheld under a Times policy of protecting the identities
of sex-crime victims.) The graphic evidence investigators found at
Luster's house--16 videotapes in his bedroom that allegedly show him
having sex with other women, some of whom appear drugged, almost
comatose--led to additional criminal charges by two women Luster had
dated in the past.</TE>
<TE>   His status as a great-grandson of Max Factor became a liability
for him overnight as the media played up the celebrity angle. The
kidnapping charge, the possibility that Luster was "a clear and
present and immediate danger to women," plus the fear that he might
flee, led a judge to set his bail at $10 million. Unable to come up
with the $1-million bond, Luster sat in jail for five months. In all,
Luster was charged with 87 counts of kidnapping, drugging, sodomy and
rape. Prosecutors alleged that Luster is a serial rapist who drugged
three unsuspecting women with the illegal substance gamma
hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and, without the knowledge of his two former
girlfriends, videotaped them in various sexual acts. If convicted, he
could spend the rest of his life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The defense, however, claims that this was never a GHB-induced
rape case. "Plain and simple," says Roger Diamond, one of Luster's
lawyers, "this is a case about prosecutorial misconduct and we plan
to get to the bottom of it." The defense claims that prosecutors have
withheld key evidence, altered witness statements and coached the
three women complainants who, Luster's lawyers claim, are "gold
diggers" out to get their client's money.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews last March, before the judge imposed a gag order,
Luster and his defense team denied all of the charges against him.
The women consented to have sex, Luster said, and if the two
videotapes now being used as evidence were viewed in their entirety,
they would show that the women knew they were being videotaped.</TE>
<TE>   He also contended that he never gave any of them GHB. "My life has
been ruined because police and prosecutors jumped to conclusions," he
said. "They wanted to make me their GHB poster boy. They're doing
this to punish me for my lifestyle, which doesn't fit in with their
conservative values. In 20 years I haven't gotten anything except a
few speeding tickets. Had they thoroughly investigated [Carey Doe]
before charging me, they would have discovered she lied" about how
things transpired during their encounter. But, Luster said, "they
allowed the case to go forward to boost their careers."</TE>
<TE>   Two and a half years after Luster's arrest, his case still is not
resolved. He remains under limited house arrest, an
electronic-monitoring device attached to his ankle, as he waits for
his trial to begin in the coming weeks. The high-profile case once
seemed solid, but at this point it's hard to predict how a jury might
react to some of the evidence that has emerged since the charges were
first filed.</TE>
<TE>   As the pretrial debate between Ventura County prosecutors and
Luster's defense team continues, Luster's case opens a window on the
persistent problems that arise when the criminal justice system is
confronted with accusations of drug-induced sexual assault. These
cases often present difficult challenges, including physical evidence
that vanishes quickly from the human body and built-in cultural
biases against men and women who sometimes get caught up in a
partying lifestyle. Such cases also often hinge on the meaning of
"consensual" and the ability of a jury to sift the truth from a
subculture of sometimes easy sex, performed in a haze of drugs and
alcohol, that obscures traditional meanings of guilt and innocence.</TE>
<TE>   By the summer of 2000, authorities in Southern California and
elsewhere around the country considered GHB--along with Rohypnol, or
"roofies," and a variety of other central nervous system
depressants--as a drug linked to sexual predators and their crimes.
GHB is clear and odorless, with only a slightly salty taste. This
makes it hard to detect in drinks or food, and it can be synthesized
easily in a home lab with recipes that are available on the Internet.
With GHB, a four-hour groggy period usually ensues, sometimes
followed by in-and-out amnesia. (Former LAPD narcotics officer Trinka
Porrata says that Ecstasy, another popular drug on the club scene,
also "can compromise a woman's judgment," even though it is not a
depressant but a stimulant.)</TE>
<TE>   An average of 50 drug-facilitated sexual assaults are reported to
the Los Angeles Police Department's rape special section each year,
says Det. Jesse Alvarado, "but there are so many more that go
unreported. Many women don't want to go through the emotional trauma
of a criminal investigation, and these drugs make women often not
remember what happened to them." Most of the reported cases never
make it to trial (last year only six did) because of a lack of hard
evidence. GHB vanishes from blood in four hours and from urine within
12.</TE>
<TE>   When L.A. County Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Hanlon Stone got the 1998
case of George and Stefan Spitzer, identical twins who were dubbed
the "Rohypnol Romeos" for using roofies to drug women they had met
and then forcing sex on them, she had little physical evidence to
work with. "These cases are complicated because evidence is
disappearing every minute," she says. "Women often don't realize
they've been sexually assaulted and don't go to a hospital in time
when it would be critical."</TE>
<TE>   Stone was able to win a conviction by building a strong
circumstantial case around the testimony of more than a dozen female
victims and seven boxes of Rohypnol found in the twins' Marina del
Rey apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell people they should pee in a cup right away," says Porrata,
who now teaches law enforcement and high school and college students
how to recognize and avoid drug-facilitated rape. (She also is a
prosecution expert witness in the Luster case and declined to comment
on the upcoming trial.) "These are hard cases to prove, and cops who
don't understand the phenomenon are a big part of the problem. Most
rape investigators don't even have enough training. If they did,
they'd know to rush a victim to the hospital. As it is, most police
don't respond to these situations as drug-induced rape cases. They
think of the woman as some drunken bimbo."</TE>
<TE>   Most cases of drug-induced sexual assault "are alcohol-related,"
says Alvarado. "A woman can just as easily get drunk and not remember
what happened. As long as someone does not give their permission,
that's rape. In sex cases, there are only two defenses: it wasn't me
or it was consensual. Consent is the hardest thing to prove,
particularly with the use of drugs, because the victims can't
remember whether or not they gave consent. Sometimes there's a very
thin line between what's true and not true."</TE>
<TE>   As the Luster case demonstrates, a partying lifestyle can easily
blur that line. Andrew Luster moved to Mussel Shoals 19 years ago
after graduating from Windward School in West Los Angeles so that he
could be close to his "true love"--the ocean. His freewheeling
lifestyle weakened his already tenuous ties to the Factor family,
which is involved in the arts and philanthropy.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's not about chasing dollars or fame," he said last
spring. "I'm not a high-profile guy, nor am I some wild party animal.
I'm a nobody, really. Just a humble surfer who's had a few
girlfriends." He doesn't have to work--his investments provide an
annual $55,000 income. But over the years he has dabbled in real
estate, played the stock market and started a number of small
businesses, including a surf accessories company.</TE>
<TE>   A former surfing companion who asked not to be identified says he
was not surprised by Luster's arrest. He ran around with a crowd of
"chicks who are into sex and drugs," the surfer says. In this beach
crowd, explained Luster's defense investigator, Bill Pavelic, "sex is
nothing more than entertainment for a few hours."</TE>
<TE>   There were other ways in which Luster didn't fit the Factor mold.
"In a sense, Andrew isn't really a Factor," says Fred Basten,
coauthor of "Max Factor's Hollywood Glamour, Movies, Make-up." Based
on Luster's lineage, Basten notes that Luster "doesn't have
[Factor's] name or his blood."</TE>
<TE>   Luster's mother, Elizabeth, was adopted by Freda Factor, the
oldest daughter of Max Faktor Sr., a wig maker for the imperial
family who fled Russia in 1902 and smuggled his family aboard a ship
bound for America, where his name was misspelled as Factor at Ellis
Island. In 1909 they settled in California, where Factor specialized
in theatrical makeup for screen legends such as Joan Crawford and
Lana Turner. He later expanded the company into a multimillion-dollar
international cosmetics firm. Factor died in 1938, and in 1973 the
family sold the company to Norton Simon Inc. for $480 million--it is
now controlled by Procter &amp; Gamble--and the proceeds have been passed
down through four generations in trust funds.</TE>
<TE>   Luster's father, a psychiatrist, died from emphysema-related
surgery when Luster was 9, leaving his mother to raise him and his
younger sister. He has two children, ages 8 and 11, by a former
girlfriend who brings them for weekend visits.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Luster met Carey Doe at O'Malley's sometime after 1 a.m. on
that Saturday in July 2000. By then, according to court documents,
she had consumed three beers, two Long Island iced teas and a
Cosmopolitan. Like many her age, Carey, a third-year UCSB student,
had experimented with drugs. She had taken Ecstasy and smoked
marijuana three times prior to that night, she told police. She said
she sometimes got so drunk that she vomited.</TE>
<TE>   Carey told police that she felt strange after dancing with Luster.
She later suggested to friends that perhaps she had been given a
spiked cup of water at O'Malley's, because she does not remember
agreeing to leave with Luster or that she and her friend David got
into Luster's green Toyota Forerunner and headed back to his house in
Mussel Shoals.</TE>
<TE>   According to various accounts, it was after 2 a.m. when the group
arrived at Luster's house. The beach was dark except for flickering
lights from an oil rig up the coast. Carey later told police that she
walked onto the pier, took off her dress, handed her money and ID
card to Luster, and jumped into the surf.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, she swam back to shore and climbed out,
shivering in only her thong underwear. One of the men helped her out
(accounts differ about which man) and they went back to Luster's
house, where she took a shower. Luster got in with her and they had
sex. Again, accounts differ. Was it consensual, as Luster maintains,
or was Carey so out of it that she was in no condition to give
consent? Luster took several photos of her in his living room that
night and Luster's defense team claims those photos were taken
sometime after she took a shower. One of those images is expected to
become pivotal evidence in Luster's defense. It shows Carey fully
dressed and smiling.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Luster drove Carey and her friend David back to her
apartment near Santa Barbara on Saturday morning, she claims Luster
had raped her two more times. Before they parted, she told police,
she gave him her telephone number.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a strong cultural bias against women who get drunk and,
say, rip off their clothes in the middle of the street," says
Porrata. "It's not a pretty picture and predatory men hide behind
that bias. Women who party like the boys and drink and take drugs
voluntarily complicate these cases because their behavior fuzzies the
issue of consent, but it still doesn't mean they give their consent."</TE>
<TE>   Carey went to the police the following Monday to report that she'd
been raped by Luster. A series of tests at a local hospital found no
trace of drugs in her system, according to Luster's defense team. But
details of her account convinced detectives that she'd been drugged
with GHB, although the defense claims that none was found in searches
of Luster's home and vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Without proof of toxicity "prosecutors take another road and try
to find other victims to weave a tapestry of stories," says Deputy
Dist. Atty. Stone. In the Spitzer twins case, the prosecution urged
other victims to come forward in news articles, "and 23 women came
out of the woodwork," Stone says.</TE>
<TE>   Even when other alleged victims come forward, drug-aided rape
cases can still be "hard sells to juries because jurors look for
inconsistencies in the women's statements," says jury consultant Lara
Giese. Giese worked on the John Gordon Jones case, a high-profile GHB
criminal case that was tried in Long Beach and ended in an acquittal
on all 30 counts of drugging and raping nine women. (In July, Jones
was ordered to pay $5.3 million in civil damages to one of his
accusers. One of his defense lawyers, Richard Sherman, is co-counsel
on Luster's defense team.)</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed "the limousine rapist," Jones, a successful computer
company owner, frequented Hollywood nightclubs, where he met women
and took them back to his house in a limousine. As in the Luster
case, some of the women who accused Jones of drugging and raping them
had dated him in the past, which, says Det. Alvarado, "is always a
complicating factor. In the Jones case, some of the victims had
issues; they were party girls."</TE>
<TE>   As jury expert Giese knows, jurors tend to care less about a
victim who has an alternative lifestyle, and it also didn't help that
no GHB was found in Jones' possession. "The gold-digger theme came
through," Giese says, "because some of the witnesses' accounts may
not have been completely true." For example, some of the women
testified that they'd been locked in Jones' various bedrooms and then
raped, but jurors doubted their credibility when they went to his
house and saw no locks on the doors.</TE>
<TE>   "Women can end up jeopardizing their own cases and hurting the
credibility of cases--and women--that are real," Giese says.</TE>
<TE>   Adds Alvarado: "We always proceed from the position that the woman
is telling the truth, but sometimes the evidence doesn't hold up.
Some women use elaborate fabrications for various reasons. The last
thing I want to do is hurt an actual victim more, but I also don't
want to put a rape arrest on an innocent man."</TE>
<TE>   In Luster's case, the defense is counting on one witness in
particular, Carey Doe, to create reasonable doubt in jurors' minds.
When Bill Pavelic, who retired as an LAPD detective after 19 years,
joined Luster's defense team, he first concentrated his investigative
efforts on Carey, "because without her there is no case."</TE>
<TE>   After Luster was arrested, new details emerged that cast doubt on
Carey's initial story, particularly her claim of having been
kidnapped and drugged. Luster told detectives that on the drive back
to his house, he saw Carey perform oral sex on her friend David in
the back seat of his car. Detectives went back to the UCSB student
and asked if this were true. She denied having sex of any sort with
David.</TE>
<TE>   Initially reluctant to share details, David eventually told
detectives his own version of events. He said he had memory gaps that
night, but that Carey "may have" performed oral sex on him. When
pressed further, David recalled that Carey lifted her dress,
straddled his lap and that intercourse "probably" happened.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they could not talk about details of the case
because of the gag order, but tests they conducted on DNA samples,
including semen found on Carey's clothing, raised even more questions
about what happened. The tests showed that one semen sample tested
positive for Luster, another for David, and a third for an as-yet
unidentified person whom Pavelic believes was Luster's friend who
accompanied him for their night on the town.</TE>
<TE>   "We will show that over the course of 72 hours, Carey had sex with
at least three men," Pavelic says. "So why would she just single out
Luster? There is only one answer. She did it hoping to get his
money."</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Wold, the lead prosecutor in Luster's case, argued against
having the third semen sample tested because, as he said during a
court hearing: "It's irrelevant. This is not a case about
identification. We know who did this."</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear what connection, if any, those tests had on the
prosecution's decision just before Luster's June 2001 preliminary
hearing not to pursue the kidnapping and drugging charges stemming
from the events at O'Malley's involving Carey Doe. He still faces
rape charges in the Carey Doe case, and drugging and rape charges
involving the other two women, both of whom have filed
multimillion-dollar civil suits alleging severe emotional distress.
An attorney for one of the plaintiffs says nothing is expected to
happen on those cases until the criminal cases are concluded. When
contacted by telephone, one of Luster's accusers declined to comment
and Carey did not respond to a message left for her with co-workers.
The Times was unable to locate the third woman.</TE>
<TE>   The most relevant issue, says Trinka Porrata, is an understanding
of the issue of consent. "It doesn't matter if a woman has consensual
sex with 10 guys on the football team but not the 11th," she says.
"It still doesn't mean sex [with the 11th guy] was consensual. Even
prostitutes get raped."</TE>
<TE>   Luster's defense strategy of attacking Carey's behavior comes as
no surprise to women's-rights advocates. "In these cases, the burden
of proof is still on the woman instead of the man," says Patricia
Bellasalma, executive vice president of the Los Angeles chapter of
the National Organization for Women and a civil rights attorney.
"Sexual assault laws now say that a woman's past can't be used at
trial, but lawyers still find ways to get it in. Another problem is
that the public still operates on the old idea that if a woman didn't
go to a bar and drink, she wouldn't get into trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are banking on the two sexually explicit videotapes to
help win a conviction. "He can't get around these videotapes," Wold
said in a court document.</TE>
<TE>   Suggesting that prosecutors don't intend to use all of the 16
seized videotapes during the trial, Pavelic says, "You have to ask
yourself why." He concludes: "The other tapes establish that women
knew they were being taped."</TE>
<TE>   The tapes--edited versions of two have been shown in court but
never to the public--allegedly show two of Luster's former
girlfriends drugged and in various sexual acts. At Luster's
preliminary hearing, the women testified that they had no memory of
the taping or of having given their consent for sex. Luster's defense
maintains that both women are motivated by shame and greed.</TE>
<TE>   As the battle between Ventura County prosecutors and Luster's
defense lawyers intensifies in the days leading up to trial, the case
has refocused attention on a number of basic ideas. "Women need to be
more aware that these drugs are out there," Alvarado cautions, "and
if they think they were sexually assaulted, they need to get a urine
sample immediately." On a broader level, Bellasalma believes that
instances of drug-aided sexual assault will not decline "until the
culture accepts that women, and not the public domain, have ownership
of their bodies."</TE>
<TE>   As for Andrew Luster, he sat quietly at the counsel table during a
pretrial hearing in September, occasionally swiveling in his chair to
smile at people who had come to lend support. He appeared noticeably
older and heavier than he had at his preliminary hearing in June
2001. As usual, his mother sat in the front row and shook her head
whenever prosecutor Wold said something about her son that she didn't
like.</TE>
<TE>   Outside in the hallway, some longtime courtroom observers began to
make their bets, while others declined, knowing the outcome of this
case is too close to call.</TE>

<HD>Under the Bubbles</HD>
<DH>There's More to Blanc de Blancs than Fizz--and
Understanding What You're Tasting Could Improve Your Holiday Menu
Planning</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMIE PURVIANCE</AU>
<BD>Chef and cookbook author Jamie Purviance last wrote
about sea salts for the magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To choose a sparkling wine for my wedding, I agonized over which
bottle of bubbly would best flatter the foods on the menu and impress
my new in-laws. I chose a California sparkling wine that seemed to
meet all my criteria for flavor and aroma, but the problem (if you
can really call it a problem) was that in the midst of the party,
with all the reveling in reunions, speeches and dancing, I never
really noticed the nuances of the wine, and I suspect that few of the
guests did either. On red-letter days, which might include job
promotions and World Series victories, cold sparkling wine is more
often a state of mind than a state of taste. It's just fun.</LD>
<LD>   Particularly at this time of the year, when bubbly wines flow more
freely than at any other, it's worthwhile to look for their
occasionally hidden identities, which make these sparkling wines
food-friendly. According to Karen MacNeil, chair of wine studies at
the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone, the Champenois get
awfully irritated when Americans drink their Champagnes primarily for
the fizz. "Taste the wine under the bubbles," the French insist,
suggesting that the wine's effervescence can be a distraction from
the more elegant characteristics developed in a rigorously
complicated winemaking process.</LD>
<TE>   Take, for example, a blanc de blancs. Literally white wine from
white grapes, blanc de blancs is made entirely from chardonnay, the
white grape America knows best. However, unlike a still chardonnay, a
blanc de blancs is a blend, or cuvee, of more than 30 base wines,
sometimes more than 100. Each base wine is a separately fermented
still wine with a unique history that reveals itself in distinct
flavors, aromas and textures. By combining so many wines with so many
characteristics, sparkling wine producers can develop far more
complexity than you'll find in most still white wines. That
complexity is the key to the wine's ability to match up to foods as
robust as a tomato-based pasta or risotto.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason a blanc de blancs is better suited to food pairing
is that a still chardonnay's creamy texture and oak-barrel flavors
can throw a wet blanket over a dish's nuances, but thankfully the
chardonnay in a good sparkling wine is much higher in acid, as the
grapes are picked before they fully ripen. The sharp acidity acts as
a critical counterpoint to rich dairy foods such as cheese, eggs and
butter. This is just one reason that a sparkling wine is a top choice
for brunch.</TE>
<TE>   A blanc de blancs is also a more reliable choice because good
sparkling wine producers draw from many more base wines, including
wines from previous vintages. Making a nonvintage sparkling wine, a
producer can incorporate whatever reserve wines are required to
maintain the "house style," which is really a sense of timelessness
that doesn't depend on the vagaries of a particular year's weather,
as still wines do. That degree of consistency makes food and wine
pairing more predictable. If you loved a glass of Schramsberg's blanc
de blancs with seared scallops last year, chances are good that you
will love the combination again next year, assuming the scallop
recipe remains as consistent as the wine.</TE>
<TE>   In the broad range of sparkling wine styles, a blanc de blancs is
near the lightest end, with delicate finesse. The standard black-tie
accompaniments--including caviar, smoked salmon and oysters--make
perfectly delicious combinations, but it's not necessary to confine
yourself to swanky foods. They work well because they're salty, and
there are many delicately flavored recipes with noticeable saltiness
that will soften a sparkler's characteristic acidity a bit and let
the wine show through (can you hear the Champenois cheering now?). I
especially like a blanc de blancs with sushi for the way the acidity
tempers the little burn of wasabi, and the way the wine's complexity
prolongs the clean fish flavors. My final recommendation is almost
anything fried, and here the payoff is mostly textural--that is,
crispy with bubbly. The delicate textures dance together with equal
energy like no other combination I know. I guess that the Champenois
wouldn't approve of me favoring the fizz in this case. Maybe it's
just the American in me.</TE>

<DH>Jeremy Scott Left Paris at the Height of His Popularity to
Be L.A.'s Designer. But Does the City Share His Vision?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEREMY ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeremy Scott's "lifestyle pod" sits parked in the alley adjacent to
the 29-year-old fashion designer's east Melrose studio. Near the
pod--that's Scott-speak for his black 2002 Jeep Liberty, the first
automobile he's ever owned--a man in a cowboy hat sells spiced corn
from a cart. A woman loudly scolds a misbehaving dog. Across the
road, portable toilets stand sentry in front of dirt mounds and metal
fencing.</LD>
<LD>   For this, Scott left Paris, where he was even recognized by
cabdrivers?</LD>
<LD>   "L.A. is an inspiring, inspirational, magical city," says the
Kansas City-born and New York City-schooled clothier, his words as
unrestrained as his semiannual outre women's clothing collections.
"It's like no other place. It's a fantasy world. It's like dreamland.
It's a paradise on earth." In other words, anything goes here, and
Jeremy Scott likes it that way.</LD>
<TE>   Scott, who is known for his avant-garde women's clothing, is
sitting on a small couch in a back corner of his narrow white-walled
studio, which has concrete floors and exposed wood ceiling beams. He
curls one of his white, unlaced Nike Air Force high-top basketball
sneakers up under his opposite leg. He wears silver jogging pants,
white sport socks, a gray T-shirt and a white martial arts jacket. He
hasn't been exercising.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's handiwork is equally ironic. Having shown 10 largely
unconventional collections in Paris, he gained an international
reputation for his wild imagination and for the spectacular
theatrical elements of his runway shows, which he often concluded by
yelling "vive l'avant-garde!"</TE>
<TE>   One of Scott's recent collections of women's clothing paid homage
to skyscrapers. Another season's exhibition was based on game shows,
complete with household items as prop prizes and fake cash scattered
to the crowd. While he has a solid following, he's also been knocked
by the fashion press for a lack of consistency, and his clothes have
been panned for being impractical--quite a feat in the anything-goes
realm of haute couture.</TE>
<TE>   So now he's arrived in a city where leading executives can
legitimately pass large portions of their careers pondering, say, the
size of a giant robot or the color of a sea monster's scales. Sounds
like prime Scott turf.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is such a gorgeous city for fashion and people really love
fashion here. . . ." Scott says. "Oh, it's the most futuristic city
in the United States, and maybe even the world."</TE>
<TE>   Scott isn't the first designer to answer Southern California's
siren call. Bob Mackie, James Galanos and Richard Tyler, to name a
few, have made their names as L.A. designers. Perhaps the most
memorable was Austria native Rudi Gernreich, who fled the Nazis for
L.A. in 1938, and went on to invent the "monokini," a topless bathing
suit made famous in the '60s by model Peggy Moffit. (Like Gernreich
before him, Scott draws inspiration from Moffit. The two were
introduced several years ago at a dinner party given in Scott's honor
by hair-care impresario Vidal Sassoon.)</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Gernreich, Scott--whom even the fickle French embraced and
who was the only American designer to be included in the Louvre's
2002 Couture Superstar exhibition--wasn't forced out of Europe. He
split voluntarily while still in his preternaturally early prime.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago at the Pacific Design Center, Scott made his L.A.
debut, presenting a Spring 2001 collection reminiscent of the
nighttime television soap opera "Dynasty."</TE>
<TE>   Rita Watnick, owner of the prominent Beverly Hills vintage
boutique Lily Et Cie, was in the crowd that night. She's become such
a Scott supporter that Rose Apodaca-Jones, the West Coast bureau
chief for Women's Wear Daily, calls Watnick the designer's "fairy
godmother."</TE>
<TE>   Watnick invited Scott back to L.A. to work with her on a charity
event, this time putting him up at L'Ermitage and renting him a
convertible.</TE>
<TE>   When it came time for Scott to return to Paris after that second
stay, the then-expat bawled.</TE>
<TE>   "He drove away from my store, and he had to come back and say
'bye' again," Watnick says. "He was crying, crying, crying, crying.
[It was] really cute."</TE>
<TE>   Scott adds, "I just was insane. I was crying at the airport. I was
like a baby. I didn't want to leave because it felt so right."</TE>
<TE>   Back in France, Scott pondered his status as an independent
designer, wondering in part where he should work and live. He'd been
offered jobs in established fashion houses but turned them down.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I'm not in this blown-out company with eyeglasses in every
airport, I don't have to [cede control]," Scott says. "My goal is to
forward my vision of creativity to popular, mainstream culture."</TE>
<TE>   Toward that end, Scott hopes to break through another high-fashion
barrier--working with the runway crowd while also doing entertainment
industry costume design.</TE>
<TE>   He's off to a decent start, having scored the gig costuming
Madonna's latest major music video, for the James Bond film "Die
Another Day." Earlier this year, he was selected to costume models
for the Andy Warhol Retrospective opening night gala at L.A.'s Museum
of Contemporary Art. Scott also participated in the Otis College of
Art and Design's mentoring program for junior and senior students,
for which he asked his senior students to design an outfit from two
different time periods. "Getting Scott to participate was just the
most miraculous thing on earth," says Rosemary Brantley, founding
chair of the Otis School of Fashion Design.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's also designed looks for musical acts, including the
performance art band Fischerspooner and the randy rapper Peaches.
Contemporary and filmmaker Harmony Korine has asked the designer to
costume and art-direct his next movie, which is about nuns, and to
co-write and co-direct the picture following that.</TE>
<TE>   "I have tons of goals," Scott says. "I want to win an Oscar."</TE>
<TE>   But even Scott's staunchest supporters acknowledge that in the
long run, it isn't easy to please both Hollywood producers and the
fashion elite.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very hard," boutique owner Watnick says. "And I
don't think anybody has ever succeeded at it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, if Scott fails, it won't be from a lack of connections.</TE>
<TE>   He remains acquainted with Bjork, for whom he designed a surreal
white leather "angel" dress with diaphanous fan-like wings affixed
from sleeves to hips. His mentor in Paris was Karl Lagerfeld, who
remains a close friend. He calls model Devon Aoki "my muse" and keeps
a stylized photograph taken by Lagerfeld of himself and Aoki up on
his studio wall. And Sassoon adds, "The more great designers we have
here the better. I'm very happy that he decided to come."</TE>
<TE>   On a chilly Saturday night last month, Scott showed his spring
2003 collection--which made its debut in September at New York
fashion week--in Little Toyko at MOCA's Geffen Contemporary.
Outdoors, a large turnout and a poorly organized check-in scrum left
dozens of would-be attendees stranded,
peasants-at-the-castle-gate-style, on the wrong side of a lowered
museum garage door. Nearby, a security guard told invited guests to
halt or face arrest for trespassing.</TE>
<TE>   Indoors, though, on Scott's runway and among the 300-some admitted
designers, stylists and others, all went smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   The works that Scott presented, including hand-painted silk
dresses, metallic microdresses and revealing suede beachwear never
intended to be worn in water, had received mediocre reviews when they
debuted in late September as part of New York City's Fashion Week.
But unlike his cool welcome back east, L.A.'s fashion cognoscenti
seemed to get the joke.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Scott's settling in here, he's absorbing and
incorporating fashion ideas culled from the sun, sand and sea. His
current collection has coral and shell shapes and those showy
swimsuits built for sunning--a local phenomenon perhaps misunderstood
by East Coast critics, who dip in more placid waters.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the MOCA event, the clothes were shipped to Asia--his
biggest market--for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Back in his studio, Scott's been spending time with his growing
library of art, photography and architecture books. He's also
studying up on West Coast fashion history and continues to pursue his
interest in science fiction and futurism, making frequent trips
downtown to ogle the Bradbury Building and recall his favorite movie,
"Blade Runner."</TE>
<TE>   Scott's fixated on far lesser-known landmarks as well, such as
Bristol Farms in West Hollywood--and for reasons that have nothing to
do with how fresh the produce is.</TE>
<TE>   "You go in there and you're seeing major looks at the grocery
store," Scott says. "People are really done to the nines. I love it.
It's sick."</TE>
<TE>   The man whose work desk brims with a 3-foot-tall fiberglass bust
of himself wearing a thick chain with a dangling pistol emblem and
who just finished creating a limited-edition series of Adidas
sneakers featuring a pattern of his mug on faux currency clearly
isn't worried about being labeled over-the-top. Scott and L.A. are a
natural fit.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A.'s about money and excess and sunlight and sunshine," he
says. "And it's not a shameless place to display wealth. It isn't
that way in lots of other places."</TE>

<DH>It's Not Just Retro. It's the Way Things Are.</DH>

<LD>To some style-setters, the vintage craze might be, well, old hat. But
for Nathan Marsak, retro is a way of life--from his car to his tooth
powder. As for his clothes, everything in a sizable room Marsak uses
as a personal closet dates from about 1880 to 1970, with a heavy
concentration of items from the 1930s. His wardrobe? Well, that would
be 60-plus suits, 40 or so pairs of shoes, several dozen hats and
about 1,500 ties.</LD>
<LD>   "I think new clothing would itch or something," says the
33-year-old Highland Park resident. "I don't even know what it feels
like."</LD>
<LD>   Marsak's case of what he terms RCD, or "Retro Cognitive Disorder,"
isn't limited to threads. He and his wife, Nigel Cox, who also has
advanced symptoms of the disorder, live in a 1907 house that they are
painstakingly restoring, drive a '49 Packard and use rotary phones.
Marsak, a writer, also favors fountain pens, old postage stamps and
1940s boot black, which he uses on a newish pair of steel-toed work
boots. Until his supply ran out recently, he brushed his teeth with
Colgate Tooth Powder. Never mind that the stuff has an arguably
dangerous level of aluminum. "I do take it to an absurd extreme,"
says Marsak. "It's a lot of upkeep, but it's rewarding. It's what I
have to do. [Just like] some people really need to go to sports
games."</LD>
<TE>   As to the source of his passion, Marsak offers: "I come from a
long line of crazy people." But some of the credit (or blame) would
seem traceable to Marsak himself. Let's face it, not every 7-year-old
with nutty forebears decides to be Edgar Allan Poe for Halloween.</TE>
<TE>   "It may have started because I always wore hand-me-downs,"
theorizes Marsak, the youngest of three children. "I was the only kid
in 1980 who looked like I was torn out of a Sears catalog from 1971.
I was wearing corduroy bell bottoms and Hang Ten shirts when all the
other kids had Nikes and 'Star Wars' T-shirts." At 14, he started
buying suits. "Thrift store shopping in the early '80s was a gold
mine, a nonstop festival of zip-up jackets from the '50s and '60s,"
he recalls. "I really wanted to look like an early 1960s mortician."</TE>
<TE>   Then Marsak went Victorian. "I was wearing frock coats and top
hats." These days, his favorite suit is a greenish-gray three-piece,
double-breasted, belt-back number from 1935 with a shirt reminiscent
of the Art Deco days of Bullocks Wilshire or Alexander &amp; Oviatt, the
long-departed downtown haberdashery.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just making my meaningless little life amusing to myself," he
says. "There is a special feeling when you're in a '40s suit driving
down Figueroa in your '40s Packard. People wave and shout, 'What year
is your car?' I don't even notice them."</TE>

<LD>Roof gardens can seem exotic, their sky-high scenes best suited to
tall, space-deprived cities like New York. Yet for those of us living
in apartments in Los Angeles, or hilltop houses with vertical lots,
or houses built out to the edge of a lot, the choice may be simple:
You garden on your balcony or you don't garden at all.</LD>
<LD>   On the rooftops pictured here, trees bear fruit, water flows and
vines flower. There is even a small turf lawn where people lie and
count stars. Added lights create outdoor spots for dinner; shade
cloth screens the afternoon sun. If the space is there, use it.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, any structure must be strong enough to bear the weight
of soil-filled pots, trellises, people and furniture, so it's wise to
consult an engineer before you start. Knowing where load-bearing
beams are will help you place your containers appropriately. Using
light soil (for example, half-compost, half-perlite) in fiberglass
pots will reduce the weight. If you live in a condo or apartment
building, you'll probably need to show plans to the housing board or
management. (No one wants a roof collapse or flooded neighbor.)</LD>
<TE>   When you go to the nursery, choose sturdy, drought-tolerant plants
that can take exposed, windy conditions. Place plants to accentuate
pleasant views, block grim ones and, together with safety railings,
create an edge that evokes security, not vertigo. Don't overcrowd.
Remember, you'll have to lug everything--plants, containers and
soil--upstairs and then maintain order, watering, clipping and
feeding, on a regular basis. But the rewards are many. In place of a
hot tar beach, you'll have a cool garden in the air.</TE>

<TE>   Buddha's balcony</TE>
<TE>   Black bamboo, red flax and a giant Buddha head enclose this
Beverly Hills balcony, which adjoins a condo with Asian-style
interiors. The London-based film-director owner wanted a quiet garden
he could use daily but leave at a moment's notice. ''Keep it
simple,'' he told L.A. landscape designer Paul Robbins, who extended
the Asian theme outdoors with bamboo fencing, woven-resin chairs and
a fountain, made from an antique rice-grinding wheel by Thomas Schoos
Design of West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   After consulting an architect for a structural assessment, Robbins
went to Asian Ceramics in Pasadena for brown-glazed pots--"the
biggest ones we could get in the lift and through the door,'' he
says. He arranged these on the periphery of the 18-by-20-foot deck.
Building his plant palette around the tones and textures of the black
bamboo, he added red fountain grass, equisetum, carex and papyrus,
all of which rasp and rustle in the wind. To blot out an apartment
building across the street, he trained summer-blooming pandorea vines
on willow hoops along one fence. But he left the view open to the
northeast, to take in borrowed local palms and eucalyptus and the
distant line of the Hollywood Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Pots are drip-watered every other day during the hot months and
fed monthly with an organic mix of blood and bonemeal. ''You have to
feed pots more than you would plants in the ground since you water
more and the food washes away,'' he says. "But plants get very big
very fast up here.''</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Garden Suite</TE>
<TE>   When garden designers Pamela Berstler and Alex Stevens of
L.A.-based Flower to the People expanded their West L.A. house eight
years ago, they intended to cap their new ground-floor bedroom and
kitchen with a second-story master suite. But the project dragged and
their funds dwindled, and they decided instead to recoup some lost
outdoor ground by turning that master into a roof garden.
Eight-hundred feet square, with a covered dining room, a porch swing
and a bubbling pot-pond full of goldfish, the terrace triples the
couple's indoor entertaining space. ''It's totally changed how we
live in our house,'' says Berstler. She and her husband Stevens so
love the deck that they designed many of its furnishings, and now
market them through their company, Pamalex Effects.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, the two have played with the deck's layout and
plantings, moving furniture as they observe where party guests
gather, and experimenting with vines, shrubs and trees to enhance
their enclosure. Potted ficus, dodonaea and stephanotis vines block
phone wires and neighbors' roofs. Grouped containers--spilling
succulents and gazanias--define seating spots. Low-voltage lights
make the garden friendly at night, and shade cloth on the overhead
trellis blocks 80% of the noon sun. Heavier elements, such as trees,
are distributed in corners, where structural beams are, but drainage
is the bigger issue. ''If we had designed this initially as outdoor
space, we would have put in more drains,'' says Berstler. ''After a
major rain, we have to come up and sweep, or the terrace turns into a
swimming pool.''</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A lofty lawn</TE>
<TE>   The vision of a lawn for lounging inspired this Santa Monica condo
deck, designed by Berstler and Stevens for a film
producer/actor/director. Beginning with an empty 14-by-14-foot space
off a third-floor media room, they built a frame, roughly the size of
a queen-size bed, out of yellow cedar and ironwood, placed it over an
existing drain and laid in a floor of perforated pressed-concrete
board. On top of that went a weed barrier and then, to enhance
drainage, an inch-and-a-half of pea gravel, an equivalent layer of
coarse sand and a 2-inch soil-and-compost mix. An automatic
turf-irrigation system waters sparingly twice a week, and the grass
gets a weekly haircut with hedge shears. Three times a year, when her
client is out of town, Berstler feeds the bed with fish emulsion.
''People lie on it,'' she explains. ''You don't want to add
chemicals.''</TE>
<TE>   Oriented toward a distant ocean view, the bed is screened from the
street below with removable steel trellises draped with bougainvillea
and cape honeysuckle. A ''headboard'' planter holds kumquats, which
can be plucked and eaten from a prone position, and nearby, a
podocarpus tree shades a dining table. ''I'm always out here when I'm
home,'' says the owner, a part-time New Yorker. ''I've had picnics on
the bed and I've even slept out here all night.''</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   City lights</TE>
<TE>   Like a ship heading downtown, this Hollywood Hills roof commands a
view from the ocean to Griffith Park. When the blinking night
arrives, the owners can watch traffic on Sunset Boulevard become a
stream of gold while a strand of fiber-optic light comes alive along
the deck's rim. As it shifts through a programmed display of
colors--white, yellow, green, blue, electric pink--a second
fiber-optic beam pulses at the center of a fountain, which in turn
bubbles up through a glass-topped table poised above the view.</TE>
<TE>   Created by landscape architect Pamela Palmer of the Venice-based
firm Artecho, this 2,000-square-foot ''sky garden'' provides the
largest outdoor living space for a three-story hilltop house. Sherman
Oaks architectural designer Peymon Kooklanfar of Kook &amp; Assoc. laid
the groundwork, designing the wood deck and steel railings during a
house remodel in the late '90s. To Palmer, hired in 2000, the railed
platform evoked a ship's prow, and she enhanced the aquatic illusion
by planting the 3-foot-wide ledge beyond its rails with a froth of
blue-gray westringia and Senecio mandraliscae.</TE>
<TE>   Challenged to capitalize on the view while making the open deck
more private, she added Greenscreen trellises in selected spots along
the edge and planted them with trumpet vines. Within these, to
delineate gathering areas and suggest the layered depths of a garden,
she designed three sizes of planter box, had them custom made in
lightweight fiberglass by Fiberglass Fabricators in Orange and filled
them with tall dodonaea, sprawling loropetalum and smoky-blue
euphorbia.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, along with two custom-designed table fountains, she
brought in citrus trees in wheeled containers, which can be rolled
beside chairs for instant shade. Outdoor lighting expert John Gannon
of San Pedro-based Gannon Electric Light conceived the subtle
fiber-optic lights to add magic without stealing from the view.</TE>

<HD>Levi Strauss and the Price We Pay</HD>
<DH>The Cost of Apparel Has Declined for a Quarter Century,
Helping Make Americans the Best-Clothed People in History. All Is
Right in the Word, Unless You Ask How It Happened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED DICKEY</AU>
<BD>Fred Dickey last wrote for the magazine about prison
rape.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brenda Pope sits at the kitchen table and stares sadly at her
work-hardened hands. Inside one wrist is the purple welt of a
surgical scar that runs halfway to her elbow. Twenty years at a
sewing machine gave her the carpal tunnel injury. That scar and
$15,000 in severance is what she has to show for those years. Near
the edge of Blue Ridge, Ga., the Levi Strauss plant where she once
worked now sits empty, a glass-and-brick shell overlooking acres of
empty parking lot. Bored security guards stroll the grounds to
protect what no one any longer values. A factory dies an honorable
death when it falls apart from hard work and time. This one was cut
down in full productivity.</LD>
<LD>   For a half-century, this apparel sewing plant was a wellspring
that pumped life into the town. The workday was switched on by the
gathering of 400 workers, mainly women, chattering as they punched
the clock. Hour after hour, they created a cadence from clacking
sewing machines, generating wealth for their bosses and modest wages
for themselves.</LD>
<TE>   The plant was shut in June, one of six Levi plant closures that
left the San Francisco apparel giant with just a tiny U.S.
manufacturing presence--a plant in San Antonio, Texas, devoted to
quick turn-around products that have deadlines overseas plants can't
meet. At the end, the Blue Ridge workers stood in small knots, tossed
about by a maelstrom of emotions. Some were in shock. Some muttered
that they would never again wear Levi clothing. Most worried about
the future. Brenda Pope was one of those.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Ridge is a town of nearly 2,000 in north Georgia, just south
of the Tennessee and North Carolina lines. Blue-green hills rise
sharply a few miles south of town and provide a gateway to the
Appalachians, gaining loveliness as they gain height. Residents are
mostly Scots-Irish, descendants of the hard-edged people who broke
the Cherokees, and then broke the soil. Today, many here, like Pope,
are working poor.</TE>
<TE>   Measured against what most of us feel we need, the 44-year-old
single mother asked little. She wanted to live among familiar pines
and trustworthy people, create value with her hands and raise her
child in the old ways. She did not think she needed a college degree
to do these things. She was right, until she made the mistake of
pricing herself out of the labor market--a feat accomplished by
earning $14 per hour putting zippers in Levi's famous blue jeans.</TE>
<TE>   When Levi moved Pope's job out of the country, she became one of
hundreds of thousands of American workers who have lost jobs during
the past six decades as the garment industry seeks lower wages in
underdeveloped countries. In that context, the decision to close the
Blue Ridge plant was hardly unusual. Levi had clung to its last U.S.
manufacturing plants long after most of its competitors had fled.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when a company like Levi, with a reputation for good
management and strong relations with employees, finally turns out the
lights in the United States, it might be an occasion to measure the
human toll, here and abroad, of the flight of garment industry
jobs--and to remember that it's happening so that American consumers,
who buy more clothing than any people in history, can get a shirt for
$20 instead of $25.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, 1.2 million Americans were employed in apparel
manufacturing. By 2001, that figure had fallen to 566,000. In the
same time span, the U.S. population almost doubled. Jobs went out of
the country, and finished products came in. In 1989, the U.S.
imported $24.5 billion in apparel; in 2001, $63.8 billion. In the
last quarter of 2001, 83% of all apparel sold in this country was
imported.</TE>
<TE>   The migration of these jobs is seen as the natural result of
globalization, the economic process that melds the technology and
finance of the developed world with the vast labor pool of the
underdeveloped. This trend is especially attractive to the apparel
industry because, basically, all it needs are sewing machines and
low-paid workers.</TE>
<TE>   Globalization has crept up so stealthily that it wasn't generally
recognized until full grown. It accelerated around the end of World
War II, when the industrialized world was reshuffling, says Charles
Derber of Boston College, author of "Corporation Nation," a book that
views corporate power through a populist filter. As American
corporations witnessed the economic rise of Japan and other foreign
competition, they started looking for an edge, and they found it in
cheap labor abroad. "They realized that more money could be made by
using those billions of workers as producers as well as consumers,"
Derber says.</TE>
<TE>   Many corporate executives view this sea of cheap labor as an
attractive profit center, or, if they find it predatory and
distasteful, as a competitive necessity. Economists say globalization
will be the platform for Third World countries to build their own
free-market economies, and that low wages are part of the growth
process.</TE>
<TE>   Michael M. Weinstein, a New York economist who has studied the
job-flight phenomenon, says of the plight of Pope and others like
her: "Any policy you give me for saving that person's job is going to
threaten somebody else's. I don't mean to sound callous, but there
are plenty of low-end jobs [in the U.S.] that need filling. If we bar
low-cost goods from abroad, it would be the poorest among us who
depend on these products who would be punished most harshly."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, it is the poor who would suffer most if, say,
clothing at Wal-Mart suddenly cost more. Weinstein adds, "We don't
need garment jobs to have full employment for Americans. It's a good
thing when these jobs go to the worst-off people in the world. I
regard it as unconscionable to clamp down on sweatshops that are
making these people's lives better than they would otherwise be."</TE>
<TE>   The search for the worst-off people in the world means the garment
industry is looking for a target that's always moving. As soon as
wages rise in one country, work can be moved to another. Charles
Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee in New York City,
calls this long-distance shuffle a "race to the bottom" of the wage
scale. The committee has a list of hourly apparel wages in Third
World countries, including: Guatemala, 37 cents; China, 28 cents;
Nicaragua, 23 cents; Bangladesh, 13 to 20 cents.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to low wages, manufacturers in many countries benefit
from child labor and long workdays as well as the absence of health
plans, environmental protections, workplace safety standards and
efforts to organize workers. In fairness, some U.S. apparel makers,
Levi among them, have taken steps to police conditions in plants
overseas, and to pay fairly. But those efforts are far from
universal.</TE>
<TE>   "American companies make showcase visits to these offshore plants,
but they always get the VIP tour and are maneuvered to talk only to
employees who have been coached for such occasions," says Kernaghan,
an old-style, angry labor activist who knows his enemy, doesn't trust
him and never gets too close.</TE>
<TE>   Levi Strauss &amp; Co. has taken on the role of dressing people to
look sexy and cool, but the company began in 1853 as a wholesale dry
goods business. Its first garments were work pants made of
canvas-type material to serve workers in dust-clogged mines and on
docks. As the years passed, Levi grew, its sales reaching $4.3
billion by fiscal 2001, and the company expanded its manufacturing to
other parts of the country. Levi became a paragon of corporate
beneficence. It provided benefits, fair wages and even helped
employees earn diplomas. It donated ball fields to the small towns
where it operated. Even unions liked the company.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Woody was a management employee at the Blue Ridge factory. She
remembered when Bob Haas, a descendant of the founders and Levi's
president and CEO, visited the plant about a decade ago. Workers
planted a tree in his behalf to show their affection. It was a
touching moment of mutual fidelity.</TE>
<TE>   Company fortunes faltered in the mid-'90s in the face of
competition from goods made overseas. When the time came for Levi to
close Blue Ridge, Haas had become chairman of the board, replaced as
president and CEO by Philip A. Marineau, who was recruited from
Pepsi-Cola to "turn this thing around."</TE>
<TE>   To reduce labor costs, Marineau had to break the paternal mold
that the Haas family had formed over many years. Journalist Karl
Schoenberger wrote in his 2001 book, "Levi's Children," that "Levi
Strauss is one of the very few major companies in the apparel
industry that has not been indelibly branded a scoundrel by human
rights critics. . . . It has the distinction of trying harder and far
longer than any other multinational corporation to do the right
thing."</TE>
<TE>   The new boss was tough enough to say to the workers: Sorry, but
this is about money.</TE>
<TE>   Marineau doesn't do fireside chats. He's all business. Asked why
the company closed Blue Ridge and turned out faithful workers, he
says: "To be competitive in the marketplace required us to lower our
cost of goods. It required us to go offshore. Apparel prices have
gone down for the last 25 years, and it continues unabated, driven by
an aging population that wants to spend less on clothing."</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the six plant closures, Levi said it was becoming a
"marketing company," and that future production in almost all cases
would be by contract manufacturers. That would take place in 50
countries, including Mexico, Bangladesh and China.</TE>
<TE>   To author Derber, that explanation is code language that actually
says: We're going for the cheap labor, and we don't want the dirty
hands of ownership that go with sweatshops. The goal is to have
"plausible deniability" about labor conditions. He said that foreign
plant owners are rarely steeped in touchy-feely management techniques
and operate with the backing of powerful politicians who can impede
whatever government oversight might technically be on the books.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why Levi contracts out its manufacturing, Marineau gives
several competitive business reasons, then he pauses and
acknowledges, "The apparel industry is chasing low-cost labor."</TE>
<TE>   For Levi, the advantages became obvious this year. In the third
quarter, which ended Aug. 25, Levi's sales were up 3.5%, its first
increase since 1996. Five weeks ago came an agreement to sell a new
line of lower-priced jeans through the vast Wal-Mart Stores chain.
Marineau predicted that the new Levi Strauss Signature brand would
generate hundreds of millions of dollars in sales each year--all from
garments made abroad.</TE>
<TE>   To its credit, Levi has been a pioneer overseas, creating a
corporate code of standards for every manufacturer with which it
contracts. Levi also pays inspectors to enforce the standards. Writer
Schoenberger acknowledges Levi's effort, but says, "How well they
have managed to enforce that code is probably very debatable," given
the serpentine twists in Third World countries.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, enforcing the codes of various private groups and
international organizations is not achievable, Weinstein says. Groups
such as the World Trade Organization, NAFTA and the International
Labor Organization have no real leverage to control American
multinationals because the United States has such vast economic
clout. "Say the Philippines has a beef against American trade
practices," he says. "What are they going to do, refuse to do
business with the U.S.?"</TE>
<TE>   That segues into a main Kernaghan point. The labor activist says
that the most effective step against globalization abuses would be to
pass legislation in the United States prohibiting the entry of goods
from countries whose products fall short of acceptable standards. In
other words, the U.S. would be saying to multinationals operating
offshore: We can't stop you from making clothing in sweatshops, but
you can't sell it here.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the power to determine what comes into our country," says
Jay Mazur, retired president of Unite, the union that traditionally
represented most American apparel workers. "We say cocaine can't come
into our country; so we can say that goods produced in sweatshops
can't either."</TE>
<TE>   Kernaghan and his allies (human rights advocates and some labor
unions, but thus far not many politicians) believe that such
legislation would eliminate the common explanation companies give for
abusing humane standards--we do it because our competitors do.
Opponents argue that the law would send clothing prices higher in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Collis was the president of the Unite local in Blue Ridge.
When Levi announced the closure, there was little the union could do
except negotiate severances. Collis, 31, is luckier than most. She's
bright, young and ambitious. She has a supportive husband and plans
to use her $11,000 severance to pursue an accounting degree. She may
be one of the few for whom being laid off will be a blessing.</TE>
<TE>   Collis, though, knows her former co-workers do not need severance
packages. They need employment. She is upset--at the union she
believes gave up on the Blue Ridge plant, at Levi for turning its
back on loyal workers, and even at Mexico, which is where she and
other workers heard their jobs are going.</TE>
<TE>   So in the race to the bottom, is Mexico the next stop?</TE>
<TE>   In the sand-blown Mexican border town of Piedras Negras, two hours
southwest of San Antonio, a mother of five prays that Collis'
prediction comes true. It won't. The woman, who did not want her name
used for fear of reprisal at work, lives in a two-bedroom crumbly
stucco house so narrow it seems you can't open the back door without
closing the front. The tiny front room is filled with rows of family
photos, religious symbols and a snowy old TV that is always on and
seemingly never watched. Even the furniture coverings are threadbare.
At the moment, the room is festive and crowded as several relatives
have gathered for the momentous occasion of this interview. Her
children are almost awkwardly polite and listen as attentively as if
this were pay-per-view.</TE>
<TE>   She says she earns about $55 a week sewing cloth bags at the local
factory. Two years ago, she earned twice that much working on Levi
jeans at a large factory, but it closed and the jobs moved to Central
America and the Far East. The closure left her and her husband, whose
own job is spotty, with far more bills than money.</TE>
<TE>   Today, she worries that she will fall behind on her sewing quota.
She is not as nimble as she once was. She holds her bladder until
lunch or quitting time to avoid slowing down. She knows that 100
people would line up for her job, and would gladly take the latest
starting wage of about $35 per week. There is no job security and no
one to appeal to because the union in her plant is as answerable to
the company as she is.</TE>
<TE>   This year's economic downturn in the U.S. has hurt the Mexican
apparel industry, but most jobs were lost because companies moved to
countries with lower wages, says Julia Quinonez, head of CFO (Border
Committee of Women Workers) in Piedras Negras. She says that 4,500
apparel jobs have disappeared from that small city in the past three
years and that wages have gone from $4 per hour 10 years ago to an
average of 80 cents today. Quinonez says the jobs are going abroad,
or farther south in Mexico, where wages are about 60% of those along
the border and labor protections are rarely enforced.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Tovar, president of Solunet-InfoMex, an economic research
company in El Paso, Texas, says that 68 textile plants closed in
Mexico last year, depressing conditions in the border area, including
the poor woman's family in Piedras Negras. Prices are so high, they
cross the border to buy beans and rice, and occasionally--very
occasionally--some chicken or cheap beef. When told that some
housekeepers in L.A. earn her weekly income by lunchtime, the
mother's eyes widen and she says, "How can that be?"</TE>
<TE>   Her ambition is to gather her family and slip across the border,
where she wishes to find out if such stories can be true for her.
Asked how she would do that, she shrugs. "I'll just use a guest pass
to cross over, then not return."</TE>
<TE>   She has little curiosity about the companies responsible for her
wages. She would, however, like to ask them--whoever they are--"Why
is it that you can't pay me enough so I can live decently? So that I
can feed my family chicken even once in a while?"</TE>
<TE>   She is not an economist and she has never heard of globalization,
but her instincts tell her that the job that allows her barely to
survive is soon going the way of thousands of other jobs in her town.
In the race to the bottom, it turns out, Mexico is in the rearview
mirror.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Rahman would consider that Mexican family blessed with
riches, because $1 an hour far exceeds any amount the 19-year-old
garment factory worker would dare dream of when asleep in her
family's shack. Her closer-to-earth ambition is to double her income
to about 30 cents per hour. That would mean chicken in her rice maybe
once a week.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman lives with and is the main support for her parents and two
young relatives in the vast slums of Dhaka, Bangladesh. All she can
afford is one room, and during the rainy season, the family collects
the bedding and moves to the one dry corner so that they don't get
soaked. She has never gone to school, ridden a bicycle or seen a
movie. Her wages allow the eating of chicken maybe once every two
months. She describes the neighborhood: "Ninety to 100 people in my
neighborhood all use one water pump, one outhouse and one stove with
four burners."</TE>
<TE>   Rahman has worked in garment factories since she was 10, the last
three years at the Shah Makhdum factory. She says she often works
from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m. seven days a week, with a day off maybe
once a month. Her take-home pay is the equivalent of 14 cents per
hour. The factory is hot, and the drinking water is dirty. If she
gets sick and can't work, she doesn't get paid. If she gets sick very
often, she'll be unpaid permanently.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman is waif-like--about 5 feet and 110 pounds--and has round
eyes that float in her still-young brown skin. Everything about her
begs for a protective arm around her, but that draws her no slack on
the job: "If we fail to meet [production quota], the supervisors yell
and curse at us. They curse our parents and call them filthy [names].
Sometimes they slap us."</TE>
<TE>   One product that Rahman worked on most recently was for the Walt
Disney Co. of Burbank, a contract purchaser from the factory. It's a
Winnie the Pooh shirt that retails for $17.99. Asked to guess the
shirt's retail price in the U.S., Rahman says, "About 50 or 100
taka," which is 86 cents to $1.72.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman had never heard of Disney, Disneyland or Mickey Mouse until
a labor dispute broke at the plant recently over working conditions.
The Disney licensee promptly suspended its work there--forcing Rahman
and others to reverse field. They are now trying to have the
manufacturing resume.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman says she hopes to work at the plant until she is old.</TE>
<TE>   And what's old?</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Disney company, Gary Foster, says of Rahman's
allegations about the Shah Makhdum plant: "We have visited that plant
12 separate times, and everything she says about it is untrue." Asked
if Disney garments are still being produced there, he says, "As far
as we know, there is no Disney licensee making products in that
plant." Asked why he isn't certain, he says, "That is the licensee's
decision."</TE>
<TE>   Bangladesh is a desperately poor nation of 134 million that needs
a lot of Lisa Rahmans to staff its 3,300 sewing factories. The
country provides garments for most major American apparel
manufacturers, including Levi. In 2000, Bangladesh companies made 924
million garments for U.S. companies with a wholesale customs value of
$2.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, however, the Bangladesh minister of commerce complained
that wages in other countries, such as China, were undercutting
laborers in his nation. That is not surprising to labor activist
Kernaghan. He says that fickle multinationals have found new low-wage
destinations, and China heads the list.</TE>
<TE>   Richard H. Dekmejian, an international relations expert at USC,
makes a judgment on where globalization is leading us: "Third World
countries have no choice but to let these companies operate so their
teeming populations don't die of hunger. People take what crumbs
they're able to catch. But the overall impact of globalization is
that the rich get richer and the poor starve. That will eventually
lead to an explosion. It's inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   Union veteran Mazur is more sanguine. "The world sees us as the
great economic engine, and they just want it to work for them, too.
By giving the world fair wages for labor, we would create social
stability, and make peace more possible."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting at the table with Brenda Pope is her 11-year-old son,
Brian. He's a chubby, pleasant boy, well-mannered in a "yes sir, no
ma'am" way that sounds almost quaint to a Southern California ear.
Brian was found to have lupus a year ago, and he has red splotches on
his face and arms caused by the disease, which can kill if it's not
carefully--and expensively--controlled. He can do nothing about his
face, but he reflexively tries to cover his sleeveless arms. When I
ask if he would mind playing outside for a while, he complies without
a murmur. When he's gone, I ask his mother how he's doing.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of kids give him a hard time. They call him pizza face and
stuff like that. It just breaks my heart. He once asked me, 'Momma,
are you ashamed of how I look?' When the doctor told him about the
lupus, the only question he had was, 'Am I gonna die?' "</TE>
<TE>   Pope has been pushed around by life, but some of it was her own
doing, and she knows it; to wit: the two men she married, including
Brian's father, whom she divorced 10 years ago. The look on her face
as she discusses them tells me I could write the familiar script. "I
dropped out of school; figured I could live on love. I was stupid, I
reckon," she says with a hollow laugh.</TE>
<TE>   When Pope switches attention to her lost job, she says she
anticipates drudging trips to the welfare and unemployment offices,
and endless job hunts that promise little for her limited skills. She
could flip burgers for about $6 an hour--if they'd hire a middle-aged
woman with a G.E.D. and an old-fashioned work ethic--but that
wouldn't be enough to save her house and pay the costs of treating
her son's sickness. "I'd dig ditches if the pay's good," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Helen M. Lewis, who also lives near Blue Ridge, is an author and
authority on the familiar Appalachian struggle to make a living. She
doesn't know Pope, but she has known thousands in the same situation.
"I'm sorry to say it, but she'll probably lose her house and move
onto her parents' property with a trailer home. It's an old pattern.
There are millions of people in this country like her who want to be
productive workers and who are content to live marginally
middle-class lives; instead, they become dependent on society because
large corporations tromp on them chasing more profits from sweatshop
foreign workers."</TE>
<TE>   No one in Blue Ridge, currently, is looking for a woman who has
sewn a couple million zippers into pants. In fact, not many in Blue
Ridge are looking for anyone. The town is rapidly turning into a
mountain resort of antique shops, summer houses for rich Atlantans,
and retirement and convalescent homes. In job-availability shorthand,
that comes down to bedsheets and bedpans serving those low-paying
industries.</TE>
<TE>   The state of Georgia has set up a job agency for the former Levi
workers. State employees eagerly staff job banks, but for far too few
positions. They encourage people who can't type to learn computer
skills, and provide some funding to go back to college or trade
school. That's of marginal value to middle-aged people conditioned to
manual work and who, in any event, can't afford to stop working while
going to school.</TE>
<TE>   Brian is invited back to the kitchen table. He listens to his
mother vent at her ex-employer. Levi was part of the Pope family. Her
mother worked there for 26 years before retiring, and three other
members of her immediate family were let go with Brenda. "Four of us
are out of a job." It's as though another husband took off.</TE>
<TE>   "They said they was going to give us a commemorative denim bag."
She pauses for the irony of that to settle. "Twenty years, and I get
a denim bag made out of the same damn scraps I threw in a basket?"
She laughs. "I just can't wait to get that denim bag." Brian
chuckles, too, but isn't sure why. Asked about his mother's
situation, he responds with a child's heart. He smiles at her proudly
and says he wants to give back his allowance to help out. She hugs
him tightly. As I walk down the driveway, I look back and see Brenda
and Brian Pope standing on the step holding hands.</TE>
<TE>   American consumers are blessed in many ways. As the nation's
standard of living has risen and the cost of clothing has dropped,
homes have grown bigger, as have closets. Shopping for clothes has
become a pastime for millions of people because they can afford to do
it regularly. Thanks to this Levi closure, we can buy, say, five
shirts for $100 instead of four.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of having that fifth shirt? Higher welfare, health-care
and job retraining costs for hard-working people like Brenda Pope,
the shrinking lives of people like Lisa Rahman and the family in
Piedras Negras, and perhaps the explosion forecast by Dekmejian.</TE>
<TE>   It is part of the American character to believe that things will
always get better. However, many poor countries are mired in the
depression that says bad things never change. Both are often right.</TE>
<TE>   On March 25, 1911, 275 young immigrant women who sewed garments
for six bucks a week were about to go home. It was quitting time in
the cluttered Triangle Shirtwaist Company factory in Manhattan. A
fire broke out and spread quickly through clutter on the floor. The
rush to get out turned to panic as they realized they were trapped on
the upper floors, where the doors opened inward. Many leapt onto
pavement from eight stories up. At the end, 146 died. Photographs of
their bodies laid in an orderly line on the sidewalk shocked America.
In response, laws were passed establishing workplace safety
standards. Wage laws eventually followed, decreeing that apparel
workers should not only not die, but their lives should be worth
living.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety years later, on Nov. 25, 2000, a fire broke out on the
fourth floor at the Chowdhury Knitwear factory in Narsingdi,
Bangladesh. It darted across the factory floor and enveloped tables
piled with shirts. A can of solvent exploded into a fireball. Someone
grabbed an extinguisher. It was broken. The 1,250 apparel workers
panicked. Some dashed to the roof, where they were cornered and
jumped to their deaths. Some raced down the stairs to the main exit,
where they discovered the metal gate was locked. As their pounding
went unanswered, others piled up behind them. Fifty-two workers died,
mostly young women and children. The factory was soon back in
production. No new laws were passed and nothing much changed, except
about 50 new faces at the sewing machines.</TE>

<AU>Andrew Rice</AU>
<BD>Andrew Rice last wrote for the magazine about cycles of
budget austerity at Hollywood studios.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most of my Los Angeles friends are wary of Hollywood's influence on
their lives, fearing the distortion of its celebrity and money. My
wife, Lisa, and I feel the same way.</LD>
<LD>   One day the telephone rang. It was a location agent. She said
Spike Jonze wanted to rent our apartment for his new film,
"Adaptation," starring Meryl Streep and Nicolas Cage, which opens
this week. "Adaptation" is twisted and quirky, like Jonze's surprise
hit "Being John Malkovich," in which people slide through a portal to
spy on John Malkovich from the point of view of his own brain.</LD>
<LD>   In "Adaptation," Streep is a writer who lives in a New York
apartment. In real life, Lisa and I live in a big, airy 1930s
Koreatown apartment with high ceilings, hardwood floors and French
doors. If you squint and ignore the palm trees across the street, you
could be in a swanky New York pied-a-terre. Our place offers New York
without leaving 213.</LD>
<TE>   The studio was offering a lot of money--equal to more than a year
of our rent--to use the place for just 14 days. The moviemakers
promised that our personal possessions would be treated like sacred
relics and stored before the place was completely redecorated.
Afterward, the apartment would be returned to our place--original
paint and all.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, it would mean turning over our home to people
we'd never met, which tweaked our vulnerability: We thought about all
the things we hoped nobody would ever see, the secrets, whether dark
or banal, that are somehow reflected in our home. It would also mean
moving into a friend's place for a while.</TE>
<TE>   Despite our misgivings, we agreed. The night before shooting
began, Lisa and I returned to have a look. We turned the key, opened
the door and gasped. It looked stunning. We take pride in our taste
and our belongings, but we now felt like the Beverly Hillbillies.
Every elegant detail was a repudiation of our daily life. The
cream-colored walls were painted chocolate brown and hung with
elegant gold drapes in place of our dusty blinds. An eclectic mix of
modern and antique furniture filled every angle in the place without
making it seem crowded. A Picasso looked great in the corner, and a
dining table was set with white linens and nice china. This was our
home, and it looked a million times better.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa and I are writers. The office in our apartment is typically
messy and spartan. It was now a fantasy writer's office, the kind
every writer longs for and which no one we know has, including the
rich and famous. A Mies van der Rohe chair held down the corner of a
plush rug. The only realistic detail was the desk clutter of
reference texts, bills, legal papers, computer software, notepads,
letters and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of books lined ornate wooden bookshelves. Strange, I
noticed. We owned the same books. My gaze jumped back to the desk.
Oh, no. Mixed in with the prop books and papers were dozens of
personal documents. The business contracts, financial records and
personal correspondence we'd packed away to be safely stored were
scattered everywhere. A more thorough search turned up my baby book,
credit card receipts, papers from my therapist, a family photo album
and our complete set of computer backup discs. We fanned out through
the apartment. More of our books--and lamps and art and bedding.</TE>
<TE>   We'd been Malkoviched.</TE>
<TE>   I showed up on set the next morning to raise hell. Outside, I
found the site rep, the person responsible for safeguarding our
things, and was just starting to lay into him when a woman shuffled
up the sidewalk in slippers and a bathrobe. She turned up my front
steps, looked me right in the eye and said, "Hi."</TE>
<TE>   "Hi," I said back. She looked familiar.</TE>
<TE>   The site rep made the introduction: "Mrs. Streep, this is Andrew.
This is his apartment."</TE>
<TE>   I muttered something about it being great to meet her.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks," she said. "They're calling my scene." She turned up the
staircase.</TE>
<TE>   The last time I watched the Academy Awards, Sean Connery still had
his hair. My usual reaction to seeing a famous person up close is to
marvel at how short they are. But there was something about Meryl
Streep walking into my house in a fuzzy bathrobe and slippers that
let the air out of my anger. I even forgave her right then and there
for "The River Wild," which says something about the distortion field
of celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   The production company paid extra money to help us forgive the use
of our belongings. We took it but, even so, swore that we'd never
rent out our place again.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, two weeks before our baby was due, the makers of
Zima beverages asked if they could rent our place to shoot a
commercial. The money offered would more than cover the medical costs
of delivering the baby. We looked long and hard at our calendar,
counting back the days from the baby's due date, and stayed at a
friend's house near the beach while Zima painted our house pink and
yellow for two days.</TE>
<TE>   This Friday, we'll be standing in line to see "Adaptation,"
waiting like proud parents for our apartment's feature film debut.
Location scouts drop by every couple weeks to check the place out.

<HD>Reviving Amelia</HD>
<DH>Sculptor Ernest Shelton Is Still Navigating for the
Immortal Miss Earhart</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL T. JARVIS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In July, artist Ernest Shelton hopes to douse the torch he has
carried for aviator Amelia Earhart for 34 years.</LD>
<LD>   His strange odyssey began in the 1960s when several women's
groups--the North Hollywood Jaycees (now the Universal City-North
Hollywood Jaycees) and area chapters of Zonta--commissioned a statue
of Earhart, who disappeared over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 while
attempting to circle the globe at the equator.</LD>
<LD>   By way of preparation, he contacted the Earhart family's former
secretary, Margot de Carie. "She had a scrapbook at least a foot
thick," Shelton recalls. "It had pictures of Amelia in casual
settings. She had a kind of unusual way of standing, not posing.
She'd put the weight on one leg and her left knee turned. She looked
taller than she really was. She was thin and her hair was short. She
wore baggy men's clothes and worked on her own planes. I wanted to
keep [the artwork] mysterious. I wanted it to vibrate like it was
ethereal."</LD>
<TE>   Shelton, who studied art at USC, made a plaster mold and waited
during numerous delays, including a change of officers at the
Jaycees. "I had the mold in my backyard for almost two years," he
says. Shelton cast what was to be a temporary Earhart in fiberglass,
and the Jaycees collected about $500 to cover some costs. Shelton
gilded the 8-foot sculpture with gold leaf to make it shine, but from
the beginning he intended for the statue to eventually be cast in
bronze.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, the fiberglass statue was placed in North Hollywood Park
at Tujunga Avenue and Magnolia Boulevard, adjacent to the North
Hollywood (Amelia M. Earhart) branch of the Los Angeles Public
Library. But that's where the project stalled. "The mystery's [gone]
on and on and so has the project," says the sculptor of his beloved
statue. "In my mind, it has never been completed."</TE>
<TE>   Shelton went on to sculpt toys, movie props and art commissions,
including life-size bronzes of Lucille Ball, Jack Benny and Johnny
Carson for the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Plaza in North
Hollywood, and the Our Lady of Angels sculpture in front of St.
Basil's Church on Wilshire Boulevard. Through it all, his temporary
statue stood in the Valley heat that Earhart knew so well.</TE>
<TE>   In the radiant years when she was breaking aviation records and
making it look easy, Earhart lived with her husband, George Putnam,
in Toluca Lake on Valley Spring Lane. She worked a day job as a
telephone operator. In 1932, Earhart was the first woman to make a
transcontinental flight, in a Burbank-built Lockheed Vega. She was a
regular at Lockheed Air Terminal, now the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   As it happens, the statue isn't Shelton's only bond with Earhart.
When she disappeared, he was a child living among aviation
enthusiasts in Kansas. His father and brother flew, and his father,
who worked for a Los Angeles plane factory during WWII, once built a
biplane in the family's garage. "He tied the thing to a tree and blew
oil all over the house," says Shelton, who himself has a pilot's
license.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Shelton was summoned from his Cambria home to patch
cracks in the statue. But a year ago, with the fiberglass
disintegrating, he made an urgent plea to the Universal City-North
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to recast the statue in bronze per his
original intent. The chamber agreed to help, a coalition of
organizations (including the Jaycees, Zonta and the San Fernando
Valley chapter of the women's pilot group the 99s) mobilized a
fund-raising effort, and the statue was moved to Decker Studios, a
North Hollywood fine-art foundry, where Shelton is supervising prep
work. Of a projected $170,000 needed, $72,000 has been secured. If
the balance arrives, Shelton will cast Earhart in bronze at last.
"Every time they dedicate it, it has more plaques."</TE>
<TE>   Today Shelton, 70, is philosophical about Earhart's disappearance.
"There's a different story about every 10 years," he says. "She's
developed into an icon with a mystery. It was a dream project. The
mystery, the aviation, everything was there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Save Amelia Bronzing Project committee hopes to raise the
final $98,000 for the July 24, 2003 rededication, which is the 106th
anniversary of Earhart's birth. For information, call (818) 763-4142.</TE>

<LD>Who would have ever thought? Carwashes, typically known for selling
pine-scented air fresheners and cold drinks, have gone cultural. A
few of the region's more diversified sudhouses are below.</LD>
<LD>   If you're yearning for a frog-topped Indonesian herbal medicine
box or a silver dragon candelabra, look no farther than the Madison
Car Wash. "I wanted to differentiate myself from the other
carwashes," says owner Kal Ammari, who travels with his fashion
designer wife, Nereida, to Indonesia to sweeten the inventory.
Besides offering carwash staples such as leopard-skin steering wheel
grips, greeting cards and belly-button rings, he has carved wood
mirrors and hand-painted masks. "Wait till you see what is coming for
Christmas," says Ammari, who is plotting a cavalcade of bath soaps
and incense.</LD>
<LD>   7617 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bob Bush, owner of Downtown Car Wash, offers his customers a
selection of L.A. Times best-sellers, along with such literary gems
as "Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St. Vincent Millay" and Chris
Santilli's "The Naked Truth About Hedonism II." You also can enjoy
popcorn and coffee or visit the shoeshine stand along with (it seems)
half of the LAPD.</TE>

<TE>   Art and franchise mix like soap and water at the Santa Palm,
currently exhibiting the work of L.A. artist Beau Bradford, whose
Warhol-esque photo silk-screen portraits grace the end of the viewing
hallway. "It's the most high-end carwash in the world," says
Bradford, whose large panels go for $10,000. Who's going to buy a
piece of art at a carwash? "A lot of interior decorators, collectors
and directors drive through," says Bradford, who says the set design
department on Reese Witherspoon's upcoming "Legally Blonde 2: Red,
White and Blonde" approached him regarding a possible commission
after a visit to the Santa Palm. "That wouldn't happen at any other
carwash," he adds.</TE>

<LD>To some ears, the sound of voices exclaiming in Latin may trigger
ugly flashbacks of grammatical traumas past. But it was music to the
ears of Patricia Aste, producer of the PBS documentary "Peter and
Paul and the Christian Revolution," an examination of early
Christianity under the Roman empire.</LD>
<LD>   When Aste and Koval Films needed authentic "walla"
(broadcast-speak for background noise) for ancient Roman crowd
scenes--longshoremen, market vendors, that sort of thing--they knew
where to turn: the L.A. chapter of the North American Institute for
Living Latin Studies, also known as SALVI (Septentrionale Americanum
Latinitatis Vivae Institutum). "We try to be accurate," Aste says
during a break. "We filmed in March in Morocco and we could have
[had] people speaking Arabic, but why?"</LD>
<LD>   Sixteen SALVI members spent four hours recording for Aste in
October in a studio near Universal City in place of their monthly
dinner-and-Latin-conversation get-together. "Make it sound like a
murmur," Aste cued. "Ladies, we need you going to market. Someone say
something low-key about chicken and lemons until we get to the goat."</LD>
<TE>   "I'm a guy," protests Gethin Wied, a 19-year-old Loyola Marymount
student.</TE>
<TE>   "That's OK," Aste replies.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Gollan, a SALVI board member, offers the group some
coaching. "If you want to say John Lennon is dead, that's great, as
long as you say it in Latin."</TE>
<TE>   The ambience is festive despite the grim character motivation
required of thespians enacting some of early Christianity's stickier
moments.  "They're stoning him and dragging him in a tug of war,"
Aste tells the assembled players. "You're not in an air-conditioned
studio," adds associate producer Ellen Mulligan. "You die
beautifully," one SALVI member cheerfully remarks to another.</TE>
<TE>   Created in Los Angeles in 1996 to promote Latin, SALVI is taking
its second walla gig in stride. "It's a great club," says Mulligan.
"They did some walla for a previous series we did. It's really the
sound patterns that we try to get." As for non-Latin exigencies such
as speaking in tongues, Aste has that covered. "For the Pentecost,
we'll have you speak in Latin and then play it backward."</TE>

<KH>Destination: Alaska</KH>
<HD>Winter fun warms up visitors</HD>
<DH>A spirited bachelor auction -- combined with sublime
scenery -- helps December travelers chill out during a sojourn to the
50th state.</DH>

<AU>Camille Cusumano</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Anchorage</DL>
<LD>Last December I stood on the deck of a lodge in Talkeetna, Alaska,
and watched sunrise bleed down the snowy crown of 20,320-foot Mt.
McKinley. I had seen our nation's loftiest peak before, rising
dramatically from the flat tundra but always shrouded in cloud. This
view was rare and awesome, as the sunrise was in concert with the
full moon. I snapped away, joined by a man who exclaimed, "I live
here, and I never get to see McKinley like that."</LD>
<LD>   I was only a visitor, but having enjoyed several summer adventures
throughout the state, I yearned to see this land of sublime beauty in
winter. It was less than 24 hours since I had landed in Anchorage
under clear blue skies and driven the 113 miles to this village at
the edge of Denali National Park. Every notion I harbored of these
northern latitudes hibernating in a lockdown of gloom during the
winter dissipated like a snowflake on my tongue.</LD>
<LD>   I hadn't stopped to consider that Alaska covers five geographic
zones. The sun doesn't rise in parts of the state from Nov. 18
through Jan. 24 -- but only in the far north. Talkeetna and Anchorage
are in the south central zone, with average December temperatures of
20 degrees. The shortest day: five hours and 41 minutes. Though
Anchorage gets about 67 inches snow a year, its climate is moderated
by the Cook Inlet. The airport is seldom closed due to severe
weather.</LD>
<TE>   It was unseasonably cold at 8 below, but there was little wind.
Everything I'd seen, from the peaks of the Alaska Range to the miles
of hoarfrosted birch forest, was intensified through air crystalline
with frozen moisture. Denali (McKinley's indigenous name means "great
one") was my constant beacon on the two-hour drive north. The peak
blushed lavender as sunset approached around 3:45 p.m. In the lengthy
golden afterglow, I arrived in lively Talkeetna, a town of 500
residents that swells with Denali-bound tourists in summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Winter clears 'em out," said Collette Folk, manager of the
Fairview Inn. "We tell 'em it's cold and dreary, they don't plow the
roads, sun doesn't rise and we grow horns and wings," Folk said,
laughing, skilled in the Alaskan style of irony.</TE>
<TE>   The Fairview, whose 80-year history includes introducing Talkeetna
to its first bathtub, was full of animals: bear and wolf skins, moose
and caribou racks, and Dall sheep horns. The animated talk was of the
following day's annual Wilderness Woman Contest and Bachelor Ball and
Auction. They take place the first Saturday each December, a ploy by
the Talkeetna Bachelor Society to attract women. The auction is fun,
benefits local nonprofits and launches a Winterfest that includes a
parade of lights, dances and live theater.</TE>
<TE>   I joined 21 other hardy women in a test of our wild-woman skills.
But the qualifying 100-yard dash over icy snow, carrying two 35-pound
buckets of water, humbled me. Only the four fastest women, of whom I
was not one, competed in the remaining events, from gathering
firewood to shooting "ptarmigan" to serving beer and sandwiches to
actively vegetating bachelors.</TE>
<TE>   I chatted with one of the Bachelor Society's founding members,
46-year-old Robert Petersen, a gold mining engineer known as Grog to
his friends. Clad in rawhide and skins from hat to boots, Grog was
the quintessential frontiersman looking for someone "to live remote
for more than one night." Living in Alaska for 24 years in a cabin
off the grid, he joked about telling outsiders (like me), "Yes, I
have running water -- I'm always running for water."</TE>
<TE>   I enjoyed rediscovering a town I had only breezed through one
summer. I made warmup visits to Nagley's General Store, which has
endured since the 1920s when it was built for trappers and miners,
and to the Talkeetna Historical Society Museum, housed in a 1936 red
schoolhouse with exhibits of the area's frontier days.</TE>
<TE>   The log-cabin homes, some crafted with pegs, scribed logs and
interlocking lap notches, included the 1917 cabin that has been the
popular Roadhouse since 1944, a bunkhouse with home cooking. The
Roadhouse exuded the aroma of its famous rib-sticking breakfasts --
biscuits and gravy, reindeer sausage, tart sourdough hotcakes, yeasty
cinnamon rolls and bursting-with-fruit pies.</TE>
<TE>   I had overlooked eating until late in the day when I ducked into
Cafe Michele and dined heartily on tasty venison stew. The French
restaurant, along with the contemporary Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge
(closed this winter), mark the town's bow toward gentility for
tourism.</TE>
<TE>   Bachelors on the block</TE>
<TE>   The auction's Male Order Catalog revealed 35 eligible men looking
for a woman -- from a "longhaired leaping gnome" to "just a pulse" --
to share their passion for the Alaska wilds. The highest-bidding
women procure one drink and a dance from their bachelors ("anything
else is strictly up to the parties involved"). Past years' events --
the auction started in 1981 -- have resulted in everything from a
12-year marriage (ended in amicable divorce) to a love child, now an
8-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   The auction took place at the brawny VFW hall where eager and
curious women (I was among the latter) claimed their prizes.
Auctioneer Robert Forgit, former weather anchor for KTUV-TV in
Anchorage, brought in $300, the evening's highest bid.</TE>
<TE>   My bachelor, a mellow, bearded 33-year-old on whom I bid $70, was
looking for "one who is going to stay in Alaska." Despite my
transience, he delivered my drink -- two, in fact -- and a dance, as
we joined the revelers who packed the Fairview for the ball. Amid the
bacchanalian atmosphere, we danced with others too, and drifted
apart. My drive back to Anchorage was blessed by the same enchanting
arctic light as the ride up. The city, where half of Alaska's 600,000
population resides, sparkled under its blanket of snow and Christmas
decorations.</TE>
<TE>   I stayed at the Hilton because of its convenient downtown location
and walking distance to many attractions. After the scale of life in
Talkeetna, the hotel seemed big and impersonal, but I came to enjoy
the warmly lighted lobby with its captivating Native Alaskan art,
including a bear shaman carving and sculptures in fossil whalebone
and soapstone. In the lobby's Hooper Bay Cafe, I sipped cappuccino
and watched people come and go, clad in winter skins and furs as
fashionable as any in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Anchorage, a cosmopolitan city, is cradled by the canine-sharp
Chugach Mountains and Cook Inlet. It has an unlikely mix of natural
wonders and culture -- symphony, ballet, opera, theater and museums.</TE>
<TE>   I decided to start with its outdoor pleasures and considered an
outing to Alyeska Resort, south of town, where alpine skiers,
including Olympic medalist Tommy Moe, take on downhill runs from
gentle to double black diamond. I was also tempted by the prospect of
ice fishing, popular on lakes surrounding the city.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the winter lively</TE>
<TE>   In the end, I fell back on my favorite winter sport --
cross-country skiing -- because it was the most accessible, two
blocks from my hotel, on the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail. With rented
equipment, I glided out on the 15-mile scenic path along Cook Inlet's
Turnagain Arm and in minutes was in a bright wintry wilderness spying
an immature eagle in a spruce. A moose browsed among the alders,
heedless of me. I went as far as Earthquake Park, the site where
chunks of shoreline slipped into the inlet, destroying 75 homes in
the 1964 Good Friday earthquake -- a magnitude 9.2. I turned around
when dusk turned the Chugach peaks purple.</TE>
<TE>   On downtown's 5th Avenue, I stopped to buy a hand puppet of
caribou skin and wolf fur for my nephew. The shopkeeper told me to
return in February for Anchorage's Fur Rendezvous. Dating to the
1930s when fur trading was Alaska's second leading industry, the
two-week-long "rondy" offers everything from a Frostbite Footrace to
the Miners &amp; Trappers Ball. And if I stayed on until the first
Saturday in March I could really have fun, watching the downtown
kickoff of the "Last Great Race on Earth" -- the Iditarod Trail Sled
Dog Race, a 1,150-mile run by dogs and humans through the arctic
interior.</TE>
<TE>   A thriving restaurant scene</TE>
<TE>   If Alaskans suffer from winter blues, none crossed my path,
especially not in Anchorage's hip restaurants. The city offers a
surprising array of good eateries, though prices are higher than for
equivalent dishes in the Lower 48. Newer downtown establishments I
enjoyed included the innovative Glacier Brewhouse (try the
wood-roasted duck on soba noodles) and Bear Tooth Theater Pub, with
mostly Mexican dishes. But I gravitated to an old favorite, Simon &amp;
Seaforts, for traditional seafood -- briny steamed clams and buttery
scallops -- with views of Cook Inlet.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning took me past the Aviation Heritage Museum on Lake
Hood, where on past trips I've marveled at the vintage aircraft on
display -- from a 1928 Stearman to a 1960 Iroquois helicopter. I was
reminded why Alaska is called "the flyingest state" in the Union: It
has more pilots and airplanes per capita than any other.</TE>
<TE>   The museum didn't open until noon, so I headed to the new Alaska
Native Heritage Center, which represents the 11 cultural groups that
make up the state's native people, including the Athabascans,
Inupiaq, Aleut, Haida and Tlingit.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Anchorage Museum of Arts and History, with its native
art and depictions of 10,000 years of Alaskan history, a visit any
time of year is de rigueur. In the Alaskan Gallery, a re-created
Athabascan village reminded me that winter was not an optional
adventure for any of the state's Aleuts, Eskimos or Indians. I missed
a local native group's holiday concert in the lobby because I was so
mesmerized by their masks, walrus tusk ornaments and beaded
cormorant-skin garments. But the festive atmosphere lingered in the
air, as it did everywhere in Anchorage. Old-fashioned Christmas
carols poured from radios, and I found myself singing along. After
all, I was closer to the North Pole than I'd ever been at yuletide.</TE>

<HD>Reaching new heights in the Andes</HD>
<DH>After some R&amp;R in a mountain hamlet, an Incan trail takes
trekkers from snowy peaks to rain forest jungle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Glaubitz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Sorata, Bolivia</DL>
<LD>The plan was simple: Drive up and walk down.</LD>
<LD>   It made sense, after all, to use gravity to our advantage,
especially because we were traveling in the oxygen-poor air three
miles above sea level. But after 4 1/2 hours bouncing over
kidney-bruising roads, shoehorned in the back seat of a Jeep with
three others, our legs intertwined like spaghetti, I wondered if we
had made a mistake.</LD>
<LD>   I braced myself with one hand on the seat and one on the roof,
trying, with each jackhammer-like jolt, not to land in my companions'
laps.</LD>
<TE>   The Jeep swayed heavily as we bounced through rocks and dirt. It
was a challenge for my brother-in-law, Kevin Cadle, to keep his hands
on the steering wheel. "Welcome," he said, "to the 95% of roads in
Bolivia that aren't paved."</TE>
<TE>   We had been climbing steadily on dirt roads since leaving La Paz,
the capital, at 12,000 feet. Through dusty rear windows I could see
the snowy peaks of the Cordillera Real range. The tallest stood more
than a mile above our heads in a cloudless cobalt sky. We had timed
our June 2001 visit to take advantage of the winter's clear weather.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin stopped to secure our backpacks, which were lashed to the
roof rack. Happy for a chance to stretch my legs, I jumped out with
Michael Fredette, a stocky 25-year-old from Massachusetts, and David
Tayloe, 27, a clean-cut North Carolinian. Jaime Poyant, 26,
Fredette's childhood friend, climbed out of the front seat. Kevin,
28, Michael and David had taught English throughout Latin America and
Asia and were now stationed in Santa Cruz, an industrial city to the
east of La Paz. They were on a break from a private school in eastern
Bolivia. Jaime had flown to La Paz from the U.S. the day before, as I
had.</TE>
<TE>   I had come here to see what had drawn the teachers to Bolivia -- a
country I never before dreamed of visiting. But a few days immersed
in the country's culture and scenery convinced me that Kevin had
discovered one of the few places on the globe largely untouched by
the modern world.</TE>
<TE>   My California home certainly seemed worlds removed from this pass
at 15,000 feet, where we could look down on the resort town of
Sorata. It hangs at 9,000 feet off the snow-draped massif of Mt.
Illampu, more than 20,000 feet high. Its location makes Sorata an
ideal base for mountain sports, hiking, climbing and backpacking, and
we planned to stay there two days to adjust to the altitude before
setting off on a three-day backpacking trip on the Choro Trail.</TE>
<TE>   We climbed back into the Jeep, and when we crossed the Rio San
Cristobal, it seemed we had stepped back in time.</TE>
<TE>   Narrow cobblestone streets led to a central square, which was
sun-drenched and empty at midday. Across from the church on the
palm-lined plaza, we spotted the Residencial Sorata, a sprawling
former colonial mansion with open verandas overlooking gardens, where
we would stay before our trek. It is among the few lodgings in town.
Airy hallways with wrought-iron railings hung over verdant gardens. I
had to memorize the route between our two rooms, which required
climbing stairs, crossing an atrium, winding along overgrown pathways
and passing through several gates between the whitewashed buildings.
The room I shared with Kevin and Michael had double glass doors that
opened into a large room with mismatched furniture.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the hotel and the others behind to deal with a repair on
the Jeep, I wandered the Plaza Enrique Penaranda. Aymara and Quechua
Indians lined the sidewalks, sitting with their hands folded in front
of displays of fruit, vegetables and wool clothes for sale. I bought
some sweet finger-sized bananas, which I ate like candy.</TE>
<TE>   Sorata gained prominence with rubber and gold, which the Incas
carted off to Peru. In the colonial era, German families capitalized
on the mines, many of which are still working. One German baron
established the Casa Gunther in 1895, now the Residencial Sorata.</TE>
<TE>   There were few shops to browse in, so I wandered the village's
steep streets, climbing above the sea of red tile roofs for an
exceptional view of the terraced hillsides that drop sharply to San
Cristobal. After the diesel-choked thoroughfares of La Paz, Sorata
offered some much-needed tranquillity, and it was perfect preparation
for our hike.</TE>
<TE>   Echoes of Incan footsteps</TE>
<TE>   We chose the Choro Trail, a one-way trek from La Cumbre to
Coroico, because it was the easiest, though we had to backtrack south
to La Paz to reach the trail head. Many other good trails, including
the Lagunas Glacier and Chillata, Camino de Oro and Mapiri, begin in
Sorata. Some are one-way journeys, as ours was. We hired a car to
take us back to the trail head.</TE>
<TE>   Our route would take us from the snowy reaches of the Andes to the
jungle on the edge of the Amazon River basin. The transition is
abrupt. On the 45-mile Choro Trail, we would descend 10,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   At a 15,900-foot pass, still free of snow, we donned our packs.
"This is as high as I've ever been," David said. We stood higher than
any point in the continental U.S., and still we could see much higher
peaks.</TE>
<TE>   A well-worn path sliced down the mountainside and into a deep
canyon. As we walked down the trail, we stepped back to a time when
the Incas ruled. The route was part of the network of highways that
connected the Incan empire from Ecuador to northern Chile. As they
had for centuries, Incas and their descendants, the Quechua, had
crossed and recrossed this path.</TE>
<TE>   The route through the grassy, arid plateau of the puna was well
marked. We followed it for four hours into Achura, a small village
that was only a few stone buildings surrounded by low-lying walls.
Smoke from evening fires drifted in the thin air. The light had grown
dim, obscured by the fog that had come up from the jungle. From here
we would drop into the Yungas, a steamy cloud forest, wet year-round.</TE>
<TE>   We stopped for the evening, carefully crossing a farmer's field to
camp beside the Phajchiri River. As we set up our tents, small
figures appeared in the mist -- local children who stood like
pillars, impervious to the cold. We had put on everything we had,
jackets, pants and wool caps, and still we tried to warm our hands
over the blue flame of the camp stove.</TE>
<TE>   "One night out here I can handle," Kevin said, "but I can't
imagine a whole lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   The refrigerated air got us started early the next morning. As we
trekked below Achura, the stonework of the Incan road appeared,
tightly fitted and level, sweeping down the valley to green and lush
steep slopes. We moved quickly over the path, which in places
stretched to 15 feet, excessively wide for the light traffic we
encountered early on a sunny morning.</TE>
<TE>   The jungle soon overtook the stone trail, and then it nearly
overtook us. Large ferns and banyan trees with roots that snaked in
all directions made the going difficult. Twice, Kevin lost his
footing above a ravine, but a quick grab at the hip-high brush
stopped his fall. Making the trail even slicker was the rain that
began to fall as soon as we dipped below the clouds. A light but
constant stream coursed into my shirt and through the tops of my
boots, and I sloshed with each step.</TE>
<TE>   The path turned to dirt and the dirt to mud as we hiked under a
canopy of trees that filtered out most of the daylight. In the
shadows and underbrush, I spotted tight-fitting stonework structures
that bore the characteristic Incan trapezoidal openings.</TE>
<TE>   I puzzled at their purpose. Maybe they were storehouses to feed
armies along the trail. Maybe they were cisterns for water. At that
moment, I felt as if I were part archeologist, part explorer, part
historian.</TE>
<TE>   That evening, perched on a ledge high above an unnamed valley, we
found a clearing big enough to pitch our three tents. The clouds
brushed the tops of our heads, while the sunlight snagged the rocky
peaks we had just passed. Far below we could hear the roar of the
Huarinilla River, which drains the high Andes and eventually joins
the Amazon.</TE>
<TE>   From the trees came the screech of a flock of parrots. We found
enough dead wood to start a good blaze. In the damp, still air, every
snap of moisture from the burning branches reverberated around our
little alcove.</TE>
<TE>   We sat looking out across the valley. We could not see a single
structure. We were connected to the rest of the world only by the
thread of a muddy path, centuries old.</TE>

<AU>Arthur Frommer</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the mysteries of travel is why so few North Americans visit
South America. You can make the trip there almost without jet lag,
flying north to south. Once there, you encounter a generally friendly
population and pleasant prices. And this year, in two particular
locations, you will find amazingly low rates. Here are the top
bargains in Latin America for the coming winter months:</LD>
<LD>   Rock-bottom Rio: With its economic crisis unresolved and its
currency selling at 3.6 to the U.S. dollar, glamorous Rio de Janeiro
is more of a lure than ever. And a longtime specialist, Marnella
Tours, (866) 993-0033, www.marnellatours.com, offers round-trip air
from Los Angeles or San Francisco on American Airlines, seven nights
at the Trocadero Othon Hotel -- across the street from Copacabana
Beach -- round-trip airport-to-hotel transfers, breakfast daily and a
half-day tour of Corcovado or Sugarloaf for $849. That rate is valid
through April 30, except for holiday periods.</LD>
<TE>   Historic Peru: Marnella Tours also has an inexpensive trip to the
Andes, where you can spend a week for $999 per person. Lima plus
Machu Picchu is what many travelers demand, and Marnella (see above)
offers a well-planned itinerary. You're flown from Los Angeles or San
Francisco on American Airlines to Lima for two nights at the
three-star Faraona Hotel in the Miraflores district. You're then
flown to Cuzco for a four-night stay at El Puma Hotel, during which
you'll receive a half-day tour of Cuzco and nearby ruins, and then
the climax: a full-day excursion to the ruins of Machu Picchu. The
prices are valid today through June 30, except holidays.</TE>
<TE>   Bargain Buenos Aires: It costs less to tango in Argentina this
winter, and Buenos Aires has become a sensational value. A one-week
air-and-land package from LAX to Buenos Aires from Analie Tours,
(800) 811-6027, www.analietours.com, has dropped to $670 as
Argentina's economic problems continue and the Argentine peso -- once
exchanged at par with the dollar -- falls to 3.5 to the dollar.
Everything there is cheaper. From today through Dec. 14, and again
from Jan. 12 to March 31, you're flown round trip to Tango Central
for a six-night stay at the centrally located Lafayette Hotel, with
breakfast daily and two sightseeing tours.</TE>
<TE>   Sultry Santiago, Chile: The summer season here is our winter
(beaches with daytime temperatures in the 90s from December through
mid-March). From today through Dec. 9, and again from Jan. 16 to
March 31, Discover Latin America, (800) 826-4845,
www.discoverlatinamerica.com, charges $927 from Los Angeles for
round-trip air and six nights' accommodation at the boutique-style
Torremayor Hotel downtown. Bonuses include breakfast daily, a
half-day city tour and a separate full-day excursion to the beach
resort of Vina del Mar and the city of Valparaiso.</TE>
<TE>   These four trips provide an excellent introduction to Latin
America. Once you have checked into your hotel, you discover that
everything else -- restaurant meals, in-city transportation, shopping
and entertainment -- is also available at bargain prices. You
couldn't hope for a better short holiday this winter.</TE>

<HD>What goes into the planning of itineraries</HD>

<LD>When vacationers shop for a cruise, some choose their favorite cruise
line or ship, and others look for sailings close to home. But for
many, the itinerary is the most important factor. So how do cruise
lines decide where to send their ships?</LD>
<LD>   It's not as simple as sticking pins in a map and drawing a line to
connect the points. The planning starts 18 months to two years before
the brochures are printed. With such a long lead time, cruise line
planners must gauge where passengers will want to go in two years.
Mimi Weisband, spokeswoman for Crystal Cruises, says that the company
is now planning the schedule for the 2004 world cruise of its new
ship Crystal Serenity.</LD>
<LD>   But sometimes planners guess wrong. Two years ago, Radisson Seven
Seas thought South America would be a popular route for its ship Song
of Flower, but the demand wasn't there, so the ship was taken out of
service.</LD>
<TE>   Several factors can affect itinerary, among them world events,
crime at ports of call, marketing and season.</TE>
<TE>   Events can always force an immediate unplanned change in
itinerary. Several cruise lines canceled calls in Indonesia after the
Bali bombing in October. After the Sept. 11 attacks last year,
Crystal Cruises diverted a ship scheduled to sail through the Suez
Canal to a route around the Cape of Good Hope and along the west
coast of Africa. Carnival redeployed a ship to New Orleans from San
Juan, Puerto Rico, because many passengers were unwilling to fly to
the Puerto Rican port.</TE>
<TE>   Moves to smaller ports were afoot at Carnival before Sept. 11,
said company spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz, because of marketing
needs and new ships. De la Cruz said Carnival had been moving ships
to smaller ports along the East and Gulf coasts before the attacks,
the result of a marketing plan to make it easier for passengers in
less common home ports to take a cruise. The company added Tampa,
Fla., then New Orleans; Galveston, Texas; Charleston, S.C.; and now
Norfolk, Va.; Baltimore; and Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Crime was a factor when Carnival and Holland America decided to
stop calling at St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands this year.
Unrest and an increase in kidnappings of foreign nationals in
Venezuela caused some lines to cancel calls at its capital, Caracas.</TE>
<TE>   Adding a new port of call to an itinerary requires planning. A
stop must have adequate facilities for docking the ship or tenders
and enough shore-side facilities and activities to interest
passengers. The onshore infrastructure must be able to handle
organized shore excursions; restaurants and shops have to be
investigated, and security must be in place.</TE>
<TE>   When you pick up a cruise brochure with its glossy photos, know
that somebody has done a great deal of planning to make your journey
a happy and fulfilling one.</TE>

<HD>An antiques streak through Del Mar's fair</HD>
<DH>Several times a year the seaside town hosts a huge
buying-and-selling event that is a lesson in all things collectible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan James</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Del Mar, Calif.</DL>
<LD>At an antiques fair, there are those who pound their chest after
scoring a magnificent find. And there are those who gnash their teeth
when junk they gave to Goodwill shows up on some dealer's shelf,
spruced and polished, with a price tag that triggers groans of
disbelief.</LD>
<LD>   "Do you remember when we had one of those?" I once said to my
sister, pointing to a Patsy Ann doll that my family gave away when I
was 10. "If we'd kept it, it would be worth $300."</LD>
<LD>   Such exercises in self-torment delight Linda and our mother,
Bobbe. So a few times a year, we all rendezvous at the massive
antiques fair in Del Mar. The event is a tutorial in all things
collectible, and visitors can learn a great deal about distinguishing
family treasures from garage-sale junk.</LD>
<TE>   In July during our last visit, we not only shook our heads at
having gotten rid of Aunt Mabel's scruffy Turkish carpets but also
congratulated ourselves for things we haven't given away. It was a
budget-minded overnighter that combined the bustle of the antiques
fair with the calm natural beauty that is Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was for my mother and me to drive south from the L.A.
area and for Linda to drive north from her home in San Diego. For a
while we weren't sure we could meet as planned because Mother twisted
her ankle. But a San Diego medical supply shop rented us a
wheelchair, and, as it turned out, on the Saturday we arrived at the
show, the two exhibition halls were full of wheelchairs. The wide
aisles between stalls made navigation a breeze.</TE>
<TE>   Three or four times a year, the halls, about the size of two
football fields, are packed with the stalls of more than 400 vendors.
Some sell antiques (by definition, at least 100 years old), some sell
collectibles (newer goods) and others sell food. The result is an
entertaining smorgasbord that includes Art Deco furniture, signed
American Indian pottery, Edwardian diamond jewelry and handmade
tamales. (The 2003 show dates are Jan. 10 to 12, April 18 to 20 and
Nov. 7 to 9. The same company will run a similar event in Costa Mesa,
to be held March 14 to 16 and Oct. 10 to 12.)</TE>
<TE>   One of my favorite features is the appraisal tent. For $5 an
expert will look at any single item and tell you about its history
and value. By the time we arrived at the tent, eager owners were
already unpacking giant Hummel figurines, decorative silver bowls and
cups, historical photographs, a violin, teddy bears and a William and
Mary-style claw-foot chair.</TE>
<TE>   A village of tradesmen</TE>
<TE>   Linda had brought for appraisal three silver-colored mesh evening
bags that belonged to our grandmother. The appraisal organizer
steered antiques expert Erin Hamilton over to our table. Erin, it
turned out, had a collection of Edwardian metal evening bags and was
enthusiastic about Linda's. They were made in the United States
between 1915 and 1925, Erin said, typical for the period.</TE>
<TE>   She went over all three pieces meticulously, pointing out one
bag's clasp, which had a particularly beautiful chased design, as
well as a few tears that would reduce the purses' resale price. "But
they can easily be repaired," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her estimate of their total value: $600. We were stunned.</TE>
<TE>   "Just see J.C. Dumas in the Goldworks Gallery booth," Erin said,
adding that polishing the mesh would boost the bags' value even more.
For that she recommended a different booth.</TE>
<TE>   One might wonder if the appraisers merely steer unwitting
customers into unnecessary repairs and purchases. But the arrangement
here has always seemed like a convenient collection of specialized
tradesmen, not a high-pressure sales trap. Linda decided to have J.C.
fix the mesh tears with a laser solder another time, but she did buy
metal cleaner for $25. It seemed a reasonable investment: Purses
similar to Linda's were selling in some show booths for about $700
apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Simply talking to the experts about fixing up treasures is a joy
in itself. Linda once brought a broken antique butter dish to the
glass expert at the Josette's Antiques booth, where it was restored
and emerged as good as new. Now we're planning to haul down Grandma's
19th century Jacobean Revival dining room chairs to have their backs
restored at the Antiques by Futura booth.</TE>
<TE>   We broke away from the fairgrounds for a late lunch at the Fish
Market Restaurant nearby. While Linda and Mother devoured Dungeness
crab salads, I chose bay scallop and halibut ceviche and smoked
Pacific king salmon -- all fresh and beautifully prepared.</TE>
<TE>   Linda headed home, and Mother and I drove a minute or two up
Camino del Mar to the Del Mar Inn. Lodgings in the area include the
luxury L'Auberge Del Mar Resort and Spa, which finished a $3-million
renovation earlier this year; a Hilton, centrally located by the
racetrack; and a Marriott hotel that opened in January with a
well-reviewed restaurant by acclaimed chef Bradley Ogden.</TE>
<TE>   We chose the Del Mar Inn, part of the Clarion chain, only because
it had proved to be a reasonably priced, surprisingly appealing
discovery on a previous trip to Del Mar. Though still cozy, the inn
had a few problems this time.</TE>
<TE>   Mother and I had been confirmed in a top-floor room with two
double beds and an ocean view ($143 plus tax). We got the two beds
but in a room facing the highway on the far noisier lower floor. Even
after complaining at the front desk, we still didn't get our ocean
view; a clerk said the hotel was full because of a golf tournament
and a wedding, which also made the pool off-limits. (We would face
another difficulty Sunday when the elevator went out, forcing Mother
to hobble down steps on her bad ankle.)</TE>
<TE>   Del Mar: A worldly town</TE>
<TE>   Saturday afternoon I walked into town and wandered galleries in
Del Mar Plaza while Mother rested at the hotel. Travel seemed to be
the big theme: At the Valerie E. Wong Gallery, Michael Seewald's
photographs of glistening Paris, Venice and Greece decorated the
walls. Paintings of far-flung destinations lined Grant Pecoff
Studios. At Esmeralda Books and Coffee, travel tomes climbed the
walls. I thumbed through a fascinating book on Indian interiors,
trying to remember if I had seen any of the same things at the fair.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner was at Sbicca, across the street from L'Auberge Del Mar.
Owners Susan and Dan Sbicca preside over a small, stylish restaurant
with innovative cooking by Susan, the chef. Mother ordered rich
lobster-shrimp bisque and a delicious Bosc pear salad with mixed
greens, spicy walnuts, goat cheese and a plum vinaigrette. My
Mediterranean chicken sausage with linguine, pine nuts, spinach and
sun-dried tomatoes in a light cream sauce was a little bland. But
dessert was wonderful: a gianduia fudge brownie with cappuccino
gelato.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Linda met me for a brisk morning walk along Del Mar's
coastal cliffs. We thought we would have the place to ourselves,
given the early hour. Wrong. Pods of surfers darted like sleek seals
through the waves. Joggers and dog walkers joined parents pushing
baby strollers and Sunday-morning philosophers meditating along the
cliffs.</TE>
<TE>   An ethereal gray fog hung over the whole scene, making it look
like a painting in a gallery from the day before. Surrounded by
clumps of lavender, feathery stands of bamboo waved in the sea
breeze. Despite all the people, there was a lovely sense of quiet --
another reason to return when the antiques show comes back to town.</TE>

<HD>Whale spotting from a dry place</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John McKinney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You don't need to board a boat to see whales. Each winter, hikers
often can spot the state's official marine mammal, the gray whale, a
45-foot-long, 35-ton creature from coastal bluffs.</LD>
<LD>   Its migration from the Bering and Chukchi seas near Alaska to
breeding and birthing waters in Baja California, Mexico, is the
longest of any animal. Gray whales tend to swim farther offshore on
their southbound journey, which usually starts in December, compared
with their northbound return, which usually begins in February.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, plenty of hiking spots in California are good for whale
watching now as well as later in winter. I'll start in the north and
work south:</LD>
<TE>   Redwood National Park: Some of my favorite whale trails are in
this park. The hike along the bluffs from Lagoon Creek south to
Klamath Overlook -- eight miles round trip -- is delightful in any
season and especially dramatic if you spy some whales. The short walk
from Enderts Beach Road to an overlook is another good one.</TE>
<TE>   Information: (707) 464-6101, www.nps.gov/redw.</TE>
<TE>   Point Reyes Lighthouse: One of the Bay Area's best whale-watching
locales is the lighthouse in Point Reyes National Seashore. Take the
1.2-mile round-trip hike to the Lighthouse Visitor Center, open 10
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Thursday through Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Parking is limited, and the area can be crowded on weekends.
Construction occasionally limits access, so call ahead. The road to
the lighthouse also is closed on weekends during peak whale-watching
season, but shuttles are offered.</TE>
<TE>   Information: (415) 464-5100, www.nps.gov/pore.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara: Walk from Stearns Wharf past the yacht harbor and
up the bluffs to Shoreline Park, a grassy strip overlooking the
Pacific. (The hike is 3 1/2 miles round trip.) Whale watching,
picnicking and kite flying are popular here.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara's ninth annual Whale Festival -- with educational
presentations, music and other activities -- is March 29 and 30.</TE>
<TE>   Hikers can take a side trip south to Malibu, where the mile-long
round trip from Zuma Beach to the lookout atop Point Dume is good
viewing spot.</TE>
<TE>   Festival information: (805) 897-3187, www.sbwhalefestival.com.</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro: The Cabrillo Marine Aquarium has coordinated
whale-watching cruises for years. But hikers can see plenty by
touring the museum's tanks and shell collection, then walking three
miles from nearby Cabrillo Beach west along the bluffs to White Point
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Museum information: (310) 548-7562, www.cabrilloaq.org.</TE>
<TE>   Point Loma: At Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego, you can
hike two miles round trip on Bayside Trail and look out to sea from
the enclosed whale-watching station at the end of Point Loma. (The
Point Loma peninsula is south of Mission Bay, east of Coronado.)
Speakers and programs are scheduled for the park's Whale-Watching
Weekend, Jan. 18 and 19, the peak time for viewing here.</TE>

<LD>If you've always dreamed of a Caribbean vacation, it's time to stop
snoozing and pick up the phone.</LD>
<LD>   Some island resorts are cutting rates as much as 35% for the peak
winter season, December through April. Seven-night cruises have been
advertised as low as $399. Next month, giant Pleasant Holidays, best
known for its budget package tours to Hawaii, will storm the beaches
of the Caribbean for the first time, armed with six-day air-hotel
combos from L.A. starting about $700 per person.</LD>
<LD>   What has been viewed, especially by West Coasters, as an expensive
alternative to Mexico and Hawaii is suddenly looking more affordable.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a buyer's market," says Peter C. Yesawich, president of
Yesawich, Pepperdine, Brown &amp; Russell, a marketing firm based in
Orlando, Fla. "Increasingly, for residents of the West Coast, it's a
great value."</TE>
<TE>   Caribbean resorts still aren't going for a song, especially during
the heavily booked holidays. One East Coast hotel executive told me
he began trying in August to trade a ski week in Park City, Utah, for
a Christmas-season timeshare in the Caribbean. He recently threw in
the towel. "It was locked up," he reports.</TE>
<TE>   Holidays aside, Caribbean hotels are discounting for the first
time in peak season, says Richard Kahn, spokesman for the
Barbados-based Caribbean Tourism Organization. In the past, he says,
"you just didn't find discounts after mid-December." The rate-cutting
stems from a decline in visitors. Kahn expects the region to finish
the year with 6% to 9% fewer tourists than in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Chalk that decline up to money woes and fears about foreign lands.
The shaky U.S. economy is discouraging big-ticket trips. Worried
about security, Americans are still reluctant to stray far from home.
(The decrease in American visitors to the U.S. Virgin Islands has
been less than to the Cayman Islands, Jamaica and several other
foreign territories in the region.) Crime and security are issues on
some islands, concerns that two cruise lines cited when they stopped
docking at St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</TE>
<TE>   The Caribbean, with its sybaritic beach resorts, crystal-clear
diving venues and exotic cultures, remains popular nonetheless. It
ranks third, behind Europe and Australia, as the international
destination that Americans would most like to visit, identified by
18% in 2002 -- its highest figure in five years of surveys by
Yesawich's company and Yankelovich Partners.</TE>
<TE>   Although East Coast visitors outnumber those from the West Coast
by about 6 to 1, more than 600,000 Californians went to the Caribbean
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some tips for seeing the region this winter without
plundering your bank account:</TE>
<TE>   Timing is everything: If you want bargains, don't travel during
Christmas season, Presidents Day weekend, spring break and other
holidays.</TE>
<TE>   The cheapest winter deals in the Caribbean are for departures
between now and Dec. 15. The next cheapest are typically in the first
half of January, after New Year's Day. Act quickly on these deals;
some require you to book by Monday. (In fall, when hurricanes are
common, rates are usually even cheaper.)</TE>
<TE>   Try to schedule trip departures for a Tuesday or Wednesday to get
the lowest prices, advises Alice Harmon, an agent with Travel Travel
in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   GoGo Worldwide Vacations has been offering five-night air-hotel
packages at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cayman starting at $1,239 per
person, double occupancy, from Los Angeles, according to Carlson
Wagonlit Travel, a network of more than 1,000 travel agencies. The
booking deadline is Monday for travel Jan. 5 to 31.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon says she recently saw fares of $459 per person, double
occupancy, for outside cabins and $799 for deluxe cabins for a
seven-night Holland America cruise in the western Caribbean leaving
Dec. 8 from Port Canaveral, Fla. The brochure fares were $1,800 and
up. (Air fare was extra.)</TE>
<TE>   Get on board: Caribbean cruises are discounted even more deeply
than resorts.</TE>
<TE>   The main reason for the low fares, Yesawich says, is "an
unprecedented oversupply of cruise cabins," which grew in numbers by
40% from 1999 to 2001 as companies rushed ships off the assembly
line. The glut is especially large in the Caribbean, where many
cruise lines station ships in winter, as opposed to L.A.-Mexico
routes, where a few lines dominate.</TE>
<TE>   Recent offerings include a three-night Bahamas cruise on Norwegian
Cruise Line, departing Feb. 7 from Miami and starting at $279 per
person (from Carlson Wagonlit), and a seven-night western Caribbean
cruise from several U.S. ports on Royal Caribbean starting at $499.
Air is extra. (These deals may no longer be available.)</TE>
<TE>   Book air-and-hotel packages:  Air fares to the Caribbean have
tended to be high, partly because American Airlines has dominated
routes, Kahn says.</TE>
<TE>   From Los Angeles, the only Caribbean destination with regular
nonstop service is Jamaica. Other islands have connecting flights.
Air Jamaica, which flies the LAX-Montego Bay route five times a week,
will boost service to 14 times a week in April. (Delta offers a code
share on these flights.) Flights take 5 1/2 hours, about the same as
to Honolulu. But LAX-Jamaica round-trip nonstops are generally $600
and up, versus about $300 to $600 for Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   A way around this problem is to go on a package that combines air
and hotel. Many such packages from Los Angeles to the Caribbean cost
$1,200 or less per person per week.</TE>
<TE>   Pleasant Holidays, which is reserving now for trips starting Jan.
1 and later, recently advertised six-day Jamaica packages starting at
$709 per person for air and hotel. Its Caribbean packages with
all-inclusive chain resorts such as Sandals and SuperClubs start at
about $1,000. Funjet Vacations and Apple Vacations are among other
discounters with good deals.</TE>
<TE>   Shop around:  "Don't accept the first thing you see," Yesawich
advises, because prices are volatile. Consider using a travel agent.
Although the Internet can be useful, it's helpful to have a human
handle packages.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I enjoyed the Nov. 10 Healthy Traveler column about taking your own
food on airlines ("If Airline Fare Isn't Dishy, Bring Your Own").</LD>
<LD>   I fly back to Philadelphia regularly to see my grandchildren and
leave on early-morning flights. Because I don't eat eggs or pancakes
with sausage -- the usual breakfast fare -- I take a banana and some
cereal. I also take a plastic spoon and bowl (usually a margarine
tub). When the flight attendant asks for my breakfast choice, I
request a carton of milk. Everything goes in the trash when I'm done.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>My beloved grandmother died recently. After contacting several
airlines, the best bereavement or compassion fare I was quoted was
$600 for a round-trip ticket between Burbank and Tampa, Fla. Our
family of four would have had to pay $2,400 just to get there and
back.</LD>
<LD>   As a former travel industry professional, I was often embarrassed
to quote these special fares to clients. The "discount" fares were
calculated at half off the highest unrestricted fares and are
unaffordable for many.</LD>
<LD>   It saddens me to think of the people who are denied the
opportunity to come together when they most need to simply because
the airlines are unwilling to waive the advance-purchase restrictions
on their lowest fares.</LD>

<LD>John McKinney urged visitors to imagine the future of the Kenneth
Hahn State Recreation Area extension in "Bring Your Imagination to
See the Future of Baldwin Hills" (Hiking, Nov. 24). But readers would
get an immediate thrill by visiting the area as soon as possible. The
northerly view from the Baldwin Hills is incomparable in scope and
drama as it includes towns, contours and high-rise clusters from west
to east.</LD>
<LD>   It's a world-class spectacle on a sunny day after a storm has
washed down the whole city and the stark downtown skyscrapers have
the snow-covered Sierra for a backdrop, Mt. Wilson, Baldy and all.</LD>

<LD>Susan Spano's "Her World" article about marking a milestone in her

Nov. 17) really hit home.</LD>
<LD>   My father, 89, died suddenly two weeks before a Panama Canal
cruise he was to take with Mom, her sister and her niece. The cruise
was Dad's dream, so I struggled about whether to go. My practical
side won out.</LD>
<LD>   It was a bittersweet journey. The sense of my father's presence
was strong, especially because of our mutual interest in the history
and construction of this engineering marvel.</LD>
<TE>   Taking a trip after any change offers a wonderful opportunity to
create special memories of a unique time in one's life. Months later
Mom said the trip had been very peaceful and healing for her, and we

<LD>Two cruise ships plagued by outbreaks of a gastrointestinal illness
have been scrubbed down in an effort to stop the bug that has
affected more than 650 passengers.</LD>
<LD>   "We're cleaning everything from Bibles to Scrabble tiles," said
Erik Elvejord, a spokesman for Holland American, whose Amsterdam
reported more than 450 cases of Norwalk virus on its last four
voyages. Norwalk lasts a day or two, causing vomiting, abdominal pain
and diarrhea.</LD>
<LD>   One Amsterdam sailing was canceled. Since Nov. 21, the
1,380-passenger ship has been cleaned three times. At the Travel
section's press time, it was scheduled to sail to the Caribbean
today.</LD>
<TE>   The virus is usually transmitted by contaminated food and water
but increasingly is being spread by person-to-person contact, said
Dave Forney, chief of the Vessel Sanitation Program at the national
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Forney said the CDC had not been able to identify "any single
source of food or water" responsible for the outbreak on the
Amsterdam. Holland America's Elvejord thinks the virus came on board
with the passengers in October.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Cruise Line's Magic, on which more than 200 passengers
complained of a similar virus on a November sailing, also has been
thoroughly scrubbed, said Angela Bliss, a spokeswoman.</TE>

<TE>   The package, including two nights' hotel and taxes, is $349 per
couple, and $50 per child (12 and older) in the same room as parents.
Reservations are required. Contact Carpinteria Valley Chamber of

<TE>   Northwest sets new rules for overweight bags</TE>
<TE>   Plan on traveling lighter on Northwest Airlines starting Dec. 15.
That's when the airline will lower the weight limit for free checked

<TE>   Passengers in all classes on North American, Mexico and Caribbean
flights will be charged $25 for each checked bag between 50 and 70
pounds. Bags of 70 to 100 pounds will be assessed $50 each. (The
current penalty is $80 for bags over 70 pounds.) Bags weighing more
than 100 pounds are not accepted.</TE>
<TE>   In another change, Northwest has expanded self-service check-in,

<HD>Jamaican cliff-top villa a place to Bond</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Beverly Beyette</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Bond didn't sleep there, but he was born there 50 years ago in
the pages of "Casino Royale."</LD>
<LD>   "There" is Goldeneye, the Jamaican cliff-top hideaway of Bond
creator and author Ian Fleming. The recently released film "Die
Another Day" brings 007 back to the big screen, the hero and his
capers having evolved in the decades since Fleming introduced him. So
too has Goldeneye, which has become a resort for those who, like
Fleming's super spy, have a taste for Mont Blanc pens and martinis
well made.</LD>
<LD>   Goldeneye was once a simple beach house so lacking in luxuries and
clinically uncomfortable that Fleming friend Noel Coward referred to
it as "Goldeneye, Nose and Throat."</LD>
<TE>   No longer. Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records who
introduced the world to Bob Marley and reggae and to Irish rock band
U2, bought the property in the '70s, renovated it and opened it as a
high-end resort in the '90s. He has added five rental villas, some of
them named for Bond girls. Prices begin at $595 a day, depending on
season, for a one-bedroom villa in Goldeneye Village. The
three-bedroom main house, which has a private pool, rents for $2,500
to $3,500 a day.</TE>
<TE>   All units have access to a private beach, and prices include
meals, beverages and a 30-minute Jet Ski lesson. Other activities are
tennis, snorkeling, kayaking and a glass-bottom boat trip that leaves
from nearby James Bond Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The resort is near Oracabessa on the north coast, a 30-minute
drive from Ocho Rios. It is part of Blackwell's Island Outpost
collection of boutique hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming bought the property in 1946 and built the simple one-story
house to which he escaped from gloomy English winters.</TE>
<TE>   "He just loved the simplicity of Jamaica, the fact that he could
get away from any social life," Blackwell says. "He was kind of a
loner, and Goldeneye was the place he'd go to get away completely."
After his morning swim, he would tap away on his Imperial Good
Companion typewriter, creating many of his 14 James Bond thrillers at
the rate of 2,000 words a day.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming died in 1964 at the age of 56. His only child and heir,
Casper, committed suicide in 1975, and the property had fallen into
disrepair when Blackwell purchased it.</TE>
<TE>   "When I bought it, I got a machete and started to chop all around
and found some incredible parts of the property that had never been
seen before," he says.</TE>
<TE>   With Balinese-inspired furnishings, ethnic art and bamboo-enclosed
outdoor baths with showers and claw-foot tubs, Goldeneye has been a
getaway destination for rock stars such as Mick Jagger and Hollywood
celebrities -- including the original 007, Sean Connery, and the
reigning 007, Pierce Brosnan.</TE>
<TE>   There are plans to build more cottages, for private ownership, and
a 100-room hotel on the property, which boasts three miles of
waterfront on the Caribbean. Construction is to start in 2003, with a
goal for completion in late 2005.</TE>

<HD>Florida's treasure islands</HD>
<DH>The booty on Sanibel and its sister islets isn't gold but a
trove of pretty seashells, plus sun and simple pleasures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Sanibel Island, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Seen on the beach here: Florida fighting conchs, sand dollars,
tapering lightning whelks, calico scallops, spiky murexes, kitten's
paws, all abundant and free for the taking, assuming the little
critters these shells once housed have moved on.</LD>
<LD>   Shells may be hard to find on other beaches, but they wash ashore
in piles on Sanibel and Captiva, two slender barrier islands
connected by a bridge off the west coast of Florida. The beaches of
these islets, which rank third after the Great Barrier Reef and the
Philippines among great shelling places of the world, catch treasures
from the Gulf of Mexico like a colander cradles spaghetti.</LD>
<LD>   That, in a clamshell, is why I went to Florida last month. It's an
odd destination, perhaps, for a Californian. Easterners,
Midwesterners and even Europeans have long escaped winter here,
basking in the sunshine when it's cold and snowy back home. But I was
surprised to find so much to like besides the weather and shells.</LD>
<TE>   Sanibel is 12 miles long and up to three miles wide; to its
northwest, Captiva is five miles long and never more than half a mile
wide. Together they boast 16 miles of beach lapped by Gulf waters and
bayside coasts fringed in mangrove trees, with their exposed roots
and bushy foliage. Especially on Sanibel, the local government and
residents have worked hard to curb development. High-rises and
fast-food outlets with drive-through windows are banned.</TE>
<TE>   Nature reigns here. Large tracts are given over to preserves,
including the 6,400-acre J.N. "Ding" Darling National Wildlife
Refuge, home of alligators, manatees, dolphins and great flocks of
tropical birds. The colors of the islands are baby pink and blue. The
weather is generally balmy, so a tan is all but assured. Miles of
paved bike paths make it fun and easy to get around. Sunrises and
sunsets are visceral joys.</TE>
<TE>   Basking in steamy heat</TE>
<TE>   The islands, reached in about 30 minutes from Fort Myers by the
three-mile Sanibel Causeway, are so narrow that each has only one
major road. Traffic can be heavy, especially in peak season (January,
February, March), so many visitors get around by boat or bike.</TE>
<TE>   Steamy heat and the thick, rich smell of the sea settled over me
as I drove across the causeway toward South Seas Resort on the north
tip of Captiva. Feeling like a slowly melting ice cube, I checked in
and got a map of the 330-acre luxury resort. It has more than a mile
of Gulf-front beach, a golf course, marina, shopping plaza, swimming
pools, tennis courts and restaurants, all so spread out that you have
to take a motorized trolley to get around. Concrete block condos and
a hotel cluster at the north and south ends of the resort; big white
beach homes, available for rent, are strung out along the road
between.</TE>
<TE>   I stayed in a bayside condo with an abundance of amenities: a
big-screen TV in the master bedroom, a coffee maker and microwave in
the kitchen. The pale woods and wicker, bad seashore prints and
colorful cushions worked hard to seem like decor, but they were a
little too cheap and cheerful for my taste. That's Florida, though.
High style isn't what you come for.</TE>
<TE>   Sea life is. In the marina below my window, I saw my first
manatee, or sea cow, an endangered species. It seemed at first just a
huge, dark shadow in the water. Then its lovably ugly snout appeared
as it slurped flotsam at the surface. It was one of many encounters
with captivating sea creatures.</TE>
<TE>   If finding shells is what you like, morning low tide, before the
crowds arrive, is the time for a constitutional. The beach at South
Seas is a beauty, with easy waves, soft sand and warm water. I found
lots of clams and scallops near the resort's north end, but nothing
unusual. I picked up a heap, learning only later how to be more
discriminating.</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon, I rode a rental bike 10 minutes south to the
village of Captiva, which has several shops and restaurants, a pretty
little seaside church and cemetery and just one general store. I
lunched at the Bubble Room, a temple of Florida kitsch that's
whimsically decorated with flea market-like finds: big stuffed
Santas, toy trains, movie stills. The waiters and waitresses wear
Scout uniforms, and mine also had stuffed devil horns on his head. He
delivered a heavenly sandwich of fried grouper swaddled in crisped-up
pancake batter, and he tried to tempt patrons with such desserts as
red velvet and double chocolate cake, in portions big enough to sink
a dinghy.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere I ate on Sanibel and Captiva I found huge servings and
such comfort foods as chipped beef, cheese steak and chicken wings.
Invariably, TVs were tuned to football, and the bars were crowded and
noisy.</TE>
<TE>   There's something stuck-in-the-'70s and goofy about this state. A
man I met at the Mucky Duck, one of Captiva's best sunset view bars,
said that Florida, with its faulty ballots and alligators in the
backyard, has supplanted California as America's nutty fringe.</TE>
<TE>   In such a place, the strange can seem commonplace, the commonplace
strange and wonderful, as when it rained the next morning, sometimes
so hard I wondered if I should start looking for a hurricane
evacuation route. Instead I sat on my screened-in porch drinking
coffee while palm trees whipped in the wind like go-go dancers.
Afterward, a cold front moved in, bringing fresh air and daytime
highs in the low 80s instead of the 90s. "This is just the kind of
weather we wait for here," said a woman at the reception desk of the
Waterside Inn on Sanibel, where I stayed four nights after checking
out of South Seas. "It's hot enough for you guys and cool enough for
us."</TE>
<TE>   Sandcastles and shell seekers</TE>
<TE>   The Waterside is a small, carefully kept mom-and-pop place with a
two-story motel wing, a little pool, shuffleboard courts and wood
cottages painted sherbet colors. My motel room had two double beds, a
TV, kitchenette and balcony, decorated in a modest, chain motel kind
of way. Best of all, the classic Florida inn sits right on the beach,
where toddlers in sunbonnets build sandcastles and oldsters with
kitchen spatulas and plastic milk jugs hunt for shells.</TE>
<TE>   The beach was freshly glazed with treasures the morning after the
storm, and it seemed as if all the Gulf's fighting conchs had washed
up on my doorstep. I couldn't stop picking up shells. I was totally
absorbed, my body bent in the characteristic "Sanibel stoop."</TE>
<TE>   While I was searching, I met a man looking for his wife. "She's
been gone for hours," he said. "She left without drinking coffee or
taking her meds."</TE>
<TE>   Like gambling, shell collecting is addictive.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking less frequented hunting grounds, I went on a three-hour
shelling cruise with Capt. Jim Burnsed, whose boat is docked at
'Tween Waters Inn on Captiva. Just being out in a boat, zipping
through Redfish Pass, was glorious enough. But when we moored off the
beach at Cayo Costa Island, north of Captiva and Sanibel and
accessible only by boat, I started finding sand dollars and shiny
shells called olives.</TE>
<TE>   Later I visited the Bailey-Mathews Shell Museum on Sanibel, where
a video credits the low water level for the conchological bonanzas.
In the Great Hall of Shells I saw a display on right- and left-
handed shells (a differentiation based on which way they spiral),
19th century sailors' valentines with shell-inlaid hearts and flowers
made by Caribbean women for seafarers to take home to their wives,
and a rare brown-checked junonia shell that was 6 inches long.</TE>
<TE>   When shelling and soaking up the Florida sunshine paled, I sampled
the many other distractions of Sanibel and Captiva, such as biking
through the Ding Darling refuge, established in 1945. Darling, a
conservationist and Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist who died in
1962, was instrumental in keeping the state from selling prime
wildlife habitats to developers.</TE>
<TE>   The refuge's four-mile wildlife drive reminded me of sequences in
"The African Queen." To the left, an alligator lay, log-like, in the
mangrove, and to the right, flocks of white egrets and ibises fed on
a sandbar.</TE>
<TE>   I also joined a guided tour for a sunset kayak trip to rookery
islands in Tarpon Bay, which is part of the refuge. As the sun melted
in a pink puddle, bottlenose dolphins circled the boats and hundreds
of birds flew in to roost on small, mangrove-covered islets. Darkness
fell as we paddled to shore, guided by moonlight.</TE>
<TE>   Between adventures, I shopped in the Sanibel business district
along Periwinkle Way. I bought chocolates in the shape of shells and
a bottle of bleach to rid my cache of its fishy smell. I couldn't
tear myself from She Sells Sea Shells, a shop devoted to shells,
where junonias went for $30 each and an extremely rare, imported Bay
of Bengal cone shell was priced at $250.</TE>
<TE>   Sanibel is all about shells. You can't get away from it. Surely
you don't have to ask what I brought home as a souvenir.</TE>

<LD>After you've collected shells on Sanibel beach, another west Florida
delight awaits: Useppa, tucked like a pearl in an oyster shell
between the mainland and its barrier beach islands.</LD>
<LD>   The 100-acre islet is surrounded by mangroves and by Pine Island
Sound, the body of water that separates the mainland from North
Captiva and Cayo Costa islands. You can't reach Useppa by car. If you
don't have your own boat, there's a launch from Pine Island.</LD>
<LD>   When I think of what makes southwest Florida attractive, I think
of storied, unspoiled Useppa, a virtually private enclave of the
600-member Useppa Island Club. The island is home to about 100
residences, most of them classic, white-frame seaside dwellings with
porches and widow's walks. Only a few Useppans live here year-round.
The rest settle into this old-fashioned, slow-lane place from
Christmas to Easter.</LD>
<TE>   A pink paved path connects their homes to a full range of resort
facilities: a marina, tennis and croquet courts, small pool and hot
tub, and two bars and a restaurant with a formal dining room and a
more relaxed terrace, shaded by a huge banyan.</TE>
<TE>   The Useppa Garden Club has devised a walking tour of the island's
botanical treasures, including orchids and gumbo limbo trees. There's
a history museum where the displays are devoted to tarpon fishing,
the region's native Calusa people and the island's role in the Cuban
missile crisis, when the CIA rented Useppa to prepare volunteers for
the Bay of Pigs invasion.</TE>
<TE>   High-jumping tarpon, which stream through Boca Grande Pass just
west of Useppa, helped turn the island into America's premier
sportfishing resort. In 1912, advertising and real estate tycoon
Barron Collier founded the island's Izaak Walton Club, named for the
co- author of the 17th century fishing classic "The Compleat Angler."</TE>
<TE>   Collier welcomed tarpon hunters to the white, three-story,
neoclassical hotel, now called the Collier Inn. It has seven smashing
rooms decorated to recall a bygone era. I stayed for two nights in
the third-floor Izaak Walton Suite, which features a preserved tarpon
and vintage photos of frocked Victorian fisherwomen. The room also
has a double-size tub with jets, and a little balcony. Rates at the
inn, (239) 283-1061, www.useppa.com, range from $140 to $331 through
Dec. 19 and $176 to $389 Dec. 20 to Jan. 1, including breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't want to stay over, you can take a day trip to the
island by way of Captiva Cruises at South Seas Resort, (239)
472-5300.</TE>

<HD>An appealing fit for the holiday season</HD>
<DH>The makers of 'The Christmas Shoes' wanted to avoid
sentimentality and find humor in an emotional story.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It takes a lot of imagination and finesse to make a holiday movie
during the shank of summer. Case in point, the new CBS Sunday movie
"The Christmas Shoes" was shot in July in Halifax, Nova Scotia. But
viewers will be hard pressed to realize that, since the picturesque
city is snowy and decorated for the holidays, and the actors, Rob
Lowe and Kimberly Williams, are bundled up in winter clothes.</LD>
<LD>   "I am one of these people who are hot all the time," Lowe says,
laughing. "We joke about it on 'The West Wing.' I like [the set] like
a meat locker, so it was extra tough for me."</LD>
<LD>   "The Christmas Shoes" is the second holiday movie in a row for
director Andy Wolk, who made last year's CBS yuletide flick "A Town
Without Christmas." Wolk says this time he knew how to deal with the
snow factor and even the Christmas carol dilemma.</LD>
<TE>   "Every bit of snow is manufactured," Wolk says. "It is a
combination of dry ice, foam, confetti. Now they have the technology
where fire departments will come out and they will help you with
spraying huge amounts of foam. They have little machines they use for
flocking trees."</TE>
<TE>   Because one of the subplots of the film revolves around a school
choir preparing for its holiday concert, Wolk also had to choose just
the right Christmas carols. "You have to find carols that ... are in
the public domain and that people can sing well enough to make it
work and fit into your story line. Some carols are just so overly
religious that you don't want them, and some are too upbeat ... you
find a Christmas carol not just for the value of the carol but for
its symbolic value."</TE>
<TE>   "The Christmas Shoes" is the first television movie that began as
an anonymous story on the Internet and then last year was turned into
a bestselling song by the group New Song. Then it was transformed
into a bestselling book by Donna VanLiere.</TE>
<TE>   In the four-hankie weepy, Lowe plays the Scrooge-esque character,
a workaholic attorney who has grown distant from his wife and preteen
daughter. He finds the true meaning of Christmas when he comes across
a boy (Max Morrow) in a store Christmas Eve. The lad wants to give
his dying mother (Williams) a pair of beautiful Christmas shoes, and
Lowe's character helps him find the embroidered slippers before the
store closes.</TE>
<TE>   Executive producer Craig Anderson says that the key to making a
movie like "Christmas Shoes" work is to avoid sentimentality. "My
opinion is that the audience will be moved by it because they won't
be manipulated by it, so if you play it straight and the emotion is
there, it will pay off in the long run. We wanted to make it a very
character-driven piece, and even though this has elements of that
terrible TV movie style of the disease of the week, we made a very
upfront choice not to go into hospitals."</TE>
<TE>   "I read this movie and it made me cry," Williams says. "I thought
the key to doing this film is not hitting people over the head with
it. I tried to find the humor in it. People even in the most dire
circumstances can find humor."</TE>
<TE>   Lowe says that he worked closely with Wolk and Anderson in making
adjustments and refinements in this character. "When he was angry, I
wanted real uncomfortable anger," says Lowe. "I didn't want
television anger, because real anger is not something that gets
explored as much as it should on television. I kept saying that the
tone I wanted from the marriage was more 'Ordinary People' and less
'Touched by an Angel.' "</TE>
<TE>   The actor, who is leaving "The West Wing" this season, welcomed
the chance to be in a movie that was "proudly un-hip" and "not
playing just to three guys who live on the Upper West Side of New
York. I wanted to do this as a palate cleanser."</TE>
<TE>   "The Christmas Shoes" can be seen Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS. The
network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<HD>Investors Turning Their Back on Treasury Issues</HD>
<DH>Rally in government securities may be over as more are
betting on a recovery and seeking higher returns in stocks and
corporate bonds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Heather Bandur</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A three-year rally in U.S. Treasury securities may have ended Oct. 9,
the same day the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index fell to its lowest
level since 1997, some investors say.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, the S&amp;P 500 has risen 20.5%, while the benchmark
10-year Treasury note has dropped about 4.4% in value.</LD>
<LD>   The Treasury note's yield has climbed from a 44-year low of 3.57%
on Oct. 9 to 4.21% as of Friday. A bond's yield moves inversely to
its price.</LD>
<TE>   "The days of capital appreciation for U.S. Treasuries are probably
over," said Bill Gross, manager of Newport Beach-based Pacific
Investment Management Co.'s Total Return Fund, the world's biggest
bond fund, with $64.5 billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   More investors are betting on an economic recovery in 2003 and are
seeking higher returns in stocks and corporate bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer confidence and retail sales indexes rose in November,
fueling optimism that corporate profits overall will pick up.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the strength in consumer spending, and the rebound in
stocks, would you lock up your money for the next 30 years" at
current Treasury yields? asked Kurt Harrison, co-head of government
bond trading at Banc of America Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Those betting that Treasury yields will continue falling and that
bond prices will keep rising are fighting history.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since 1939 to 1941, Treasuries are on track to
outpace stocks for three consecutive years, according to
Chicago-based research firm Ibbotson Associates.</TE>
<TE>   But not since an even darker period in U.S. economic history --
the years 1929 through 1933 -- have government bonds fared better
than stocks for four years in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of government bonds, more income-seeking institutional
investors now are turning to higher-yielding corporate issues.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers snapped up more than $44 billion of bonds in November from
companies such as Kraft Foods Inc. and IBM Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The demand has helped bring down the "risk premium," the
difference in yields between corporate bonds and Treasuries. Even as
Treasury yields have risen, the yield on an index of 100 corporate
"junk" bonds has tumbled to 10.60% as of Friday from 12.34% on Oct.
10, according to KDP Investment Advisors.</TE>
<TE>   But the spread still makes corporate issues more appealing, many
investors say.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a huge change in investor psychology to once again
take risk," said David Brownlee, who is adding corporate bonds to the
$7 billion he oversees at National Life Investment Management in
Montpelier, Vt. "There's no yield in the Treasury market anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of war with Iraq may keep investors from parting with
Treasury holdings too quickly, economists said. But "once the war is
over, more people will feel confident," said Stephen Stanley, an
economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, many analysts have foreseen an end to the Treasury bond
rally before, only to be proved wrong.</TE>
<TE>   For example, investors dumped Treasuries on April 1, sending the
10-year note's yield to a 10-month high, after a bigger-than-expected
gain in a manufacturing index provoked concern that the Federal
Reserve would start raising interest rates for the first time since
May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But that was a false alarm, as the economy lost more steam in
spring.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, Treasury bond investors are facing increasing
amounts of supply, which will weigh on prices of existing securities,
as a widening federal budget deficit causes the government to sell
more debt.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury last month sold $40 billion in five- and 10-year
notes at its quarterly auctions.</TE>
<TE>   The government recorded a $54-billion budget deficit for October.
An increasing number of economists predict that the deficit will rise
to $200 billion or more in 2003, according to a Bloomberg News
survey.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be easier to pass a fiscal stimulus bill now that the
president and the majority of Congress are on the same side of the
aisle," said Sadakichi Robbins, head of fixed-income trading at Bank
Julius Baer. "The government will have to issue more debt."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, many analysts believe the Fed has done all it can to
help the economy. The central bank cut its benchmark short-term
interest rate to a 41-year low of 1.25% on Nov. 6.</TE>
<TE>   "The end of a bond rally occurs when the price of money can't be
lowered any more," said Pimco's Gross. "The anchor, of course, is the
Fed."</TE>

<LD>For more and more companies trying to manage huge amounts of
information flowing through the global economy, the "in" thing is
contracting out.</LD>
<LD>   Just look at American Express Co. The financial services giant has
turned over the operation of its worldwide information systems to
International Business Machines Corp. Under a $4-billion, seven-year
contract signed in February, IBM is processing American Express'
credit card and banking transactions and is responsible for adjusting
its information needs to changing competitive conditions.</LD>
<LD>   Similarly, banking firm J.P. Morgan Chase is negotiating an
agreement with IBM that could be worth $5 billion over seven years.
IBM would take over Morgan Chase's information resources, along with
thousands of its employees.</LD>
<TE>   In return, the Armonk, N.Y.-based computer concern would be Morgan
Chase's information provider on demand, processing millions of daily
transactions, maintaining all of its accounts and updating the bank's
systems with the latest technology.</TE>
<TE>   The phenomenon of companies handing over their confidential
records and strategic information to others for processing -- with
security safeguards, of course -- reflects not only the continuing
advances of information technology but also the evolution of the
corporation itself.</TE>
<TE>   In place of the centralized corporate organization that prevailed
for a century, the model today is "moving toward confederation,"
management scholar Peter F. Drucker wrote last year in a landmark
article, "Will the Corporation Survive?"</TE>
<TE>   In Drucker's eyes, outsourcing represents a healthy development in
a business world that is more cutthroat than ever and where
executives are required to be extraordinarily nimble, often making
bet-the-company decisions on tight timetables.</TE>
<TE>   Under such conditions, Drucker advised, "the most productive and
most profitable way to organize is to disintegrate."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, by farming out their information technology needs,
companies can concentrate on what they do best, be it manufacturing
or marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Hiring an IT partner, says Rick Belmonte, the Los Angeles-based
head of management consulting for the Gartner Group, allows a
corporation to better "shoulder the strain of processing flows of
money and orders and supplier contracts and hundreds of other
operational details 24 hours a day, 365 days a year in every corner
of the world."</TE>
<TE>   IBM is not alone in tapping this burgeoning market, which offers
an avenue for growth in an otherwise difficult high-technology
environment.</TE>
<TE>   Just a couple of weeks ago, Computer Sciences Corp. inked a
$700-million contract to provide all information services for
Bombardier Transportation, the rail equipment division of Bombardier
Inc. of Canada. Under terms of the deal, El Segundo-based CSC will
hire more than 600 Bombardier IT employees and operate rail service
centers at 200 sites worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   CSC was founded 44 years ago to help the aerospace industry cope
with the data requirements of weapons development. It received its
first IT outsourcing contract in 1994 from General Dynamics Corp.
Today, CSC has 130 such pacts that bring in $5 billion in revenue a
year. Its client roster includes entities as varied as United
Technologies Corp. and Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Also heavily into the field -- which the jargon-happy technology
industry calls "IT Infrastructure" -- are Electronic Data Systems
Corp. and Accenture Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   For those doing the outsourcing, there are certainly risks
involved. It is possible, for instance, that an IT company doing work
for a bank won't pick up on some particular nuance in the credit
market that insiders would have noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics also wonder whether the services being provided are worth
the money.</TE>
<TE>   Yet those who have signed IT contracts maintain that the potential
for a payoff is great.</TE>
<TE>   The costs of operating the networks of computing and Internet
communications at a big corporation today are 3% to 4% of revenue for
a manufacturer, experts say, and 8% to 10% for a financial-services
firm. At both American Express and J.P. Morgan Chase, spokesmen say,
the money saved by going with IBM could amount to hundreds of
millions of dollars a year.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Palmisano, IBM's chairman and chief executive, said in a
recent speech that the best way to think of his company these days is
"as a utility." In other words, customers will pay only for the
information resources they use -- not for the computing and Internet
capacity they don't.</TE>
<TE>   IBM, which now relies on services and software rather than
hardware for most of its $86 billion in annual revenue, paid $3.5
billion in July to acquire the 30,000-strong information technology
consulting practice of PriceWaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   In the coming decade, IBM intends to spend $10 billion more on
acquisitions to support its information outsourcing efforts,
Palmisano said.</TE>
<TE>   Notably, PriceWaterhouseCoopers is the same consulting practice
that Hewlett-Packard Co.'s chief executive, Carly S. Fiorina, tried
to acquire two years ago. But HP shareholders vetoed her attempt,
sending a clear signal that they wanted the company to stick to its
roots of making electronic instruments and other equipment.</TE>
<TE>   So who was right, HP shareholders or Fiorina?</TE>
<TE>   Time will tell. But just as with successful species in the natural
world, adaptability is the hallmark of successful companies in the
business world. And today, that means do what you do best -- and
outsource the rest.</TE>

<LD>Let's see whether I understand this. California used the proceeds of
a gross overtaxation -- politically correct phrase: surplus -- to buy
electricity for the people who were overtaxed in the first place
("California Kicks Off 1st Part of Bond Sale," Oct. 24).</LD>
<LD>   Now we are going to be taxed an additional $2.50 to $3.50 per
month to allow the state to re-accumulate that surplus so the
politicians can squander it or use it to balance the budget deficit
that grew out of their profligate spending of the extraordinary
revenue generated during the years of the dot-com "bubble."</LD>

<LD>The Times missed one major twist in "El Paso Case Full of Twists and
Turns," Oct. 22.</LD>
<LD>   At the height of the California natural-gas price crunch, El Paso
Corp. blamed the entire problem on California by claiming a lack of
capacity within the state to handle any more gas.</LD>
<LD>   After claiming that reduced shipments were caused by safety
considerations and not by any capacity problems in California, El
Paso and its executives have now admitted that they lied to
California in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   El Paso clearly had a major role in triggering the gas and
electricity price crisis in California, and the only remaining
question is how much of the company will be given to California to
pay for its misdeeds.</TE>

<LD>When the California Supreme Court rejected Ford Motor Co.'s appeal of

in terms of restoring balance and fairness to our courts ("Record
Verdict Against Ford Allowed to Stand," Oct. 24).</LD>

<HD>No Tax Dollars Pay for UC's Fuel-Cell Cars</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several readers have expressed concern about a new and exciting
initiative at the University of California ("UC Money Could Be Used
on Something Else," Letters, Nov. 24).</LD>
<LD>   Recently, the university leased two next-generation automobiles
that run on hydrogen gas and subsequently produce virtually no
pollution. The automobiles were developed and built by Toyota Motor
Corp., and UC is leasing the vehicles to study and advise on their
practical use in California, the nation and, for that matter, the
world.</LD>
<LD>   As your readers observe, the cost of leasing these vehicles is not
cheap.</LD>
<TE>   Still, I can assure your readers that the leases are being paid by
private industry sources already supporting our research. Not one tax
dollar will be spent on the lease payments. Indeed, not a single UC
student or academic program will be adversely affected by this
research. We expect exactly the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine and UC Davis are the only U.S. universities leasing
these vehicles. This arrangement allows UC students and researchers
to have the unique opportunity of seeing how a cutting-edge
technology is put to common use. It will also allow the university to
be involved in advancing a technology that promises to have a truly
positive effect on the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The National Fuel Cell Research Center at UC Irvine is renowned
for the development and testing of fuel-cell technology and its
infrastructure. Fuel-cell technology is one of the most promising
technologies for reducing the pollution caused by more traditional
energy sources.</TE>
<TE>   Please be assured that this program has been designed to enrich
the academic function of the university and to provide a research
platform to address one of the most vexing environmental issues
facing California.</TE>

<HD>Republicans Need to Rethink Tax Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three articles in the Nov. 13 Business section should be read
together: "Fiscal Policy Redux," "Top CEOs Expect Sour 2003 U.S.
Economy" and "New Investor Tax Breaks Expected."</LD>
<LD>   Conservatives are pushing "supply-side" tax cuts for businesses
and investors to stimulate the economy. Their approach won't work,
because businesses won't increase their hiring and capital spending,
and investors won't resume investing, until they expect an increase
in demand.</LD>
<LD>   Fiscal stimulus needs to put more money into the pockets of those
who will spend it to consume, not to invest: lower-middle-income and
low-income people, the very people whose incomes stagnated or fell
during the last generation. This will increase demand, motivating
businesses and investors to invest again.</LD>
<TE>   Supply-side stimulus worked in 1980, when the problem was price
inflation because of too much demand. Today we need demand-side
stimulus, because the problem is over-capacity in most industries.</TE>
<TE>   In today's economy, the Democratic solution is the right one; the
Republican solution is the wrong one.</TE>

<HD>A Moneyman on a Takeover Mission</HD>
<DH>Financier Will Mesdag is pushing L.A. billionaire Marvin
Davis' bid for Vivendi's entertainment assets</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Bates</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Right about now, the behind-the-scenes moneyman orchestrating Marvin
Davis' audacious $13-billion bid to control Vivendi Universal's
entertainment assets is somewhere on the Atlantic Ocean, hopefully
closer to South America than to Africa.</LD>
<LD>   Will Mesdag is pausing from the biggest takeover proposal in the
media industry this year to pilot his 60-foot yacht, the Constanter,
toward St. Lucia from the Canary Islands in the annual Atlantic Rally
for Cruisers race. "There's nothing better," said Mesdag, "than
'driving,' especially downwind."</LD>
<LD>   That's what deal makers also like to see in a good investment. But
a cool reception by Vivendi Universal and Wall Street skepticism are
making for strong headwinds.</LD>
<TE>   As the man who drives Davis' financial empire, Mesdag's mission
includes addressing straight on whether Davis' latest bid is anything
more than another example of "kicking the tires." A slew of Davis
near-misses -- which includes four airlines, CBS and the Dallas
Cowboys football team -- continues to plague the billionaire,
spawning a reputation in certain quarters for looking deals over but
passing on them when they get too expensive.</TE>
<TE>   It's a reputation Mesdag believes is unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not inclined to waste my time," Mesdag said. "If Marvin
wasn't serious, I wouldn't be involved with Marvin. I have any number
of things I could be doing."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, many on Wall Street believe debt-laden Vivendi
Universal -- whose portfolio of Universal Pictures, Universal Studios
theme parks and Universal Music entices Davis -- soon will join that
list of could-have-beens.</TE>
<TE>   When word of Davis' bid first surfaced 10 days ago, "we didn't
take it very seriously," said Michael Nathanson, a Sanford C.
Bernstein analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and his camp point to a list of consummated deals that
includes 20th Century Fox and the Pebble Beach golf resort (both
since sold); numerous oil and gas ventures; and development of major
real estate projects from Denver to Chicago to the Water Garden in
Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Mesdag also notes that anyone with the kind of dollars Davis has
(4.6 billion of them, Forbes estimates) gets pitched more deals than
he can handle.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people would like to have Marvin as an investor," Mesdag
said. "We try to do justice to all of the proposals that come in,
without rejecting any of them outright."</TE>
<TE>   Missing Pieces</TE>
<TE>   Mesdag compares Davis' financial empire to a hedge fund with
investments of varying risk. There are the inherently big-gamble oil
and gas operations that formed the cornerstone of Davis' early
success, balanced by real estate and a large chunk of conservative
Treasury bills.</TE>
<TE>   Two areas Davis knows well and wants to get into, Mesdag said, are
airlines and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Hence the Vivendi Universal offer. The deal was hatched by Brian
Mulligan, who served as chief financial officer of Seagram Co. when
it still owned Universal studios, the theme parks and the world's
largest recording group. Mulligan then persuaded Davis and Mesdag.</TE>
<TE>   Mesdag maintains that Davis and his partners have the firepower to
make it happen.</TE>
<TE>   "The only issue outstanding is whether Vivendi is prepared to
consider the sale of these assets, and would ultimately agree to sell
them to us," Mesdag said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, potential partners in the Vivendi Universal deal include
Bain Capital and Texas Pacific Group, with other investment groups
possibly interested. Mesdag won't talk specifically about partners,
but acknowledges that Davis can't do the deal without them.</TE>
<TE>   He promises they will be drawn to Davis' willingness to pony up
serious money as the deal's leader.</TE>
<TE>   "Suffice to say, we've been involved with various people who have
the capacity to make their own judgment," Mesdag said. "They take
Marvin seriously and have been working with us to put this proposal
together."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with the proximity that Mesdag has to Davis automatically
qualifies as a power player in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan says Mesdag was an
important part of an intimate "kitchen cabinet" that met Sundays at
Riordan's home to advise him on what turned out to be an unsuccessful
gubernatorial bid.</TE>
<TE>   During the primary, Riordan recalls, Mesdag advised him to play
more to the Republican base rather than focus on incumbent Gov. Gray
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I had followed his advice more," said Riordan, who was
defeated by businessman Bill Simon. "I might be governor today."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mesdag is virtually unknown outside high-level business
circles.</TE>
<TE>   He has no formal title other than senior advisor to Marvin Davis
and describes his role as something of a personal investment banker
to the billionaire. Davis, however, says that description doesn't do
his lieutenant justice, adding that Mesdag is forcefully going after
deals on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll walk through a wall to get what he wants," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Well-Suited</TE>
<TE>   The role suits Mesdag, 49, who spent 20 years at the Wall Street
firm Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., most recently as head of the Los Angeles
office.</TE>
<TE>   A self-described "meat and potatoes" investment banker, Mesdag
handled less glamorous deals such as the sale of Arco to British
Petroleum, as well as work for Southern California Edison.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is known as a demanding boss who at 77 still immerses
himself in his business and investments. Acquaintances say, however,
that Mesdag's even-tempered style meshes well.</TE>
<TE>   "Marvin's not the easiest guy for some people to work for," said
fellow billionaire Eli Broad. "But Will's got the brights and the
temperament."</TE>
<TE>   Broad has seen that first hand as Mesdag's neighbor. Mesdag heads
an informal  homeowners association in the private Brentwood enclave
where they both live. In that post, he's had to garner support on
such issues as replacing palm trees and shrubbery, forming a
consensus among neighbors who often have wildly different opinions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of petty issues, but he's got the patience of a saint.
He gets along very well with people," Broad said.</TE>
<TE>   Added another neighbor, Oaktree Capital Management Chairman Howard
Marks: "He's very high on the intelligence, integrity and
likability."</TE>
<TE>   Long before he became Davis' personal financier, Mesdag got a
taste for exactly how personally involved Davis can get in a deal.
Mesdag was still at Goldman Sachs when he decided to move the
company's offices from downtown Los Angeles to Fox Plaza in Century
City, which at the time was owned by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than delegating the lease negotiations to underlings, as
most billionaires would have done, Davis sat across the table from
Mesdag.</TE>
<TE>   "When Marvin owns a building, Marvin cares about who his tenants
are," Mesdag said.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from Goldman Sachs last year, Mesdag set out on
several adventures. He climbed Argentina's Aconcagua, the Western
Hemisphere's tallest peak at 22,841 feet. He began racing the
Constanter. Named after his grandfather's boat, it is Dutch for
"steady."</TE>
<TE>   Then Davis came calling, offering Mesdag what he naively thought
would be a part-time gig.</TE>
<TE>   "I assumed it would give me a lot of time to pursue my
recreational interests and my extracurricular activities," Mesdag
said. "But Marvin certainly has a very full plate."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Davis said Mesdag's aggressiveness "has added a new
vitality to this company. Not that the people here were bad, but he
added new vitality."</TE>
<TE>   'T' for Taco</TE>
<TE>   Born T. Willem Mesdag, he was raised in South Dakota and Illinois.
The "T" stands for Taco, his Dutch great-grandfather's name, which
Mesdag went by as a youth but gave up as an adult because of the
inevitable ribbing.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, I didn't come to that conclusion until I finished
law school," said Mesdag, a Cornell Law grad. But, he added, "If I'd
had a son there would be another Taco in my family." (He and his
wife, former Fortune magazine journalist Lisa Miller Mesdag, have two
daughters.)</TE>
<TE>   Mesdag isn't making any predictions about his future, saying he is
focused on carrying out Davis' business deals and making time for his
hobbies, such as his sailing adventure.</TE>
<TE>   But Broad said he sees Mesdag as a potential successor to Davis
someday, someone who could run the family fortune for Davis' heirs.</TE>
<TE>   "I know [Davis] is very high on him," Broad said. "Of all the
people Marvin has around him, Mesdag is the likely person if Marvin
wasn't around to run his businesses."</TE>

<HD>With This Much Debt, Only Tony Soprano Will Give Loan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Liz Pulliam Weston</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I'm 25 and single. Two years ago I inherited my
grandparents' 100-year-old house. I borrowed $75,000 to repair and
remodel it. Now I am in debt up to my ears with a few credit cards
($2,000 total) and student loans ($12,000).</LD>
<LD>   I make the same amount I did when I was approved for all of this
credit and I barely pay my bills each month. I have no money left for
groceries, gas or unexpected costs, much less recreation or
entertainment. My biggest problem is that I have a $513.48 house
payment plus a $300 home equity payment each month, which is
three-quarters of what I make. I've tried to get a debt consolidation
loan but no lender will talk to me once they find out what my debt
ratio is.</LD>
<LD>   I'm working full-time to make ends meet while barely hanging on in
college, and I don't know what to do. Selling the house is not an
option at this point.</LD>
<TE>   Why can't I get debt consolidation and combine all my debt into
one payment?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: You can't get a loan because you've already borrowed too
much money. Even if you could talk a lender into extending you
credit, it would be at the kind of rates Tony Soprano charges, which
would mean higher monthly payments -- and really nasty penalties
should you get behind.</TE>
<TE>   Legitimate lenders these days are handing out loans like
lollipops. If you can't get one, or if you're paying high interest
rates, that's a pretty good sign that you are in way, way over your
head.</TE>
<TE>   There is an answer: Sell the house, before you lose it to
foreclosure.</TE>
<TE>   If that's really not an option, then you need to drop out of
college for a while and get a better-paying job so you can make the
payments.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yes, and stop using those credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   You're lucky, in a way. Many people live beyond their means for
years and don't find themselves in a box canyon until much later in
life, when it's a lot harder to recover from a credit disaster.</TE>
<TE>   You've learned a valuable lesson while you're still young enough
to benefit from it -- and that's never to borrow more than you can
comfortably pay back.</TE>
<TE>   Smart Management of Money Isn't Penalized</TE>
<TE>   Q: I recently applied for a loan and was given my FICO credit
score, which was 790. The credit manager said my score would have
been higher except I wasn't carrying balances on any of my accounts.
My wife and I pay in cash for most things and prefer not to pay
interest. I think it's an utter rip-off that people are being
penalized for not forking over hard-earned cash to credit card
companies in the form of interest payments.</TE>
<TE>   A: Most people aren't being "penalized" for not carrying a
balance. Only those with exceptionally high scores are likely to
experience any diminution at all in their score because of this
issue, said Fair Isaac spokesman Craig Watts, and the damage is so
minor that it's hardly noticeable.</TE>
<TE>   The score formula, by the way, doesn't measure whether high
scorers pay interest. It measures whether they use their accounts at
all. As noted above, the score generally doesn't distinguish between
a balance that's paid off and one that's carried over.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than feeling ripped-off, you should feel proud you've
handled credit so responsibly. With your score, you can qualify for
the best rates lenders offer, and they'll be falling all over
themselves to give you credit whenever you want it. Which, given your
smart money management, probably won't be often.</TE>
<TE>   Expiration Date Is for 529 Plans' Tax Bonus</TE>
<TE>   Q: We have a 4-month-old son and would like to start contributing
to a 529 plan for his college education. However, I've read that the
plans end in 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Must the money be withdrawn from the plan if he is not old enough
for college? How is the withdrawal taxed or penalized when the plan
ends? Are there any tax consequences when the plan ends for the
grandparents who contributed?</TE>
<TE>   A: Whoa, whoa, whoa! The 529 plans do not "end" in 2010. That's
the year when their tax-free status is scheduled to expire. But the
plans themselves will go on.</TE>
<TE>   Also known as college savings plans, 529s are run by individual
states and allow parents and others to put aside money for college
that can be invested, tax-deferred, until it's time for college. The
money can be used for any college in any state, and there are no
income limitations on who can contribute.</TE>
<TE>   Until last year, any withdrawals from a 529 plan to pay for
college were taxed at the child's rate, which is typically lower than
the parent's. Congress made the withdrawals tax-free in 2001, but
lawmakers put an expiration date on this little bonus for
budget-balancing purposes.</TE>
<TE>   So go ahead and keep contributing. Even if Congress doesn't extend
the tax-free status for withdrawals, 529 plans are still a great deal
for most parents.</TE>

<HD>Avoid the Holiday Shopping Hangover</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In this season of "buy now, pay later" promotions and budget-busting
largess, debt counselors warn that bills rung up today can haunt
consumers long after the holiday decorations have been put away.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody starts the season with the good intention of not
overspending," said Howard Dvorkin, vice president of the Assn. of
Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies in Fairfax, Va. "Then
they get barraged with marketing, start getting into the holiday
spirit and all those good intentions go out the window."</LD>
<LD>   One of the many causes of holiday overspending is the tendency to
"self-gift." More than three-quarters of consumers buy something for
themselves while shopping for others, according to a recent American
Express survey.</LD>
<TE>   That, combined with the natural tendency to overspend on gifts for
friends and loved ones, often causes consumers to spend far more than
they intend to -- and often considerably more than they can afford,
debt counselors say.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a study by the International Mass Retail Assn. found that
the average consumer overspent his or her Christmas budget by 31%
last year. Debt counselors note that many of their clients still are
paying for Christmases past -- many years past.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are still paying off the holiday bills from two
and three years ago," Dvorkin said. "That sale item isn't such a
great deal when you're still paying 20% interest on it."</TE>
<TE>   Here are some tips for keeping holiday shopping under control:</TE>
<TE>   Create a Budget</TE>
<TE>   It's imperative to create a holiday budget and stick to it, said
Richard Quigley, vice president at American Express Co. in New York.
Preparing a budget requires nothing more than jotting down a list of
the people you must buy a present for, and how much you can afford to
spend on each.</TE>
<TE>   Those who entertain or travel over the holidays also must factor
in the cost of food, drinks, plane tickets and rental cars. The
American Express survey reports that the average consumer will spend
$1,073 on gifts this year -- up slightly from last year -- and almost
$600 more on entertaining, decorations and travel.</TE>
<TE>   Make a List</TE>
<TE>   And check it twice. Impulse shopping is one of the key reasons
consumers fall off the budget wagon, Dvorkin says. A well-planned
shopping list can keep consumers focused on what they've already
decided their spouse, in-law, nephew or whoever wants -- and they can
afford.</TE>
<TE>   Pre-Shop</TE>
<TE>   The Internet provides a great way to compare prices without the
temptations of the mall, debt counselors say. Bargain-hunting online
can save time and money on both gifts and gas.</TE>
<TE>   Manage Expectations</TE>
<TE>   Cash-strapped consumers should consider confession, debt
counselors contend.</TE>
<TE>   If cash-strapped consumers let the people on their gift lists know
that the largess of yesteryear simply isn't possible in today's
economic environment, it can take some of the pressure off both the
giver and the receiver.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, one San Fernando Valley woman says that the year she
confessed to her brother that she couldn't afford the big gifts they
had traditionally exchanged, her brother was elated. It turned out
that, with three small children, shopping for adult relatives caused
a budget problem for him.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they came up with innovative ways to exchange useful
gifts that don't carry a price tag: She babysits for her brother's
kids; he handles home improvement projects for her.</TE>
<TE>   Don't Buy for Yourself</TE>
<TE>   People like to treat themselves at the end of the year, Quigley
notes. But there's no reason to do it at the height of the shopping
frenzy. You can get more for less by waiting for the sales that hit
in the waning days of the season or the day after Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Pay Cash</TE>
<TE>   Keep in mind that every dollar charged on a credit card will cost
10% to 25% more in interest charges if not paid off within a few
months, notes Chris Viale, general manager of Cambridge Credit in
Agawam, Mass. Avoid using credit cards if possible -- unless you
intend to pay the entire balance when the bill arrives -- and be
particularly careful about department store cards, which frequently
carry very high interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   "The best gift you can give yourself this holiday season is a
manageable credit card bill in January," Quigley says.</TE>

<HD>Signs of Bear's Rout Renew Stock Questions</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some people who swore they'd never again be interested in the stock
market, after the losses of the last three years, lately may be
finding it difficult to resist sneaking a peek.</LD>
<LD>   The rally in share prices since Oct. 9 has carried the Dow
industrials up 22.1%, to 8,896.09 as of Friday. The Nasdaq composite
is up 32.7% in the same period.</LD>
<LD>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, the index to which hundreds of billions
of dollars of investor wealth are directly tied, has risen 20.5% and
is approaching a potentially critical point: If the current rally
carries the S&amp;P up at least 21.5% from its lows, it would be the
strongest advance the index has mustered since the bear market began
in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   A gain of 20% in the S&amp;P also has been the threshold,
historically, at which the market is said to be in a new bull phase.</TE>
<TE>   For many investors, these statistics will elicit only scowls.
After the longest and deepest market decline since the late 1930s and
a full year's worth of corporate scandals and revelations of
deceitful brokerage practices, most Americans almost certainly
maintain a healthy skepticism toward Wall Street. It would be news
only if they didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Still, December usually is a good month for stocks. If this month
follows suit, it will force more investors to ask some questions that
seemed far afield just a couple months ago:</TE>
<TE>   What if the bear market really has ended, after 2 1/2 years?</TE>
<TE>   What if your retirement account has stopped going down?</TE>
<TE>   What if you could reasonably expect to earn 700% more in stocks in
2003 than in a money market fund?</TE>
<TE>   The latter isn't a math trick. If stocks rise just 8% next year
and money fund returns stay at 1% or less, the market will beat cash
accounts sevenfold.</TE>
<TE>   Reading a Rebound</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there are many institutional and individual investors
who believe that the current rebound in stocks is just another brief
bear-market rally, to be followed soon by another steep decline in
share prices.</TE>
<TE>   The argument that the bear remains large and in charge is
well-enough supported. The global economy is rickety, and if it falls
apart in 2003 equity markets worldwide probably would fall with it.</TE>
<TE>   What could sink the economy? The terrorists still are out there
and could be plotting another devastating attack. And a war between
the United States and Iraq still is a strong possibility, if not
probability.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the economy's pace improves, bolstering corporate
earnings, many stocks already are fairly priced or high-priced
relative to expected 2003 profit, market skeptics say.</TE>
<TE>   General Electric shares, for example, have risen 23% since Oct. 9.
At $27.12 on Friday, the stock was priced at 16.5 times the $1.64 a
share that analysts, on average, expect GE to earn in 2003, according
to Thomson First Call in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   That's a far lower price-to-earnings ratio than GE commanded in
the boom years of the late 1990s but it's slightly above the stock's
average P/E of the early '90s, when investors arguably had a more
rational view of the world and what could go wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The case for lower stock prices has held sway for 2 1/2 years, a
very long time by U.S. bear market standards. That has brought the
bear camp many more converts. But it also is one of the best
arguments for why the market may finally have bottomed: These periods
don't last forever, Japan's 12-year experience notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's rally since early October has been rooted in a
growing assumption that the U.S. economy will be at least OK in 2003
and that the surprises with regard to corporate earnings could be
more positive than negative. A number of reports last week, including
data on consumer spending and factory orders for big-ticket items,
provided more evidence that the picture is improving.</TE>
<TE>   With that backdrop, the natural inclination of many professional
investors is to buy stocks, because that's the fastest way to make a
bet on economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time in a long time, I've become very optimistic
about the market," said John Rogers Jr., a value-oriented investor
whose Ariel Capital Management in Chicago manages more than $10
billion.</TE>
<TE>   "I think expectations got to be way too low."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, other factors that contributed to the severity of the
bear market -- which drove the S&amp;P 500 down 49% from its 2000 peak to
its Oct. 9 low and the Nasdaq index down 78% in the same period --
are receding. Corporate accounting scandals are old hat. And nobody's
surprised anymore that brokerages have routinely been less than
trustworthy in their advice.</TE>
<TE>   Basic Questions</TE>
<TE>   Let's say the bulls are right, and the market decline overall has
run its course. Individual investors are likely to be asking
themselves one of two basic questions, or maybe both:</TE>
<TE>   * Should I buy? Just because the market is rising doesn't
necessarily mean it needs more of your capital. Patient investors who
have stuck with equities through the bear market may already have all
they need; now it's just a matter of watching the stocks rebound if
the rally can be sustained.</TE>
<TE>   It's also critical that investors be realistic about the returns
the market can produce over the next few years, financial advisors
say. Patience might become even more important if the best average
return stocks can generate is, say, 6% to 8% a year.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, returns in that range still might far exceed
what will be available from other financial assets, such as Treasury
bonds and short-term cash accounts. Remember: When the economy is
expanding, investors typically look to stocks first.</TE>
<TE>   If your time horizon truly is long term, "You really need to
consider taking on some risk to get a higher return now," said John
Hollyer, who helps manage the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund, which
offers investors a yield of just 1.37%.</TE>
<TE>   Unless you're a trader, however, be wary of getting sucked into
wild gains in individual shares, many veteran investors caution.
"Momentum" investing -- buying by portfolio managers who are simply
trying to ride the fastest-moving shares they can find -- is alive
and well, particularly in the technology sector. Often, the faster a
stock rises, the greater the risk that it could quickly reverse.</TE>
<TE>   * Should I sell? Why sell into a rising stock market? If you
believe that the economic outlook is far grimmer than the market now
assumes, a rebound in share prices gives you an opportunity to exit
either at a profit or with a smaller loss.</TE>
<TE>   Selling also might be warranted if you're looking to shift assets
from one stock market sector to another that appears more promising.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, investors who are benefiting from the snap-back in
many technology shares might ask whether they should use the rally to
pull money out of those stocks in favor of diversifying into other
industry groups.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, another reason to sell stocks may be to fix your
long-term asset allocation among stocks and bonds: If you've wanted
to own Treasury securities, for example, but have been reluctant to
buy them this year as yields plunged, a continuing surge in yields
could give you an opportunity to lock in better risk-free returns for
the long term.</TE>
<TE>   An asset allocation plan should be the driving force behind all
buy and sell decisions, Hollyer said. If you have a plan that assures
your portfolio always is well diversified and reflects your risk
tolerance, then the only issue is having the discipline to stick with
the program and make automatic asset shifts accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, that is a lot easier, and less stressful, than
trying to predict the future of financial markets.</TE>

<LD>Dockworkers, Shipping Companies Reach Deal</LD>
<LD>   The longshore union and shipping companies ended months of
acrimony and costly showdowns that rippled through the national
economy by agreeing on a labor contract covering all U.S. commercial
ports on the West Coast. The agreement, which must be ratified by
union members, was reached about one month before the expiration of a
federal injunction that kept the ports operating.</LD>
<LD>   Details of the six-year contract were sketchy, but it was clear
that both sides gave deeply while winning important concessions. The
Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents about 80 shipping lines and
terminal operators, came away with the right to implement
labor-saving technology, such as computer systems that allow cargo
lists to flow directly into terminals rather than being retyped by
union clerks. Those systems and other new equipment will speed cargo
movement while eliminating hundreds of high-wage clerical jobs.</LD>
<TE>   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union's 10,500 members
won substantial increases in their pension and held on to fully paid
family health insurance, with large premium increases being absorbed
by the employers.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities Charge 3 in Identity Fraud Case</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities in New York brought charges against three men
in what they said was the largest identity fraud case in U.S.
history.</TE>
<TE>   Private financial information of consumers across the country --
about 30,000 have been identified so far -- was stolen by thieves who
authorities said used pilfered corporate passwords to electronically
access data from all three major credit reporting bureaus.</TE>
<TE>   For many consumers, the theft was the beginning of a nightmare
that left their bank accounts drained and allowed crooks to run up
thousands of dollars of fraudulent charges in the victims' names.</TE>
<TE>   Losses have been estimated at $2.7 million, although that total
could rise as the investigation continues.</TE>
<TE>   California High Court Limits Piracy Lawsuits</TE>
<TE>   The California Supreme Court limited the entertainment industry's
ability to combat piracy by ruling that California companies cannot
bring lawsuits here against many out-of-state defendants operating on
the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In a case involving a trade secret dispute, the court held 4 to 3
that a California trade association for the DVD and movie industries
cannot file suit in California against a Texas computer engineer who
organized a Web site containing software that could be used for
pirating copyrighted movies on DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was hailed as a victory for Internet users and small
Internet businesses. Computer engineer Matthew Pavlovich cannot be
sued in California because his move to post the software for
unscrambling DVD encryption technology was not targeted specifically
at California, the court majority decided.</TE>
<TE>   State Securities Cop Says Wall St. Fines Too Low</TE>
<TE>   California's top securities regulator said the fines being sought
from brokerages in a proposed settlement over analyst conflicts are
far too low. It was the first time an official has publicly broken
ranks with his counterparts on how much Wall Street should be
penalized for its alleged bull-market sins.</TE>
<TE>   Demetrios A. Boutris, commissioner of the state's Department of
Corporations, said every firm should pay at least $100 million to
resolve multiple investigations of whether stock analysts dished out
tainted advice in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal regulators are demanding fines in talks aimed at
reaching for a "global" settlement with a dozen investment banks. The
bulk of the companies are being asked to pay $25 million to $100
million, sources said. Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston
would have to pay considerably larger fines.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed fines let firms "think they can justify their bad
behavior as simply the cost of doing business," Boutris said. "Bad
behavior should be punished."</TE>
<TE>   Court Rejects Settlement of Boeing Bias Lawsuit</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court threw out a $15-million settlement of a
class-action racial discrimination suit against Boeing Co., saying
there was no justification for the $4 million in lawyers' fees or for
the substantial disparity in payments among plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling forces the company to reopen negotiations that could
lead to a more costly settlement or trial.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement, approved in 1999, would have allowed Boeing a
relatively inexpensive resolution to a suit on behalf of 15,000 black
workers. It alleged widespread harassment and discrimination in
promotions at Boeing plants across the country, including Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals voted
2 to 1 to send the Boeing case back to U.S. District Court in
Seattle. If a new settlement cannot be reached, the case could go
back to trial, said lawyers familiar with the case and with civil
procedure.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for more than 200 black Boeing workers said the group
wants to see a new settlement that involves substantially more money,
is distributed more fairly and forces the company to change its
promotion practices.</TE>
<TE>   A Boeing spokesman said the company could not comment on the
ruling because its lawyers were still reviewing it.</TE>
<TE>   Spate of Upbeat Reports Eases Economy Anxiety</TE>
<TE>   The economy appeared to be emerging from its late-summer funk,
easing concerns about a possible double-dip recession. In a
pre-Thanksgiving blizzard of economic reports, new claims for
unemployment benefits fell to a 21-month low, consumer spending in
October shot up at the fastest clip in three months and orders to
U.S. factories for big-ticket durable goods increased for the first
time in three months.</TE>
<TE>   And the Federal Reserve found slightly stronger business activity
in its latest nationwide survey, reporting scattered signs of
improvement in late October and early November.</TE>
<TE>   Those reports followed news earlier in the week that consumer
confidence, which had been falling for five straight months, rose in
November and the overall economy grew at a robust 4% rate in the
third quarter, a big revision from the initial estimate of 3.1%
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, analysts said the string of better-than-expected
reports pointed to a gradual rebound from what Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan had termed a "soft patch" for the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Rules AMC Violates Disabilities Act</TE>
<TE>   AMC Entertainment Inc.'s stadium-style theaters deprive moviegoers
in wheelchairs a comfortable view in violation of the American With
Disabilities Act, a federal judge ruled.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Florence-Marie Cooper in Los Angeles sided
with the U.S., which sued the nation's second-largest publicly traded
movie theater chain in 1999 for violating the Americans With
Disabilities Act.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling marks the first time a theater has lost a disabilities
act challenge to stadium-style theaters, which have become the
industry standard. Patrons in wheelchairs complain that their
designated seating is too close to the screen, forcing them to crane
their necks.</TE>
<TE>   Napster Wins Approval to Sell Assets to Roxio</TE>
<TE>   Napster Inc. won a bankruptcy judge's approval to sell its assets
to Roxio Inc., ending the defunct music-swapping Web site's quest to
find a buyer since it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
June.</TE>
<TE>   Roxio, a maker of software for copying compact discs, will pay $5
million in cash for the assets, including the Napster name, to expand
its digital media services. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh
approved the sale at a hearing in Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann's offer to buy Napster was rejected in September by
Walsh, who said conflicts of interest by Napster Chief Executive
Konrad Hilbers had tainted the transaction. Another deal failed
because the buyer was unable to secure financing.</TE>
<TE>   Redwood City, Calif.-based Napster, a Web site that once hosted 13
million users, filed for Chapter 11 after failing to find financial
backing to create a paid service.</TE>
<TE>   Mechanics at United Reject Pay Concessions</TE>
<TE>   Mechanics at United Airlines rejected their portion of $1.5
billion in proposed pay cuts over 5 1/2 years, which could lead to a
filing for bankruptcy protection by the No. 2 U.S. airline unless it
can hammer out a new deal with the union workers quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The International Assn. of Machinists, District 141M, said its
13,000 members rejected the deal by a 57% margin.</TE>
<TE>   United, a unit of UAL Corp., is the largest operator at Los
Angeles International and San Francisco International airports. The
mechanics' rejection jeopardizes pay-cut agreements with sister
unions, including those for pilots and flight attendants, which said
givebacks were contingent on every union taking part in the
sacrifices.</TE>
<TE>   United posted massive financial losses in 2001 after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks and again this year as revenue remained weak. The
airline recently secured $5.2 billion in wage cuts from its
employees, including five separate unions, as part of a financial
recovery plan put before the Air Transportation Stabilization Board.</TE>
<TE>   United has asked the agency to back $1.8 billion of a $2-billion
loan. Industry experts say a decision from the ATSB will determine
the near-term fate of United as it tries to avoid restructuring
through the courts.</TE>

<HD>Disney Stakes New Online Territory</HD>
<DH>'Toontown,' the first multiplayer Web game for kids, is
part of effort to extend dominance in family entertainment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Craig Dalrymple knows the Internet can be ugly. As a devout player of
online fantasy games, Dalrymple himself has meted out some of that
ugliness.</LD>
<LD>   For his 5-year-old son, though, the Chicago father of three wanted
a more orderly, tidy and safe virtual world -- someplace more like
Disneyland than Middle Earth.</LD>
<LD>   "I know what's out there, and it's not stuff I want my kids to
see," said Dalrymple, 31, who instead lets son Adan play "Toontown
Online," an attempt by Walt Disney Co. to create an online version of
its theme parks.</LD>
<TE>   Made to accommodate thousands of players at once, Disney's
"Toontown" borrows from such popular online games as "EverQuest" and
"Asheron's Call." But unlike those rowdy and often bawdy games,
squeaky-clean "Toontown" is the first multiplayer Internet game aimed
squarely at children.</TE>
<TE>   The game represents a multimillion-dollar effort by Disney to
extend its dominance in family entertainment to the Internet, a realm
traditionally hostile to kid-friendly ventures. Pedophiles, online
bullies and strict children's privacy laws have driven many
children's Web sites out of business -- and earned the Internet a
reputation as a dicey place for minors.</TE>
<TE>   "There used to be all kinds of exciting sites online for kids,"
said Amy Bruckman, assistant professor of computer science at Georgia
Institute of Technology's College of Computing in Atlanta. "The
majority of them have either gone away or reduced interactivity to a
minimum. They're afraid to let kids talk because of the safety and
liability issues. That's a shame because the promise of the Internet
is its ability to connect people."</TE>
<TE>   Armed with experience in building tightly controlled theme parks,
Disney executives believe they have carved out in "Toontown" a
virtual haven that lets kids interact with other players. By limiting
what kids can say and rewarding only good behavior, "Toontown" tries
to end-run the bad manners and predatory tactics rampant in the games
that inspired it.</TE>
<TE>   "Toontown," launched in October with next to no marketing, is
being watched closely by children's advocates and online games groups
anxious to see whether it's possible to create a kids' site that is
not only safe, but also fun and profitable. Disney charges a monthly
fee to play the game -- $9.95 for the first month and $5.95 for every
month thereafter -- but has not released subscription figures.</TE>
<TE>   For years, a small but growing number of adults has connected
online through multiplayer games that let people wander through
fantasy worlds, battling dragons and building social networks. In the
1980s, these worlds were little more than text-based chat rooms. But
as personal computers became increasingly powerful, the games took on
more realistic graphics. Today's games have miles of virtual terrain
and three-dimensional environments.</TE>
<TE>   But what keeps these games alive -- some for more than a decade --
are their social aspects. Players build human ties that are as
intense as if forged in real life.</TE>
<TE>   Repercussions</TE>
<TE>   As a result, online games mirror life, with good and bad behavior.
Because of the Internet's ability to cloak identities, some people
cut loose online, saying and doing things they wouldn't normally
because they feel that their online actions have little real-world
consequence.</TE>
<TE>   But for kids especially, there can be repercussions.</TE>
<TE>   "The environment is virtual, but the feelings are real," said
Gordon Walton, who headed online services for a game called "Ultima
Online" and now is executive producer at Electronic Arts Inc. for an
upcoming game called "The Sims Online."</TE>
<TE>   The premise of "Toontown" is classic Disney. Toontown is overrun
with "cogs" -- cranky robots that try to transform the town into a
stuffy, gray place. To save Toontown, players must defeat the cog
army by playing practical jokes on them.</TE>
<TE>   Since "Toontown's" launch, executives say, nothing untoward has
occurred in the game.</TE>
<TE>   They credit the game's design. From the beginning, "Toontown"
creators tried to weed out bad behavior by studying other games.</TE>
<TE>   "Early on, we played all the other online games to get a sense of
what they were like," said Mike Gosselin, director of the Disney
studio that created "Toontown." "These were games that were made for
adults.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a different mission," Gosselin added. "Coming from a
background of designing theme parks, we have our eyes on the mass
market. We realized pretty quickly by playing them with kids in mind
what the problems were. We made a list of things we needed to avoid."</TE>
<TE>   One of them was competition, which tended to draw out the worst in
players. So "Toontown" designers created incentives for players to
cooperate. Players never fight each other, but take on humorless
robot cogs by, say, throwing pies. Players are rewarded for teaming
up to take on especially grim cogs.</TE>
<TE>   "We went out of our way to reward working together," Gosselin
said. "The spin isn't about killing and looting. It's about defending
Toontown."</TE>
<TE>   In most other online games, players must collect resources that
have been artificially limited to create value and demand. In
"Toontown," there's nothing to hoard. Kids collect pies to throw at
cogs, but there's no limit to the number of pies available.</TE>
<TE>   The game also takes a different tack on death. In most other
games, in which conflict and battle are key elements, characters can
die. Although they can be reincarnated, players lose points or
treasure when their characters pass away.</TE>
<TE>   In "Toontown," however, the Toons can't die. Instead, they simply
lose "laff" points and must return to the playground to get happy.</TE>
<TE>   "To a 20-year-old, the concept of death is OK," said Joe Shochet,
lead "Toontown" designer. "For a 5-year-old, it can be crushing to
watch your character die. So we decided to take the teeth out of
dying."</TE>
<TE>   Online 'Griefing'</TE>
<TE>   Another unpleasant aspect of online games is harassment by other
players. The phenomenon is so prevalent that there's a term for it:
"griefing." The harassment can take many forms, but the most damaging
version is live chat, which griefers use to hurl taunts, insults and
epithets.</TE>
<TE>   Chatting also is the way players communicate and develop
friendships, so "Toontown" designers were reluctant to abolish the
feature. Rather, they developed what they call speed chat, a menu of
more than 100 canned phrases that players can choose from to say
roughly what they want. Options include "Hooray!" and "Want to be my
friend?" to "Hey!" and "Stop that!" The harshest phrase is "You
stink."</TE>
<TE>   Live chat, where players type unrestricted messages to each other,
is an option but must be enabled by a parent with special access to
the account.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, players can chat only by obtaining a randomly generated
secret code in the game and giving that code to a friend. Because no
chatting is allowed in the game otherwise, the code must be handed
over outside the context of "Toontown." This, of course, requires
that the player knows the friend outside the game. The code lasts 48
hours and allows players to chat freely. No one else in the game can
see the chat, rendering it a private conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Although Disney does not have employees monitoring the chats, it
does have a program that keeps a log and tries to filter out bad
language and any series of digits that look like phone numbers. One
of the tenets of Internet child safety is to not permit children to
give out personal information -- phone numbers, addresses and school
names -- that can let another person locate the child.</TE>
<TE>   Children's privacy, federally protected by a law passed four years
ago, prohibits Web sites from collecting personal information from
children younger than 13 without parental consent. This requirement
is a key factor in forcing many sites out of business, according to
Parry Aftab, an Internet law attorney and executive director of
WiredSafety Inc., a nonprofit online safety advocate group.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the sites were profiling kids and selling the marketing
information to other companies and vendors," Aftab said. "That was
deemed illegal in 1998, and many of those sites went out of business.
It's become very challenging since then to find a business model for
building profitable children's sites that has high quality, rich
content, which can be very costly."</TE>
<TE>   Disney got over those twin hurdles of making money and complying
with the law by turning to a monthly subscription fee billed to a
credit card. Under the 1998 law, receiving credit card information is
equivalent to securing parental consent because the law assumes that
only adults can obtain credit card accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue Models</TE>
<TE>   For Disney, the subscription is one of three revenue models
helping to stabilize its Internet venture. In the late 1990s, Disney
chased the Internet boom, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to
develop Go.com as a competitor to other Web portals such as Yahoo
Inc. The effort led to massive losses. In 2001, Disney took a
$790-million charge against its earnings to write down the value of
its flagging Internet assets.</TE>
<TE>   "Toontown" is considered a marquee effort in Disney's new Internet
strategy. Although financially risky, fee-based games can be among
the most profitable Internet ventures. "Toontown" plays on Disney's
expertise in building entertainment venues for families. And it leans
on well-known Disney characters to draw in parents and their young
children.</TE>
<TE>   For the Dalrymples, the formula has worked.</TE>
<TE>   "The familiar environment was a great draw" for Adan, Dalrymple
said. "He recognized Mickey Mouse right away."</TE>

<LD>Eight years of impersonating the Hatfields and McCoys apparently are
not enough for the city of Tustin and the Santa Ana Unified School
District, which have resumed their feud over reuse plans for the
former Tustin Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, the warring parties were at risk of having the
state or federal government step in and impose a solution on how to
develop the former blimp and helicopter base. But in the spring of
this year, the city and school district signaled that they'd signed a
peace treaty. Just months later, however, the gloves again are off,
and both sides are swinging freely in the costly and embarrassing tug
of war.</LD>
<LD>   Tustin earned the Santa Ana school district's enmity during the
1990s by agreeing to turn over parts of the former base to the Tustin
and Irvine school districts, the South Orange County Community
College District and, after much haggling, the Rancho Santiago
Community College District. Santa Ana, a cash-hungry district with a
heavy population of students, was left out of the land giveaway.</LD>
<TE>   Tustin's defense has always been that the city needs to retain a
hefty amount of acreage at the former base to help finance
redevelopment. Cooler heads subsequently prevailed, and the two sides
in May reached an agreement that, in the words of Tustin Councilwoman
Tracy Wills Worley, came about through "the spirit of compromise and
public service."</TE>
<TE>   The agreement, Worley wrote in an opinion piece that appeared in
this newspaper, "will both help alleviate the crowded conditions of
Sana Ana Unified schools and ensure that the base reuse plan that
benefits all Orange County citizens can move forward."</TE>
<TE>   But Santa Ana recently alleged that Tustin officials reneged on
part of the promise to guarantee a $60-million payment to the school
district. At issue is how that guarantee will be made -- in the form
of a letter of credit (which would make life easier for Santa Ana) or
a promissory note (Tustin's plan). An Orange County Superior Court
judge on Tuesday will try to sort out the arguments and make a
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin should abide by the terms of its agreement with the
district; the school system should work with Tustin to clear the
latest hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   The only certainty is that redevelopment plans for the former base
will remain stalled until the two sides reach an agreement. That
alone should provide reason for a quick resolution.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Coad learned an important lesson during his ill-fated bid to keep
the Coad name alive on the Orange County Board of Supervisors:
Carpetbaggers had best make sure their luggage is packed well in
advance.</LD>
<LD>   Coad's predicament might have escaped some county residents, so in
the interest of public service, here's a brief recap. The husband of
outgoing board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad several weeks ago announced
plans to run for the 3rd District seat that soon would open up when
Supervisor Todd Spitzer won election Nov. 5 to the state Assembly.
(Spitzer, by the way, hopes to play musical chairs and switch seats
with fellow Republican Bill Campbell, the termed-out 71st District
assemblyman who is running for Spitzer's county job.)</LD>
<LD>   Coad's announcement raised some eyebrows in Spitzer's old
district, in large part because Spitzer consistently campaigned hard
against the proposed airport at El Toro while Coad stood steadfastly
in favor of the plan. Then there was the practical matter of where
Coad lives -- a house in Anaheim, safely inside the 4th District. The
Coads are building a home in northern Tustin, but it isn't finished.
Coad planned to establish residency by renting a Tustin house and
starting to take the pulse of the local electorate.</LD>
<TE>   Spitzer -- gleefully, observers suspect -- upset the apple cart by
unexpectedly resigning Nov. 20, several days ahead of his anticipated
schedule. Spitzer tripped up Coad's political ambitions by handing
his resignation to, of all people, Cynthia Coad during a supervisors
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Would-be candidate Tom Coad was caught flatfooted because he'd
failed to fulfill a 30-day residency requirement. The county counsel
promptly ruled that Coad's notice to the registrar of voters had to
be postmarked by Nov. 16, but the card didn't get postmarked until
Nov. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians of all stripes and at all levels try to put the best
spin on their politically motivated moves. A three-judge appellate
court panel had to certify that Dick Cheney was a Wyoming resident
and thus qualified to hold a place on the ballot as George Bush's
running mate in 2000. Democrats unsuccessfully tried to paint Olympic
Games head Mitt Romney as an out-of-towner during his successful Nov.
5 bid to become governor of Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Coad's experience undoubtedly was personally painful, but it
probably was for the best that the county counsel quickly weighed in
with an unambiguous decision. The last thing voters needed was a
courtroom squabble over whether Coad made or missed the registration
deadline. Given voters' short attention spans, politicians had best
stick to what they stand for, not what district they're qualified to
run from.</TE>

<LD>Information coming out about the district attorney's office leaves
the public with no better answers, only more questions.</LD>
<LD>   The latest and strangest shoe to drop: One of Tony Rackauckas' top
investigators was wearing a wire around the office, taping
conversations without his boss' knowledge. Michael Clesceri, the
assistant chief of investigations for the district attorney, was
doing a little extracurricular snooping for state Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer, who has been at odds with Rackauckas for several months.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas reportedly was drawing up a response to a critical
letter from Lockyer when the taping revelation dropped from the sky.</LD>
<TE>   The district attorney also was taken to task in an Orange County
Grand Jury report for poor management, misusing taxpayer money and
intervening in cases that involved his political cronies. Rackauckas
brushed the jury report aside, saying the grand jury had been
influenced by his political enemies. That response incensed Lockyer,
whose office had helped with the probe.</TE>
<TE>   The Case of the Wired Investigator is a puzzling affair.
Rackauckas' continual denials of wrongdoing and Lockyer's continual
innuendo deprive the public -- which pays for their offices and their
investigations -- of crucial information. Rackauckas is refusing to
address the allegations and continual hubbub that surround his
office. He shrugs off findings that he was misusing an investigative
fund to wine and dine lobbyists. He even changed office policy to
allow the expenditures, though he later reversed course.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas' retort to criticism is that all this is the work of
old-timers in his office who are out to get him. That line has lost
whatever thin veneer of credibility it once had, because Clesceri
isn't part of the old political guard.</TE>
<TE>   He was, at least up until the taping revelations, a trusted
investigative chief for Rackauckas who even so agreed to go behind
his boss' back for the attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   So it's time for Rackauckas to own up, publicly and privately, to
the problems in his office.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer has been equally adept at obfuscating. His investigators
found no criminal wrongdoing by Rackauckas, but Lockyer has publicly
taken on the Orange County district attorney in speech and letter for
unspecified mismanagement. Once his mole in Rackauckas' office was
revealed, Lockyer went on the offensive, saying that although he
lacks the evidence to prosecute a crime, "I've never seen a district
attorney get so close to the line repeatedly." Strong words. So what
were those close-to-the-line actions? Lockyer isn't saying.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a day after those statements, he said that Clesceri
wasn't targeting Rackauckas. Lockyer said he authorized the taping to
assist in an earlier probe requested by Rackauckas. During that
probe, they found evidence that someone in the district attorney's
office had lied to a law enforcement official.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Lockyer spokesman, such lying could be a crime,
although once again the office failed to lodge charges against
anyone. "At a minimum, it's unethical," the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Such a conclusion hardly calls for a legal brain; the question is,
does it call for enlisting one of the district attorney's allies in a
sub rosa operation? Just what is it we're supposed to be worried
about in Rackauckas' office?</TE>
<TE>   We don't know. And until Lockyer and Rackauckas are willing to be
open with the public, we won't know.</TE>

<HD>Spitzer vs. Tom Coad: Blame Makes Rounds</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Spitzer Quits O.C. Board Early," Nov. 20:</LD>
<LD>   In preparation for Assemblyman-elect Todd Spitzer's journey to
Sacramento, he stumbled and displayed a disturbing characterization
of poor taste.</LD>
<LD>   The Times photo pictured him in the background with arms
stretched, prepared to strangle board Chairwoman Cynthia Coad.
Although his gesture was an antic, I can't help recalling that a
similarly unsound gesture -- a raised middle finger -- by another
politician created passionate outrage by then-candidate Spitzer. Now,
Spitzer "has some fun" by simulating the strangulation of a woman.
That speaks volumes and reminds each of us that it is hard to become
No. 1 but even more difficult to remain there. I suggest that he
watch the 1957 film classic "A Face in the Crowd" to understand that
we should never forget from where we came because we can return there
mighty fast.</LD>

<TE>   When Tom Coad charges "that there are morally bankrupt people in
politics," perhaps he should look in the mirror. Spitzer's
"calculated trick" thwarting his candidacy for supervisor ensured
that a carpetbagger belatedly registered at a guest house in the
district he hoped to represent did not have the legal grounds to buy
a seat with his considerable financial means.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the members of the Board of Supervisors, Todd Spitzer is
the one who did more to fight special interests to improve the
quality of life for residents. I'm sure we'll be hearing more from
him as he moves to the state Assembly, and we'll all be better off as
a result.</TE>

<LD>   Lost in the discussion of Junipero Serra High School versus the
Juaneno sacred site are very serious environmental issues. Under the
site is a volatile hydrocarbon plume leaking from the underground
storage tank of the gas station [nearby]. Private school use of land
is unregulated by Cal/EPA, so the children running around on the site
will be breathing fumes from the carcinogens in the plume. Not my
children.</LD>

<LD>Re "Churches as Neighbors," Oct. 20:</LD>
<LD>   The editorial was useful as far as it went, but it failed to
consider the economic impact of tax-exempt church property on the
community. This has become an increasingly important issue as
churches, you rightly observe, are expanding their range to include
many secular activities. The subject merits informed consideration.</LD>

<LD>Re "Not Just a Sheriff's Badge -- A Rising Star," Nov. 10:</LD>
<LD>   Dana Parsons' assessment of Sheriff Mike Carona is right on the
money.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff Carona and I started our law enforcement careers nearly 27
years ago as deputy marshals in the jail at the West Court Justice
Center. Carona has worked hard for everything he has, including
[spending] evenings and weekends pursuing his college degrees while
working full time.</LD>
<TE>   His reputation for fairness and professionalism has clearly
followed him from his role as Orange County marshal to that of
sheriff. One merely needs to speak to current and former deputies,
even those opposing him for sheriff four years ago, who will say Mike
Carona is the real thing -- professional, dedicated to serving the
people of Orange County and a true leader. As a law enforcement
professional, it was my pleasure to work with and for Sheriff Carona.</TE>
<TE>   John S. Williams</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   During the pre-election barrage of mailers, it troubled me that
our sheriff used his office and uniform for so much unabashed
partisan purpose. I like Carona and voted for him, but somehow it
would seem better if the senior law enforcement officer in the county
was politically neutral -- in appearance if not in fact. At a minimum
he should not be promoting partisan candidates and causes in his
uniform.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Loud 'Yes' on Health Care," Nov. 11:</LD>
<LD>   Your editorial said that the root of Los Angeles County's health
care problem is the number of uninsured people. You must know the
root of our poverty level is uncontrolled immigration, a disaster The
Times has enthusiastically supported for decades. Overpopulation by
the poorest and least skilled has destroyed our urban centers,
schools and, of course, the health system.</LD>
<LD>   There have been no direct county tax increases on property owners
lately because the politicians found they could offer endless
"tax-free" bond issues instead. I counted $54 billion worth,
including interest, in the recent election. We need a moratorium on
most immigration to get our whole infrastructure back on track [and]
balance budgets.</LD>

<TE>   I am 73 years old, and my husband is 82. We recently had to sell
our little home of 41 years and buy in a retirement community.
Because of Proposition 13, we are supposed to keep the same tax level
as before. However, the property tax wolves are howling at our door.
We had to give them $1,000 more, which they claim will be refunded to
us "when your property tax papers are adjusted."</TE>
<TE>   Your newspaper has always been pro-illegal immigration. It is time
you admit that the enormous increase of poor people is causing a
crisis in health care, among other things. You mention that most
employers don't provide health-care plans. Why should they, when
cheap labor keeps pouring in over the border and the taxpayers pick
up the tab? Do you think it is fair that little old people like us on
a fixed income should be paying for illegal aliens' health care?</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the property tax increase won because apartment dwellers
outnumber property owners. They have been led to believe they are not
affected by property tax increases.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Immigrants Fearful to Come Forward, Latino Leaders Say," Oct.
24:</TE>
<TE>   Your article quotes the director of a suburban Montgomery County
[Md.] social service agency as saying he would discourage his people
from giving the police information regarding the sniper investigation
if "witnesses are going to be deported."</TE>
<TE>   I am outraged! Outraged that this man would sacrifice the lives of
innocent citizens so these immigrants will not jeopardize their
illegal status in our country. This way of thinking further inflames
my anger over the tidal wave of illegal immigrants in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Further, in the same article, you write that "some police agencies
are not obligated to hand over law-abiding undocumented migrants to
the INS." Am I the only one who sees the irony in this statement? Do
we not understand that the term undocumented immigrant is an L.A.
Times euphemism for illegal alien?</TE>

<LD>Re "Look! Up in the Sky! Polluters," Nov. 24:</LD>
<LD>   I want to address the reader who wrote this letter. I am truly
amused by this reader's comments regarding birds in the sky as
polluters. Wow! Should we just go ahead and destroy their habitat or
kill all living creatures other than us humans who eliminate? I
really don't see how birds are of great concern to the environment.
Do birds cause the closure of our state beaches? It seems to me that
humans are the greatest single cause of the pollution of our seas,
land and air. Should we also reduce human habitats in order to reduce
contaminants?</LD>

<LD>Re "Tough Love, or Abuse?" Nov. 21:</LD>
<LD>   I reacted with a range of strong emotions to your Column One
story. As a high school teacher with 16 years' experience, I have
felt gratitude for the sometimes wrenching struggles of parents such
as the Machnicks, who toil mightily to transform troublesome children
into responsible adults. How can prosecutors advance child abuse
charges against them in light of evidence indicating disciplinary
consequences that only accelerated in the face of continued defiance
by their son?</LD>
<LD>   Sadly, the Machnicks have already had their careers tarnished with
the suspensions imposed by their employers. "Fines," in the form of
legal fees paid to their attorney, will be assessed before and after
their trial, whether or not they prevail.</LD>
<TE>   Though an excellent story, I wish Stuart Pfeifer had asked the one
glaring question: What would the Machnicks' accusers have done if
they had such a disobedient child in their home?</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Comstock</TE>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Don't district attorneys have anything better to do than
prosecuting these caring parents? Social workers and child experts,
put yourselves in the Machnicks' shoes; can you honestly say you
could do better?</TE>
<TE>   Time and again, the society and its system have proved to be
ineffective to our kids, if not downright harmful. What about the
psychological abuse and the agony inflicted upon parents by the
illness of the society handed down to these misbehaving kids? We are
living in a time when our cities issue permits to shoot porno films
next door and we, the parents, are at the receiving end of all the
ill effects that are engendered. District attorneys, please drop the
charges; give the Machnicks a chance to help the kid.</TE>

<LD>Re "Seeing Needless Deaths Abroad, M.D. Turns Privilege Into
Leverage," Nov. 25:</LD>
<LD>   I was fortunate to have been a patient of Dr. Robert Greenburg. He
was what everyone wants his or her physician to be -- extremely
knowledgeable, warm and dedicated. His sense of humor was a bonus.
His patients were always more important than insurance and HMO forms,
and, I suspect, golf.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't surprise me (though it did sadden me) when I received
the letter saying he was closing his practice to follow his heart.</LD>
<TE>   Your story was well-written and highlighted Dr. Greenburg's
compassion.</TE>

<TE>   Thank you for the inspiring and uplifting article on Dr. Robert
Greenburg and the charity named Medicine for Humanity. I was one of
Dr. Greenburg's patients for many years and was sorry (for myself)
when he gave up his practice, but I soon realized his talents would
be used in a much more important way.</TE>
<TE>   After my hysterectomy, he called me the miracle woman because of
my fast and almost painless recovery, but I have always maintained
that his careful and meticulous surgical skill was the critical
factor. Blessings on this dedicated man and the many others who help
in this charitable work.</TE>

<LD>   Women should have the right to choose if they want to have their
baby vaginally after having a baby by C-section. It's not right that
doctors are denying women the right to deliver their babies the way
they are supposed to. C-sections are far more dangerous and take
longer to recover from. It's unfair for women to have their doctors
deny them a vaginal birth because it's too costly or they don't want
to spend that much time with the patient.</LD>

<LD>Re "Tollway Plan Hits a Bump," Nov. 14:</LD>
<LD>   A big thank-you to U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer. Recognizing the value
of the last areas of open space in Southern California, the
importance of preserving endangered species' habitats, and the
potential effects of a toll road on water and air quality, Boxer said
no to this special-favor legislation. Bravo to Boxer!</LD>
<LD>   She and colleague Dianne Feinstein value the quality of life of
their constituents -- unlike many politicians who allow special
interests and big business to drive decision making. With support
withheld by our senators and the concerns of a Marine commandant
about the proposed toll road interfering with military security, I am
heartened that elected officials and the military are finally seeing
through the toll road agencies' stealth tactics.</LD>

<LD>Re "Demography vs. Democracy," Nov. 5:</LD>
<LD>   In response to Steven Hill and Rashad Robinson's piece stating
"young people feel left out of the political process," since when
does involvement in our democratic process require a prompt from
another?</LD>
<LD>   The Harvard University study said "83.5% of 18-to-24-year-olds
were not contacted by any political party during the 2000 election."
This group must have been completely isolated from mainstream
societal contact, as you cannot take a breath during any major
campaign without inhaling a political message from somewhere.</LD>
<TE>   Our system, our country and its people's success are rooted in
self-motivation and education, not waiting to be contacted, then
feeling left out.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The recent election is one of the worst voter turnouts in history.
It's a shame more people did not exercise their right to vote. I have
always voted since I obtained that right and stress to my children,
like my father did with me, that my vote can affect the outcome.
However, I can sympathize with the nonvoters since the political
parties have not given us the best and brightest candidates.</TE>
<TE>   As for the recent results, Republicans say they have been given a
mandate but have clearly ignored the fact that 60% of the voters did
not vote.</TE>
<TE>   This nonvoting majority has sent an obvious message to both
parties that until you come up with better candidates and meaningful
platforms, most voters will continue their protest. Naturally, party
leaders will continue to ignore this message by maintaining the
status quo, and not give the people what they really want: better
choices at the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Lipot</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Could it be that for more than two years many young voters have
been disenfranchised? In the year 2000, my two older children were
prevented from voting in what would have been their first
presidential election. Since that time my daughter has established
her own residence and is registered to vote there. My son, however,
is still in school out of state, and because of what looks like a
persistent bureaucratic error, he is again in danger of being
disenfranchised.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 18 the county registrar's office processed my son's
request for an absentee ballot by changing his registration date
instead of sending him a ballot. Apparently mistakes like this can
occur when the mailing address of an absentee voter is different from
the permanent address. It seems likely that this mistake was made not
only in the current election, but two years ago as well.</TE>
<TE>   I'm concerned that problems affecting my children are also
affecting other new voters.</TE>

government, one of which has been the creation of tens of thousands
of government agencies, each with legions of bureaucrats who are
empowered to make us all jump through their hoops (e.g., the federal
government now tells bunk-bed manufacturers how to make a bunk bed),
with the further consequence of a relentless erosion of our
individual freedom to create businesses and jobs for ordinary people,
and to produce goods and services that people want and need and
enjoy.</TE>

<LD>I have to salute Caitlin Orr for her beliefs against a war on Iraq

I too strongly oppose war on Iraq, and I think that giving peace a

what the government thinks.</LD>

happening in our world right now and is standing up for what she
believes in. It is rare nowadays to see young people in high school
take part in supporting a specific issue.</LD>
<LD>   I am extremely interested in politics, but I feel that my friends
are not. Where I go to school, Sunny Hills High, students are more
concerned about how hard today's trigonometry test was than about the
threat of war.</LD>
<TE>   Orr is setting an example to other teenagers across America that
there is an alternative to war and violence and we should be aware of
what is happening around the world, not show concern only about
ourselves and our interests. Thank you, Daniel Yi, for showing that
there are teenagers who are concerned about current issues.</TE>

<HD>Bands Conquer the Bowl</HD>
<DH>High school groups compete at Hollywood landmark a day
before marching in annual Christmas parade.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saturday morning, 1,400 high school band members stood inside the
storied shell of the Hollywood Bowl, performing their hearts out
solely for the right to say, "Yea, I've played the bowl."</LD>
<LD>   It didn't matter that virtually no one was in the audience, except
a few camera-toting parents.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't matter that the Hollywood Bowl was shut down for the
season. Even the soggy benches and murky puddles of rainwater that
dirtied their uniforms didn't seem to bother them.</LD>
<TE>   What mattered most to these young musicians from as far away as
Albany, N.Y., was that for one heart-pounding moment, they made music
on the same stage where Luciano Pavarotti and Itzhak Perlman, the
Beatles and the Beach Boys have performed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like such an adrenaline rush," said snare drummer Gideon
Porter of the Milan, Ohio, Edison High School marching band. "I feel
like one of those stars that put their hands in the sidewalk."</TE>
<TE>   The Bands at the Bowl competition was part of a busy roster of
activities for nine of the marching bands that will perform tonight
in the 71st Hollywood Christmas Parade, sponsored by the Hollywood
Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of thousands of spectators are expected to line stretches
of Hollywood and Sunset boulevards for the annual parade, which
features celebrities in convertibles, bands, equestrians and the star
of the event, Santa Claus.</TE>
<TE>   For the marching bands, the parade culminates months of
fund-raising and preparing for what, for many, is a first-time trip
to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "This is so nerve-racking; it's such a big deal," said Stefanie
Czelusniak, 15, of the Amsterdam, N.Y., high school marching band.
"Just think of all the famous people who have performed here --
Aerosmith, Britney Spears....I mean, that's what I heard, Britney
Spears."</TE>
<TE>   Close. Britney Spears was scheduled to perform at the bowl in July
2000, but canceled to perform at the Great Western Forum.</TE>
<TE>   Parade organizers selected 20 bands from the 60 that submitted
tapes of their music and performances, looking for talent as well as
representatives from a cross-section of the country. Nine of the
bands decided to participate in Saturday's competition at the bowl.</TE>
<TE>   From the Chamber of Commerce's perspective, the more bands that
perform, the more publicity they can generate for Hollywood
Boulevard. In past years, the parade has been televised in up to 130
cities, and many towns got a chance to see their schools in a
Hollywood performance. This year, however, a network television
special will be taped during the parade with no promises that band
performances will be shown in the Dec. 8 NBC broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not about TV, say band members and their directors. This
weekend is a chance to travel to the big city, to perform in one of
the biggest parades in the nation, go to Disneyland, see the "Lion
King."</TE>
<TE>   "Just to be told, 'Yes, your band is good enough to be selected'
is rewarding," said Stephanie Ossenfort, who has directed the
Amsterdam band for eight years. "It's the biggest thing I've ever
done."</TE>
<TE>   The 180-member Center Grove High School Band from Greenwood, Ind.,
took first place in the competition, followed by the Comeaux High
School band from Lafayette, La., and Crestview High School band from
Crestview, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   When 15-year-old flutist Erica Kassner of Bay Port High School in
Green Bay, Wis., took the stage, she became overwhelmed.</TE>
<TE>   "I got this huge head rush," she said. "My heart is pounding
because I know how many famous people have been here. And then your
mind forgets the first note, but you start playing anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the shell, the pounding drums reverberated through their
chests, and those on wind instruments could feel the percussion
through their mouthpiece. On stage they could hear the horns, the
trumpets, the flutes resonating their scores.</TE>
<TE>   "We are usually spread out over a field and can't hear all the
parts," Kassner said.</TE>
<TE>   Conductor and composer Bill Conti, who won an Oscar for the film
score to "The Right Stuff" and has conducted the Academy Awards
orchestra, took the stage to lead the bands in one big rendition of
patriotic music.</TE>
<TE>   But the youths gave him the loudest applause for his student
achievement. He earned a scholarship to Louisiana State University,
where he played the bassoon in the marching band.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the bowl scene, Kassner of Green Bay said she will
always remember that she wore a T-shirt over Thanksgiving weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so cold when we left that putting your mouth on a flute
was like sticking your tongue on a frozen pipe," she said.</TE>

<HD>'Bambi' Suffers Another Setback</HD>
<DH>The ex-cop, still trying to clear her name in a murder, has
a foot amputated after a fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Playboy bunny and ex-Milwaukee cop still seeking to clear
her name in a 20-year-old murder had her right foot amputated after a
fall from a Los Angeles hotel window, her lawyer said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   It's the latest chapter in the strange life of Laurie "Bambi"
Bembenek,whose story inspired a TV movie starring Tatum O'Neal.
Bembenek was in Los Angeles for an appearance on the "Dr. Phil"
television show, which had offered to pay for a series of DNA tests
that Bembenek hoped would exonerate her.</LD>
<LD>   Bembenek was convicted of killing her ex-husband's first wife,
Christine Schultz, in 1981. She was sentenced to life in prison but
escaped in 1990, seeking asylum in Canada. A deal reached with
prosecutors in 1992 allowed her to return to the U.S., where she was
allowed to plead no contest to second-degree murder and to serve the
remaining 10 years of that sentence on parole.</LD>
<TE>   After completing that parole in April, Bembenek asked the court
for DNA testing on a number of items, including a bullet retrieved
from Schultz's body and the clothing Schultz was wearing when she was
killed.</TE>
<TE>   A judge granted Bembenek's request, and "Dr. Phil" agreed to pay
for the expedited tests in exchange for Bembenek's appearance on the
show.</TE>
<TE>   Bembenek's lawyer, Mary Woehler, said Saturday that Bembenek was
in Los Angeles Nov. 10 for the show's taping when she cracked two
bones and cut an artery in her right foot after apparently falling
from the hotel window. Woehler would not say where the operation took
place.</TE>
<TE>   Woehler said that the "Dr. Phil" staff had taken Bembenek to a
different hotel than they'd promised and subjected the former police
officer to "constant videotaping and a 24-hour-a-day guard."</TE>
<TE>   "My client has post-traumatic stress disorder, from years of
incarceration and months of solitary confinement in Wisconsin
prisons," Woehler said, and reacted negatively to the surveillance.
In addition, Woehler said, "She's slightly claustrophobic. She told
them to stop. Then she panicked, and tried to get out a window. She
fell and severely injured her foot, which has now been amputated."</TE>
<TE>   The executive producer of "Dr. Phil" issued a written statement
saying: "It is unfortunate she hurt her leg during an apparent prank
when she left her room through a first-floor window ... rather than
using the front door."</TE>
<TE>   A hearing for Bembenek, who has charged that she was framed for
murder by her police colleagues because she was assisting a federal
investigation into corruption and sex discrimination in the Milwaukee
Police Department, will be held Dec. 16 in Milwaukee.</TE>

<HD>Condor Found Dead Under Power Line</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATASCADERO</DL>
<LD>A 3-year-old female California condor released in the wilds of Big
Sur two years ago was found dead Saturday under a power line with
burn marks on its feathers, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The death of the endangered bird brings the total number of
condors in the wild to just 73, said Kelly Sorenson, executive
director of the Ventana Wilderness Society, a nonprofit group that
rehabilitates and releases birds into the wild. There are now 126
condors in captivity.</LD>
<LD>   It is believed the condor died about 10 a.m. when power in the
immediate area went out, Sorenson said. The bird had a hole in its
chest that may have come from the high voltage of the power line, he
said.</LD>
<TE>   "The bird was seen feeding and was alive and well just this
morning," Sorenson said.</TE>
<TE>   A necropsy will be performed at the San Diego Zoological Society.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, three California condor chicks were found dead
from unknown causes in the Los Padres National Forest. The chicks
were the first condors to be laid and hatched in the wild since 1984
as part of a recovery program by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   The Fish and Wildlife Service and two private nonprofit groups,
the Ventana Wilderness Society and the Peregrine Fund, operate the
only captive breeding facilities in the United States with condor
release programs.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-year-old condor that died Saturday was released in March
2000 when it was a year old.</TE>
<TE>   The bird had been monitored on a weekly basis from an aircraft
while a ground crew of biologists observed it from the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to expect mortality every year, it's just a part of
life," Sorenson said.</TE>
<TE>   Of 33 condors released into the wild by the Ventana Wilderness
Society, three have died -- all from collisions with power lines,
Sorenson said. Seven have returned to captivity, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining 23 condors have started approaching their breeding
age of 6.</TE>
<TE>   Seven more condors are expected to be released Dec. 12, Sorenson
said.</TE>
<TE>   The latest death came as a surprise because condors released since
1995 receive "power pole avoidance training," which includes a mock
power pole that delivers a mild shock to the young condors.</TE>
<TE>   California condors, which can live up to 50 years in the wild,
have a low reproductive rate.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the condors, which pose no threat to humans, play an
important role in cleaning the ecosystem as scavengers because they
eat the remains of dead animals that harbor disease.</TE>

<HD>Oasis to Be Envied</HD>
<DH>Santa Ana's Floral Park enclave works hard for its look and
draws a little fire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its emerald lawns, themed street signs and annual home tours,
Floral Park looks like it was dropped into the wrong city.</LD>
<LD>   The neighborhood is largely white, some homes go for more than $1
million and house hunters take a pass on Newport Beach and South
County gated communities for a chance at an address there.</LD>
<LD>   It's a far cry from the churro vendors, fruit stands and
check-cashing businesses that dot the landscape elsewhere in Santa
Ana. That contrast has made Floral Park an object of both envy and
anger.</LD>
<TE>   "You go to Floral Park and you see nothing out of place," said Sam
Romero, an activist for Santa Ana's nearby working-class Logan
neighborhood. "Some of those folks rub elbows with the [big] wheels.
They consistently vote. They are the 'right' kind of people."</TE>
<TE>   In a city that is 74% Latino, with a vast immigrant community,
Floral Park's demographics are nearly the opposite. Home prices are
nearly double the median sticker elsewhere in town. Traffic
barricades discourage outsiders from passing through.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing noise and traffic, Floral Park residents went to court
this year to block construction of a grade school on land marked for
upscale development. The opposition is so fierce that school trustee
Nativo Lopez believes some of the energy driving the recall campaign
against him is rooted in Floral Park.</TE>
<TE>   Said city resident Manuel Diaz, a cabdriver, "You do get the
feeling that there's an immense amount of wealth in just one part of
the city. You can hardly figure out a way to get into the
neighborhood. It's like it's off-limits to certain people."</TE>
<TE>   City officials say Floral Park takes an unfair rap as getting
special treatment in a city where so many have so little.</TE>
<TE>   "It's assumed, if you live north of 17th Street in Santa Ana, you
get something special. I think that's doubly assumed if you are in
Floral Park," said Pat McGuigan, whose 20 years of service on the
City Council ended last week. "The record, however, doesn't support
that."</TE>
<TE>   Planning Commissioner Chris Leo said Floral Park is simply the
best known of the city's good neighborhoods. "There are old
neighborhoods all over Santa Ana that people don't know about," he
said. "The residents are doctors, lawyers, judges -- people who chose
an urban lifestyle instead of sitting in a car."</TE>
<TE>   Floral Park, residents say, exemplifies how an older neighborhood
in an urban setting can retain its charms if residents pull together.
They stage an annual home tour, in which visitors pay for the right
to ogle the interiors of well-appointed homes. The tour raises about
$30,000, of which a part -- usually about $8,000 -- goes to charities
and scholarships. The rest goes for neighborhood improvements and
block parties.</TE>
<TE>   Other old neighborhoods in Santa Ana do the same. Residents in
nearby Park Santiago will hold their second home tour Dec. 8.
Residents north of Floral Park like to say they live in North Floral
Park.</TE>
<TE>   "People have a negative perception of the city.... The
neighborhoods want recognition as being different from what people
might think. We all get tired from the people saying, 'Is it safe
where you live?' " said Phil Schaefer, a Realtor. "Floral Park has
been the most aggressive to try to distinguish themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Residents in Floral Park have worked hard to preserve the flavor
of their community, where homes cost as much as $1.3 million and
styles run from English Tudor to Art Deco. Improvements began about
13 years ago with the formation of the Floral Park Neighborhood Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The association paid for the stylish street signs and painted the
backs of stop signs black so rust wouldn't show. The group is now
procuring outdoor lights to illuminate the street signs.</TE>
<TE>   Floral Park is an address for the powerful and the connected. They
include Mayor Miguel A. Pulido, state Sen. Joe Dunn and Peter and
Mary Muth, owners of Orco Block Co. and major benefactors to the
Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace and the Bowers museum.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Brotherton, CEO of Children's Hospital of Orange County,
passed on Newport Beach and Irvine in favor of Floral Park, where he
can walk to work.</TE>
<TE>   David Seigle, vice president of the Orange County Community
Foundation and a founder of the software firm FileNET, spent three
years house hunting with his wife, rejecting Old Towne Orange,
Hancock Park in Los Angeles and Belmont Shore in Long Beach before
buying in Floral Park.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowner association president John Schulte and his wife, Linda,
moved to Floral Park five years ago from a tract home in Dove Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we moved," said Schulte, "I felt I had turned a corner. It
was like I was on the set for 'Leave it to Beaver.' "</TE>

<HD>A Man's Dream of 'Giving Back' Takes Root</HD>
<DH>Aided by donated labor and goods, publisher creates a
garden where children can grow food for the poor. Now all he needs
are the kids.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During his morning workouts at the YMCA in Newport Beach, Bruce Royer
used to let his mind wander.</LD>
<LD>   He thought about the lazy summer days on his great-grandfather's
orchard in Orange more than 30 years ago. He reflected on what seemed
to have been a simpler time in Orange County, when land was used to
grow food, when people had time to tend to gardens, and their
neighbors too.</LD>
<LD>   One day Royer decided to put the daydreams aside, roll up his
sleeves and make an effort to get back to those simpler times -- even
if it came in the form of a small sliver of land at the Y, next to
the volleyball pits.</LD>
<TE>   Royer asked the Central Orange Coast YMCA if he could develop an
organic garden on the land, bring in children to cultivate the crops
and give most of the food to the poor, saving maybe a bit of broccoli
now and again to saute for himself.</TE>
<TE>   If only Royer had known the first thing about gardening.</TE>
<TE>   But he didn't let that slow down his dreams. He threw himself into
the work, hauling away dead brush and leaves. He checked out books
from the library and learned the basics.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to give back, to give of myself, and I wanted to learn
about organic gardening," said Royer, a 45-year-old photo book
publisher. "I started doing this myself, and I kept going and going."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his lack of gardening prowess and his still-evolving
dreams, Royer said, he was driven by a the simple desire of giving.</TE>
<TE>   He called businesses and leaned on them for help. His efforts paid
off. They donated fencing, railroad ties, wood chips and fertilizer,
as well as the free use of rented equipment to level the land.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one man can do only so much. And Royer might still be out
on the field had Men's Divisions International, a nonprofit
organization dedicated to teaching values, not come to his aid. The
group, which had been seeking a community project to take on,
dispatched 60 members to help Royer prepare the land for the growing
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I would probably still be out here working if it weren't for
them," said Royer.</TE>
<TE>   "Bruce pitched the idea to me. We loved it," said Adam Russo,
community service manager for the group. "The big thing to us was
that it would have an impact on kids who think vegetables come from
the grocery store. It was a lot of work, but it brought us a great
sense of accomplishment."</TE>
<TE>   About a month ago, Royer looked out past the grassy field and the
sand volleyball court and declared that he was pretty much done.</TE>
<TE>   There were eight raised gardening plots lined by railroad ties,
with wood chips carefully surrounding them.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the garden was the size of a small backyard. Not too big
but certainly big enough to provide an urban farming experience for
young people and -- with any luck -- a harvest that might put a few
meals on the table.</TE>
<TE>   Excitedly, Royer planted strawberries, cauliflower, spinach,
parsnips and carrots. Other vegetables, as well as blackberries and
raspberries, will come in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I have felt really good doing this project and being close to the
earth," said Royer. "It's a neat thing to grow your own food. You are
outside and you don't have all the pesticides and chemicals used in
the food we buy at the store. I feel this is a way to get in
control."</TE>
<TE>   After the planting, Royer went to the YMCA day after day and ran
out to the garden, staring and staring at the dirt for signs of life.</TE>
<TE>   Recently he saw some green fuzz poking through dirt.</TE>
<TE>   "That's it!" he cried.</TE>
<TE>   It was a moment of victory for Royer, who -- with the first sign
of a crop to come -- is rushing to round up the team of young farmers
he hopes will watch over the harvest and find a way to distribute the
food to those who need it.</TE>
<TE>   He has called local school districts, the Boy Scouts and several
local private schools. But there's red tape to cut in each case, so
-- except for one Scout who showed up one day to help -- Royer has
been on his own. He is confident, though, that help will eventually
arrive, as will the hungry mouths.</TE>
<TE>   Central Orange Coast YMCA Executive Director Jon Voget said it is
possible that children involved in Y programs will work in the garden
in the near future. He is unaware of other YMCAs with community
gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "We are really here to try to promote community opportunity,"
Voget said. "We wanted to open the garden to anyone in the community
who is interested. A lot of it now is getting the word out."</TE>
<TE>   Royer has faith that the effort will pay dividends.</TE>
<TE>   "When I die," he said, "I would like to see that I did something
to give instead of to take."</TE>

<LD>At a dress rehearsal last week for the Crystal Cathedral's annual
"Glory of Christmas" pageant, a tender moment passed unnoticed amid
the camels, herds of sheep and goats on stage, and the eight angels
flying 80 feet above.</LD>
<LD>   There on the hills of the set, a shepherdess looked down on her
real-life 13-year-old daughter singing "Silent Night" under the glare
of a single spotlight. Shary McDonald thought about the five years
her child has spent fighting brain and spinal cancer: the four
surgeries, 30 radiation treatments, the high-dose chemotherapy and
the stem-cell transplant.</LD>
<LD>   "I had a big lump in my throat," said McDonald, whose daughter
Meta will be a soloist twice during the monthlong run of "The Glory
of Christmas," which began Friday at the church in Garden Grove.</LD>
<TE>   "You always want your child to succeed and live a normal life. And
we've tried to give her that as best we can." The singing role is
nice for Meta, whose disease is in "guarded remission," but it's not
the world's biggest deal. "I won't be too nervous," said the skinny
teenager with wispy blond hair and pristine voice.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother added the obvious: "After what she's been through,
nothing makes her too nervous."</TE>
<TE>   The story of the McDonalds is one of the many behind-the-scenes
dramas unfolding during this year's edition of "The Glory of
Christmas," a Southern California holiday tradition that's viewed as
either sublime or just a little tacky -- or even some of both.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 200 performers, a menagerie of live animals (and
shepherds who scoop up after them), 17 musical numbers and angels
darting overhead at speeds of up to 20 mph, the pageant tells the
Gospel story of the birth of Jesus on a spectacular scale.</TE>
<TE>   To recreate the Bethlehem star's beam, for instance, a 2,000-watt
spotlight shines through an open 90-foot cathedral door near the
play's end.</TE>
<TE>   The rigging takes two weeks of round-the-clock work, organizers
say.</TE>
<TE>   The elaborate production, which costs $2 million and operates in
the black, reflects the power-of-positive-thinking philosophy of the
Rev. Robert H. Schuller. The church's senior pastor started his
Southern California ministry in 1955 at the Orange Drive-In theater,
built the award-winning glass cathedral 22 years ago in Garden Grove
and is the author of more than 30 self-help books, including "Turning
Hurts Into Halos."</TE>
<TE>   The mostly volunteer cast of hundreds comes from the Crystal
Cathedral congregation and other Southern California churches. Many
are pageant veterans, working their way up over the years from the
mundane jobs -- such as marching in the background as a Roman solider
-- to prized roles that include commanding Roman troops astride a
horse.</TE>
<TE>   As big of a spectacle as the 23rd annual pageant is, there are
smaller stories, like the one involving Meta McDonald, that can be
found behind the mammoth sets. Here are a few:</TE>
<TE>   The Professional</TE>
<TE>   Richard Kinsey, digging in a plastic tackle box for his theatrical
makeup, pulled out some talcum powder and a brush and dusted his face
in front of a long mirror in a subterranean Crystal Cathedral office.
Aside from the church setting, it's a familiar routine for the
48-year-old actor, who starred in "Les Miserables" on Broadway and in
the touring show for seven years, and has a long list of other
theater credits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good gig," said Kinsey, who plays Joseph. He is one of a
small group of professional actors with singing or acting roles paid
scale for their work.</TE>
<TE>   Kinsey sees other advantages to a Crystal Cathedral production: He
gets to work with his wife and 7-year-old daughter, who also landed
parts in the show, and "the kindness here is overwhelming." In
contrast to the backstage traditions in most theaters, "You're not
going to hear four-letter words here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that the show, however popular, might not be
regarded by the discriminating as high art. But, "for someone not to
be moved by this production, you'd have to have a heart made out of
stone."</TE>
<TE>   Associate Producer</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Dunn watched the dress rehearsal, just a few days before
opening night, with a relaxed demeanor that comes from 20 years of
working on the show.</TE>
<TE>   She is the associate producer of "The Glory of Christmas," and its
springtime cousin, "The Glory of Easter." She's also the daughter of
Robert H. Schuller and wife of Paul David Dunn, who wrote and directs
the Christmas pageant.</TE>
<TE>   The first thing she points out to a visitor is the latest
generation of children in the production.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our hopes when we started was to get this to last at least
15 years," she said. "By then children who began with us will bring
their own children." And, she added, the same pattern of renewal has
been established within the audiences, a sign that helps ensure the
production's long-term future.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn estimates that 150,000 people will see "The Glory of
Christmas" this year, including 18,000 schoolchildren from low-income
areas who will see the play for free.</TE>
<TE>   The audiences are less demanding that the professional critics,
whose often-unflattering writings Dunn has to absorb each year. Among
the comments appearing in The Times: "The star of Bethlehem looks
like a vulgar rhinestone pin," and " ... a nonstop flow of high-tech
bombast and directionless action." Even some compliments were
delivered backhanded: " ... this spectacle far outstrips almost
anything at nearby Disneyland."</TE>
<TE>   A recurring complaint is that the elaborate production is at odds
with the humble story of God becoming a helpless baby in order to
save the world.</TE>
<TE>   It's criticism that Dunn disagrees with, arguing that while the
birth as described in scripture was humble, the events surrounding it
were undeniably spectacular.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you saw angels and kings bringing gifts, you wouldn't
think this [production] was humble enough," Dunn said with a smile.
"The perception that the birth of Jesus was a humble event is wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The Family</TE>
<TE>   Each member of the Martz family won a role in this year's pageant.
Kelly, 10, and Daniel, 6, play young shepherds, mother Tammy plays
the trumpet, and father Bruce plays a camel-riding king, a coveted
role.</TE>
<TE>   "I started out as a Roman, like everyone else," said Martz, who
grows a beard each year for his role. "But now I'm a king."</TE>
<TE>   Tammy said the forced family time together -- up to six hours a
day when the commute to and from their home in Corona is factored in
-- is a major benefit of performing.</TE>
<TE>   "We do it as a family thing," Tammy said. "We drive here together,
eat together, rehearse together."</TE>
<TE>   They also use the pageant as Christian outreach for friends who
don't go to church but will come to see the family perform.</TE>
<TE>   There's a little internal disagreement over the worth of this
family holiday ritual, however. Daniel admits to being less than
thrilled with the experience. "I just go on stage and be bored," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel</TE>
<TE>   With her long, flowing, blond hair, white and gold robes, and wide
smile, Karen Crane has flown gracefully over "The Glory of Christmas"
audience for the last decade, her body suspended by a
state-of-the-art wire system.</TE>
<TE>   "I can hear the oohs and aahs," Crane said, adding that sometimes
the chemistry between her character, the angel Gabriel, and Mary is
"so intense that the audience can feel it. It's very powerful."</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old premed student at La Sierra University in
Riverside first read about auditions in the church bulletin. Though
she first thought of trying out as a dancer, she couldn't resist the
chance to be an angel.</TE>
<TE>   "You can dance anywhere," Crane said, "but I don't know too many
places where you can fly."</TE>

<HD>Passion Plays Role in 'Glory'</HD>

<LD>At a dress rehearsal last week for the Crystal Cathedral's annual
"Glory of Christmas" pageant, a tender moment passed unnoticed amid
the camels, herds of sheep and goats on stage, and the eight angels
flying 80 feet above.</LD>
<LD>   There on the hills of the set, a shepherdess looked down on her
real-life 13-year-old daughter singing "Silent Night" under the glare
of a single spotlight. Shary McDonald thought about the five years
her child has spent fighting brain and spinal cancer: the four
surgeries, 30 radiation treatments, the high-dose chemotherapy and
the stem-cell transplant.</LD>
<LD>   "I had a big lump in my throat," said McDonald, whose daughter
Meta will be a soloist twice during the monthlong run of "Glory of
Christmas," which began Friday at the church in Garden Grove. "You
always want your child to succeed and live a normal life. And we've
tried to give her that as best we can."</LD>
<TE>   The singing role is nice for Meta, whose disease is in "guarded
remission," but it's not the world's biggest deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't be too nervous," said the skinny teenager with wispy
blond hair and pristine voice.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother added the obvious: "After what she's been through,
nothing makes her too nervous."</TE>
<TE>   The story of the McDonalds is one of the many behind-the-scenes
dramas unfolding during this year's edition of "The Glory of
Christmas," a Southern California holiday tradition that's viewed as
either sublime or just a little tacky -- or even some of both.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 200 performers, a menagerie of live animals (and
shepherds who scoop up after them), 17 musical numbers and angels
darting overhead at speeds of up to 20 mph, the pageant tells the
Gospel story of the birth of Jesus on a spectacular scale.</TE>
<TE>   To recreate the Bethlehem star's beam, for instance, a 2,000-watt
spotlight shines through an open 90-foot cathedral door near the
play's end.</TE>
<TE>   The rigging takes two weeks of round-the-clock work, organizers
say.</TE>
<TE>   The elaborate production, which costs $2 million and operates in
the black, reflects the power-of-positive-thinking philosophy of the
Rev. Robert H. Schuller. The church's senior pastor started his
Southern California ministry in 1955 at the Orange Drive-In theater,
built the award-winning glass cathedral 22 years ago in Garden Grove
and is the author of more than 30 self-help books, including "Turning
Hurts Into Halos."</TE>
<TE>   The mostly volunteer cast of hundreds comes from the Crystal
Cathedral congregation and other Southern California churches. Many
are pageant veterans, working their way up over the years from the
mundane jobs -- such as marching in the background as a Roman solider
-- to prized roles that include commanding Roman troops astride a
horse.</TE>
<TE>   As big a spectacle as the 23rd annual pageant is, there are
smaller stories, like the one involving Meta McDonald, that can be
found behind the mammoth sets. Here are a few:</TE>
<TE>   The Professional</TE>
<TE>   Richard Kinsey, digging in a plastic tackle box for his theatrical
makeup, pulled out some talcum powder and a brush and dusted his face
in front of a long mirror in a subterranean Crystal Cathedral office.
Aside from the church setting, it's a familiar routine for the
48-year-old actor, who starred in "Les Miserables" on Broadway and in
the touring show for seven years, and has a long list of other
theater credits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good gig," said Kinsey, who plays Joseph. He is one of a
small group of professional actors with singing or acting roles paid
union scale for their work.</TE>
<TE>   Kinsey sees other advantages to a Crystal Cathedral production: He
gets to work with his wife and 7-year-old daughter, who also landed
parts in the show, and "the kindness here is overwhelming." In
contrast to the backstage traditions in most theaters, "You're not
going to hear four-letter words here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that the show, however popular, might not be
regarded by the discriminating as high art. But, "for someone not to
be moved by this production, you'd have to have a heart made out of
stone."</TE>
<TE>   Associate Producer</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Dunn watched the dress rehearsal, just a few days before
opening night, with a relaxed demeanor that comes from 20 years of
working on the show.</TE>
<TE>   She is the associate producer of "The Glory of Christmas," and its
springtime cousin, "The Glory of Easter." She's also the daughter of
Robert H. Schuller and wife of Paul David Dunn, who wrote and directs
the Christmas pageant.</TE>
<TE>   The first thing she points out to a visitor is the latest
generation of children in the production.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our hopes when we started was to get this to last at least
15 years," she said. "By then children who began with us will bring
their own children." And, she added, the same pattern of renewal has
been established in the audiences, a sign that helps ensure the
production's future.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn estimates that 150,000 people will see "The Glory of
Christmas" this year, including 18,000 schoolchildren from low-income
areas who will see the play for free.</TE>
<TE>   The audiences are less demanding than the professional critics,
whose often-unflattering writings Dunn has to absorb each year. Among
the comments appearing in The Times: "The star of Bethlehem looks
like a vulgar rhinestone pin," and " ... a nonstop flow of high-tech
bombast and directionless action." Even some compliments were
delivered backhanded: " ... this spectacle far outstrips almost
anything at nearby Disneyland."</TE>
<TE>   A recurring complaint is that the elaborate production is at odds
with the humble story of God becoming a helpless baby in order to
save the world.</TE>
<TE>   It's criticism that Dunn disagrees with, arguing that while the
birth as described in Scripture was humble, the events surrounding it
were undeniably spectacular.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you saw angels and kings bringing gifts, you wouldn't
think this [production] was humble enough," said Dunn with a smile.
"The perception that the birth of Jesus was a humble event is wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The Family</TE>
<TE>   Each member of the Martz family won a role in this year's pageant.
Kelly, 10, and Daniel, 6, play young shepherds, mother Tammy plays
the trumpet, and husband Bruce plays a camel-riding king.</TE>
<TE>   "I started out as a Roman, like everyone else," said Martz, who
grows a beard each year for his role. "But now I'm a king."</TE>
<TE>   Tammy says the forced family time together -- up to six hours a
day when the commute to and from their home in Corona is factored in
-- is a major benefit of performing.</TE>
<TE>   "We do it as a family thing," Tammy said. "We drive here together,
eat together, rehearse together." They also use the pageant as
Christian outreach for friends who don't go to church but will come
to see the family perform.</TE>
<TE>   There's a little internal disagreement over the worth of this
family holiday ritual, however. Daniel admits to being less than
thrilled. "I just go on stage and be bored," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel</TE>
<TE>   With her long, flowing, blond hair, white and gold robes, and wide
smile, Karen Crane has flown gracefully over "The Glory of Christmas"
audience for the last decade, her body suspended by a
state-of-the-art wire system.</TE>
<TE>   "I can hear the oohs and aahs," Crane said, adding that sometimes
the chemistry among her character, the angel Gabriel, and Mary is "so
intense that the audience can feel it. It's very powerful."</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old premed student at La Sierra University in
Riverside first read about auditions in the church bulletin. Though
she first thought of trying out as a dancer, she couldn't resist the
chance to be an angel.</TE>
<TE>   "You can dance anywhere," Crane said, "but I don't know too many
places where you can fly."</TE>

<LD>There were no books in Alicia Flores' childhood home in Mexico. The
only ones she saw were at school. By ninth grade, when she went to
work in the Zacatecas cornfields, school and schoolbooks were over
for her.</LD>
<LD>   No one ever read Flores a story -- not once. So now when the
30-year-old mother tries to read to her two small daughters, she has
no model. She lacks confidence. "I don't know what to do," she said
softly in Spanish. "I want them to love books."</LD>
<LD>   So each Thursday morning she heads to Sharpe Elementary School in
Pacoima to sit in a classroom with 16 other mothers, most of whom are
recent immigrants too -- from El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   They come to the school for a free program called FamilyRead,
which is designed to help them build skills that can make reading a
part of their family life. In the class, conducted in Spanish, the
women take turns reading aloud. When one stumbles on a word, the
others rush in to help.</TE>
<TE>   FamilyRead is about literacy. It's also about community. Many of
the women live isolated lives, unable to speak English, at home alone
with their children.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about the only outlet for these women," said teacher
Martha Gurule.</TE>
<TE>   In each class, she tells the women that no subject is off-limits,
no opinion wrong. They listen. A discussion about a picture book can,
in a single moment, prompt a confession about an abusive husband or
about loneliness.</TE>
<TE>   FamilyRead is one of many programs offered by Friends of the
Family, a family resource center in Van Nuys celebrating its 30th
anniversary. The center, which serves 8,000 adults and children, is
one of 56 charities in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino
and Ventura counties that received money from last year's Los Angeles
Times Holiday Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of the Family is a community safety net, offering
individual counseling, programs for teen mothers and fathers, classes
to help mothers and their just-turning-teen daughters communicate and
programs to give young boys the tools they need to solve problems
constructively in school and at home. Help comes in English, Spanish
and Armenian.</TE>
<TE>   As their children sit on the other side of a partition, watching
cartoons, the women in the Pacoima classroom learn to look at a book
and recognize its main themes. Conversation flows.</TE>
<TE>   On this morning, a book about a child visiting grandparents at
their ranch in Mexico strikes a chord. The ranch has no electricity
or running water. Most of the women grew up without these things.
"They want everything for their children," Gurule said. "They had so
little themselves."</TE>
<TE>   This holiday season, The Times is highlighting agencies that
benefit from its fund-raising campaign established in 2000, which is
part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund.</TE>

<HD>More Elected Than Appointed Judges Disciplined in '90s</HD>
<DH>The first examination by state commission finds a
relationship between sanctions for ethical misconduct and a jurist's
path to bench.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elected judges are more likely to be disciplined for unethical
conduct than appointed judges, according to the first-ever study by
California's judicial disciplinary agency.</LD>
<LD>   Ethics experts suspect one reason is that elected judges get less
scrutiny from voters than their appointed colleagues receive from
governors, who rely on the State Bar of California to vet potential
appointees. Governors are also keenly aware that their political
legacies are shaped in part by the quality of their appointees to the
bench.</LD>
<LD>   The study, conducted by the state Commission on Judicial
Performance, found that nine of the state's 184 initially elected
judges, or nearly 5%, were disciplined in 1999, compared to 32 of the
state's 1,414 initially appointed judges, or 2%.</LD>
<TE>   Those statistics confirm that "the [gubernatorial] evaluation
process is working and doing something that the electoral process is
not doing," said J. Clark Kelso, a professor at McGeorge School of
Law in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's study, released last month, offers an
unprecedented look at the state's judicial discipline process, most
of which is conducted in private through secret admonishments and
advisory letters to errant judges. The study provides a statistical
look at the 499 cases between 1990 and 1999 that resulted in either
public or private discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Never before has the 11-member commission compiled and made public
this kind of statistical data, ranging from the age and experience
level of judges who are disciplined to the types of misconduct most
likely to result in sanctions. The study's most significant finding
was the relationship between discipline and a judge's path to the
bench.</TE>
<TE>   Although the commission's director declined to speculate publicly
on the study's findings, ethics experts agree that the discrepancy
between elected and appointed judges may reflect the high quality of
the judicial appointment process.</TE>
<TE>   Besides undergoing an exhaustive review by the governor's staff,
judicial nominees are evaluated by a State Bar of California panel
that uses an extensive survey process and personal interviews.
Governors have rarely appointed judges rated "not qualified" by the
bar's Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   But neither the appointment nor election method of selection is
foolproof. Michael E. Platt, who was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson in
1994, was removed from the bench in August for fixing traffic tickets
and trying to improperly influence another judge. Three months later,
San Joaquin County voters reelected him to the court with 60% of the
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Most judges are initially appointed by the governor to fill
vacancies created by the retirement or death of a sitting judge. As
incumbents, they usually are reelected without opposition every six
years.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than 10% of California's 1,610 judgeships were filled in
contested elections in 1996, 1998 and 2000, according to a 2001
Judicial Council of California study.</TE>
<TE>   Further, the political skills needed to win a contested judicial
election may contrast sharply with those needed to be a good judge,
creating potential ethical problems, observed Cynthia Gray, director
of the American Judicature Society's Center for Judicial Ethics in
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "The political system rewards people who are good politicians and
not necessarily good judges," Gray said. "And good judges are not
necessarily good politicians."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, attorneys who successfully challenge sitting judges
may not receive warm welcomes from their new colleagues and, as a
result, have no place to turn for advice on the difficult ethical
issues they may face as new judges, retired Los Angeles County
Superior Court Judge David Rothman said.</TE>
<TE>   Giving weight to the popular image of the older, wiser jurist, the
study found that judges in their 30s and those in their third through
sixth year on the bench are more likely than others to get in ethical
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Most new California judges get hands-on attention and educational
opportunities, experts say. They must attend a one-week orientation,
half of which is devoted to ethics issues, and a two-week Judges
College with an ethics update and fairness issues sprinkled
throughout the curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is that ethics and fairness are the essence of being a
judge," said Rothman, the state's leading authority on judicial
ethics and a frequent lecturer on the topic.</TE>
<TE>   Judges in smaller courts also are much more likely to be
disciplined than those in larger courts, the study found.</TE>
<TE>   There are 15 California counties with only two authorized
judgeships each. Of those, 17 judges, or 57%, were disciplined during
the 1990s, according to the study. In courts with more than 42
judges, there were 294 discipline cases from among the 1,017
authorized judgeships in the same period, or a 29% discipline rate,
the statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be in part the anonymity of large courts," Kelso said.
"Justice in small counties tends to be more personal than in large
counties.... Those personal connections, if you are not careful, can
be ethical traps."</TE>
<TE>   In large courts, judicial assignment may be tailored to a judge's
expertise or temperament, while rural judges handle all the matters
that come before them, Rothman said.</TE>
<TE>   Inappropriate demeanor in the courtroom accounted for 13% of the
judicial discipline cases in the study, followed by bias or the
appearance of bias toward one party in a dispute that is unrelated to
gender or racial discrimination, which accounted for 10% of the
cases.</TE>
<TE>   In 9% of the misconduct, judges failed to disqualify themselves
from a case or disclose a relationship with the parties.</TE>
<TE>   Judges also are commonly sanctioned for abusing their authority on
the bench and communicating privately with one side in a dispute
without the other's knowledge, the study showed. Other reasons for
disciplinary action included failure to render prompt decisions or
ensure the legal rights of litigants, improper use of judicial office
to get special treatment outside of court, and abuse of contempt
powers.</TE>
<TE>   Rothman said it is particularly difficult to train judges on these
issues because there are no clear-cut rules. He said he receives
calls from judges seeking ethical advice on such issues as whether to
disqualify themselves from cases or accept gifts from attorneys. "I
don't get calls from a judge saying, 'I'm about to abuse my
authority,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Anonymous tips resulted in more disciplinary actions than any
other category of complaints, including those from litigants, said
Victoria B. Henley, the commission's director and chief counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than 2% of the complaints received each year come from
anonymous tips and news stories, but 13% of the disciplinary actions
meted out in the 1990s were prompted by such tips, the study shows.
By contrast, litigants filed 79% of the complaints in the same
period, but such complaints produced only 35% of the disciplinary
cases.</TE>
<TE>   Henley and others speculate that lawyers, court staff and other
judges may provide many of the anonymous complaints, because they
fear repercussions if they are identified.</TE>

<HD>2 Doctors Take a Shot at a Huge Challenge: Serving the
Needy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Each doctor was looking at roughly a quarter of a million dollars
worth of debt as they completed their residencies last year at
California Hospital Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   "What are you going to do?" Dr. Susan Morris, a white woman from
Northern California, asked Dr. Timothy Lee, a black man from Kansas.</LD>
<LD>   Despite more lucrative offers, Lee said he was thinking of doing
something risky, if not nuts. He was going to open a small family
practice in a neighborhood virtually abandoned by the medical
community.</LD>
<TE>   Need a partner? asked Morris, who is nice enough, if not always of
sound mind.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a year later, the two-doctor Baldwin Pacific Medical Group
is operating on the sixth floor of a Crenshaw district building that
has seen better days.</TE>
<TE>   So, how's it going?</TE>
<TE>   "Look at this," Morris says, showing me an insurance statement on
a $1,300 bill submitted by the doctors. The elderly patient had been
treated for diabetes, hypertension, degenerative joint disease,
depression and several other things you wouldn't wish on your worst
enemy.</TE>
<TE>   The reimbursement to the doctors?</TE>
<TE>   Twelve dollars ($12).</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it's insane. But there's a long list of crazy things in the
American health care system. Somewhere near the top is the fact that
it's hardest to do business in neighborhoods with the greatest
medical need.</TE>
<TE>   Every month, this particular patient's HMO Medi-Cal plan pays the
doctors $12, period. If they don't see the patient at all, they still
get the $12. But if they see the patient twice, four times, eight
times, even if it costs $1,300 to make that patient feel good again,
$12 is all the doctors get.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that almost everyone we see is really sick," says
Lee, which is no surprise, given the shutdown of L.A. County health
clinics. Then you've got a doctor-patient ratio south of the Santa
Monica Freeway rivaling those in some Third World countries.</TE>
<TE>   About one-third of their patients have coverage like that $12
plan, says Lee. About half have straight</TE>
<TE>   Medi-Cal, which is better, at around $30 a month. Roughly 5% have
no insurance at all and dig into their pockets for loose change.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, nearly 90% of their patients are costing them
money. The remainder have Medicare or a good HMO, but that's not
enough patients to offset the losses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tragic, but it's not surprising," says Linda Rosenstock,
dean of the UCLA School of Public Health. "What these young
physicians are facing is the pinnacle of all that's wrong and failing
with the system.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the richest country that's ever lived, and we're the only
developed country that does not provide universal access to health
care, even though we pay more per capita for it than any other
country."</TE>
<TE>   The trouble is: Morris and Lee are the end of a long line of
outstretched palms, starting with insurance companies, lawyers and
health-care conglomerates. If you think the system is about keeping
you healthy, you might want to consider a brain scan.</TE>
<TE>   Just open the paper, and what do you see? A patient dropping dead
after being refused a referral. Hack doctors doing unnecessary
surgery. Health care giants scamming the government like common
thieves.</TE>
<TE>   Morris, who's 40 and lives in Eagle Rock, and Lee, 33, of Windsor
Hills, face the handicap of trying to run an honest business in an
industry where no good deed goes unpunished.</TE>
<TE>   Are they frustrated? Of course they are. And tired too. In
addition to four days a week in the office, each doctor is working a
second job to earn some real money.</TE>
<TE>   Are they giving up the fight? No. They're improvising, doing
things that aren't taught in medical school.</TE>
<TE>   Neither one ever expected to leave fliers on doorsteps or star in
a traveling medicine show. They've been to a Sizzler, an IHOP, senior
centers and churches in South Los Angeles to preach a healthy
lifestyle and teach about diabetes and other chronic diseases. They
leave stacks of business cards wherever they go.</TE>
<TE>   "You're at the IHOP, and they're eating the pancakes with all the
butter and the syrup and a side of bacon," says Morris, "and you just
make sure never to take their blood pressure after that."</TE>
<TE>   But even with all the hustle, how is this going to pencil out?</TE>
<TE>   The trick with those $12 reimbursements, Lee says, is to build a
big enough pool of patients so you at least break even. If you've got
500 of them, for example, and 400 don't visit the office in a given
month, you're still collecting their $12. Meanwhile, you try to bag a
few more patients with decent insurance.</TE>
<TE>   They're closing in on 400 patients total, and Lee thinks they can
turn a profit if they hit 1,000. In the corporate lingo, they've
learned you need high volume and low acuity, meaning lots of patients
who aren't on death's door.</TE>
<TE>   But if a patient can't make it to the office, that's not a
problem. They make house calls. Morris met a man at a health fair who
was so sick, she later called to check up on him.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he couldn't get a ride to the office, so I told him,
'We'll come to you,' and that's how it got started."</TE>
<TE>   I accompanied Morris on a home visit to 104-year-old Etta Jones in
Lafayette Square. Jones, who often exclaims to Morris, "Lord Jesus, I
need some doctoring," was doing better this day. Morris put a
stethoscope to her chest and said:</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds like a Cadillac with 20,000 miles on it."</TE>
<TE>   Next we called on a blind man in the Baldwin Hills district known
as the Jungle, and young kids in bright red jackets eyeballed us as
if we were undercover cops. This is one of the reasons Morris' mother
sometimes asks when she's moving back home to Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   It ain't going to happen, Ma.</TE>
<TE>   "I have moments when I feel frustrated," Morris says, "But when I
see these people handle crisis with such poise and grace, and with
great resiliency under stress, I trust that we're in the right spot
and that we're doing the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Lee had known he wanted to be a doctor in a black community since
he was a boy in Kansas. He says he and his family had to wait until
their doctor saw all the white patients before he'd treat them, which
usually meant "tossing some pills at us."</TE>
<TE>   "Although there are a lot of obstacles, it's been worth it," says
Lee.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was to treat people who don't always have access to
quality care. We aren't going to get rich at it, but we're here and
we're not leaving."</TE>

<HD>Expanding Beyond Snow Business</HD>
<DH>Ski town aims to be a tony year-round resort, but many
residents could be priced out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Cart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MAMMOTH LAKES</DL>
<LD>The first stage of Mammoth's transformation from dowdy ski town to
swanky year-round resort will debut this winter with the grand
opening of a new town center dense with luxury condominiums, high-end
stores and tony restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   This portion of a planned billion-dollar make-over is what its
Canadian developer, Intrawest, says is the much-awaited realization
of Mammoth's potential.</LD>
<LD>   But many residents, planners and people in neighboring towns fear
that Mammoth's face lift will forever alter the visage of the Owens
Valley, bringing in welcome tourist dollars but also tourism's
related ills: traffic snarls, housing shortages, a higher cost of
living and greater demand for already scarce water.</LD>
<TE>   The town's setting at the head of the valley, deep in a cleft of
the Sierra between Mt. Whitney and Yosemite National Park, has always
beguiled visitors. Many residents are concerned about maintaining the
delicate balance between a secure economic future and preservation of
the Old West grandeur that has made the Owens Valley one of
California's scenic treasures.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, geography and history had discouraged the growth
that is marching up the Sierra's more accessible western flank. The
Owens Valley is cloistered between two mountain ranges. More than 90%
of the land in the middle is owned by the government. Much of the
valley's water has been piped south since Los Angeles grabbed the
rights to it in the early 1900s.</TE>
<TE>   The scarcity of private land and water has bid up the price of
living here, but that has hardly diminished the appeal for those who
can afford it. Intrawest's condominiums go for $300,000 and up, and
the company says it is selling them as fast as it can build them.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the remake is complete in 10 years, the town of
Mammoth Lakes, population 7,400, is expected to have grown 50%. And
in Bishop, 40 miles to the southeast, housing prices are already
soaring. In nearby hamlets such as Crowley Lake and Toms Place, new
homes for prospective Mammoth employees are sprouting on the
hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   The way town officials see it, construction of Mammoth's
world-class ski amenities would not be complete without the final
piece of the puzzle: an improved regional airport to ferry visitors
to the slopes and shops.</TE>
<TE>   The project to widen the airport's runway to accommodate Boeing
757s could cost more than $40 million. Officials envision four
flights a day bringing 33,000 visitors each winter. A lawsuit
challenging the expansion is making its way through U.S. District
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Water Demand Rising</TE>
<TE>   The town also wants to draw water from one of the region's most
beloved trout streams, Hot Creek, adding to what conservationists say
is a mounting list of growth's environmental effects. Even with water
from the creek, officials expect that the town will have to drill
more wells.</TE>
<TE>   The ski area needs water to feed the mountain, which requires
daily grooming and supplements of machine-made snow even during the
wettest winters. Mammoth Mountain gets its snowmaking water from five
wells it maintains on U.S. Forest Service land.</TE>
<TE>   Water is also needed for the town's new golf course.</TE>
<TE>   Even Mammoth's most devoted admirers admit that it was overdue for
sprucing up. The aging buildings are a hodgepodge of faux chalet
style mixed with A-frames. For many here, Intrawest's new complex
will be a welcome upgrade.</TE>
<TE>   The company's signature formula is a pedestrian-friendly
"village," with a core of shops and restaurants connected to the
company's condos. As it is now, visitors wishing to see the old part
of town need to dash across busy roads or drive. The new development
will free many people from their cars.</TE>
<TE>   But Pat Eckart, a former member of the Mammoth Water Board, says a
"mob mentality" has gripped town officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I puzzle over it, why we've fallen for a developer's vision,"
Eckart said. "There certainly is not enough water to support this
growth. Where is it coming from? No one seems to be paying
attention."</TE>
<TE>   Town officials -- who courted Intrawest -- say the company is
merely implementing Mammoth's own vision of its future.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a master plan for some time, and it involved
high-density housing and becoming a four-season destination, among
other things," said Mammoth's senior planner, Bill Taylor. "This is
our plan for ourselves, and Intrawest is a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Amy Horne, research director for the Sierra Business Council, sees
unexpected results of the plan. "If you look at growth in the Eastern
Sierra, it begins with Mammoth and radiates out," she said. "Housing
in Mono County is less affordable, particularly in the lower-income
ranges."</TE>
<TE>   Ranchers Selling Land</TE>
<TE>   Up and down the valley, the rising price of real estate is
inducing farmers and ranchers to sell their land. The valley lost 33%
of its farmland between 1992 and 1997. Those acres have been snapped
up for development and carry price tags that reflect their enhanced
value. Land in Mono County that in 1992 sold for an average of $659
an acre went five years later for $1,029.</TE>
<TE>   A growth trend was already well established when Intrawest came to
town in 1996. But what had been a slow trickle of people and building
has mushroomed since the company began laying the groundwork.</TE>
<TE>   To Benno Nager, Intrawest's director of development, predictions
that Mammoth will explode like other Western ski resorts is
understandable, but unlikely. "I'm familiar with the argument, and I
agree with much of it," Nager said. "Mammoth has the opportunity to
learn from others' mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the increased cost of living here is a jolt to longtime
residents, who drive more than two hours south to shop in Ridgecrest
and elsewhere outside the valley.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Smith, whose family runs a fishing-outfitting business in
Bishop, spoke of growth's double edge: "Sure, our property values go
up. But so do our property taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Mammoth officials acknowledge that even middle-income people such
as teachers and other professionals are being priced out of town, or
soon will be. Recently, two candidates for mid-level positions with
the Forest Service turned down the jobs, saying they couldn't afford
to live in Mammoth or Bishop.</TE>
<TE>   Mammoth planner Taylor predicts that in 20 years nearly 90% of the
town's current residents won't be able to afford to buy or rent a
house.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the issue that has really snuck up on us," he said. "Our
current housing stock is priced out of reach."</TE>
<TE>   Intrawest is providing housing for about 60% of its new employees.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest part of all of this is that development is going to
drive up prices," Nager said. "That's tough on everyone, and there's
not a lot you can do about it. In a way, it's the price you pay to
live here. Like at the beach. It's expensive."</TE>
<TE>   "The guy down the street from me is selling a two-bedroom, 1
1/2-bath house for $300,000," said Gail Albut, co-owner of a
bookstore in Bishop. "Around here, that's amazing. And scary."</TE>
<TE>   A young man standing nearby with an armload of books chimed in: "I
guess I could always put up a tepee on [federal] land. That's about
all I can afford."</TE>
<TE>   Intrawest understands the lure of this place and how to sell it.
According to its brochures, none of the company's condominium
projects here has taken longer than two hours to sell. One, Eagle
Run, sold 36 units in 36 minutes, the developers say. A company sales
pitch tells prospective buyers: "Don't sleep on it."</TE>
<TE>   The buying opportunities are limited, the company says, because
growth is limited by the dimensions of the town: just 4 1/2 square
miles. Of that, company officials note, Intrawest owns only 250
acres, most of it at the base of 11,053-foot Mammoth Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Elastic Boundaries?</TE>
<TE>   But the town's boundaries could prove to be elastic.</TE>
<TE>   The town council is seeking to acquire a handful of Forest Service
parcels within town borders. And according to recent studies
commissioned by Mammoth Lakes and Mono County, the Forest Service has
identified 14 sites it owns as property it might be willing to give
the town in exchange for parcels elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Through such land exchange, Intrawest has already acquired acreage
that it can develop in nearby June Lake.</TE>
<TE>   "Ski development is all about real estate," said Andrea Mead
Lawrence, a former Olympic skier, former member of the Mono County
Board of Supervisors and a leading opponent of the Intrawest project.</TE>
<TE>   "They see the beauty of this place, and they see a product," she
said. "They don't ask the question of what happens when you add
10,000 people to a town. It isn't that we should say no to
development, but we should say how."</TE>

<HD>Edwin Mechem, 90; Was Governor, Judge in N.M.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edwin L. Mechem, New Mexico's only four-term governor, a former U.S.
senator and a federal judge, has died. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   Mechem died Wednesday at his home in Albuquerque. The cause of
death was not reported, but his family said he had a heart condition
that had worsened recently.</LD>
<LD>   A Republican known as "Big Ed" in his office-seeking days, Mechem
served as a judge for more than 30 years and continued to work at
home until his death.</LD>
<TE>   "He was still a senior judge. His health didn't allow him to go
down to the office very often, but his court clerk brought him his
work and when he felt well enough we would go down there," said
Josephine Mechem, his wife of 27 years.</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico governors were elected to two-year terms when Mechem
served, from 1951 to 1954, 1957-58 and 1961-62.</TE>
<TE>   An Alamogordo native, Mechem graduated from New Mexico A&amp;M, now
New Mexico State University, and earned a law degree from the
University of Arkansas. He went into practice with his father and
then joined the FBI during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to his law practice after the war, and tried his hand
at politics at a time when the state's Republican Party had
difficulty even finding candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Mechem won a state House seat in 1946. Four years later, he upset
Democrat John Miles to become New Mexico's first Republican governor
in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   He resigned as governor in November 1962 to complete the U.S.
Senate term of Democrat Dennis Chavez, who had died. Mechem lost his
bid to retain the seat in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970 he was appointed a federal judge by President Nixon, who
called Mechem "Mr. Republican." Mechem took senior status as a judge
in 1982, on his 70th birthday.</TE>

<HD>Trying to Recapture Russian Emigres' Life in Mexico</HD>
<DH>The few descendants of a religious sect that fled czar's
empire 100 years ago now put faith in trading on heritage to keep
their ancestry alive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Garrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>FRANCISCO ZARCO</DL>
<LD>FRANCISCO ZARCO, Baja California -- After he retired from the
mattress factory in Vernon, after his children grew up and attained
happy American lives, Gabriel Kachirisky moved back to Mexico and
turned his life into a museum exhibit.</LD>
<LD>   He began sticking little labels on half the possessions in his
house. He went back to the dilapidated church that his parents helped
build, restoring it. He even went to the cemetery, pulling weeds from
the forgotten headstones, lettered in Cyrillic.</LD>
<LD>   Living among ghosts gives Kachirisky a strange peace.</LD>
<TE>   The only thing that haunts the 70-year-old is a question that does
not have an answer: "When I die, who is going to take care of all
this?"</TE>
<TE>   A century ago, hundreds of Kachirisky's forebears -- members of an
obscure Russian Christian sect called the Molokans -- fled from the
outer reaches of the czar's empire to the lush Guadalupe Valley 50
miles south of Tijuana. They built a bustling village under the hot
Ensenada sun.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing the garb of the old country, they grew alfalfa and grapes,
cooked el borscht and los blintzes, and sweated together in saunas
behind their houses every Saturday night. On Sundays, they sang
psalms and drank tea brewed in samovars brought from Russia.</TE>
<TE>   But years ago, squatters came and took their land. Now, villagers
say, fewer than 20 remain who claim "pure Russian blood."</TE>
<TE>   Kachirisky and a handful of others have taken it upon themselves
to keep alive memories of that way of life and a past that has all
but slipped away.</TE>
<TE>   The Molokans have gone into the heritage business. They greet the
tourist buses that come over the bumpy road from Ensenada. They
nurture and scrupulously maintain two museums, right across an
unpaved road from each other. And they operate many mom-and-pop
enterprises, including one run by Kachirisky.</TE>
<TE>   For Kachirisky and others, it is something. But it's small solace,
given the loss of the idyllic community of their memories. And the
museums have not always smoothed the path into the future --
sometimes inflaming local debate over who owns the past, who has a
right to claim it and make money off it from tourists.</TE>
<TE>   So Kachirisky pursues his historical restorations in this small
town and continues to lecture visitors and tourists, not talking much
to his fellow Russian septuagenarians. Even though they are likely
the only ones who can really understand.</TE>
<TE>   "The pain of what happened affected us, all of us," he said. "It
makes us so sad."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Molokans split off from the Russian Orthodox Church in the
18th century. Their Bible-centered religion emphasizes pacifism, and
they rejected mandatory service in the czar's army. In 1840, many
Molokans agreed to go to the Kars region of what is now Turkey to
avoid military service.</TE>
<TE>   But by 1904, with those agreements set to expire, the Molokans
began to emigrate. Many went to Los Angeles, some to Australia, and
more than 100 families to the Guadalupe Valley -- settling on 13,000
acres they bought communally, according to Therese Muranaka, a San
Diego anthropologist who wrote her dissertation on the community.</TE>
<TE>   In carefully preserved photographs and home movies, the early
decades of life at the colony have the appearance of a sun-drenched
utopia.</TE>
<TE>   The new settlers consecrated a church. Every Sunday, they came to
worship in the simple wood room of plain white boards and softly
filtered light.</TE>
<TE>   They stayed for hours, drinking tea and eating borscht. The men
wore high-neck shirts and the women covered their heads with scarves,
just like their ancestors. And though they learned Spanish, they
spoke Russian to each other.</TE>
<TE>   Marriage to Mexicans</TE>
<TE>   Weddings brought Molokans down from Los Angeles for song-filled
feasts that would last for three days. At first, marriage to Mexicans
was frowned upon, but by the 1940s, it had become common.</TE>
<TE>   Kachirisky's wife of 47 years, Martha Lidia, is Mexican. She
remembers how her mother-in-law taught her to make los blintzes and
el borscht, which the Molokans make without beets. Today, the results
of those unions are everywhere. More than 300 locals claim some
Russian heritage.</TE>
<TE>   The farms prospered as well. Neat rows of alfalfa and grapevines
marched up and down the lushly rolling valley.</TE>
<TE>   Many families built saunas behind their houses, where men would
gather to purify themselves each Saturday night before Sunday's visit
to church.</TE>
<TE>   The idyll ended in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Hundreds of
landless Mexican settlers streamed into town. They stormed up to the
farms and announced they were taking over, saying the Molokans
weren't real Mexicans.</TE>
<TE>   "They put on hats like Pancho Villa and carried signs that said,
'Death to the Russians,' " said Augustin Lopez, who is part Russian.</TE>
<TE>   The Molokans pleaded with them. They showed a signed proclamation
from Mexican President Porfirio Diaz, granting their rights to the
land.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't consider you a Mexican citizen," said George Mohoff,
who was born and raised in the Guadalupe Valley, but now lives in Los
Angeles County. "They said, 'Why do you have so much and we have so
little?' "</TE>
<TE>   But the Molokans were pacifists, unwilling to use guns and fists
to hold on to their land. The settlers kept coming, and the Molokans
"were left with broken hearts," Mohoff said.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1960s, the minister -- and formal Sunday church
services -- had disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Kachirisky was born here in the Guadalupe Valley. But he and his
wife became part of the exodus, moving in the early 1960s to Pico
Rivera in the Los Angeles suburbs. He stayed there 27 years.</TE>
<TE>   The little English he learned in America still comes out in a
gruff voice heavily accented with Russian. But his Spanish has no
accent at all, and Kachirisky and his wife transformed themselves
into Angelenos, like any other immigrants from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife joined a Pentecostal church, put their kids in
school and went to baseball games. They went back to the Guadalupe
Valley only for visits.</TE>
<TE>   But by the late 1980s, a change in management had left Kachirisky
unhappy at the mattress factory where he worked. He cashed in the
equity in his home and returned to the Guadalupe Valley. About the
same time, a burgeoning eco-tourist trade brought visitors and museum
money to the valley.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, it looked like this would bring the community back
together -- although many had stopped practicing the religion.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians collaborated to put together the first museum in
1991. They rummaged in closets and storage spaces, and came up with a
vast collection of dresses, photographs and samovars. They helped
reconstruct a town map, showing where everyone had lived. Children
even began learning Russian.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1998, a dispute over how the museum was being run led its
director -- a Mexican married into a Russian family -- to quit and
establish a competing museum. It is directly across the road from the
first.</TE>
<TE>   Though their exhibits are substantially the same -- photos, maps,
bright Russian dresses and samovars -- many townspeople insist there
are serious differences between them. But those tend to have more to
do with who put the museums together and how they profit.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Wilken, an anthropologist who leads tours through the
valley, said he believes the dispute stems from differing perceptions
of who has a right to claim the treasured past.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever I hear the argument, it seems to be that 'So and so is
making all kinds of money off this,' and 'They're not really into it
for the right reasons,' " said Wilken, who said he has not taken
sides in the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Catering to Tourists</TE>
<TE>   "People can have conflicts," said Julie Bendimez, director of the
National Institute of Anthropology and History in Baja California.
Her institution helped found the first museum and continues to fund
it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to continue the war between them," she said, "but
that's how it has evolved."</TE>
<TE>   Bendimez said she thinks the two museums "complement each other."</TE>
<TE>   With the museums came busloads of tourists and students -- up to
10,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, individual townspeople began catering to the tourist trade.
Maria Samaduroff got a tourist certificate and, with her daughter,
serves schoolchildren cheese and lectures in her backyard.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is Kachirisky, who has turned himself into the
town's one-man curator. It started with displaying his possessions
and serving tourists blintzes.</TE>
<TE>   Then, he turned his attention to the church, built in 1950. The
roof had collapsed, and rainwater had poured down the walls and the
floors. Somehow, the Bibles were spared the mildew and rot, but
almost everything else was damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Kachirisky spent thousands of dollars and hours of labor,
painstakingly putting the church back the way it was.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of teapots and hundreds of teacups sit on a musty shelf,
unused since 1960. Alongside, sugar cubes rest patiently in their
pink box, as they have for four decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, when you went on Sunday, it was so happy," he said. "So
much life ... the boys and girls singing. Now when I come here, I
just want to cry."</TE>
<TE>   In his house, Kachirisky flips on his television and pops in a
home movie of a wedding held in 1939. The sound of dozens of voices
singing the psalms in Russian fills his little room.</TE>
<TE>   His wife gazes at him fondly as he begins to sway back and forth,
singing softly to himself in Russian. He points out faces of those
who still live in town, people he doesn't speak to much these days.</TE>
<TE>   When the movie ends, he reaches over to the VCR and hits play a
second time, his stiff 70-year-old body swaying back and forth, his
voice lifting again with the voices of the past.</TE>

<HD>Staying Out of Ojai's Former Lockup Is Proving Easy</HD>
<DH>The old jail will soon go on public view as a city
landmark, but not before its door, welded shut long ago to thwart
vandals, is pried open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gail Davis</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Squat, unadorned and often mistaken for an outhouse, Ojai's former
jail will soon be on view to the public -- as the city's newest
landmark.</LD>
<LD>   That is, if someone can open the door.</LD>
<LD>   To prevent vandalism, workers long ago welded it shut, and windows
on the escape-proof, reinforced-concrete building are fist-sized. So,
to get inside, someone will have to pry the door off.</LD>
<TE>   And maybe lob in a bug bomb to clear out the black widows.</TE>
<TE>   So the jail, hidden behind a hill in Libbey Park, was not opened
as planned for the town's recent Ojai Day celebration but should be
ready by January.</TE>
<TE>   Barely 23 feet across and 15 feet wide, it has four barred cells,
eight cots hanging from chains, plus sinks, toilets and a light.</TE>
<TE>   Graffiti include Bob Dylan lyrics and "LSD is here to stay."</TE>
<TE>   Once opened, city officials will preserve the graffiti with clear
lacquer, spruce up the fixtures and put bars or some other viewing
barrier across the front so visitors can peek in.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1929 on land that cost $10, the building replaced a
wooden jail constructed in 1874 in the backyard of the town's
constable and undertaker, Andrew Vancuren. He stored coffins in it as
well as inmates.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1920s, city officials wanted a stronger, more central jail,
but the aging Vancuren refused to move it from his yard. After he
died in 1923, the city built the concrete jail.</TE>
<TE>   It was a charmless box in a town just honing a reputation for
thoughtful architecture, but it held drunks and petty thieves well
enough.</TE>
<TE>   And it was strong.</TE>
<TE>   Former Ojai Police Chief Vince France grew up in Ojai. As a child,
France said, he set off quarter-sticks of dynamite outside the jail.</TE>
<TE>   The blasts rattled prisoners but didn't harm the building.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Ojai resident Bill Lotts, 78, said he spent a night there
in the mid-1950s after arguing with an officer who ticketed him for
parking on the wrong side of Aliso Street. Lotts had parked briefly
to ask his girlfriend to dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The judge threw out the case the next morning, and Lotts said he
later learned the officer had been dating the same girl.</TE>
<TE>   But Lotts vividly recalls his night in the clink. The officer
locked him in, shut off the light and left. Lying in the dark, Lotts
wondered if anyone would hear if he screamed.</TE>
<TE>   An intercom linked the jail to the police station, then about two
football field-lengths away in Ojai's Arcade. The intercom was hooked
to a wire strung through the oaks, across Ojai Avenue and down into
the station. Squirrels could eat through the wire and no one would
know, Lotts worried.</TE>
<TE>   France also worried. After storms, he would check the wire, which
the wind often knocked out of the trees.</TE>
<TE>   One hot day, France opened the jail's outer door to keep the
prisoners cool and returned to the station. Later, he heard
cracklings over the intercom. At the jail he found the inmates drunk
and rowdy, with buddies passing beers in through the bars.</TE>
<TE>   He arrested the friends and let everyone sleep it off -- inside.</TE>
<TE>   For some of the 600 people held over the years, the bumpy ride
through the bushes was more terrifying than the lockup itself, France
said.</TE>
<TE>   One drunk's eyes got as big as silver dollars as France drove
behind the park.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'What are you going to do to me?' " France said.</TE>
<TE>   But jail time wasn't bad, as jail time goes. Only minor offenders
stayed. Hard-core criminals went to the Ventura County Jail.
Animosity didn't exist, France said. Ojai was like the fictional
Mayberry from the old Andy Griffith TV show.</TE>
<TE>   France even did one inmate's Christmas shopping, then dropped him
off at home for a conjugal visit.</TE>
<TE>   Most prisoners spent more time outside than in. With no meal
service, officers took inmates to Loops Restaurant for breakfast,
lunch and dinner and would dine with their jailbirds.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what we would have done if we had gotten a call,"
France said.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates kept busy. Most gardened city grounds. And France
remembers one regular drunk in the early 1960s, whom the police kept
busy making bullets.</TE>
<TE>   That inmate was also a good carpenter, France said. Police looked
forward to his incarcerations because he would do handiwork around
City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1960s, Ojai had become a mecca for the drug culture
and the jail housed less friendly inmates. But that was its swan
song.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, just before the city contracted its police work to the
Ventura County Sheriff's Department, state officials said the jail no
longer met regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The city replaced it with an in-station holding cell, and no one
stays overnight in Ojai today. All detainees go to County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   All that remains is the question of how to get the door open.</TE>

<HD>A Life's Tragic Finale Spotlights Sad Statistic</HD>
<DH>Trombonist who played with the greats becomes Oakland's
100th slaying victim of '02 as the rate of killings rises. Voters
won't fund more cops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Pogash</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Even though he'd played trombone with Ella Fitzgerald, Charlie
Parker, Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie, his death might have
merited no more than a paragraph on the obituary page had Taswell
Baird Jr., an 80-year-old African American, not had the misfortune to
become this city's homicide No. 100 for 2002.</LD>
<LD>   For days, reporters had dogged the Oakland Police Department's
homicide unit, quizzing investigators even when they were doing
nothing more than dashing out for a salami on rye.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Brian Thiem, commander of the unit, complained that nobody
cared but the media, which was on a stakeout: waiting for Oakland's
100th homicide of the year.</LD>
<TE>   In this city -- which last year had the highest murder rate in
California, with 85 slayings -- the bulk of the homicides involve one
felon killing another, what Mayor Jerry Brown calls "taking care of
business" homicides, "one man stealing another's stash or not paying
debts."</TE>
<TE>   But Baird's sad story was one of what the mayor would call the 5%
or 10% that play to people's worst fears. It was, Brown acknowledged,
"symbolic of a lack of caring" and an example of young people's
"disregard for another human being." It was not unique to Oakland, he
added a little defensively, even if it seemed to magnify the city's
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Baird was assaulted at dusk Nov. 5, election day, while the polls
were still open. With Californians elsewhere bored by the
frictionless gubernatorial race, Oakland was focused on the more
personal -- crime.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Brown staked his reputation on returning Oakland
to greatness. He has brought business to the city and gentrified some
neighborhoods, for which he has been both praised and vilified.</TE>
<TE>   But his ongoing campaign to lower crime suffers from the rising
homicide rate, although the total to date remains well shy of the
record 165 killings of 1992. Leading up to the election, Brown urged
voters to approve an advisory measure to put 100 more police officers
on the streets and three other measures to increase hotel and parking
taxes to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   On that day, Taswell Baird was returning from the local market to
St. Mary's Gardens, a "quality senior community," in west Oakland.
His legs weakened by arthritis or possibly Parkinson's disease, he
whipped around the block in an electric wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   An independent man, Baird did his own cooking and shopping,
earning a little extra money each month by shopping for two other men
in his apartment building. He'd probably just received a check from
them and gone to cash it, said his longtime friend Ruby Slaughter,
89. That would explain his having had $80 in his waist-pack, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Baird was not a bragger, residents knew he'd taken up
trombone at the age of 12 and, along with his older brother Bill,
traveled the country, playing with the jazz greats. He told residents
such as 92-year-old Clarence Judice, who wears a three-piece suit and
polished wingtips every day, that he'd played with Duke Ellington.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Baird arrived at this HUD-subsidized housing, though,
he had quit playing his trombone. He continued to play jazz on his
stereo. And like other residents, he shot pool, watched football and,
Slaughter said, played the lottery, "like the rest of us."</TE>
<TE>   When his brother started to become careless, showing cash in front
of young tough guys who might try to take it, Taswell had Bill move
in, giving him the bedroom and sleeping for several years on the
couch. As Bill's condition worsened -- he suffered from dementia --
assistant administrator Jeannie Thomas remembers watching Taswell
maneuver his wheelchair and a shopping cart while patiently advising
his brother to come along or sit on the bench while he moved their
groceries. Taswell protected his older brother until Bill's death a
few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   St. Mary's Gardens sits hard by the freeway downtown, in a
neighborhood that by sunlight appears calm and deceptively safe. An
old housing project that had festered with crime was torn down, and
handsome, well-kept, private apartments have sprung up. A few houses
with peeling paint and trash-littered yards remain, but they seem
more the aberration.</TE>
<TE>   Residents such as Judice, sitting on the bench, will tell you that
the bus stop down on the corner isn't safe. Go there and you make
yourself a candidate for robbery. And so they wait by the wooden
benches out front until they see the bus actually wheeling down the
block before they risk hobbling over to the stop.</TE>
<TE>   Baird was not afraid to move about. He often went to the store to
pick up milk, grapes and other groceries. Years earlier, residents
were allowed to use the back entrance to the building to reach the
store across the way. More recently though, that was shut to all but
drivers as a safety precaution, because the administrators' windows
face only the front and they couldn't monitor an open door in back.</TE>
<TE>   On the day he was beaten, Baird rode his wheelchair from the back
of his building to the front, his groceries in plastic bags looped
onto his handlebars. Shortly after he rounded the corner to the
front, a man reported to be about 19 or 20 and wearing a dark leather
jacket punched him in the chest, kicking him to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   A small man, Baird was 5-foot-6 and, according to the coroner,
weighed 114 pounds at the time of his death. His screams couldn't be
heard through the glass of the apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   But a caregiver just leaving work heard. With two bags full of
recyclable tin cans, she hit the attacker until she saw him reach
into his pocket. Afraid that he might pull a knife or gun, she fled.
But by then, the administrators inside St. Mary's Gardens had heard
her screams.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something horrendous," said assistant administrator
Thomas. As she held on for a 911 operator, she watched the young man
pummel the old one. "Someone he didn't even know," she said several
weeks later, "someone who was so defenseless."</TE>
<TE>   The attacker pulled the $80 from Baird's waist-pack, fleeing on
foot with his accomplices. Badly injured with a broken pelvis, Baird
lay on the ground, but remained sufficiently coherent to ask for his
inhaler, which had spilled onto the grass and which he needed for his
emphysema. A pillow was placed under his head.</TE>
<TE>   On that day, Oakland citizens voted in theory to support putting
more cops on the street, but only by a bare majority. Many people
think the police are part of the problem. And voters opposed all
three measures to increase the hotel and parking taxes to pay for
more officers.</TE>
<TE>   Baird lived for a couple more weeks. But on Nov. 22, he died,
becoming a statistic, a symbol, and gaining the sort of publicity
that was his due in life.</TE>
<TE>   That he basically lost his campaign for safer streets hasn't
deterred Mayor Brown. "We're going to try different strategies. We're
going to reprioritize," he said, ticking off plans to "maximize the
use of sworn personnel, taking people out of desk jobs" and putting
them on the streets. "And we're looking at having non-sworn personnel
take burglary reports."</TE>
<TE>   Brown railed against the state that he once governed -- for
sending prisoners out into the community with a bus ticket, $200 in
cash, no training, no housing and no jobs. He talked about the drug
problems that "are part of America," about the trade deficit, the
disappearance of factory work and unskilled jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Brown considered the case of Taswell Baird and the unknown
assailant.</TE>
<TE>   The blame is shared, he said, by "bad schools, bad parents, the
bad economy, a bad media, gansta rap and bad values." To solve it
would take "almost a moral revolution," he admitted.</TE>
<TE>   And then the mayor of Oakland added, in a way that only he could,
"I don't shrink from that."</TE>

<HD>Old Town's Face Lift Has a Flaw</HD>
<DH>After a $1.8-million, 10-month revamp, downtown Tustin has
a new look but can't draw shoppers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The squiggly lines Tustin antique dealer Gerda Brucks draws in her
ledger on days when nothing leaves the store have started
outnumbering the painstakingly detailed entries she makes when
something is sold.</LD>
<LD>   Brucks hasn't made a big sale since summer, when a customer bought
a $7,500 buffet, and she spends most of the days in her cluttered Old
Town Tustin store fine-tuning an award-winning holiday window display
few customers will pass.</LD>
<LD>   "While we're waiting to be discovered, business stinks," she said.</LD>
<TE>   A $1.8-million rejuvenation project intended to make Old Town
Tustin a destination for shoppers has instead repelled some customers
from the five-block stretch of antique dealers, specialty shops and
vacant lots.</TE>
<TE>   Although the construction noise and dust have mostly disappeared,
leaving behind ornate iron streetlights and flower-filled planters to
brighten the newly widened streets, luring shoppers is yet another
challenge in an already difficult time.</TE>
<TE>   As the holiday shopping season begins, merchants in downtown
Tustin, like those in aging city centers around Southern California,
are hoping they will be able to hold their own against malls and
big-box retailers.</TE>
<TE>   One such merchant is salon owner Margit Aaron, who hopes customers
will forgive the inconveniences of the construction work that for
nearly 10 months tore up the roads around El Camino Real between
Newport Boulevard and 1st Street.</TE>
<TE>   "The new streetscape was something to bring people downtown to
shop and make them more comfortable while they're here, not to deter
them," said Aaron, who was president of the Tustin Old Town Assn.
during construction. "People need to give Old Town another chance."</TE>
<TE>   A dozen people were strolling through the area at any given time
Saturday, meandering into stores and chatting with
conversation-starved proprietors.</TE>
<TE>   To fill stretches of downtime between customers, store employees
straightened show boxes or worked crossword puzzles, and cigar store
manager Sean Gutridge tossed a football with a friend in the parking
lot.</TE>
<TE>   Florist Janet Johnson blames the construction for the dip in
walk-in business.</TE>
<TE>   "We have mostly an older crowd, so they understandably got a
little perturbed when they had to walk farther and farther just to
get to the store," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although her affectionate Jack Russell terriers are a big draw for
The Ruffled Tulip, most shoppers leave without buying anything, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooing at Gumbo and Sweet Pea as they placed their paws on her
legs before she walked out empty-handed, Deborah Swensen, 35, of
Irvine was a case in point.</TE>
<TE>   Swensen was shopping in Old Town for the first time with friend
Don Kolling, of Tustin, enticed by an ad for an antique store called
The Vintage Lady, where she bought a trio of green felt Christmas
stockings. Swensen and Kolling said the area has a lot of potential.</TE>
<TE>   "I always root for these cute downtown areas to make the
transformation and become destinations rather than just places you
stop at because you're passing through," said Kolling, 43. "We need
to have boutique types of places as alternatives for those of us who
don't like malls."</TE>
<TE>   Other business owners might say Vivian Heredia, who owns the
well-known McCharles House Tearoom with her mother, Audrey, has
nothing to worry about. Vivian Heredia said the construction didn't
affect business at the tearoom, which was booked Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Our clientele really appreciates beautification," said Heredia.
"They don't mind a little inconvenience."</TE>
<TE>   Still, she looks forward to the day when people think of McCharles
House as yet another attraction in Old Town Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   "The mingling and strolling will create more of a village-type
atmosphere," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Store owners in Jamestown Village, a small plaza at one end of Old
Town with a dozen shops, including Brucks' antiques store, hope the
mingling will extend to them.</TE>
<TE>   After unsuccessfully attempting to cajole Los Angeles costume
designer Pat Welch into buying a silver ladle Saturday, Brucks
started poking fun at her own boldness.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to have fun in here because I'm certainly not selling
anything," Brucks said.</TE>

<HD>Olive Oil a Pressing Concern for Family</HD>
<DH>Owners of a Ventura County orchard dating from the 1800s
are tapping into a growing industry while reviving agricultural
tradition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps only a veteran oil man like Ron Asquith could have seen the
potential in the aging Ojai Valley olive orchard, where century-old
trees stood like weary soldiers posted across the rugged hillsides.</LD>
<LD>   Close to retirement after nearly 20 years with Occidental
Petroleum, Asquith decided five years ago to hunt for oil of a
different kind. He revived what had once been a productive orchard
near the birthplace of the nation's commercial olive oil industry.</LD>
<LD>   Now in its second year of production, the Ojai Olive Oil Co.
expects to press two tons of the marble-sized fruit this year,
filling nearly 1,000 bottles and tapping traditions that run deep in
Ventura County.</LD>
<TE>   "It's nice to know that we are doing something that maintains
those traditions," said Asquith, who runs the family operation with
his ex-wife, Alice, and their adult children, Philip and Nicole. "By
growing olives and making oil, you are doing something that dates
back thousands of years, something you read about in the Bible."</TE>
<TE>   It's also a tradition that has experienced a revival in California
agriculture, where a growing number of producers are pumping out
greater quantities of olive oil each year. California growers produce
99% of the oil made in the United States, although that is only a
fraction of the worldwide supply.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 commercial processors in California made half a million
gallons of extra virgin olive oil last year, a 20% increase over the
previous year, according to the California Olive Oil Council.</TE>
<TE>   A similar jump in production is expected this year, due in part to
the entrance of growers such as Asquith.</TE>
<TE>   "There's tremendous interest in the industry," said Patty Darragh,
executive director of the 400-member council based in Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "I think olive oil has always had an aura about it," she added.
"It went on the crusades and was there during the Holy Wars. It has
been used to anoint the sick and the dying. It has this wonderful
history that I think gives people a connection with the past."</TE>
<TE>   In California, that past stretches back to the late 1700s, when
Spanish missionaries first planted olive trees at California missions
and began making oil for cooking and other domestic purposes.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's first commercial olive oil production is said to have
come a century later, at the same Fillmore-area rancho that inspired
Helen Hunt Jackson's groundbreaking romance novel, "Ramona."</TE>
<TE>   Judith Taylor's book, "The Olive In California, History of an
Immigrant Tree," recounts how the Del Valle family, pioneers in the
state and Ventura County, sold the first oil from its press at
historic Rancho Camulos in 1871.</TE>
<TE>   Over the hill in the Ojai Valley, the olive oil business was also
taking off.</TE>
<TE>   The first olive orchard was planted in the east end in the
mid-1800s, according to Cherie Brant, a docent at the Ventura County
Museum of History and Art, who researched the subject for the county
farm bureau's magazine. Among the earliest of the county's crops,
olives thrived in the area's rugged soil and dry climate, Brant said.</TE>
<TE>   By the turn of the century, a group of ranchers had launched the
Ojai Olive Assn., running a communal mill that closed two years later
because of competition from less-expensive Italian products, Brant
said.</TE>
<TE>   Only scattered remnants remain today of those once-thriving
orchards, including the grove Asquith bought years ago that contained
130 trees planted in the late 1800s.</TE>
<TE>   The Asquith family has planted 1,000 more since then, seeking to
increase production at the 36-acre ranch, where rutted dirt pathways
and steeply sloped hillsides conjure up images of the Tuscan
countryside.</TE>
<TE>   "His original vision was just to have it as a hobby with a
hand-operated press," said Asquith's son, Philip, president of the
family company. "Last year was really our test run, and when that
went so well we decided to expand."</TE>
<TE>   With the harvest in full swing, the Asquiths intend to double the
production of last year, when they made 500 bottles and sold them at
the Ojai farmers market for $15 a bottle. The Asquiths say they are
not trying to compete with less-expensive olive oil that can be found
on supermarket shelves.</TE>
<TE>   This year's bottling also will be sold at the open-air market and
on a Web site being developed by Philip Asquith, who also runs a
small venture capital business based in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from that step into the modern marketing world, much of the
operation is performed just as it was a century ago. Shouldering
nylon sacks, a small crew of workers scampers up ladders leaning into
the trees. Their hands become a blur, moving quickly from branch to
branch, picking only what is ripe and ready for the press.</TE>
<TE>   In a spare green building in the middle of the orchard, the olives
are loaded into a press imported from Italy. They are washed, churned
into paste and then funneled into a centrifuge, which draws out the
oil. The end product flows thick and golden out of a tube at the
bottom of the machine and is stored in stainless steel tanks until
bottling.</TE>
<TE>   The Asquiths have put $15,000 to $20,000 into their equipment and
hope to produce 15,000 to 20,000 bottles a year as the newer trees
mature.</TE>
<TE>   "It becomes a passion; it really does," said Alice Asquith, on
hand for the first day of pressing. "It's about making something
real, something that's good for you."</TE>
<TE>   For Ron Asquith, who has grown oranges in the Ojai Valley for two
decades, it's also about taking part in an industry uncommon in
California while keeping alive a piece of the state's rich
agricultural past.</TE>
<TE>   "Having grown oranges here for 20 years, I can tell you, nobody
calls you up to talk about growing oranges or to find out how your
oranges are doing," he said. "But people call frequently to talk
about olives. There's just something about them that people find
fascinating."</TE>

<LD>Do you know who Lawrence Baird is?</LD>
<LD>   Unless you're plugged in to Catholic Church circles in Orange
County, you probably don't. Baird, 60, is the spokesman for the
Diocese of Orange and pastor at a Balboa Island parish.</LD>
<LD>   That makes him well-known to a lot of people but not the kind of
person I'd consider a public figure. He's neither an elected official
nor a celebrity whose face or name most people would recognize.</LD>
<TE>   Yet a San Francisco Superior Court judge last week ruled that
Msgr. Baird is a public figure, using a line of logic that sounded as
arcane as certain medieval catechisms. The judge's thinking carried
much weight, because it means that Baird now might not be able to
pursue a slander suit against a woman who claimed that Baird made
inappropriate sexual advances toward her 20 years ago when she was a
teenager.</TE>
<TE>   That Baird may be forced to drop his lawsuit against Lori Haigh is
good news. Her allegations against him seem to fall in the he
said/she said category, with the truth likely hard to divine by
outsiders. Considering, however, that Haigh has already received $1.2
million from the Orange and Los Angeles dioceses to settle
sexual-abuse charges involving another priest, you'd think a church
elder like Baird would leave well enough alone.</TE>
<TE>   But before letting this episode disappear into antiquity, I must
squawk about the judge's rationale in deeming Baird a public figure.
The judge said he made the ruling not because of Baird's job, but
because he called a press conference last April to deny Haigh's
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that if he [Baird] hadn't made the press conference
that I would be finding this," Judge A. James Robertson was quoted as
saying.</TE>
<TE>   In dismissing Baird's slander suit (filed about 10 days after his
press conference), the judge ruled the monsignor likely could not win
his case, because he could not meet the tougher legal standard facing
public figures in slander cases. That standard requires showing that
the person making the allegedly false and harmful statement does so
maliciously. For nonpublic targets, an accuser's malice is not a
requirement.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know if Haigh's allegation is true or if she made it
maliciously. But if I'm reading the judge correctly, he said that
because Baird responded publicly to Haigh's equally public
accusation, he became a public figure -- at least in this instance.</TE>
<TE>   I don't get it. If Baird was the subject of such a serious
allegation in public, why shouldn't he be allowed to answer it in
public? Yes, he could have responded publicly without filing a
lawsuit. But why should he be elevated to "limited public figure"
status -- thereby affecting his burden of proof -- merely because he
called a press conference to answer an explosive charge?</TE>
<TE>   I'm not arguing that public officials should not face a tougher
standard. Nor should public figures be allowed to file frivolous,
unwinnable slander suits simply to frighten their critics into
silence. The tougher standard for public figures goes with the
territory; it's why people could call Gray Davis and Bill Simon all
sorts of names during their race for the governorship. I wouldn't be
making as big a stink if the judge had ruled that Baird's job alone
made him a public figure.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge seemed to be saying that people -- even those less
"famous" than Baird -- become public figures with a single press
conference. That may make legal sense, but it doesn't make common
sense. In this day and age, how does an otherwise nonpublic person
respond to a serious charge made in public? The answer, I guess, is
to fire back publicly, but in the process surrender your right to
have your day in court.</TE>
<TE>   Baird hasn't decided whether to appeal. If I were him, I'd take
the judge's ruling as a sign from God and drop the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The ledger now reflects Haigh's allegation and Baird's vehement
denial.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a confession from either side, that's probably as close to
the truth as we'll get.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Plea Bargains Under Scrutiny</HD>
<DH>Prosecutors say D.A., who campaigned on giving staff
leeway, wants more cases taken to trial.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Top managers in the Orange County district attorney's office have
increased their scrutiny of plea bargains negotiated by prosecutors
in recent months and have started reviewing old cases in search of
errors, the head of the prosecutors' union said.</LD>
<LD>   The efforts have left some prosecutors afraid to negotiate plea
bargains without approval from their bosses and could result in a
legal logjam with more criminal cases going to trial, said Chris
Kralick, who heads the union representing more than 200 deputy
district attorneys.</LD>
<LD>   "The deputies are concerned they're going to face disciplinary
action if they enter into a disposition of a case that management
feels is inappropriate or embarrassing to the administration,"
Kralick said.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas won broad support from
prosecutors when he ran for office in 1998 because he vowed to
overturn his predecessor's ban on plea bargains. Rackauckas said he
trusted their judgment and would allow them to settle cases without
the strict oversight they faced under former Dist. Atty. Mike
Capizzi.</TE>
<TE>   Now, managers in the office have told deputies that they should
consult a supervisor if they are not pursuing "three strikes" or
other life-imprisonment cases. And senior prosecutors in high-profile
units have been instructed to document their case decisions in "trial
notebooks," something previously required only of inexperienced
prosecutors, Kralick and other prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a departure from his campaign promise of four
years ago," Kralick said.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas did not return a call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers said they began noticing a change in October, the
same month that Deputy Dist. Atty. Randy Payne was placed on
administrative leave amid questions about his handling of a sexual
assault case. The defendant in that case later became a suspect in
the high-profile kidnapping of a Salt Lake City girl but was
eventually cleared. The district attorney's office has declined to
comment on the reason for Payne's suspension or how long it might
last.</TE>
<TE>   "After what happened to Randy, it seems everyone is real jumpy,"
said Orange County defense lawyer Ronald Brower. "Even in misdemeanor
cases, I've experienced a reluctance of deputy D.A.s to enter into
negotiations they previously would have without hesitation."</TE>
<TE>   Brower and other defense lawyers said that because of prosecutors'
increasing inflexibility, they are negotiating case settlements
directly with judges, leaving prosecutors out of the process.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last month or two, I've seen the front-line deputies are
much less willing to make a decision without talking to a
supervisor," added veteran defense attorney Gary Pohlson. "It seems
to me it's evidence that they have less and less discretion ....It
slows down the system."</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, about 90% of criminal cases are resolved by guilty
plea, most of them hashed out in pretrial negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Under Capizzi, supervisors in the district attorney's office
decided at an early stage what sentence the office would offer on a
case, and deputies were not allowed to deviate from that during plea
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors complained that the policy squeezed them out of the
negotiating process. Often, sentences were hashed out between judges
and defense attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   When Rackauckas took office, he issued a policy that empowered
prosecutors to use their judgment in plea negotiations, a move that
was widely praised within the office and the county's justice system.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, however, some prosecutors said they've been told
by their bosses that top management is unhappy with the number of
plea bargains in the last few years. Deputies also said they've been
told to increase the number of cases they take to trial.</TE>

formulate policy about sentencing because all cases are different.</TE>
<TE>   Another deputy district attorney who declined to be identified
said Payne's suspension has put prosecutors in the office on edge.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is nobody knows what it is that Randy did that upset
people. That's something we're all curious about," the prosecutor
said.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us know if we're transgressing in the eyes of the 10th
floor [the administration]. If we run afoul of what somebody upstairs
thinks, we'd like to know. It's only fair to give us a clearer idea
of what they want us to do."</TE>

<HD>Debate on Black Students Rages</HD>
<DH>A Pasadena teacher's note blaming disruptive African
Americans for low test scores has stirred anger, pain and
soul-searching.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandy Banks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was nothing original about the teacher's observations:</LD>
<LD>   At Pasadena's Muir High School -- as on many urban campuses --
black students are cited more often than others for disciplinary
problems. And they score worse than others on standardized exams.</LD>
<LD>   What was shocking was how the white teacher argued -- when he
connected the dots with his public proclamation -- that unruly black
students were responsible for his school's failure to make the grade.</LD>
<TE>   "It has absolutely nothing to do with teachers or curriculum,"
Scott Phelps wrote in a letter to fellow teachers at Muir, warning
that test scores were likely to nose-dive. "Standards of behavior, or
the lack thereof" are to blame.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't hesitate to point the finger: "Overwhelmingly, the
students whose behavior makes the hallways deafening, who yell out
for the teacher and demand immediate attention in class, who cannot
seem to stop chatting and are fascinated by each other but not with
academics, in short, whose behavior saps the strength and energy of
us on the front lines, are African American."</TE>
<TE>   Now, a month later, that letter continues ricocheting around the
country, bouncing off assumptions about race, youth and social class.</TE>
<TE>   Phelps' letter resonated with many whites who feel threatened by
the behavior of seemingly arrogant young black men. And it offended
many blacks weary of being singled out for blame.</TE>
<TE>   Those were the predictable reactions. Other responses were more
nuanced, as the letter prompted finger-pointing, then soul-searching.</TE>
<TE>   In newspaper columns, in private conversations, on talk radio, the
"good" parents blamed the "bad" ones; teachers denounced other
teachers.</TE>
<TE>   At a forum in Pasadena, a teenager with bad grammar and a crude
tattoo privately offered a thoughtful interpretation of her
classmates' self-destructive attitudes, while a bookish college
student said to alarmed adults: "I'm sorry, but no one listens to
you."</TE>
<TE>   And underneath their rancor and their hurt, many blacks felt an
odd sort of gratitude.</TE>
<TE>   At a neighborhood meeting about the letter, Kitty McKnight, a
former teacher, exploded after a district official suggested that the
solution to Muir's discipline problems was more tolerance and
commitment from teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot sit and listen to this!" she shouted, rising from her
seat. "Our boys are out of control."</TE>
<TE>   McKnight, who is black, graduated from Muir, sent her two
now-grown sons there and recently retired after 40 years of teaching.
"We have to do something," she told the crowd. "We are losing our
boys!" There was scattered applause in the black audience, but many
sat in stunned silence.</TE>
<TE>   Later, McKnight admitted that Phelps' letter triggered feelings of
anger and frustration, but also guilt.</TE>
<TE>   "Having been a teacher all these years, I never made it a point.
But it's true. You talk to another black teacher about the behavior
of black students and they know exactly what you mean. I feel like
I'm at fault for not addressing it sooner."</TE>
<TE>   Others felt a sense of betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying it's true or not true," an angry father told a
community meeting. "But it hurts to be held up to ridicule by someone
whom we have entrusted our children's minds to."</TE>
<TE>   It also hurts, Phelps said, to be labeled a racist for "simply
making empirical observations of behavior that are totally supported
by data."</TE>
<TE>   Phelps left a research program at Caltech to teach high school
science 12 years ago. He is known by peers as a passionate critic of
district officials, and a hard-working, dedicated teacher. He tutors
physics students for free, invites kids over for family dinners,
visits their homes to host study sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not much of a public speaker or a disciplinarian, but he's
one of the best teachers I ever had," said Muir alum Chad Hunter, who
attends Pasadena City College and interns at Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. It's a job he got with Phelps' help. "Mr. Phelps would do
whatever it took to help, if you wanted to learn and you're willing
to work."</TE>
<TE>   Phelps says he never intended to insult black students. But many
felt that his commentary, written in the dense style of an academic,
had clear racial overtones. Black male teachers are better at
controlling black students, he wrote, because they "have no trouble
'going off' on the kids."</TE>
<TE>   In conversation, Phelps offers a list of white, Latino and Asian
American teachers he says left Muir because they were intimidated by
aggressive black students.</TE>
<TE>   "The cultures are so different, in order for white teachers to
feel comfortable they have to put a lot of energy into changing the
behavior of kids who are not like them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It is Phelps' attribution of misbehavior to cultural deficiencies
that really rankles his critics.</TE>
<TE>   "If children are disruptive, let's say that. Let's not say they're
disruptive because they're black," said Assistant Supt. George
McKenna. "Some of these kids deserve credit just for showing up" at
school, given their chaotic home lives and troubled neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   More than a third of Muir's 1,300 students live with single
mothers, almost half are from families living below the poverty line,
and almost 10% live apart from their families in county-run shelters
or group homes.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers who aren't willing to accept that the stresses in
children's lives spill onto the campus "ought to be teaching in
Beverly Hills," McKenna said.</TE>
<TE>   The fracas over the letter created such tension that Phelps was
escorted off campus and put on two weeks' paid leave -- not as
punishment, district officials said, but for his protection. At the
extremes, outsiders viewed him as either a martyr on the altar of
political correctness or an example of racism infecting public
education</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry to hear about the terrible treatment you are getting from
your high school," e-mailed Joe Owens from England. "Can't people
speak the truth now days.... Everyone in education will say the same,
but don't have the guts to say it in public."</TE>
<TE>   An e-mail posted on a message board aimed at black women took this
view: "It's ironic that ad campaigns are jamming the idea into our
children's minds that everyone is alike, only to have this idiot
magnify inferiority complexes that they already feel."</TE>
<TE>   For some, the debate has less to do with the message than the
messenger.</TE>
<TE>   Would the uproar have been the same if Phelps had been black?
Probably not, said USC professor Todd Boyd, who studies race, culture
and communication.</TE>
<TE>   Consider African Americans a family, Boyd said. Phelps was "out of
place" in speaking so bluntly. "It's one thing for a member of your
family to scold you. That comes from a history of love and support,
knowledge and understanding," he said. "You take that comment
differently if it comes from someone off the street."</TE>
<TE>   Even among those who agreed with Phelps, many bristled at the
media attention his letter drew. "It plays to the image of black
people not caring," Boyd said. "It's not like we've been silent about
kids misbehaving.... We just haven't broadcast it on TV."</TE>
<TE>   Discipline problems aren't confined to streetwise black children.
Foul language, fistfights and sexually provocative behavior happen on
campuses across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cultural, and I mean American culture," said Pasadena High
School teacher Lisa Newton. "I remember my son at 7, turning on the
television and seeing Bart Simpson and how he had such a lack of
respect for authority. These kids are emulating music videos, TV
shows, MTV."</TE>
<TE>   And their parents, said retired teacher McKnight. "I called a
mother and said, 'Your son is not acting in an appropriate manner in
class,' " she recalled. "And she started in right away, 'My son told
me about you. I know you're black, but you're prejudiced against
him.' "</TE>
<TE>   National studies of school disciplinary records going back more
than 25 years show black youths are punished more often and more
harshly than other students, but for less-serious and more-subjective
offenses.</TE>
<TE>   "The more active and physical style of communication that
characterizes African American adolescents ... may be interpreted as
combative or argumentative," suggests research by a University of
South Florida professor.</TE>
<TE>   Some teachers put a positive spin on the cultural differences.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, the black kids are noisier, but so are the Greeks, the
Italians," said Hannah Naiditch, who was raised in Europe and spent
14 years teaching science in Los Angeles before retiring in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   "The black kids were not as easily intimidated.... But that's what
made teaching so interesting. Then we weren't so obsessed with all
this high-stakes testing; you could use a little creativity."</TE>
<TE>   Today, most teachers say they don't have that luxury. They say the
pressure to produce on standardized tests requires students to move
in lock-step, putting them under the gun and frustrating struggling
students.</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes disruptive behavior masks anxiety and fear.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got kids with fifth-grade reading skills, and we're trying
to teach them algebra," said Newton. They feel like academic
failures, so they shift attention to their social strengths by
cutting up in class, bullying other kids. "They're angry. They're
drowning. But we save them at the expense of how many other
students?"</TE>
<TE>   That's the question Phelps' letter also raised when he condemned
Muir's "horrible" ninth-graders for "bouncing off the walls ...
chasing each other through the hallways, into classrooms, yelling at
the tops of their lungs."</TE>
<TE>   That would have been Velta Strouble, 30 years ago. She got kicked
out of Muir in 10th grade for cutting classes and being disruptive,
but straightened up and went on to earn two master's degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Now she's an educational consultant and the mother of two boys who
have generated more than their share of calls from Muir for fighting
or mouthing off in class. Her boys are smart, but they are also
boisterous and occasionally unruly, just as their mother was, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's no reason to give up on them," she added. "I know that
teachers are frustrated, but every child is not going to fit the
'perfect student' mold."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers say they're not asking for perfect students. They would
settle for teenagers who don't saunter into class 30 minutes late,
interrupt a test with a request to borrow lip gloss, or curse them
out in the middle of a lesson.</TE>
<TE>   What teachers would like includes smaller classes, better academic
preparation in elementary school and more vocational programs to
broaden the choices for unconventional children. And a way of
convincing parents that success in school ought to be a priority.</TE>
<TE>   "When I drop my son off at school, I see kids showing up with no
backpacks, no books. You know they're not serious about education,"
said Johari DeWitt-Rogers, a Muir parent.</TE>
<TE>   "In the same way this teacher's letter galvanized people to come
forward and protest his statements, we're going to have to get the
community to rally together and turn things around, to say this is
not acceptable for our young people."</TE>

<HD>Dave Ray, 59; Influential '60s Folk-Blues Singer, Guitarist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Ray, an influential figure of the folk-blues scene of the 1960s
who won quiet renown for his virtuoso six- and 12-string guitar work,
has died. He was 59.</LD>
<LD>   Ray died Thursday at his home in Minneapolis, said John Koerner,
his onetime band partner. Ray had been diagnosed with lung cancer in
May.</LD>
<LD>   Ray and Koerner, plus harmonica player Tony Glover, met through a
Minneapolis folk club in the late 1950s. They formed the acoustic
trio Koerner, Ray and Glover in 1962, and the next year released the
landmark "Blues, Rags &amp; Hollers" album.</LD>
<TE>   They recorded several albums of rough country blues and performed
at folk festivals around the country.</TE>
<TE>   But though they never achieved more than cult status, they
influenced such legends as the Beatles, Bob Dylan, the Rolling
Stones, Bonnie Raitt and Beck.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man, Dylan had listened to records at Ray's house and
traveled in the same circles. "Every time they play, the lights
shine," wrote Dylan when the trio released their "One Foot in the
Groove" album in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Beck, who had Ray and Glover open for him in the Twin Cities some
years ago, said of the trio: "They seem to be ... the only people
from that folk-revival period who would just completely play their
music with abandon. They were just so raucous."</TE>
<TE>   Koerner, Ray &amp; Glover parted ways in the late 1960s, but
periodically reunited over the years and also recorded individual
albums. In recent years, some of their earlier works, including
"Blues, Rags &amp; Hollers," have been reissued on CD.</TE>
<TE>   Ray carved out a cultish solo career. He engineered Raitt's first
album.</TE>

<HD>Tiny Elementary Campus a Magnet for Parents' Support</HD>
<DH>The 91-year-old school, the pride of the Santa Rosa Valley,
survived talk of possible closure by becoming the district's tech
education center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzie St. John</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nestled among the million-dollar homes and equestrian trails of Santa
Rosa Valley is a tiny elementary school that is the heart and soul of
this close-knit community.</LD>
<LD>   Think "Little House on the Prairie" meets "Beverly Hills 90210."</LD>
<LD>   Part of that feeling springs from the school's size: Only 235
students -- kindergarten through fifth grade -- attend Santa Rosa
Technology Magnet School.</LD>
<TE>   But more than that, the feeling comes from the overwhelming number
of parents who spend hours serving on the PTA, volunteering in
classrooms and putting together fund-raisers to keep the public
school thriving.</TE>
<TE>   For these parents, many of them doctors, lawyers or CEOs, the
school has evolved into a gathering point that serves as the heart of
this community of 1,000 or so homes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a quaint, old-time school where everybody knows everybody,"
said Tammy Boyle, who has four children enrolled.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of the culture out here that you get involved. It's the
way the school has always worked."</TE>
<TE>   The school was built in 1911 by local farmers -- known then as the
Norwegian Colony -- who wanted their children to have an education.</TE>
<TE>   The 23-square-mile district, at the northern end of the Conejo
Grade in Ventura County, was formed by taking parts of the Somis,
Moorpark and Timber school districts.</TE>
<TE>   The first schoolhouse was built on 1 1/2 acres purchased from
Louis Maulhardt for $10.</TE>
<TE>   Gladys Ringold taught the first class of 15 students and was paid
$560 for the school year.</TE>
<TE>   That original structure stood until the current buildings were
constructed in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   Parents' support served as the school's driving force 91 years
ago, and that tradition is carried on today.</TE>
<TE>   When talk began circulating on the school possibly closing due to
low enrollment and budget cuts, Santa Rosa Valley parents took
action.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime resident Tony Cerato helped spearhead a survey asking
parents what they wanted in their school.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is this perception about public education, and
obviously many of us who live here can afford to send our children to
private schools," said Cerato, who has three sons attending the
magnet school. "The point of the survey was to find out how we can
improve to entice people in the area to come here."</TE>
<TE>   Cerato said the 47% response rate showed people liked the idea of
a technology magnet school.</TE>
<TE>   "What we also found was that we were providing things already that
people just didn't know we had, such as strong parental involvement
with the PTA," Cerato added.</TE>
<TE>   So at the start of this school year, Santa Rosa School became
Santa Rosa Technology Magnet School. It remains part of the Pleasant
Valley School District but now places an emphasis on technology in
addition to the three R's.</TE>
<TE>   Students are studying software programs, using the Internet
regularly for their studies and learning how to use digital cameras
to create the school yearbook.</TE>
<TE>   The school also is used for adult education classes, Cub Scout and
Girl Scout meetings and as a sports practice site.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more like a community center," parent volunteer Marlene
O'Tousa said. "We wouldn't know anyone if our kids didn't go here."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a misnomer to think that everyone in Santa Rosa Valley has a
lot of money and we're all snobs," resident Karyn Pepperman said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not a lot of pretentiousness. And if you come in with
it, you lose it real quick."</TE>

<TE>   The first schoolhouse was built on 1 1/2 acres purchased from
Louis Maulhardt for $10. Gladys Ringold taught the first class of 15
students and was paid $560 for the school year. That original
structure stood until the current buildings were constructed in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   Parents' support served as the school's driving force 91 years
ago, and that tradition continues. When talk began circulating on the
school possibly closing due to low enrollment and budget cuts, Santa
Rosa Valley parents took action.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime resident Tony Cerato helped spearhead a survey asking
parents what they wanted in their school.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is this perception about public education, and
obviously many of us who live here can afford to send our children to
private schools," said Cerato, who has three sons attending the
magnet school. "The point of the survey was to find out how we can
improve to entice people in the area to come here."</TE>
<TE>   Cerato said the 47% response rate showed people liked the idea of
a technology magnet school.</TE>
<TE>   "What we also found was that we were providing things already that
people just didn't know we had, such as strong parental involvement
with the PTA," Cerato added.</TE>
<TE>   So at the start of this school year, Santa Rosa School became
Santa Rosa Technology Magnet School. It remains part of the Pleasant
Valley School District but now places an emphasis on technology in
addition to the three R's.</TE>
<TE>   Students are studying software programs, using the Internet
regularly for their studies and learning how to use digital cameras
to create the school yearbook.</TE>
<TE>   Principal Michelle Odle said the big push this year is to get the
teachers up and running with the new curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge benefit for the teachers to have parents in the
classroom," said Odle, who lives in the community. "It allows them to
do what they need to. When you have a small school, the teachers are
very taxed, but we have a lot of parents that are willing to help."</TE>
<TE>   Now in her 15th year at the school, teacher Sally DeWeese enjoys
bragging about the parental support.</TE>
<TE>   "When it's Teacher Appreciation Week, we get something every day;
we feel very appreciated by our parents," said the 62-year-old
Camarillo resident.</TE>
<TE>   DeWeese said she can't recall a time when there was not a large
contingency of parents always willing to help. "They become more like
personal friends," DeWeese said. "And they treat you like you are a
member of their family."</TE>
<TE>   She said there are many traditions that come with being part of a
small school, such as the annual Thanksgiving feast, when families
and staff members share a meal before the long holiday weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, however, the brewing excitement over the upcoming
festivities was shattered when tragedy struck the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 22, 1999, Socorro Caro fatally shot three of her sons, all
students at the school.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers, parents and students were devastated by the news, but
the tragedy pushed community members closer.</TE>
<TE>   "There weren't too many of us that weren't affected by it," Cerato
said. "What made a big difference in how we handled it was that it
was a domestic situation, not an outsider coming in. So instead of
feeling wary about where we lived, we pulled together to support each
other.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the reason we live in this little area is the privacy,
but there is also a camaraderie that makes it unique. At the end of
the day, it's all about the kids," Cerato said.</TE>
<TE>   The community's strength was tested again last December when
Jennifer Bonds, 14, died after being struck by a car as she jogged
along Santa Rosa Road with her father. Although Jennifer was in high
school, her family had close ties with the school and the community.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody just came together to support the family," said Karyn
Pepperman, whose son was baby-sat by Jennifer.</TE>
<TE>   After the accident, the school was used as a meeting place for
discussions of traffic on Santa Rosa Road.</TE>
<TE>   The school also is used for adult education classes, Cub Scout and
Girl Scout meetings and as a sports practice site.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more like a community center," parent volunteer Marlene
O'Tousa said. "We wouldn't know anyone if our kids didn't go here."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a misnomer to think that everyone in Santa Rosa Valley has a
lot of money and we're all snobs," Pepperman said. "There is not a
lot of pretentiousness. And if you come in with it, you lose it real
quick."</TE>

<HD>Hunt Is On for Fix-Up Money</HD>
<DH>Westwood Village's business improvement district was
expected to bring in $1 million per year. But it has only $40,000 in
its account.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An effort to spruce up Westwood Village to lure more shoppers is
grinding to a halt, and village merchants are asking what happened to
hundreds of thousands of dollars that were supposed to help fund the
effort.</LD>
<LD>   A private audit is underway to solve the mystery of the missing
money. It may expose whether the money -- which was thought to have
been collected by the city from property owners -- was stolen, never
received or lost in a bookkeeping mishap.</LD>
<LD>   The audit's conclusions may not only influence Westwood's future
but also serve as a wake-up call to fans of a fast-spreading trend in
the area of economic development. The nationwide trend is to create
"business improvement districts" -- entities that are designed to
supplement, but not replace, city services.</LD>
<TE>   Westwood was home to one of 32 business improvement districts in
Los Angeles, nearly double the 17 that the city had in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Merchants or property owners in a designated area typically are
assessed fees to fund the districts. The idea is that shoppers will
flock to clean, safe streets that are free of graffiti and lined with
freshly trimmed trees.</TE>
<TE>   The business improvement district in Westwood administered a
parking validation program and funded a community service center, in
addition to bolstering maintenance services. Like others in the city,
the district was governed by an appointed board of directors and
chartered by the city.</TE>
<TE>   Problems with the Westwood district surfaced in September, when
Los Angeles County prosecutors concluded that the Westwood Village
Community Alliance, the nonprofit corporation that administers the
district, had violated the Brown Act, the state's open-meeting law.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Jack Weiss also joined the criticism,
concluding after a monthlong analysis that the improvement district
was a "flawed institution" and announcing that he had decided against
its renewal. Consequently, property owners can no longer be assessed
fees.</TE>
<TE>   Next came word from City Clerk J. Michael Carey that the district
had just $40,000 left in its account, rather than the $600,000 or
more that some board members had assumed.</TE>
<TE>   That revelation prompted the alliance board to call for a private
audit to cover a three-year period dating to 1999 -- the year annual
audits of the district inexplicably ceased. The audit's outcome is
not due for several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The lag time has given rise to a combination of speculation,
finger-pointing and soul-searching in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're trying to find out is if the city has paid us all the
money," said Frank Ponder, the board's president. "We're not sure if
they've collected all the money they're supposed to."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Kalfayan, chief management analyst for the city clerk's
office, suggested that the fiscal confusion might have been caused by
a miscalculation of how much money the district would raise.</TE>
<TE>   A district management plan drawn up in 2000 predicted that the
program would collect about $1 million a year, Kalfayan said, but
during the last year, assessment fees totaled only $844,000. The
difference, she said, could explain why the district's account holds
less money than board members had assumed.</TE>
<TE>   Baffled board members wonder whether the funds got lost in a
fiscal quagmire that is waiting to be unearthed by an accountant.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Walsh, the business improvement district's executive director,
resigned in October and could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Although some merchants will continue certain district functions
voluntarily, other services have been eliminated or diminished. A
community service center on Broxton Avenue has closed, for example.
The UC Police Department is owed at least $15,000 for three community
service officers who helped staff the office, said Nancy Greenstein,
a department spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The city clerk's office is working with several other creditors,
including a maintenance company that has not been paid since March.</TE>
<TE>   A separate assessment that predates the district and totals about
$200,000 annually is available for the next five years to bolster
trash pickups, tree trimming and sidewalk cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   That may not be enough to appease eagle-eyed merchants. Some have
noticed more gum, cigarette butts and newspapers littering village
gutters and sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me there's a little more junk on the streets," said
Jeff Abell of Sarah Leonard Fine Jewelers.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss said he and several local leaders are discussing creation of
an organization that won't repeat the mistakes of its predecessor.
The focus, he said, should be on keeping Westwood clean.</TE>
<TE>   "In 'Field of Dreams,' they said, 'If you build it, they will
come,' " Weiss said. "My feeling with Westwood is, if you maintain it
properly, they will come."</TE>
<TE>   Others sense that bigger culprits are keeping crowds at bay. A
village once known for a melange of one-of-a kind shops and
glittering Hollywood movie premieres has lost some of its luster over
the years.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the "P" word. "The economic engine is here in
Westwood. The problem becomes, it's too inconvenient," said Jay
Handal, president of the West L.A. Chamber of Commerce. "That gets
back to the parking, the parking, the parking."</TE>
<TE>   Handal was one of several dozen people who attended a Nov. 13 town
hall meeting to discuss Westwood's future. Participants repeatedly
cited a dearth of inexpensive, convenient parking as a key problem
that city officials must do more to address.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm somewhat of a heretic here," Weiss said in an interview. "I
believe there is parking in Westwood.... Sure, we can do better, but
I don't want people to be under the misimpression that they can't
come to Westwood to park and shop because they can."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Westwood merchants or property owners will choose to
create a new improvement district to tackle the parking issue and
other drawbacks is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   If a "trauma" hits a business improvement district, "it's often
several years before there's enough collective will to take another
shot at it," said Bradley Segal, a Denver-based consultant for
several California business improvement districts.</TE>
<TE>   But creating another district also will depend on what happened to
the missing money.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping that the money is there and that nobody has kept track
of it in a proper way," said Abell, who was a district board member.
"If money was spent on things not authorized by the board, I don't
know where this will go."</TE>

<HD>Thanksgiving Releases Power of Togetherness</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Julie Hudash</AU>
<BD>Julie Hudash is an Irvine-based freelance writer who
focuses on children's issues.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Mommy, what's your favorite color?" my preschooler asks while
sorting her breakfast into brightly colored piles. Maybe Skittles
aren't the most nutritiously balanced meal, but, hey, each color
actually represents a fruit. Plus, grouping is a task required on
those standardized tests, I rationalize. "Yellow," I say. "It's
bright and cheery."</LD>
<LD>   "Favorite number?" Molly asks, pigtails askew. "Seven. It's always
been my lucky number," I say. Coincidentally, Molly is the youngest
in our family of seven. "Lucky it's not six," I add.</LD>
<LD>   "Favorite food?" I gulp my coffee as little Barbara Walters picks
up steam. There's hardly a food I dislike, but to pick a favorite,
hmm. "I'll get back to you on that one."</LD>
<TE>   The interview presses on. Molly's dramatic spike in verbal
metabolism is fueled by the early morning rediscovery of her nearly
demolished supply of trick-or-treat candy. "How 'bout your best day?"
Definitely not Halloween, I think, massaging my temples.</TE>
<TE>   She stares at me, one hand hiding her candy-packed grin. I pause,
which isn't smart when trying to keep pace with a kid. It was a
no-brainer until now. My birthday? Mother's Day? Depends on the
season. "Thanksgiving," I say. Molly looks at me with pity, as if I
just blew the billion-dollar question. "There's no presents on
Thanksgiiiviiing!" she whines.</TE>
<TE>   Losing interest, she pops her final Skittle and bounces off like
Tigger with a sugar buzz. I sit in the kitchen alone with my answer.
Thanksgiving. I ask myself what I am most thankful for. I've always
loved Thanksgiving and appreciated the blessings of family and
friends, but somehow this year feels different.</TE>
<TE>   Last Thanksgiving arrived, like an uninvited guest, just weeks
after that horrible day in September. The dust may have settled in
Manhattan, but it's still swirling in my mind. Aside from Sept. 11,
we've had anthrax, kidnappers and snipers; even the economy has been
frightening.</TE>
<TE>   Our doorstep is crowded with the threat of future attacks and a
war with Iraq. Then I realize why Thanksgiving is such a wonderful
holiday. It has the powerful ability to connect people, at a time
when so much can be divisive. Thanksgiving is a day to celebrate,
free from constraints created by cultural, political and religious
diversities.</TE>
<TE>   After all, if the pilgrims hadn't trusted the Indians that harsh
winter, it's possible none of them would have survived. Imagine that
first three-day Thanksgiving feast, a simple celebration of racial
harmony, religious tolerance and survival. All accomplished without
the help of a single football game.</TE>
<TE>   We can't seem to stop the avalanche of holiday decorations from
overtaking Thanksgiving, so we'll have to make a conscious choice to
elevate turkey day to its deserving and meaningful position. It's
more than a day to quit shopping long enough to devour a turkey
dinner, followed by strategic planning to hit all of Friday's 5 a.m.
early bird sales.</TE>
<TE>   This Thanksgiving I'll set aside fears sparked by recent events. I
will postpone the anxiety regarding our future with Iraq and say a
prayer for people no longer here. Then I'll indulge myself in the
joys that can go unappreciated during this busy time of year. My hugs
will be tighter and linger a few extra moments. My frustration with
trying to have the traditional Thanksgiving dishes hot simultaneously
won't drown out the laughter of my children, nieces and nephews.
Conversation will win out over dishwashing.</TE>
<TE>   And the best treat imaginable will be savored: The peace of having
loved ones close and safe from the evil that threatens us so close to
home.</TE>
<TE>   Thoughts of Thanksgiving baste my usual chaotic day. I make time
to e-mail friends, family and colleagues to ask what they're most
thankful for -- unaware of the gifts I'd receive. Each "You've got
mail" delivers another reminder of what's most important in life.</TE>
<TE>   My virtual mailbox gets stuffed with messages about the importance
of family and friends and their ability to keep us grounded and make
us laugh. Many echo sentiments of good fortune to live in this great
country, which offers freedom to worship and celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   That night I fall asleep with renewed spirit. Why? I'm not sure.
Recent events may have served us a platter of vulnerability. But I
think it came with an unsuspecting side dish, a super-sized helping
of human spirit, appreciation and kindness.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning I relax, savoring my three minutes alone with my
coffee. The morning rush to get children off to school is over, and
Molly saunters into the kitchen searching for her lost candy bucket.
She hops onto the stool hopeful, but not optimistic, of enjoying a
repeat of yesterday's colorful morning entree. I realize I never
answered her question about my favorite food. "Pumpkin pie, with lots
of whipped cream," I exclaim.</TE>
<TE>   Molly looks at me with a twinkle in her eye, "Yummy, for
breakfast?"</TE>

<HD>We Should Say Yes to an Aggressive Policy on AIDS</HD>
<DH>This disease threatens to derail entire economies and even
alter the global geopolitical balance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Pearl Jemison-Smith</AU>
<BD>Pearl Jemison-Smith is a retired nurse, a founding
board member of AIDS Services Foundation and chairwoman of the AIDS
Walk Orange County.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today is World AIDS Day. As a mother with a son who has been living
with HIV for more than 20 years, I don't need a World AIDS Day to
remind me of the devastation that HIV disease is causing here and
throughout the world.</LD>
<LD>   From an unusual outbreak of pneumonia among gay men in large U.S.
cities in the early 1980s, we have watched a pandemic that has gone
on to kill millions of people. Current estimates of infections
worldwide are staggering.</LD>
<LD>   In the beginning, we talked about it being the "4H disease," since
those affected were homosexuals, Haitians, heroin users and
hemophiliacs. Gay white males now represent fewer than 50% of those
infected for the first time in the U.S. Today, HIV/AIDS is a disease
of poverty, ignorance, official denial and, in this country, minority
populations.</LD>
<TE>   We read statistics about 28.5-million people being infected in
sub-Saharan Africa, or 14 million children orphaned worldwide because
of HIV/AIDS, but the numbers are so large they just don't register. I
am afraid that the numbers are numbing us into complacency.</TE>
<TE>   George Will recently wrote in Newsweek, "The HIV epidemic in
Eurasia is a phenomenon more destabilizing than any act of terrorism
has ever been." The Indianapolis Star concluded that "we must see
AIDS for what it is: a weapon of mass destruction." The epidemic's
next big wave now is occurring in Russia, China, India, Nigeria and
Ethiopia, countries that are home to 40% of the world's population.
The infections are overwhelmingly occurring in heterosexuals.</TE>
<TE>   At home, the U.S. must implement a comprehensive government-wide
strategic plan to address the AIDS pandemic. And it must act now.
With no cure or vaccine in sight and medications available only for a
very few of the infected, this disease threatens to derail entire
economies and even alter the global geopolitical balance.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 7, the FDA approved a 20-minute HIV test that can
eliminate the current two-week waiting period for test results. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that between
850,000 and 950,000 Americans have HIV--and that a quarter of them
don't even know it. Some 600 positive HIV test results go undelivered
in California annually because individuals fail to return to find out
if they're infected. Testing is very important to the disease's
management, along with getting sick people into care and educating
them about how to prevent its spread.</TE>
<TE>   In July, California passed a law that made HIV a reportable
disease. Within months we will have accurate statistics and be able
to track new infections. This information will tell us where to focus
prevention efforts, which remain our most powerful weapon against the
epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County continues to establish public-private partnerships
to provide services and care for the growing numbers of people living
with HIV. The key to controlling the epidemic is prevention. The
virus is entering new demographic groups at an alarming rate. We must
be culturally sensitive in building our strategies and coalitions.
And we must target both HIV-negative and HIV-positive individuals.</TE>
<TE>   After 20 years, the AIDS crisis has caused many advocates and
caregivers to burn out -- wearied by the constant battle. The media
often portray the disease as a chronic, manageable illness.
Pharmaceutical companies pay big bucks for advertising that shows
healthy young men capable of climbing mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The advertisements do not show the devastating side effects of the
drug cocktails. Those under 30 don't have memories of friends dying
terrible deaths, of hospital wards and funerals every month.
Attitudes toward safer sex are casual, and warnings are often
ignored. Sexually transmitted diseases are on the upswing. They could
very well signal that new HIV infections might be about to explode
again. Are we ready for that?</TE>
<TE>   Our current federal administration's emphasis on the "abstinence
only" message is totally worrying for those of us in the trenches.
Abstinence will prevent some of the spread of HIV, but hormones often
prevail over morals and even the best intended education. We parents
know that. We have to give our children and young adults the tools,
the skills and the knowledge to protect themselves and others.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent poll conducted by CollegeClub.com, more than half of
the U.S. college students responding reported that they have had
unsafe sex during the last year. Nearly 80% acknowledged "no problem
having sex without being in a relationship." Let's face it: Our "war
on unsafe sex" through abstinence will not work any better than our
war on drugs and "just say no" did.</TE>
<TE>   The "abstinence only" message, which is receiving funding from the
Bush administration, is painfully shortsighted. The scientific
community and our best behavioral scientists are very clear on this.
Let's listen to them and not moralists, however well-meaning they may
be. It is time to blend some common sense with behavioral science and
adopt prevention programs that reflect reality.</TE>
<TE>   As a mother, I ask you to support enlightened public policy,
aggressive HIV education and prevention (including education about
condom use) as well as abstinence. Our young people deserve nothing
less.</TE>

Ivory Coast as loyalist troops headed toward the area.</LD>
<LD>   Eighty-three of 160 foreigners seeking to leave the city of Man
were flown south to Abidjan, the commercial capital of the former
French colony. The rest were to follow on a second plane.</LD>
<LD>   The French said one of their soldiers was wounded and at least
five rebels were killed in gun battles to secure the airport for the
evacuation. It was not known whether any Americans were among the
evacuees, half of whom were believed to be French.</LD>

<LD>Six South African judges who make up tiny Swaziland's top judicial
body have quit in protest of a government decision to ignore their
rulings that would limit the power of King Mswati III.</LD>
<LD>   Prime Minister Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini said the Court of Appeal
judges, on loan from South Africa, had overstepped their authority in
two rulings that held that Mswati, sub-Saharan Africa's last absolute
monarch, had no constitutional power to override parliament by
issuing his own decrees.</LD>

<HD>Developers Plan Luxury Hotel in Kabul</HD>
<DH>Afghan-U.S. project is a vote of confidence in a country
still rife with violence and insecurity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Kraul</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>A luxury hotel that an Afghan American investment group plans to
build here with the financial backing of the U.S. government would be
the largest private development project this war-torn country has
seen in decades and a vote of confidence in a country still rife with
violence and insecurity.</LD>
<LD>   If the deal's loose ends are tied up as expected, a $40-million
hotel that Afghan officials say will be managed by Hyatt Regency will
be built on land opposite the U.S. Embassy. Financing is to come from
the Overseas Private Investment Corp., a U.S. agency that specializes
in making loans in countries where commercial banks fear to tread.</LD>
<LD>   The 200-room project is significant for practical and symbolic
reasons. It would fill an enormous void in hotel rooms in a city left
largely in ruins by more than two decades of war. The shortage makes
it difficult for foreign businesspeople to work here, impeding the
country's economic recovery.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, the project is taking shape amid sporadic but ongoing
rocket attacks and bombings in and around the capital and
demonstrates faith among the investors that better days lie ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan government is leasing the hotel site to the developers
on favorable terms, sources say, motivated by the jobs the project
will generate and by the prestige of having attracted an
international hotel chain, the first here in the capital in 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Construction on the property, once destined for the Czech and
Polish embassies, is to start early next year, pending final approval
of the OPIC loan, which is expected to cover at least 60% of the
construction cost.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan and U.S. officials said they were confident the loan would
come through.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel is being built by a partnership that includes a group of
Afghan American businesspeople who emigrated to the United States,
made their fortunes and have returned, the investors say, to help get
their homeland back on its feet. Also drawing them, they admit, is
the possibility of enormous profits in a country deficient in many
basic goods and services.</TE>
<TE>   "It is our duty to be back here and share in the rebuilding of our
country after 22 years of warfare and misery," said Zaher Yaqubie,
41, whose family established a successful New York City-based trading
company after arriving in the U.S. in the 1980s. His business here,
Afghanistan Reconstruction Co., has as its partner in the hotel
project one of Turkey's largest construction companies, Yuksel.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan and U.S. governments played key roles in striking a
tentative deal at a recent meeting in Dubai, United Arab Emirates,
that included officials of Chicago-based Hyatt, said Adib Farhadi,
director of the Afghan Foreign Ministry's economic affairs
department.</TE>
<TE>   Christina Koenig of Hyatt International said last week that her
company "had been invited to participate in discussions" about
operating a hotel in Kabul but as yet had signed nothing definitive.</TE>
<TE>   Hyatt operates several hotels in Central Asia and "knows the
area," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Afghanistan slips back into the "dark ages of chaos" that
it experienced in recent decades depends on the country's ability to
attract private investment such as the hotel project, Farhadi said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of companies, foreign and Afghan, are on the sidelines
waiting to see what will happen," he said. "When a company like Hyatt
is ready to come, it symbolizes that stability is on the way. This is
a great symbolic sign of reconstruction."</TE>
<TE>   World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern agrees that private
investment is crucial to Afghanistan's future. Stern visited Kabul
last week and met with government and business leaders to discuss
economic growth and how to stimulate it, saying this was an
"absolutely critical period in Afghanistan's history."</TE>
<TE>   "It will be the private sector that drives growth," Stern said,
adding that there are obstacles to be overcome. "Security would be
one, so would red tape and the absence of a banking system and the
lack of infrastructure, particularly transport."</TE>
<TE>   Stern, who toured World Bank-sponsored rural development projects
here, sees small but sure signs that "beneath the radar screen,"
progress is being made on a community level as "people become
confident war won't break out again."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the loan, OPIC is providing the hotel developers
with political-risk insurance to cover any losses caused by terrorism
or war, said sources close to the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Those risks were apparent last week when a rocket launched by
terrorists landed in downtown Kabul just yards from the Finance
Ministry the day after six rockets were fired in the eastern environs
of the capital. The week before, an Iraqi Kurd was arrested for
allegedly possessing explosives and planning to assassinate President
Hamid Karzai or Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim.</TE>
<TE>   Yaqubie said he recognizes the risks but is willing to take them.
"We must put our hands together and make it happen," he said. "If
not, the only alternative is chaos."</TE>
<TE>   Some long-awaited public works projects also are underway,
generating jobs and lending legitimacy to the Karzai government.
Construction began Nov. 10 on a $180-million road rehabilitation
project linking Kabul to the nation's western border. The 600-mile
project is being funded jointly by the Saudis, the Asian Development
Bank and the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   Work also has started on a new U.S. Embassy building adjacent to
its existing site, a project that will cost $115 million. Yaqubie's
company is a subcontractor on a 25-mile section of the road project
and on the embassy construction as well.</TE>
<TE>   Other private projects are coming along, albeit slowly. The
renovation of a Kabul landmark, the Hotel Kabul, was announced last
month. The Aga Khan Development Foundation will spend $27 million to
renovate the 80-room hotel, which was damaged during the war. The
hotel will become part of the luxury Serena hotel chain owned by the
Aga Khan, a Muslim leader and philanthropist.</TE>

<HD>Experts Probe Virus in India</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LUCKNOW, India</DL>
<LD>Health experts have begun investigating a mysterious virus that has
killed nearly 100 children and sickened hundreds more people over the
last two months in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, officials
said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The children, most of them younger than 12, died after what
doctors and officials described as a high fever brought on by
mosquito bites.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors said children and older people were more susceptible
because their immune systems were weaker.</LD>
<TE>   Two teams of doctors and public health specialists from the
federal and state governments have started studying the outbreak in
Saharanpur, the worst affected district, said Navtej Singh, a
district official.</TE>
<TE>   But authorities were divided over what the virus was. Some
patients have shown symptoms similar to those of Japanese
encephalitis, but others have not.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese encephalitis is spread from pigs to humans through
mosquito bites. It attacks the central nervous system, causing
flu-like symptoms, vomiting, paralysis and sometimes death.</TE>
<TE>   At least 60 children have died in Saharanpur, said Chandan L.
Choudhury, a district official. Children have also died in the
neighboring districts of Muzaffarnagar, Ghaziabad and Meerut.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of children die each year from diseases borne by
mosquitoes and flies in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state in size
and population, because of poverty and lack of hygiene and education.</TE>

<HD>Inspectors Access Once 'Sensitive' Iraqi Sites</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALAD, Iraq</DL>
<LD>International weapons investigators Saturday made an unannounced
inspection at a military post that Iraq once declared "sensitive" and
subject to restricted access.</LD>
<LD>   On the third day of renewed inspections, U.N. monitors received
unrestricted access to the Chemical Corps base, as mandated by the
Security Council when it sent them back to Iraq with powers to
inspect anyplace, anytime. Another team, meanwhile, inspected a
complex that was once the heart of Iraq's aborted effort to build
nuclear bombs.</LD>
<LD>   In both cases, as expected, the U.N. teams did not disclose their
findings, holding them for later reports. But their spokesman
indicated that they were satisfied with Iraqi cooperation.</LD>
<TE>   "They were able to conduct inspections as they planned," Hiro Ueki
said.</TE>
<TE>   On the Iraqi side, the commander of the Balad military post north
of Baghdad said: "They found nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The inspections resumed under a resolution giving Iraq a "final
opportunity" to shut down any chemical, biological or nuclear weapons
programs or face "serious consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Inspections in the 1990s, after the Persian Gulf War, led to the
destruction of many tons of Iraqi chemical and biological weapons,
and the equipment to produce them. U.N. teams also dismantled Iraq's
nuclear weapons program before it could produce a bomb. But that
inspection regime ended in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Those inspectors believed that they never found all of Iraq's
suspected weapons of mass destruction, particularly chemical arms.
The United States now threatens war to disarm the Baghdad government
if the new inspections cannot achieve that goal.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, Iraq declared some facilities to be "sensitive
sites." Under informal agreements with U.N. officials, advance notice
was given of inspections at those sites and the number of inspectors
was limited.</TE>
<TE>   Balad was one such site, Ueki said Saturday, but he didn't know
the circumstances of its prior inspection.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, a convoy of four U.N. vehicles, trailed by
journalists' cars, rolled up a country road to the back gate, sending
soldiers scrambling. Iraqi officers, who accompany the U.N.
inspectors to their undisclosed destinations, shouted orders for the
area to be "frozen," or placed under U.N. procedures for sealing off

<HD>Site of Kenyan Attacks Is Busy Port for Illegal Arms</HD>
<DH>Despite efforts to improve security, bribery remains
rampant. Hotel bombing probe appears to founder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Davan Maharaj</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOMBASA, Kenya</DL>
<LD>For more than 500 years, this city on the Indian Ocean has been a key
entrepot to the Middle East, with traders moving large volumes of
everything from ivory and spices to human cargo.</LD>
<LD>   But in recent times, Mombasa has also become a popular port for
traffickers smuggling illegal firearms to armies fighting civil wars
in the continent.</LD>
<LD>   So it came as little surprise to many people here when authorities
revealed that someone standing in a grassy canyon near the Mombasa
airport fired two missiles at a chartered Israeli airliner carrying
271 people Thursday. The missiles streaked just past the plane.</LD>
<TE>   A few minutes later, three suicide bombers attacked a Mombasa
hotel catering to Israeli tourists, killing three Israelis and 10
Kenyans -- including one male victim discovered Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually anyone can slip contraband, including weapons, into
Kenya simply by bribing customs officers or senior government
officials, according to police officers and dockworkers.</TE>
<TE>   For the last several years, the U.S. government has been spending
millions of dollars to improve security at airports in Kenya and
elsewhere in Africa. But Thursday's attacks demonstrated that lax
security remains a problem.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the U.S. government warned Americans that they could
be targets of terrorist actions in East Africa. The State Department
said it had received information, the credibility of which had not
been confirmed, that attacks might occur in Djibouti, which lies
north of Kenya and borders Somalia and Ethiopia.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon is establishing a command center in Djibouti as it
boosts the number of U.S. troops in the Horn of Africa from 800 to
1,200 to help its campaign against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, the State Department repeated its warning against
Americans traveling to Yemen, across the Red Sea from Djibouti.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, authorities here continued to hunt for clues that could
lead them to the planners of the suicide bombing and the people who
fired the missiles.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation, however, appeared to be foundering. Police
released a Florida woman and her Spanish husband who were among 12
people detained following the blast.</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Kalhammer, 31, of Tallahassee, Fla., said she had come for
a "nostalgic" trip to Kenya with her husband, Jose Tena, 26. As a
girl, Kalhammer lived in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, with her parents,
who were U.S. diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   Police detained Kalhammer and Tena as they checked out of a nearby
resort shortly after the blast leveled the Paradise hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "We told [the police] we had nothing to do with this," Kalhammer
said as she and Tena emerged from a cell where they spent more than
48 hours. "We'd like a shower and a beer."</TE>
<TE>   Some or all of the 10 other detainees -- six Pakistanis and four
Somalis -- could be released soon. The men were seized from a
motorized dhow, or wooden boat, that had docked for repairs at the
old Mombasa port.</TE>
<TE>   "We searched the boat and found nothing," Lawrence Rotich, a
senior security official at the port, told the German Press Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Kenya's internal security minister, Julius Sunkuli, sought to
assure reporters Saturday that local police are capable of
spearheading the probe.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kenyan police do have the know-how and do have the resources
to be able to unravel a terror offense," Sunkuli said.</TE>
<TE>   But Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has deployed his Mossad
intelligence agency to investigate the attack.</TE>
<TE>   As investigators searched for clues, the bombing and attempted
attack on the plane have focused attention on this ancient port city,
the center of Kenya's Muslim minority and a favored settling place
for immigrants from Yemen, Somalia and other neighboring nations.</TE>
<TE>   Much of central and East Africa depends on Mombasa, the region's
largest port, for their imports of food, fuel and other goods.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent years, top Kenyan officials acknowledge, the port
has become a major channel for illegal weapons and is now notorious
for bribery and kickbacks.</TE>
<TE>   When U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick visited Kenya this
year, local businessmen complained to him that the price they pay to
move goods from Mombasa to Nairobi is far more than what they pay to
have the same items shipped from Asia to Mombasa.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, dockworkers here said Mossad investigators need not
look far for answers as to how the shoulder-fired missiles or the
explosives that ruined the Paradise hotel entered Mombasa.</TE>
<TE>   Kenya shares a porous border with Somalia, which has been ruled by
rival warlords since President Siad Barre was overthrown more than a
decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   And paying kitu kidogo -- Swahili for "a little something" -- to
Kenyan customs officials here to clear weapons or goods is routine.</TE>
<TE>   "In Kenya, with $50 you could [bring in enough explosives] to bomb
the whole country," one dockworker said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all because we're poor," said a port security officer, who
asked that his name not be used. "If you get paid less than $100 a
month [like most police and custom officials do], and someone offers
to give you a few thousand shillings to look the other way, you will
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the United Nations helped Kenya set up a program known
as the Africa Sea Ports Projects to combat weapons and drug smuggling
through Mombasa and other parts of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   But at a recent training seminar for customs officers, a senior
government official said many customs officials were simply not
capable of stopping the importation of illegal weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "At times, officers at control points do not understand the items
they are supposed to prevent from entering the country," said S.L.
Mpesha, head of the Central Firearms Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the illegal weapons that enter Kenya -- and flow to Sudan,
Congo and other African countries -- come on dhows, which for
centuries have plied trade routes from India to Mombasa to countries
in North Africa and the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the ideal smuggling craft because some of them could
dock in water only 18 inches deep," said Esmond Martin, who wrote a
book on the illegal trade carried out with Indian Ocean dhows. "If
dhows stopped smuggling, more than half would be on the beach the
next day."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's attack was not the first indication that danger was
afoot in Mombasa. Australia had warned its citizens, in a Nov. 12
advisory, to defer travel to the city because of intelligence
information about possible attacks against Western interests.
However, Australia said it had no specific information about where or
when an attack was planned.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, suicide bombers exposed Kenya's vulnerability to
terrorism in 1998, when men linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
terrorist network bombed the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania, killing more than 200 people.</TE>
<TE>   That year, the United States initiated its so-called Safe Skies
for Africa Initiative to improve security at airports across the
continent. Last month, U.S. officials furnished three Kenyan airports
with new X-ray machines, walk-through metal detectors and
explosive-trace detectors worth about $750,000.</TE>
<TE>   But many agree that trying to close security gaps could be an
endless task in Kenya and other parts of Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "You can try your best," said one Western diplomat. "But when you
think about it, an airport security officer who looks the other way
or a man in a dhow could cause a lot of trouble."</TE>

<HD>Kurdish Enclave Shows How Iraq Could Prosper</HD>
<DH>Isolated but industrious, the often persecuted ethnic group
has built a thriving, open society.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SULAYMANIYAH, Iraq</DL>
<LD>On the edge of this bustling Kurdish city, a little oil refinery
assembled from the cannibalized parts of cement, sugar and soft-drink
factories noisily pumps out 3,000 barrels a day. Its slogan: "Where
there's a well, there's a way."</LD>
<LD>   Like the refinery, the people of Iraq's craggy northern mountains
also have reconfigured the bits and pieces of their society in the
last three years to create one of the world's unique political
entities, an autonomous statelet inside Iraq that may set an example
for the future.</LD>
<LD>   With each step, however, the scrappy Kurds, isolated by their own
country as well as the outside world, have had to defy enormous odds.</LD>
<TE>   Persecuted for decades and cut off by Iraq in 1991, Kurds have had
trouble getting passports. So the prime minister of the northern
enclave has become a Brit, the minister of education a Swede, and the
ministers of human rights and reconstruction are Germans. Other
officials, converting time as students or workers abroad into
citizenship, have become Belgian, French, Italian, Spanish, Austrian
and Swiss.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there are any Portuguese among us," mused Minister
of Defense Sherdl Hawezey of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which
runs the eastern sector of Kurdistan.</TE>
<TE>   Excluded from political experience in Baghdad, the Kurds also have
been imaginative in adapting skills to needs. PUK intelligence chief
Khasro Mohammed is a former veterinarian who specialized in poultry.</TE>
<TE>   "Both jobs require research and investigation," he said with a
chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   And hard hit by U.N. and Iraqi sanctions, the Kurds have generated
new revenue by turning the tables -- and taxing smugglers who ferry
oil and other goods on behalf of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
Kurds earn $1 million a day from levies on illicit trade, according
to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Our dinar -- the old one, without Saddam's picture on it -- is
now stronger than the currency in the rest of Iraq," said PUK Prime
Minister Barham Salih.</TE>
<TE>   Kurdistan has done so well in the last three years that many Kurds
like to boast that the north, an area twice the size of New Jersey,
could be a model for the rest of Iraq in a post-Hussein era.
"Kurdistan has traditionally been the least developed part of Iraq,
economically, politically and socially. If we could achieve this in
Kurdistan, we could easily achieve it in the rest of Iraq," Salih
added.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kurds, who make up 15% to 20% of Iraq's 23 million people,
are also the most sensitive issue when it comes to Iraq's future.
They've been fighting for self-rule from Baghdad since 1961. Iraq,
Turkey, Iran and Syria have long feared that their Kurds, who
together make up the world's largest ethnic group without a state,
would eventually attempt to break away -- taking valuable lands and
creating political upheaval in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Kurdish leaders say otherwise. Their goal is now a democracy that
allows them self-rule, like an American state or Swiss canton, in a
federal system.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a picture of the future of Iraq. We're now a fledgling
democracy by Mideast standards," said Sami Abdul Rahman, deputy prime
minister of the Kurdish Democratic Party, which runs Kurdistan's
western sector.</TE>
<TE>   Kurdistan is certainly the antithesis of Iraq -- and much of the
Islamic world.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper Hawlati, or "the Citizen" in English, has become the
bane of local politicians since its launch in 2000 -- on a 1967
printing press and two aged computers.</TE>
<TE>   An early investigation by the newspaper linked a Kurdish military
commander to the kidnapping and murder of a local woman, leading to
his arrest. The paper has published -- and challenged -- secret
government communications. Its editorials have blasted officials for
inefficiency, using party influence and corruption. It exposed a PUK
commander engaged in corrupt business deals and illegal kickbacks on
government contracts. And it has uncovered the death toll in
intra-Kurdish fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "Every week, someone comes through my office asking me to do
something about the papers," Salih said with a sigh. He has opted to
let the press have its say.</TE>
<TE>   "Politicians understand that allowing criticism is more important
than stopping criticism -- no small thing in Iraq. Allowing this
paper to publish gives them benefits too," said Aso Hardi, the
Citizen's editor, who trained as an engineer.</TE>
<TE>   Kurdistan has dozens of newspapers, some independent like the
Citizen and many tied to local parties. "But at least we have a lot
of parties," Hardi added.</TE>
<TE>   Kurds also have launched several television stations -- some with
satellite links beaming to the United States and Europe. One station
airs an equivalent of "Saturday Night Live" with irreverent pokes at
Kurdish politicians.</TE>
<TE>   To compensate for having no postal system, dozens of Internet
cafes have opened in the last three years. Unlike the censored
Internet in Iraq, Kurds have cheap, unrestricted access to the World
Wide Web. In turn, satellite dishes have brought in the outside world
-- and transformed the horizon, perched atop mud-brick homes in the
countryside and dangling with laundry off apartment balconies in
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Kurdistan's transformation is particularly striking after the
devastation during Iraqi rule. To quash rebellious Kurds in the
1980s, Hussein's army razed 90% of their villages. Thousands died in
chemical weapons attacks and 180,000 disappeared in government
roundups, according to human rights groups.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein struck again in 1991, when Kurds heeded Washington's call
to rise against Baghdad after the Persian Gulf War. To escape Iraq's
retaliation, more than 1 million Kurds fled to the borders. When U.S.
and British warplanes began protecting a northern "no-fly" zone,
Hussein pulled out and imposed economic sanctions to starve the
Kurds, already under the U.N. embargo on all Iraq. Landlocked, the
Kurds were cut off -- with no functioning economy.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the stubborn Kurds slowly began to rebuild.</TE>
<TE>   Salih, the erudite, British-educated prime minister of the PUK
sector, likes to cite the vast former Iraqi military compound in the
city he now governs as a sign of change. He did time there when he
was detained in 1979. So did his father in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   "For decades, it was the most feared place in town, the place
people were tortured and executed," he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   When Kurds returned from the borders in 1991, thousands converged
on the facility and tore it down. Today, it's an entertainment park
where on weekends Kurds ride the Ferris wheel, listen to youth bands
in an open-air amphitheater and walk in gardens of red gladioluses
and pink roses above what was the army's underground bunker for
ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurds owe much of their success to the no-fly zone and the
U.N. oil-for-food program launched in 1996. Kurds now receive 13% of
Iraq's oil revenue, all of which is channeled through the United
Nations back into the country. U.N. sanctions still apply, but Kurds
can use funds for reconstruction and humanitarian needs.</TE>
<TE>   "For all its shortcomings, oil-for-food rescued our people.
Everyone now gets a food basket for a whole month every month. It's
often worth more than the income of a family," said Abdul Rahman of
the KDP. "With that oil income, we've built schools and clinics,
developed agriculture, paved roads and planted some 3 million trees.
Kurds now have a sense of security."</TE>
<TE>   In Irbil, the KDP capital, a gray-and-white marble Central Bank
just opened, and a pink-and-white marble Justice Ministry is almost
finished. On a dramatic ridge, a five-star hotel is going up, and new
"hanging streets," or overpasses, reflect one of Kurdistan's latest
problems -- traffic jams from hundreds of new cars.</TE>
<TE>   The make-over has gradually eliminated Baghdad's influence. Unlike
the rest of Iraq, there are no statues or billboards heralding
Hussein's 23-year rule. With 65% of the Kurds younger than 25, many
don't even remember Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "I only know about him from stories my father tells. We were just
children when he ruled here," said 19-year-old Sawsan Ali, a freshman
at the University of Irbil, where students learn in Kurdish rather
than the Arabic of the rest of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurdish experiment still has serious problems -- and flaws.</TE>
<TE>   A Bush administration official said the north had made "impressive
progress." But the official challenged past elections and the
accountability of current political structures. "The results in 1992
were largely fixed in a back room when neither side liked the
outcome. The KDP and PUK ended up splitting most of the vote," the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Friction between the two political rivals derailed the experiment
during two years of fighting that ended only when Washington mediated
a truce in 1998, although the two Kurdish leaders in the U.S.-backed
opposition are now collaborating in broader efforts to plan for the
post-Hussein era.</TE>
<TE>   "Our main political problem today is that neither party wants to
be No. 2, and in a real democracy, everyone has to be No. 2 at some
point," said Hardi, the editor.</TE>
<TE>   Economically, Kurdistan remains in limbo. A new fast-food outlet
complete with golden arches has introduced Big Macs and Happy Meals
-- but as MaDonal's. "I have to wait until sanctions end to make it
the real thing," said owner Suleiman Kasab, a former hamburger
flipper at a McDonald's in Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, Kurds are not empowered to change laws, so they still
live under Iraq's constitution. "Press freedoms hang by a thread
because we don't have laws and institutions that support them," Hardi
said. "This whole dream could collapse at any moment."</TE>
<TE>   Or face even worse from Hussein's army and artillery visibly
poised on the border. Repeatedly quashed by Baghdad and betrayed when
America reneged on promises of support in 1975, 1991 and 1996, the
Kurds are especially wary of what lies ahead. They feel more
vulnerable than any other sector of Iraqi society, particularly from
the danger of Hussein lashing out against them in a preemptive strike
to divert attention from U.N. weapons inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Yet most minorities and women in Kurdistan say life today is far
better than in the rest of the country.</TE>
<TE>   The right of Christians in the region to have their own schools
and media has led to the revival of Assyrian, a modern version of
Aramaic, the language of Jesus, according to Zadook Adam of the Bet
Nahrain Democratic Party. Assyrians, who have been in Iraq since
before Christ, share five seats reserved for Christians in the
Kurdish National Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   A Catholic leader says Chaldeans, the other major denomination in
Kurdistan, are "protected and respected" in the north. "In Baghdad,
we have no rights, and relations are strained among the religions,"
said Archbishop Yacoub Scher of St. Joseph's Church in Irbil.</TE>
<TE>   For women, the PUK government has banned polygamy, while the KDP
allows multiple marriages only when the husband gets the first wife's
written permission and registers it in court. And the National
Assembly has outlawed honor killings throughout Kurdistan.</TE>
<TE>   The hottest issue is the status of the Turkomans, Kurdistan's
largest minority. The Turkoman Front boycotted the 1992 elections and
is now trying to negotiate for a share of seats in parliament and the
KDP administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The Arabs consider Iraq as part of the Arab nation, and the Kurds
see this area as part of greater Kurdistan. Both consider this their
home and not a country for us all," said Sanan Ahmed Agha, the
Turkoman Front's president.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, with six licensed political parties, Turkomans take
advantage of the new openings. They also have 15 schools, eight
newspapers, four magazines, six radio stations and two television
stations, according to the Turkoman Cultural Center in Irbil.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps ironically, the Kurdish experiment has led vast numbers of
Kurds to see their future in Iraq -- not in an independent Kurdistan
uniting the world's 25 million to 40 million Kurds.</TE>
<TE>   "We're proud of what we've done with 10 years of self-government,
but it has its limitations, so we realize there's nowhere to go from
here," Salih said. "Our interests will be best secured working with
other Iraqis to build a new government. To safeguard our future, we
want and need to be in Baghdad too."</TE>

<HD>Israel Arrests Militant Leader in Attack at Polls</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli forces arrested a commander of a militant group linked to
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat on Saturday after the
group claimed responsibility for an attack on an Israeli polling
booth that killed six people.</LD>
<LD>   Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade commander Maged Masri was arrested near
the West Bank city of Nablus. The brigade, an offshoot of Arafat's
Fatah faction, attacked the polling station Thursday in the northern
Israeli town of Beit Shean.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian sources said troops caught Masri and his assistant in
a safe house. An Israeli security source said Masri had been on the
wanted list for most of the 26-month-old Palestinian uprising against
Israel, for "many terror attacks which he helped recruit for and
plan." The militant also acted as a spokesman for the group and had
served as a Palestinian police officer.</LD>
<TE>   Israel has captured or killed dozens of Palestinian militant
leaders it says planned shootings and bombings. Masri's predecessor
was arrested nearly nine months ago.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli army spokesman said 18 suspected militants were also
rounded up Saturday in West Bank sweeps.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, troops fatally shot a Palestinian
teenager near the Karni border crossing, Palestinian hospital
officials said. A second youth was hit by a bullet in the back and
was hospitalized, they said.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli military source said that troops had fired warning
shots when a group of Palestinians approached the border fence and
that the army was investigating the reported death.</TE>
<TE>   Later Saturday, about 30 Israeli tanks and armored vehicles backed
by two Apache helicopters moved into the northern Gaza Strip town of
Beit Lahiya, firing machine guns and tank shells that knocked out the
town's power transformer, witnesses and Palestinian security
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   One man was reported killed there, security officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers surrounded a mosque and the local Fatah headquarters,
witnesses said. Israeli security sources said the troops demolished
the homes of three Islamic militants before leaving the town.</TE>

<HD>Beijing Theater Marks Orwell's Year of the Pigs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Chu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>The whispers hissing through Chinese theater circles these days
center on a single question: Can pigs fly?</LD>
<LD>   Some observers say yes, because they thought they'd never see the
day when George Orwell's classic critique of communist excess,
"Animal Farm," would be served up for mass consumption in China. Yet
there it is, adapted for the stage, at the Central Academy of Drama's
Experimental Theater in downtown Beijing.</LD>
<LD>   Others, however, are waiting to see whether these particular pigs,
the dictatorial leaders in Orwell's barnyard revolution, will fly
with Chinese audiences -- and with the authorities in the last
communist behemoth.</LD>
<TE>   With unintended irony, the stage version of "Animal Farm" opened
Nov. 15, just hours after the Communist Party unveiled the new
leaders who will rule this country virtually unchecked for the next
five years.</TE>
<TE>   As China-watchers scrambled to parse the new party lineup,
theatergoers in Beijing tried to interpret the meaning of a text
familiar to high school students in the English-speaking world but
practically unknown here.</TE>
<TE>   A scathing indictment of totalitarianism, "Animal Farm" was first
published in Britain in 1945. Orwell's novel of an animal utopia gone
bad was an overnight success in the West and spawned phrases that
have entered the vernacular, such as "four legs good, two legs bad"
and "some animals are more equal than others."</TE>
<TE>   Those slogans have been preserved in director Shang Chengjun's
theatrical adaptation, a quirky production that combines a large
cast, "Lion King"-like costumes, a revolving stage and eclectic music
ranging from klezmer to tango to the ethereal Celtic strains of the
singer Enya.</TE>
<TE>   But crucially, Shang has tweaked parts of the book and shifted its
original emphasis to send a different message to Chinese audiences --
one more palatable, perhaps, to official censors.</TE>
<TE>   Orwell intended the story to serve as a fable of the corrupting
effect of absolute power. The book focuses on the pigs who lead the
overthrow of the farm's owners but who become as tyrannical and
murderous as the human beings they replaced.</TE>
<TE>   What Shang insists he wants to convey instead is the danger of
apathy and abdication of conscience on the part of the masses, not
the ruthlessness and moral bankruptcy of the masters who oppress
them.</TE>
<TE>   "The novel stresses what the pigs did as the ruling class. What I
wanted to stress was not the ruling class, but the horses, the sheep
and the chickens, the animals that represent the masses and their
attitudes. I wanted to criticize them for being selfish, indifferent,
ignorant, fatuous and lazy," said Shang, 30.</TE>
<TE>   "Many foreign journalists have asked me whether this play hints at
something about China," he added. "But I told them, 'You shouldn't
think of it that way.' "</TE>
<TE>   Whether this is a sly case of doublespeak by Shang is hard to
tell, because at least a portion of the audience one recent evening
saw through the veil -- and was astonished at the play's daring in a
land where communist rhetoric still abounds and homage is paid to
icons such as Lenin.</TE>
<TE>   Parallels with Communist Chinese history are everywhere, from the
way the head pig, Napoleon, banishes a rival to the fact that one of
his henchmen in the book, Squealer, has been made into his wife in
the play. Older Chinese draw comparisons with the way Mao Tse-tung
turned on his close associate, Liu Shaoqi, in the 1960s and how
infamous Madame Mao became her husband's key advisor and proxy.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the bureaucratic and ideological campaigns -- the
egg-production committee, the wool-whitening movement -- and the
inflated production statistics in the play that evoke Mao's
disastrous Great Leap Forward of the late 1950s, during which
millions of Chinese starved to death.</TE>
<TE>   And in one dramatic scene, a hen who refuses to conform is
tortured into confessing to being a spy and eventually commits
suicide after the other animals shun her. In Orwell's version, such
"traitors" are ordered executed by Napoleon. But for Chinese viewers,
making the hen die in despair by her own hand recalls the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution, when neighbor denounced neighbor and fanatical
Red Guards hounded "class enemies," some of whom took their own lives
to escape persecution.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the play, the tyrant Napoleon -- well-fed and
comfortable while the other beasts slave away on the farm -- welcomes
back his former enemies, the humans, and toasts them with champagne.
In his smug demeanor and back-slapping official rhetoric, ordinary
Chinese recognize the fat cats of a corrupt Communist Party that now
welcomes capitalists into the fold.</TE>
<TE>   "This book was prophetic," said theatergoer Richard Feng, a
32-year-old computer programmer. "It was written in the '40s, but it
describes China in the '50s and the '70s, the Great Leap Forward and
the Cultural Revolution. It's like it's describing China more than it
is Russia."</TE>
<TE>   With such politically sensitive content, the fact that "Animal
Farm" made it to the stage seems surprising.</TE>
<TE>   The intersection of arts and politics has always been an uneasy
one in China. The stage, especially, has been contested ground.
Madame Mao, a former actress, once commandeered the theater
nationwide and allowed only eight approved Chinese revolutionary
operas, as well as politically suitable works from Vietnam and North
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, producers must submit scripts for official vetting
before a production can be mounted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard for others to understand the mental pressure we've
been under," said Shang, a graduate of the Central Academy of Drama,
China's most prestigious acting school. "We were all worried whether
we'd be standing here today."</TE>
<TE>   Han Jia, the play's producer and Shang's wife, has said that the
censors read only sections of the script and probably signed off on
it because Orwell's book has been in print in China since at least
1988.</TE>
<TE>   In a promotional blurb for the play on the Internet, "Animal Farm"
is plainly described -- in English -- as a satire of Russia under
Stalin. But the Chinese description omits this fact, and Shang too
tries to tiptoe around it, pointing out that Orwell was a socialist.</TE>
<TE>   "He never said in his book that the animals' rebellion was wrong,"
said Shang, who first read "Animal Farm" two years ago and has read
Orwell's other classic, "1984."</TE>
<TE>   Shang's adaptation eliminates certain references that undoubtedly
would have been too overt to pass political muster. For instance, in
the original text -- including the Chinese translation -- the animals
call one another "comrade," a politically loaded term still in
widespread use in China.</TE>
<TE>   But in the play, the newly liberated animals explicitly reject
"comrade" as too human and instead choose a less-charged designation
meaning "beast."</TE>
<TE>   Although the script got past the first round of censors, it
remains to be seen whether the Culture Ministry will allow "Animal
Farm" to complete its scheduled run through Dec. 19, especially now
that the play has received international media attention.</TE>
<TE>   A likely factor in the survival of the production -- which Shang
financed himself -- will be audience reaction.</TE>
<TE>   The play's saving grace, from an official perspective at least,
may be that while many theatergoers discern the parallels between the
story and Chinese history, there are plenty who do not. These tend to
be people in their 20s, who only know a China that has become more
economically and socially liberal during the last two decades.
Because an experimental play such as "Animal Farm" is apt to attract
a younger audience, its political impact may be muffled.</TE>
<TE>   After one recent performance, a student asked Shang whether the
work didn't imply that dictatorship was a good thing because the
harvests under the pigs' rule were so abundant. The student hadn't
caught the irony in the hyped-up statistics that the pigs went around
spouting.</TE>
<TE>   But another member of the audience, Candy Zhang, saw through it.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang, 31, even wondered aloud whether "the Cultural Revolution
could have been avoided" if Orwell's book had been available in China
soon after it was first published.</TE>
<TE>   She agreed that some of the parallels between the play and Chinese
history were oblique. But she finds no fault with director Shang or
his cast.</TE>
<TE>   "They were already pretty brave to have put on the play in the
first place," she said.</TE>

<HD>'Vinegar Joe' Still Like a Fine Wine to China</HD>
<DH>U.S. Gen. Joseph Stilwell helped end Japanese occupation.
Museum in his honor is renovated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Chu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHONGQING, China</DL>
<LD>Long before Beijing upset Washington by rattling sabers at Taiwan,
before American warplanes bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia,
before a U.S. spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet collided in midair,
there was a time when relations between the two countries' militaries
were warm -- even close.</LD>
<LD>   That was more than half a century ago, when China was not yet a
communist power and the U.S. wasn't a super one, and both were locked
in mortal combat against a common enemy: Japan.</LD>
<LD>   American and Chinese soldiers strategized and trained together in
Chongqing, the wartime capital then known as Chungking. For two
years, a four-star Army general named Joseph W. Stilwell lived here
and did more than almost any other American to lead the campaign that
brought Japan's occupation of China and the war in the Pacific to an
end.</LD>
<TE>   The Chinese have remained grateful to Stilwell ever since. Today,
the courageous, acerbic commander nicknamed "Vinegar Joe" is the only
American military figure -- possibly the only American -- to have a
museum in China dedicated to him, a reminder that Sino-U.S. ties
weren't always so contentious and mistrustful.</TE>
<TE>   "The resistance against Japan was possibly the best moment ever in
U.S.-China relations," said Xie Xianhui, the museum's director.</TE>
<TE>   Since it opened to the public in 1991, thousands of visitors, most
of them Americans, have made the pilgrimage up the narrow lane to the
cliff-side home that Stilwell occupied, a scenic spot overlooking the
rippling, milk-chocolate canvas of the Jialing River.</TE>
<TE>   This was Stilwell's base as commander of American forces in the
China-Burma-India theater of World War II from 1942 to 1944. Here he
plotted strategy, practiced his fluent Mandarin and paced the floors
as he tried to figure out how best to deal with Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek, the head of China's Nationalist government.</TE>
<TE>   Stilwell was technically Chiang's chief of staff but found the
leader egotistical, capricious and unreliable, and he contemptuously
referred to him as "Peanut" in his dispatches. (Other critics accused
Chiang of "too much issimo-ing and not enough generaling.")</TE>
<TE>   The two men clashed over the deployment of China's soldiers.
Stilwell thought Chiang was more concerned with fighting his other
enemies, the Chinese Communists, than with battling the Japanese
Imperial Army.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Communists and Nationalists had declared a temporary
truce in order to join forces against the Japanese, Chiang wanted to
save his crack troops for a future showdown against the Communists.</TE>
<TE>   Stilwell was exasperated.</TE>
<TE>   "He was there to fight a war and Chiang Kai-shek wasn't fighting
it," said Houghton Freeman, an assistant U.S. naval attache at the
time who lived a few doors up from Stilwell in Chongqing.</TE>
<TE>   Shared antipathy toward Chiang may account for some of the present
Communist government's appreciation for Stilwell. China also
remembers Stilwell fondly as a supporter of the U.S. government's
secret wartime mission to establish contact with the Communists in
1944.</TE>
<TE>   But there are those who feel affection for the general himself,
not merely his political views or military achievements.</TE>
<TE>   Wang Chuying was a decorated young Chinese captain who was
Stilwell's assistant in Burma. Initially, Wang was put off by the
gruff American, who barked orders and insulted him by suggesting that
the young officer had gotten where he was because of family
connections rather than bravery in battle.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't reply and just stared at him because I was so angry,"
Wang recalled. "A Chinese official immediately informed Stilwell that
I was a courageous fighter who was not afraid of death.... Stilwell
changed his attitude and offered me his hand."</TE>
<TE>   Thereafter, Wang was constantly at Stilwell's side. He admired the
American for his demanding attitude, discipline and lack of
pretension. Stilwell responded by soliciting Wang's opinions even
though Wang was much younger and of lower rank.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very high-ranking officer and I was just a small fry,
but he never put on any airs," said Wang, 79, whose memory of the war
is still clear. "Stilwell encouraged me to speak my mind. It's very
rare for Chinese generals to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very sad when he had to go. He called me back from the
battlefront ... before he left and said goodbye to me in person.
There were so many VIPs and generals, but he still remembered me. I
never met a general like him, and I miss him to this day."</TE>
<TE>   Stilwell was forced to leave China because of his increasingly
fractious relationship with Chiang, who pressured President Franklin
D. Roosevelt to recall the general in late 1944.</TE>
<TE>   The blunt-talking Stilwell also had clashed with a U.S. general:
Claire L. Chennault, commander of the Flying Tigers of the Army's
14th Air Force. Chennault argued that the air campaign over Asia was
more important than the ground effort.</TE>
<TE>   Bitter at being undercut, Stilwell summoned two American reporters
to his home in Chongqing before he left to show them classified
documents and air his side of the feud with Chiang.</TE>
<TE>   Stilwell died at age 63 in San Francisco in 1946. Two years ago,
the U.S. Postal Service issued a 10-cent stamp in his honor.</TE>
<TE>   For years after it opened as a museum, Stilwell's home in
Chongqing was a rundown structure filled with memorabilia provided by
the U.S. government and the general's heirs, including photographs,
his uniform and a sword presented to him by his troops after a
victory in Burma.</TE>
<TE>   After a visit in 1999, Freeman, the former naval attache, was
determined to see the place refurbished. "The city of Chungking had
kept it open," said Freeman, who is still accustomed to using the
city's wartime name. "They were selling 14th Air Force T-shirts to
make a little money. It was in disrepair."</TE>
<TE>   Freeman's private foundation based in Vermont has donated $1
million to the renovation now underway. The local government chipped
in another million. A machinist's shop and about 60 residents on the
grounds were kicked out to make way for a new exhibition hall and

<HD>Turkey Lifts Provincial Restrictions</HD>
<DH>Emergency rule to quell Kurdish separatists ends in two
areas. Critics had cited police abuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>Turkey lifted a 15-year state of emergency in the southeast Saturday,
ending an era that saw security forces wield sweeping powers against
Kurdish separatists in a conflict in which 30,000 died.</LD>
<LD>   "A new, normal period is starting for the region," Interior
Minister Abdulkadir Aksu told reporters in Diyarbakir.</LD>
<LD>   Parliament decided in June to schedule the end of emergency rule
in the provinces of Sirnak and Diyarbakir after lifting it in two
other provinces this year.</LD>
<TE>   Turkey had imposed emergency rule, giving authorities
extraordinary powers to detain suspects and carry out investigations,
in 1987, three years after the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK,
launched a violent campaign for independence.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups argued that the special powers handed to
police led to serious abuses.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of people fled to the major cities to escape the
violence, deserting hundreds of villages.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting subsided after 1999 when Turkey arrested PKK leader
Abdullah Ocalan, who ordered the rebels to withdraw from Turkey to
northern Iraq and campaign for greater cultural rights by political
rather than military means.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Diyarbakir welcomed the end of emergency rule, saying
they hoped it would bring peace and help the economy. About 1,000
gathered in the city center Saturday to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's new Justice and Development Party government, which won a
landslide victory in Nov. 3 elections, has vowed "zero tolerance" on
torture and pledged a range of human rights reforms to meet European
Union standards for membership.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Contests Israeli Version of Aid Worker's Fatal
Shooting</HD>
<DH>Compound in West Bank is nearly empty as investigators look
into death of Iain Hook.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alissa J. Rubin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JENIN, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Once busy providing Palestinian refugees with aid, the United Nations
compound here is empty now except for a few U.N. investigators
piecing together the events that led to the death of their colleague,
Iain Hook.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli military has admitted that one or more of its soldiers
shot Hook, 54, in the compound Nov. 22, but the circumstances
surrounding his death remain bitterly contested.</LD>
<LD>   The military says that armed Palestinians were using the compound
as a sniper nest and that soldiers fired into what they believed was
enemy territory.</LD>
<TE>   U.N. officials adamantly deny that. "At no time did armed gunmen
enter the compound," said Paul McCann, a spokesman for the U.N.
Relief and Works Agency, where Hook worked.</TE>
<TE>   The angry back-and-forth is rooted in the Israeli government's
decades-long resentment of what it perceives as the U.N. agency's
support for the Palestinian political cause. The agency, for its
part, sees the Israelis as careless when it comes to Palestinian
civilians and those who work with the U.N. staff. The agency was
created in 1948 specifically to help Palestinians who fled or were
forced from their homes when Israel declared itself a state.</TE>
<TE>   But Hook's shooting in particular has heightened the tensions. His
death -- the first of a foreign U.N. employee in the region since the
Palestinian intifada began 26 months ago -- has refocused attention
on civilian casualties in the occupied territories, which have become
so frequent that the individual circumstances are often left
unexamined.</TE>
<TE>   On the day Hook died, Israeli soldiers shot and killed a
12-year-old Palestinian, Mohammed Musleh Balalwa, who was throwing
stones at them in the Jenin refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   Five days later, soldiers shot and killed Jihad Natour, 22, as he
walked through the West Bank city of Hebron banging the traditional
Ramadan festival drum at 3 a.m. to wake Muslims for their pre-sunrise
meal before the required sunup to sundown fast.</TE>
<TE>   And Saturday, a 16-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed on his
way home from school in the Gaza Strip. Witnesses said Israeli
soldiers fired on some teenagers as they neared an army outpost; the
Israelis say they fired only warning shots.</TE>
<TE>   The search for explanations in Hook's death confirms the
difficulty of sorting out the truth.</TE>
<TE>   A few facts are undisputed: Hook, an Englishman from a quiet
seaside town, had arrived in Jenin six weeks earlier. A veteran of
U.N. postings in Afghanistan, East Timor and Kosovo, he was
accustomed to charged situations.</TE>
<TE>   His assignment was to oversee a $27-million project to rebuild
about 400 homes that were destroyed by Israeli forces when the Jenin
camp was under siege in the spring. Hook tried to work with everyone.
Staff at the Red Crescent Society, the Muslim version of the Red
Cross, and at the Jenin hospital knew him, as did Israeli military
liaison officers.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of Nov. 22, Israeli soldiers entered the Jenin camp
in search of Abdullah Wahsh, a leader of the Islamic Jihad militant
group wanted in connection with an attack on a bus that killed 14
people in October.</TE>
<TE>   Wahsh's suspected hide-out was a house less than 150 feet from the
U.N. compound. A 7-foot concrete wall, topped with 3 feet of chicken
wire, surrounds the U.N. offices -- a makeshift affair of three
trailers set in a U-shape. A corrugated metal roof covers much of the
compound's area to shield it from the pounding summer sun.</TE>
<TE>   The compound is in a typical Jenin neighborhood. Opposite one end
of the compound stand the ruins of a house bulldozed by Israeli
troops to ensure that its occupants, suspected Palestinian militants
or their families, do not return. Next door are several buildings
pocked by bullet holes. Behind the compound, a warren of narrow
alleys leads deep into the camp.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors have scrawled standard camp graffiti on the compound's
walls: "Our honorable martyrs, we will avenge you," says one message.</TE>
<TE>   Residents say the Israeli soldiers stormed into the neighborhood
about 8 a.m. and took up positions surrounding Wahsh's suspected
hide-out.</TE>
<TE>   Several entered the home of Tafiq Farhad, just up the street and
on the opposite side from the U.N. compound. A round-faced man of 36,
Farhad showed a visitor one of the rooms where the soldiers took up
positions.</TE>
<TE>   The neat living room on the third floor has three windows
overlooking the U.N. compound. The floor is littered with bullet
casings, looking like spent cigarette butts; one of Farhad's little
daughters plays with them absent-mindedly. Farhad said that the
casings were left by the soldiers and that U.N. officials told him
not to move them.</TE>
<TE>   Because much of the U.N. compound is covered, it would not have
been possible to fire into most of the property from Farhad's house.</TE>
<TE>   By 9 a.m., Hook, worried about his staff, called Capt. Peter
Lerner, the Israeli military's liaison with international groups. "He
wanted me to confirm there was a military operation," Lerner said. "I
said, 'Stay inside the building, away from the windows and close to
the walls.' "</TE>
<TE>   What happened next is less clear.</TE>
<TE>   Some witnesses say there were repeated bursts of gunfire from
soldiers and Palestinian gunmen facing off in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Palestinian civilians in the U.N. compound, some of
them women and children, were unable to leave by the front gate
because of the shooting and called to neighbors to help them, said
Caoimhe Butterly, an Irishwoman who has been working in the camp
since April.</TE>
<TE>   As she came around the back of the compound, Butterly said, she
saw Palestinian youths hacking with pickaxes on the wall to chip a
hole large enough for people to climb through. "There had been armed
resistance in that area earlier that morning, but at that time, the
small number who were fighting had left," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At 12:53 p.m., Hook made another call to Lerner, which was
recorded on Lerner's voicemail, a tape made available to reporters
last week. "Just making a progress report. We're pinned down in the
compound, and the shabab have knocked a hole in the wall. I'm not
happy about it. I'm trying to keep them out."</TE>
<TE>   The term shabab can be used to describe youths or gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, there was a lull in the fighting, according to U.N.
officials. "There was no fighting for tens of minutes, maybe a half
hour, before Iain was shot," said McCann, the U.N. spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "Iain realized that armed elements were trying to gain entrance to
the compound. He approached them and told them they were jeopardizing
the safety of all his staff and the neutrality of the compound, and
they accepted it and left."</TE>
<TE>   Absolutely wrong, say the Israelis, who contend that there was
shooting from the U.N. property.</TE>
<TE>   "Iain told us they were trying to get in, and on at least two
occasions, there was direct fire at [Israeli] troops from the
compound," said Lerner.</TE>
<TE>   He implied that Hook had been forced to give armed men entry.
"This isn't the first instance when U.N. officials were held at
gunpoint by armed Palestinians," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the situation, shortly after 1 p.m., Hook walked out of
one of the trailers, holding an object -- now believed by Israeli and
U.N. sources to be a cell phone -- and took a step or two into the
open area of the compound. A moment later, a bullet penetrated his
back.</TE>
<TE>   Hook's staff called the Red Crescent ambulance service. The driver
sped to the compound, only to be stopped by an Israeli tank and jeeps
about 50 feet from the gate.</TE>
<TE>   A U.N. ambulance, called by the agency's Jerusalem staff, ran into
the same problem. After a 20- to 25-minute delay, it went around the
back of the compound, said Othman Talib, a nurse who was in the
ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   Hook's body was removed on a stretcher -- through the hole in the
wall that had worried him just an hour earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond admitting that Hook was shot by Israeli solders, the
military has said little. Col. Daniel Reisner, head of the military's
international law division, said: "We want to determine if this was
just a mistake that can happen in warfare, or a mistake that someone
should pay for, or a mistake with criminal [responsibility].</TE>
<TE>   "No one can really believe we shot him deliberately. We'd need to
be extremely daft to shoot a U.N. worker. It would be
counterproductive for us on every level."</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is demanding that Israel punish
whomever shot Hook. "The issue is accountability," said McCann, the
U.N. spokesman. "It's whether the person who shot Iain is going to be
brought to justice. He was an unarmed U.N. staff member who was shot
in the back. Well, we have a problem with that."</TE>
<TE>   A day after Hook's death, Palestinians gathered to bear a symbolic
coffin through the streets, covered with the U.N. flag and that of
the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "There were even more people than for the funerals of martyrs,"
said Ahmed Jardadat, an emergency room nurse, referring to the highly
political funerals held for suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "We all felt so sad, everyone in the emergency room. We
appreciated the work he was trying to do for the camp."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Deputy Dies in Artesia Shooting</HD>
<DH>Veteran of 18 years is fatally wounded when a round skirts
his bulletproof vest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Erika Hayasaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputy was shot and killed
Saturday morning when a bullet passed through an opening in his
protective vest as he responded to a possible hostage situation at an
Artesia home.</LD>
<LD>   Six hours after Deputy David Powell was shot, authorities fired
tear gas and stormed the home after failing to get any response. They
found the body of a man who had been shot in the upper torso, said
sheriff's spokesman David Cervantes.</LD>
<LD>   Officials had not determined whether the man had been shot by
deputies or if the wound was self-inflicted. They did not say if he
was the person who killed the 42-year-old Powell, an 18-year veteran
of the department.</LD>
<TE>   "We have lost a great veteran, a great hero, a man who did his job
to the best of his ability," an emotional Sheriff Lee Baca told
reporters at St. Francis Medical Center, where Powell died.</TE>
<TE>   Powell and three other deputies responded to a call of shots fired
in the 11000 block of 165th Street in Norwalk, which borders Artesia,
at 10:30 a.m. A sheriff's helicopter and witnesses told deputies that
they saw at least one man running to the home in the 12000 block of
167th Street, where Powell was shot.</TE>
<TE>   At the nearby home, the deputies saw an armed man holding a woman
against her will, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   As Powell kicked in the door, the woman fled to safety and the
deputy was shot once, the bullet entering his right arm and moving
down the seam of his bulletproof vest, where it punctured his chest,
Sheriff's Lt. Carl Deeley said.</TE>
<TE>   A deputy fired at least one shot into the house, officials said.
Then another deputy dragged the mortally wounded officer away. Powell
was rushed to the Lynwood hospital where he died 90 minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   After the area was cordoned off and some nearby residents
evacuated, more than 100 deputies combed the neighborhood looking for
possible accomplices. A negotiation team and SWAT were at the scene,
which is about 25 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles off the 91
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   At least two people have been detained for questioning,
authorities said. Others also may be involved, officials said, but no
arrests have been made.</TE>
<TE>   Powell is the second sheriff's deputy killed while on duty this
year. Deputy David March, 33, was gunned down April 29 by a man he
had stopped for a traffic violation in Irwindale.</TE>
<TE>   The latest shooting comes at a time when the region has been
racked by violence -- especially in Los Angeles. A spate of recent
killings, many in South Los Angeles, where 20 people died in
November, caused L.A. Police Chief William J. Bratton to challenge
residents and law enforcement officers to get angry about the
killings.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, 615 people have been slain in the city of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Baca said Powell enjoyed counseling youths to stay away from crime
and drugs. "After he became a deputy, [Powell] found that his second
love was teaching," Baca said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's message to teens was, "Just don't do it," Baca said.
Colleagues described the deputy as a hard worker who was devoted to
his family and well-liked on the job.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of our more experienced officers at Lakewood
(sheriff's station)," said Sgt. Bill Conley, who worked with Powell.
"He was a generally light-hearted guy, always there to pick people's
spirits up if they were down, and he always had a joke at the end of
his tongue."</TE>
<TE>   Powell lived in Torrance with his wife, Emma, and their 7-year-old
daughter, whom they adopted when she was 9 months old. He is also
survived by three adult stepdaughters, seven grandchildren, his
parents and a twin brother.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the only father we've had," said stepdaughter Amanda Alvira,
27, who cried over the phone as she spoke. "He's always the first in
line to help. He's so easygoing and happy all the time, and always
telling stories about work," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Alvira said Powell loved his job because he was able to help
people and save lives. "He didn't want to be behind the desk," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Alvira said her stepfather was looking forward to celebrating he
and his wife's 12th wedding anniversary in January. The couple
recently bought a motor home to travel across the country together.
They had just recently returned from a vacation to Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved camping and boating with his kids," Alvira said.
"Anything with the family. That's what his life was."</TE>
<TE>   Powell graduated from Junipero Serra High School in Gardena and
took courses at El Camino College and Loyola Marymount University. He
joined the Sheriff's Department in 1984, and worked at the Men's
Central Jail. He also worked at the Pitchess Detention Center,
Firestone Park sheriff's station and, most recently, the Lakewood
sheriff's station, where he served since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Cervantes said the Sheriff's Department is shocked over the
killing.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked through Jake Kuredjian and David March, the most recent
two we lost in the department, and it really hits home," Cervantes
said. "It is just like losing a family member."</TE>
<TE>   Kuredjian was killed Aug. 31, 2001, after a former police officer
with a criminal record shot him during a gun battle in the Santa
Clarita Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Powell is the fifth sheriff's deputy killed while on duty in the
last three years. Four died in shootings and one was killed in a
motorcycle accident, deputies said.</TE>
<TE>   Artesia is a bedroom community of 16,000 people where some
residents can trace their roots back generations.</TE>
<TE>   Census statistics portray a city rich in cultural diversity:
Almost half of Artesia's residents are foreign-born, and nearly
two-thirds speak a language other than English at home.</TE>
<TE>   The city's many ethnic restaurants and shops pay tribute to both
its original Dutch and Portuguese residents and newer arrivals from
China, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, among other places.</TE>
<TE>   A thriving "Little India" along Pioneer Boulevard, just south of
the 91 Freeway, abounds with sari shops, appliance stores and Indian
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandra Hernandez lives near the single-story home where the
shooting occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a quiet street. I can't believe this happened," said
Hernandez, who has lived in the neighborhood for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly Regalado, who also lives nearby, said deputies told her and
her daughter to leave the area around 11 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the sheriff being put in the police car," she said. "He was
clutching his arm. They [deputies] were yelling and screaming and
scrambling around.... They put him in a police car and took off
immediately."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Muslims Divided Over Saudi Aid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the nation's most prominent Islamic organizations has accepted
a $500,000 donation from a Saudi prince, sparking a blunt debate
among American Muslims over whether foreign contributions are
compromising their independence and the integrity of their
organizations.</LD>
<LD>   "To what extent is this part of the larger Saudi effort to co-opt
our organizations?" asked Mairaj Syed, a UCLA graduate student in
Islamic studies who opened an online debate about the donation on San
Francisco-based AMILAnet, a Muslim-oriented discussion group. It has
been one of the main forums for debate over the donation.</LD>
<LD>   "For too long we've depended too often on overseas financing to
keep our institutions alive. This comes at the price of our
intellectual independence and integrity," Syed said.</LD>
<TE>   Omar Ahmed, board chairman of the Council on American-Islamic
Relations, which received the gift, said the donation would be used
to support a $2.5-million project aimed at placing Islamic
educational material in the nation's 16,000 public libraries.</TE>
<TE>   The contribution came with no strings attached, he said. "We run
our own agenda and no one can influence us," said Ahmed, who added
that he had received no complaints about the donation from the
council's roughly 28,000 registered members. Foreign donations make
up about 20% of the council's fund-raising for its national office in
Washington, D.C., and 15 regional chapters, and are accepted only if
no conditions come with the money, Ahmed said.</TE>
<TE>   The gift to the council from Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a
nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and one of the kingdom's richest
men, comes at a time when the Saudi royal family's spending on
Muslims in the United States has been the subject of new questions.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, it was disclosed that Saudi Princess Haifa al Faisal,
the wife of the Saudi ambassador to the United States, apparently
gave thousands of dollars to two Saudi nationals in San Diego, who
then provided funds to two of the Sept. 11 hijackers. FBI
investigators have said that they do not believe the royal family
deliberately aided the terrorists, but the issue has fanned concerns
on Capitol Hill over Saudi financial support of Muslims here.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia is the largest single contributor to Islamic causes
-- ranging from mosques to religious literature to refugee aid --
around the world. Experts say, however, that its support of American
Muslims has significantly dropped in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the prince's gift have begun publicly questioning it,
calling it everything from immoral to a "strategic mistake" that
would fuel criticism of American Muslims as Saudi mouthpieces.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the donation, by contrast, argue that the critics
are unwittingly aiding what many U.S. Muslims see as a campaign by
fundamentalist Christian and conservative Jewish groups to demonize
the Saudis.</TE>
<TE>   Syed and others who question Saudi donations argue that too many
American Muslim mosques and organizations have been dependent on
Saudi money, which inhibits them from criticizing the desert
kingdom's strict interpretation of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Adherents of the form of Islam that predominates in Saudi Arabia,
including the doctrines of the 18th century Muslim teacher Muhammad
ibn Abd al-Wahhab, advocate strict gender roles and shun any
perceived innovations to the faith. They tend to strongly disapprove
of other Muslim practices such as Sufi mysticism or the beliefs of
Shia Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Some Muslim scholars have argued that such leanings are
fundamentally intolerant and, taken to their extreme, are used as a
religious justification for the terrorism of Osama bin Laden and
others.</TE>
<TE>   "The main reason we lack legitimacy among many Americans is
because we don't take a critical look at the theological orientations
within the Muslim community that could produce ugly acts like 9/11 or
the Taliban regime's destruction of Buddhist statues in Afghanistan,"
Syed said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Others argued that acceptance of foreign donations could prevent
American Muslims from criticizing the human-rights records of Muslim
states.</TE>
<TE>   "Saudi Arabia is a corrupt, dictatorial, fascist state that is an
embarrassment to Islam and Muslims," wrote Sarah Eltantawi,
communications director of the Los Angeles-based Muslim Public
Affairs Council. Accepting foreign donations from such regimes "could
set us back decades, or keep us in the 'straddling the fence' posture
vis-a-vis Muslim dictators and oppressors that we seem to be
shamefully stuck in today," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In his own posting in the online debate, Aslam Abdullah, the
editor of Minaret magazine in Los Angeles, called on Muslims to
reject all donations from Persian Gulf monarchies because they
constitute "immoral money" earned off oil revenue and other sources
that rightfully belong to the people of the Gulf countries, not to
their kings.</TE>
<TE>   According to news reports, Alwaleed has invested an estimated $16
billion in such U.S. companies as Citigroup, News Corp., Apple and
AOL Time Warner. He also is a prominent philanthropist who has
donated millions to causes including care for children with cancer,
aid to needy Palestinians and help for disaster victims. Last year,
he offered $10 million to New York City as aid to victims of the
Sept. 11 attacks, but then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani rejected the
check because of Alwaleed's long-standing criticism of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the criticism, some Muslims have praised Alwaleed's
donation for enhancing the Islamic council's work.</TE>
<TE>   The Islamic council focuses on media relations, community building
and advocacy for U.S. Muslims, tracking hate crime allegations, for
instance, and investigating charges of bias against Muslims. The
group's leaders say they do not address human-rights problems among
Islamic regimes abroad because that is not their focus nor a pressing
cause among their constituents.</TE>
<TE>   "The money could not have gone to a more worthy cause" than the
council, said one posting on the Internet discussion group from Jawad
Ali.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of foreign donations -- particularly from Saudi Arabia
-- has long been debated among American Muslims. The kingdom has
helped finance more than 1,700 mosques, Islamic centers and schools
worldwide, according to the Saudi Embassy. In the U.S., the kingdom
reports it has fully or partially financed Islamic centers in Los
Angeles; San Francisco; Fresno; Chicago; New York; Washington;
Tucson; Raleigh, N.C.; and Toledo, Ohio, among other places, as well
as professorships at the University of California, Harvard and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Saudi Arabia's printing presses have distributed more
than 114 million Korans and 80 million religious tracts around the
world, according to the embassy.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, some Saudi funds are dispersed through the Islamic
Foundation of Sheikh Ibn Taymiyah, the nonprofit corporation that
owns the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City. Saudis pay the salary of
some imams in the area and provide Korans even to places such as the
Islamic Center of Southern California, which promotes one of the most
liberal interpretations of Islam in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no mosque in this county that hasn't received some money
from Saudi Arabia," Tajuddin Shuaib, imam of the King Fahd Mosque,
said in an interview earlier this year. "Saudi Arabia is their Bank
of America."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, however, Saudi donations have significantly
declined. Embassy spokesman Nail Al-Jubeir said the kingdom tightened
up on its largess about a decade ago after discovering some abuse --
people using Saudi money to build mosques but putting the title under
their personal names; others asking for Korans for a congregation
only to sell the books.</TE>
<TE>   Other experts say the Saudis cut back because they were saddled by
debts from the Persian Gulf War and felt betrayed by some American
Muslim leaders who had taken their money and then publicly criticized
their support of the U.S.-led attacks on Iraq.</TE>

<CX>   Saudi funds--A Dec. 1 article on a debate among U.S. Muslims over
Saudi donations said that some Saudi funds are disbursed through the
Islamic Foundation of Sheikh Ibn Taymiyah in Culver City. According
to the foundation's chairman, Khalil Khalil, he has disbursed Saudi
funds to local mosques, but did so as an individual, not in his
capacity as head of the foundation. The foundation, itself, does not
disburse Saudi funds to local organizations.</CX>

list, to sell anything or even to set up appointments to discuss
selling something.</LD>

<HD>Bus Driver Arrested After Frivolous 'Taliban' Remark</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MARLBORO, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Passengers on a Greyhound bus said the driver told them he was taking
them "to the Taliban" after they criticized his meandering route
Saturday night, prompting a massive police response.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-bound bus hit heavy traffic soon after leaving
Philadelphia, and the driver took several alternate routes to find
less congested roads, said passenger Sally Weisbrot, 30.</LD>
<LD>   "People were angry and making fun of the driver, yelling, 'Do you
know what you're doing up there? Do you know where you're going?' He
clearly was annoyed," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Weisbrot said the driver then shot back: "I'm taking you to the
Taliban." She said the driver was only joking because he was upset,
but some people panicked and called 911 on their cell phones. Within
minutes, 18 police cars surrounded the bus and pulled it over, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dara Salcman, a passenger from New York, said passengers were
ordered to get off the bus with their hands in the air. Officers had
their guns pointed at the bus, she said. The bus driver was charged
with creating a false public alarm, Marlboro Police Capt. Brian Hall
said. He was expected to be released Saturday night on a summons.</TE>

<HD>16 Rare Cranes Raised in Captivity Migrate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHASSAHOWITZKA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>With help from ultralight aircraft, a flock of rare whooping cranes
completed its 1,200-mile migration from Wisconsin to Florida.</LD>
<LD>   The 16 cranes raised in captivity over the summer reached the
Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge in west-central Florida on
Saturday morning, researchers reported on their Internet site. The
birds had left the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in central
Wisconsin 49 days earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The cranes and four ultralight planes passed over a crowd gathered
at Crystal River Mall for a flyover before reaching their
destination.</LD>
<TE>   The flight follows the first ultralight-led migration, completed a
year ago. Five survivors of the first journey migrated back to
Necedah on their own in the spring and returned to Florida this fall
without assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife biologists are trying to establish a new Midwestern
population of the rare birds.</TE>
<TE>   At 5 feet tall, whooping cranes are North America's tallest birds.
They have rebounded from near-extinction in 1941, when there were
just 20 left, but even now only about 400 of the birds exist.</TE>

<HD>Prisoners May Face 'Legal Black Hole'</HD>
<DH>Lawyers for 16 terrorist suspects at Guantanamo Bay want
hearings on whether they're being lawfully held. U.S. says detainees
have no rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Monday, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., will take up
one of the most vexing legal questions to arise in the aftermath of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks: Is it possible for the U.S.
government to keep 600 suspected terrorists held at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, in custody forever?</LD>
<LD>   Sixteen prisoners from Kuwait, Britain and Australia contend that
they are being held in territory far from any combat zone in
violation of the U.S. Constitution and the Geneva Conventions. They
have asked federal courts to give them hearings to determine whether
they are being lawfully held.</LD>
<LD>   If U.S. courts fail to step in, the detainees will fall into a
"legal black hole," where they could be forever, said Minneapolis
attorney Joseph Margulies, who represents several detainees.</LD>
<TE>   Added his co-counsel, Michael Ratner, president of the Center for
Constitutional Rights: For all the legal rights the detainees
currently have, "these guys might as well be on the moon."</TE>
<TE>   That is as it should be, Justice Department lawyers retort.
Keeping the detainees locked up serves "the vital objectives of
preventing combatants from continuing to aid our enemies and
gathering intelligence to further the overall war effort," the
government lawyers argue.</TE>
<TE>   Turning aside the prisoners' pleas will ensure that "enemy
litigiousness does not jeopardize the war effort or bring aid and
comfort to the enemy," Justice Department lawyers said in a brief
filed with the appeals court.</TE>
<TE>   And officials agree that the detainees' stay in Guantanamo could
be a very long one.</TE>
<TE>   The Geneva Conventions require that, after a war,
captured soldiers should be returned home. But those treaties were not
designed for situations like the current war on terrorism in which
one of the combatants -- Al Qaeda -- is not a nation and is not
likely to sign a formal peace treaty ending hostilities, government
lawyers say.</TE>
<TE>   Does releasing the prisoners "make sense in this kind of a
conflict, where the individuals in question who are being detained
are members of terrorist organizations?" John C. Yoo, a deputy
assistant attorney general, asked in a speech at the College of
William &amp; Mary Law School.</TE>
<TE>   "Does it make sense to ever release them if you think they are
going to continue to be dangerous, even though you can't convict them
of a crime?"</TE>
<TE>   If the men involved were being held in the U.S., it would be much
easier for them to get a federal court to consider their cases. But
Guantanamo Bay naval station, which the U.S. leases from Cuba, is not a
part of the U.S.  Because of that, the captives have no right to have
their cases heard in any U.S. Court, government lawyers argue.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the government has been winning that argument.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, a federal district judge in
Washington, ruled that the detainees don't have the right to a
hearing of any sort.</TE>
<TE>   Their status, she ruled, is governed by a 1950 case involving the
fate of 21 Germans captured in China at the end of World War II and
convicted of espionage by a U.S. military commission.</TE>
<TE>   After their convictions, the 21 prisoners were returned to Germany
and put in a U.S. military prison there. Their lawyers filed a legal
motion known as a writ of habeas corpus asking the U.S. courts to
review what the military commission had decided.</TE>
<TE>   By a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court turned them down. There has never
been a case in which a court used habeas corpus "on behalf of an
alien enemy, who at no relevant time and in no stage of his
captivity, has been within its territorial jurisdiction," Justice
Robert H. Jackson wrote for the court majority. "Nothing in the text
of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything in our
statutes."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Hugo L. Black, writing for the dissenters, said
the decision "denies courts power to afford the least bit of protection
for any alien who is subject to our occupation government abroad,
even if he is neither enemy nor belligerent and even after peace is
officially declared."</TE>
<TE>   That is precisely what the Supreme Court's opinion means,
Kollar-Kotelly said. Because the detainees are being held "abroad" by
the military, U.S. courts have no power to review their cases, she
ruled.</TE>
<TE>   The detainees might have "some form of rights under international
law," but those rights would have to be negotiated between diplomats
from their countries and U.S. officials, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   So far there is no sign that diplomacy will aid the almost 600
detainees, who hail from 40 nations and speak 17 languages.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 16 whose cases are coming before the appeals court, two --
Mamdouh Habib and David Hicks -- are Australian citizens; two more,
Shafiq Rasul and Asif Iqbal, are British; and 12 are Kuwaiti.</TE>
<TE>   Ratner and Margulies were hired by the families of the British and
Australian detainees, but have not been able to meet with the
prisoners they represent. Family members of the 12 Kuwaitis have
hired Thomas B. Wilner, an international lawyer with Shearman &amp;
Sterling, a prominent Wall Street firm. Wilner said he has not been
able to talk to any of the captives.</TE>
<TE>   According to their lawyers, the Kuwaitis were volunteers doing
charitable work in Afghanistan or Pakistan when they were captured by
bounty hunters after last year's terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon and turned over to the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   Hicks, Rasul and Iqbal were captured by the Northern Alliance in
Afghanistan and turned over to U.S. custody in December 2001. Hicks'
father said his son had joined the Taliban. Habib was detained by
Pakistani authorities in October 2001, then taken to Egypt and turned
over to U.S. authorities, who brought him to Afghanistan before he
was sent to Guantanamo Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Their lawyers argue that U.S. courts offer the men their only
chances for a hearing. "If United States courts have no jurisdiction
to review the ... detentions at Guantanamo, then no court has
jurisdiction to review them," Margulies and Ratner said in their
brief to the appeals court.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers have tried to counter the government's case by arguing
that Guantanamo Bay cannot be considered foreign territory.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 1903 treaty with Cuba that allowed the United States to
build its base, Cuba has formal "sovereignty" over Guantanamo Bay,
but the U.S. military has "complete jurisdiction and control over"
everything that happens there, and no foreign country has any power
to intervene, Wilner notes. The treaty also states that the lease can
only be terminated with the agreement of both parties, which means it
can be continued as long as the U.S. desires.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone accused of a crime at Guantanamo Bay, whether a U.S.
citizen or not, is brought to a U.S. federal court in Virginia for
trial, Margulies and Ratner said.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court should "avoid the tyranny of titles and ...
recognize Guantanamo Bay for what it is: a fully American enclave
with the basic attributes of full territorial sovereignty," they told
the judges.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia University international law professor Gerald
Neuman agrees that the traditional notion of "sovereignty" -- a term
normally used to refer to the power a country has over its
territories -- is misplaced when talking about Guantanamo Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "All the practical rights of governance were given away to us in
the treaty," said Neuman, who has written law review articles dealing
with Guantanamo Bay. "We do not need [Cuban President] Fidel Castro's
permission to do anything there. We are answerable only to ourselves
and therefore our Constitution ought to govern what we do there."</TE>
<TE>   But Justice Department lawyers, led by Deputy Solicitor General
Paul D. Clement, say that the 1950 Supreme Court decision on which
Kollar-Kotelly relied turns on formal "sovereignty," not "de facto
control."</TE>
<TE>   After all, they say, in 1950, the U.S. military, which was still
the occupying power in West Germany, completely controlled the
Landsberg prison.</TE>
<TE>   The Guantanamo Bay case has drawn widespread interest in
international law circles and in other nations.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross
have visited the Guantanamo Bay detainees several times to check on
their conditions. The organization issued a statement in February
saying the captives were entitled under the Geneva Conventions to
have a hearing before "a competent tribunal."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration disagrees, saying that as "unlawful enemy
combatants," not soldiers in regular army units, the detainees have
no such rights.</TE>
<TE>   In early November, three senior British judges strongly criticized
the U.S. position. The judges were considering a case filed in London
by the mother of Feroz Abbasi, who has been held at Guantanamo Bay
for 10 months. Zumrati Juma asked the court to order the British
Foreign Office to take action on her son's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Abbasi is subject to indefinite detention in territory over
which the United States has exclusive control, with no opportunity to
challenge the legitimacy of his detention before any court or
tribunal," Lord Phillips wrote for the trio of British judges. There
"appears to be a clear breach of a fundamental human right," the
judge added.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Phillips said, the English jurists had no power to do
anything about the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Smith, who represented the U.S. in Havana during the Carter
administration and is an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins
University, said he thought it was clear that U.S. law does not
extend to Guantanamo Bay and "that is why we take prisoners there."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Smith said, he was troubled by the prospect
that the Defense Department is developing "an American Devil's Island
on Guantanamo."</TE>
<TE>   And Harold H. Koh, a Yale Law School professor who served as
assistant secretary of State for human rights in the Clinton
administration, sharply criticized the current administration's
policy.</TE>
<TE>   "What is tragic about this is that Fidel Castro does not rule this
part of Cuba, but in terms of the rights the detainees are being
accorded, it is hard to tell the difference," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Anne-Marie Slaughter, president of the American International
Law Society, said the Guantanamo Bay detentions are an area in which
"honestly, there is no clear law."</TE>
<TE>   The cases may point up a need to reexamine how the Geneva
Conventions apply to the world after Sept. 11, 2001, said Slaughter,
who also is dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of International
Affairs at Princeton University. She said international and domestic
lawyers need to "extend both domestic law and international law to
cover this case."</TE>

<HD>Einstein Exhibit Adds a Human Side to the Equation</HD>
<DH>Show depicts a lusty cad, whom the FBI found suspicious,
and explores his relativity revolution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Lee Hotz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>This is not the textbook Albert Einstein.</LD>
<LD>   This lusty fellow was a draft-dodging bohemian with sweaty feet, a
skirt-chasing cad and a security risk whose outspoken humanitarian
politics filled a 1,500-page FBI dossier.</LD>
<LD>   An amateur violinist, he set space, time, matter and energy
dancing to his own tune. And with a two-page letter in 1939, he
launched the nuclear arms race, yet he also set a standard for moral
responsibility that scientists today still emulate almost 50 years
after his death.</LD>
<TE>   A sometimes startling portrait emerges from a major retrospective
on this pivotal scientist of the 20th century organized by the
American Museum of Natural History in New York, Hebrew University in
Jerusalem and the Skirball Center in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit, which opened last month in New York and comes to Los
Angeles in 2004, highlights the challenge of restoring humanity to an
iconic figure at the center of perhaps the most far-reaching
intellectual and scientific revolution of modern history.</TE>
<TE>   And on Saturday, the crowd waiting to enter the exhibition at the
American Museum on Central Park was as thick as the holiday throngs
awaiting entry to FAO Schwarz on 5th Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, Einstein's original letters, manuscripts and
memorabilia have been pulled together. The result is sharply at odds
with Einstein's popular image as a gentle, mental giant crowned by a
halo of frizzy hair.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a skirt-chaser; he had mistresses; he cheated on his
wives," exhibit curator Michael Shara said. "He also is the person
who more than any other physicist -- more than any other scientist --
taught us that scientists have enormous social responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Shara, an astrophysicist who studies stellar evolution, is not
content simply to revise Einstein's public image. He is also
determined to teach Einstein's physics to the millions of people
expected to tour the exhibit over the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to come away with the core of his science," Shara
said, "with the essence of special relativity and of general
relativity. The core can be explained in 10 minutes to an attentive
10-year-old."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Shara spent three years organizing the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a clever science lesson encompassing 7,000 square
feet of gallery space, sugar-coated with scandal and seasoned with
controversy. It combines interactive exhibits with intriguing
personal documents from the Einstein archive at Hebrew University.</TE>
<TE>   When Saturday's visitors stepped through the exhibit's double
doors, they found themselves distorted by a black hole -- an effect
created with fish-eye lenses and projectors to demonstrate the
gravitational "lensing" effect predicted by Einstein. "This is my
space-time reality," an elderly man murmured ruefully as he watched
his bald spot expand to encompass a galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   They had entered Einstein's world, where space has hills and
valleys; where time travels at different speeds; where energy and
mass are interchangeable.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure I understand it all at all," Luke Keller, 22, from
Iowa City, Iowa, said after watching light pulses in an exhibit
illustrating Einstein's ideas of relativity. "But it is not as
abstract as you might think."</TE>
<TE>   For Shara and the exhibit designers, however, the real proof is in
the mind of a child.</TE>
<TE>   Joshua Littman, 10, from Greenwich, Conn., spent nine minutes
Saturday studying one interactive exhibit on Einstein's revolutionary
formulation of mass and energy: E=mc2.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very bright young man," said his grandfather, Stanley
Darer, 68, who brought the boy to the exhibit. "With a 10-year-old,
you just want to plant seeds; then you have to see where they grow."</TE>
<TE>   This seed began to sprout almost instantly.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Einstein's equation, Joshua, in Harry Potter glasses
and a rumpled red school jersey, did not hesitate. "A kilogram of
mass could make a light bulb burn for 30 million years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Deutsch, 11, visiting with his family from Princeton, N.J.,
where Einstein lived for many years, also pondered the scientist's
breakthrough. "It is a weird concept, almost too strange," he said.
"But I think I got it."</TE>
<TE>   Suzannah Fraker Graber, an 11-year-old visiting with her parents
from Washington, DC., put her finger on the moral conundrum at the
heart of the equation.</TE>
<TE>   "E=mc2 helped people make the bomb," she said. She frowned. "But
Einstein wanted peace too."</TE>
<TE>   In a telling illustration, two letters that launched the modern
world are displayed together.</TE>
<TE>   The first was written by Einstein in 1939 to alert President
Franklin D. Roosevelt to the potential of nuclear weapons. Next to it
is Roosevelt's terse reply, assuring Einstein that the United States
would devote all resources necessary to investigating the
possibility.</TE>
<TE>   With his few dozen well-chosen words, Einstein set in motion the
Manhattan Project and the development of the first atomic bomb.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit's paper trail begins with Einstein's high school
report card, which dispels the popular myth that he was something of
a dunce in school. Einstein was a straight-A student with perfect
scores in math and science. But he hated formal classes so much that
he dropped science completely for a year after graduation.</TE>
<TE>   Also on display is his Nobel Prize certificate and the letter
offering him the presidency of the state of Israel. His FBI file
takes up most of a wall.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Mackler, a 60-year-old periodontist from Greensboro, N.C.,
lingered over the original 72-page manuscript of Einstein's theory of
special relativity.</TE>
<TE>   "This was revolutionary. It still is revolutionary," he said. "Now
if I could combine this with dentistry, I'd really make a
contribution ... brushing and flossing and relativity."</TE>

<HD>Fish Lends Its Name, Name Gives Offense</HD>
<DH>The 'jewfish' has been renamed, and now a federal panel has
been asked to do the same for a Florida creek that borrowed the
epithet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KEY LARGO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Nothing predisposes Epinephelus itajara to be a troublemaker. A
voracious grouper that can grow to more than 6 feet, the lurking
bottom-feeder is sluggish enough that countless skin-divers have
posed for undersea snapshots with it.</LD>
<LD>   The problem comes from the name that, for centuries, has been
given this animal: "jewfish."</LD>
<LD>   Though a scientific committee has decided the old common
appellation is in bad taste and should be replaced by "goliath
grouper," the former name lives on in geography, from a saltwater
creek here in Florida's southern archipelago to a cape on Santa
Catalina Island.</LD>
<TE>   A Washington, D.C.-area resident wants to change that. In a
petition to a federal panel on geographic names, Arnold G. Konheim
has objected that "the word 'Jew' in any form other than a noun is
derogatory."</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that since the fish itself now has a different name,
so should the inlet that separates Key Largo from Florida's mainland
peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   A two-lane drawbridge on U.S. 1, and a green sign with the name
'Jewfish Creek,' are signs to travelers that they have entered the
120-mile-long island chain, a popular vacation destination.</TE>
<TE>   "I travel frequently to the Keys whenever I visit my family. I see
the sign every time," Konheim, an official with the U.S. Department
of Transportation, said in a telephone interview. "The name is not
only offensive to the people who live there, but to the visitors."</TE>
<TE>   Is his request a sensible application of America's growing
sensitivity to anything that might be considered an ethnic slight, or
one more example of political correctness gone haywire? In the Keys,
few seem to have much doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been this way forever, and it doesn't offend anyone," said
Kim Bays, 41, front desk manager at the Anchorage Resort &amp; Yacht
Club, a time-share resort on Jewfish Creek's southern shore. "Nobody
goes for the name change."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the five-member Monroe County Commission voted
unanimously against altering the name the inlet has been known by
since at least 1907. Commissioner Dixie Spehar said not one of the
county's 80,000 residents turned out to support the new designation.</TE>
<TE>   "We are reluctant to change here, I guess," Spehar said. "Also,
the fact that some people might think the name had some other meaning
for us than the fish made us uncomfortable. That is just offensive."</TE>
<TE>   One of many competing theories about the origin of the fish's
common name is that its big-headed profile resembles anti-Semitic
caricatures of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, according to an
August 1996 article in Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine. Spehar said
she sees no similarity.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like Yasser Arafat, if you want to know what I think,"
the commissioner said.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime, and we know this from experience, that there is any
activity with regard to changing geographic names, it is an emotional
issue," said geographer Roger L. Payne, executive secretary of the
U.S. Board on Geographic Names, which will have to rule on the issue,
at least as far as references on federal maps and navigation charts
are concerned. "Second, there is never 100% agreement, which is why
the federal government considers local acceptance of paramount
importance."</TE>
<TE>   The 15-member federal name-change board is to take up the matter
of Jewfish Creek at its February meeting, and it will have to weigh
the amount of offense caused by the name against the degree of
attachment local residents have to it, Payne said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the online gazetteer of the U.S. Geological Survey,
the names of nine geographical features in the United States now
include the word "jewfish," including a creek, key, basin, bay,
channel and populated place in Florida, and a point on Santa
Catalina's southeastern tip. In fact, note California historians, the
first newspaper published in Catalina's town of Avalon, beginning in
1889, was called "The Jew Fish."</TE>
<TE>   Gwen Bronson, spokeswoman for the Catalina Island Chamber of
Commerce and Visitors Bureau, said she was unaware of any demand to
change the cape's name.</TE>
<TE>   After scientists of the American Fisheries Society began trying to
standardize names in the 1930s, the California fish was renamed the
giant sea bass to avoid confusion with the species found in the
Caribbean and nearby waters.</TE>
<TE>   Epinephelus itajara, the largest grouper found in North America,
got its new name last year, when a joint committee of the American
Fisheries Society and the American Society of Ichthyologists and
Herpetologists agreed it should henceforth be called goliath grouper.</TE>
<TE>   "Though many Jewish officials told us it's part of our history and
didn't want the name change, we still had to respect those who were
offended," said professor emeritus Joe S. Nelson of the University of
Alberta in Canada, who chaired the joint committee.</TE>
<TE>   According to Nelson, it was not the first adaptation of
ichthyology, the scientific study of fishes, to new standards of what
sort of names are deemed permissible for animals. In 1998, the
committee on fish names changed "squawfish" to "pike minnow" to take
into account requests from Native Americans on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, if Konheim is successful, it will not be the first time
the maps of the United States have to be rewritten because of
shifting standards of taste and ethnic or racial considerations. In
1963, the federal names board ordered all geographical features in
the country changed that included a derogatory epithet for African
Americans. Eight years later, the board did the same for place names
with a pejorative abbreviation for Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   But tampering with references that have been in use for
generations can be risky. The federal panel ran into a buzz saw of
criticism following the assassination of President Kennedy when, on
prompting from the White House, it changed Cape Canaveral, the tongue
of land on Florida's Atlantic Coast that is home to America's
spaceport, to Cape Kennedy. There was enough public opposition to
force the board to backtrack a year and a half later, though the
space center itself kept the president's name.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the Keys pride themselves on a laid-back,
broad-minded lifestyle, and even Jewish leaders here said they are
not bothered by the old name of a fish appearing on road signs and
maps.</TE>
<TE>   "Were it called 'Hate the Jewfish Creek,' " then I would object,"
said Rabbi Yaacov Zucker of the Chabad Community Center in Key West.
"The Keys is a very tolerant community."</TE>

<HD>Hunger Hits Hard in Pacific Northwest</HD>
<DH>Demand for assistance is among the nation's highest,
overwhelming food banks. Residents accustomed to self-reliance accept
charity reluctantly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>THE DALLES, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Chris and Lisha Brumfield made their last mortgage payment but don't
know where they'll get the money for the next one.</LD>
<LD>   They have already turned her car over to the finance company and
are struggling to keep his truck. Chris lost his job 20 months ago,
and the family lives on whatever Lisha can earn caring for other
people's kids.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, faced with nearly empty cupboards and three hungry
children of their own, the Brumfields did what they once considered
unthinkable: They turned to the local Salvation Army for free rice,
instant mashed potatoes and other staples, an admission that cut to
the soul in a place where self-reliance is a near-religion.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't see the end to this," said Chris Brumfield, 30, who was
laid off from the Golden Northwest Aluminum plant here on the south
bank of the Columbia River. "We're trying to stay in the house....
The fear is coming that we can't."</TE>
<TE>   Here in the Pacific Northwest, a higher proportion of the
population reported suffering from hunger over a three-year span than
in any other region of the country, according to a recent analysis of
federal statistics by the Center on Hunger and Poverty at Brandeis
University.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 6% of Oregon residents, or more than 200,000 people,
reported during 1999-2001 that they did not have enough to eat for
reasons beyond their control. Nationwide, the rate was 3.1%; seven of
the eight states reporting the highest levels were in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, nearly 14% of Oregon residents -- fourth-highest in the
nation behind New Mexico, Florida and Utah -- did not have reliable
access to food, part of a national trend that researchers trace to
job loss, increased living costs and a failure of government programs
-- such as food stamps -- to reach those who need help.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's 7% jobless rate is the nation's highest. It has given
rise to a flood of newly poor families that threatens to overwhelm
food banks across the Pacific Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   "It is becoming more and more serious," said Sue Hofer,
spokeswoman for Second Harvest, a Chicago-based nonprofit that
oversees a national network of food banks.</TE>
<TE>   More than one in five of Oregon's 3.4 million residents used food
banks during the year, a 10% rise over the previous year. Soup
kitchens and emergency shelters reported a 17% increase in meals
served. The problem was almost as bad in neighboring Washington after
a nearly 14% hike in the number of people who needed food-bank help.</TE>
<TE>   The problem seems to have landed heavily in the central stretch of
the Columbia Gorge, a sparsely populated region of ranches, orchards,
and beleaguered aluminum and lumber plants that barely saw a ripple
from the booming 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past two years, high electric rates and low market prices
led aluminum companies to shut factories, further depressing a region
already absorbing the collapse of a lumber industry battered by
low-priced imports and environmental-driven restrictions on logging.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, hundreds of well-paid but low-trained workers have
lost jobs on both sides of the Columbia River. In Oregon's Wasco
County, unemployment runs about 8%, while in Klickitat County on the
Washington side, unemployment stands at 14%.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest effect has been on The Dalles, a low spot in the
Columbia Gorge defined by sharp bluffs and rolling, treeless
countryside. At the local Salvation Army, the number of households
receiving food boxes -- enough for three or four meals -- zoomed from
470 to 2,970 for the year that ended Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tight, but we managed," said Capt. John Tumey, who moved
to The Dalles four years ago from Merced, Calif. "We had a lot of
support from people in the community."</TE>
<TE>   The demand has peaked, he hopes, and will trail off through the
winter as more laid-off workers complete retraining programs and find
fresh work, or leave town. Last year, the Salvation Army bought one
bus ticket to help someone leave town; this year it has bought 22.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the increase in demand, local food banks are only serving
a fraction of those who need help because most refuse to ask for it.</TE>
<TE>   One man, Tumey said, showed up saying he had enough food, supplied
by friends, but needed a blanket. When Tumey gave him one and refused
to accept money for it, the man returned a few hours later with cans
of food to add to the pantry -- willing to trade but not to receive
charity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pride," Tumey said. "Some men just don't want to ask for
help."</TE>
<TE>   A key factor in the financial squeeze is housing costs, which have
remained steady.</TE>
<TE>   "For some families, 60% to 70% of their income goes to housing,"
said Barbara McNab, housing coordinator for the Mid-Columbia
Community Action Council in The Dalles, which distributes goods to
food banks and runs housing and utilities programs that have seen
similar increases in requests for help. "When the economy was good
here, 30% was a good average."</TE>
<TE>   The loss of middle-class jobs has made the local job market
impossibly tight. One window-making company had more than 200
applicants for three jobs earlier this year. Les Segui, 32, landed
one, which pays $8.50 an hour. That's not enough to live on, though,
and Segui qualifies for rent assistance and food for himself and his
6-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Segui has considered leaving town, but the pull of family keeps
him rooted. He shares custody of his son with the boy's mother. And
his father, a retired logger, and two brothers live in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "Just trying to live around here, you can't save up money to move
somewhere else," Segui said. "I'm kind of stuck in the situation, I
guess."</TE>
<TE>   The Brumfields feel similarly bound. Lisha Brumfield has two sons,
ages 7 and 5, from a previous marriage, and she and Chris had a
daughter two years ago. They bought a $105,000, four-bedroom house at
the western edge of town, within driving distance of most of their
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "That good plant money was burning a hole in my pocket," Chris
Brumfield said. His wife added: "We could buy pretty much anything we
wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Then came the layoffs. While many of Chris Brumfield's co-workers
signed up for job-retraining programs, Brumfield passed, gambling
that the aluminum plant would restart, as he applied unsuccessfully
for some of the few jobs that have come open in town. So far, nothing
has materialized, and the couple have drained their savings and his
401(k) account.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lisha Brumfield receives child support, the couple's only
regular income is $850 a month from a day-care center she runs from
their home. That's about equal to their monthly mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   The financial strains have sent difficult emotions coursing
through the family. Chris Brumfield recently went to see a doctor for
debilitating stomach pains. The diagnosis: stress.</TE>
<TE>   It is fed, Lisha Brumfield believes, by the unaccustomed
discomforts that come with sudden poverty: "We've never asked for
help before."</TE>

<HD>War's Toll Came Home to Coulterville</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER H. KING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>COULTERVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>On a winter day in 1991, a man in a U.S. Marine Corps uniform stopped
at Coulterville's general store. Without explaining his exact
business, the stranger asked for directions to Ferry Road. As the
Marine pulled away, the store clerk would say later, she just knew.</LD>
<LD>   Ferry Road was where the Jenkins family lived.</LD>
<LD>   Thom Jenkins would not be coming home from the war.</LD>
<TE>   Lance Cpl. Thomas A. Jenkins was one of the first American ground
soldiers killed in the Persian Gulf War. Time Magazine filled its
Feb. 18 cover that year with his photograph: a handsome, young Marine
in dress blues, rawboned face softened by boyish freckles, staring
off the page with a look of proud intensity.</TE>
<TE>   In the magazine piece, which carried the headline "War's Real
Cost," and in other newspaper accounts, family and friends added
flesh to the photograph. They described a fun-loving youngster who
splashed through mud puddles in his old pickup truck, who spent
weekends roughing it in the foothills and mountains of the Mother
Lode country. "Indiana Jenkins," his schoolmates called him.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't ask for a better kid," a friend said. "He was a
nice-looking kid, played a lot of basketball. And he gave the
ultimate sacrifice. Tommy died doing his job."</TE>
<TE>   He was 21. A year or two later, with the quick war long over, it
had become clear that Saddam Hussein and his regime were going to
remain in power, despite their defeat. It also had been disclosed
that Thom Jenkins had been one of many U.S. soldiers killed not by
Iraqis, but by "friendly fire."</TE>
<TE>   Around this time I drove up to Coulterville to see what Jenkins'
people made of these developments. While there was some muttering
around town about the "waste" of a young life, Thom Jenkins' father
was stoic and steadfast.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are here to ask me if I am bitter, I am not," Tom Jenkins,
a Caltrans supervisor, told me straight away. "I am heartbroken. I
lost my son. But I am not bitter. I refuse to remember my son that
way."</TE>
<TE>   The war, the father said then, had been a "necessary evil," and
Tommy's death a "terrible accident," but his son had died performing
his duty: "He saw himself as the champion of the American people."</TE>
<TE>   That was 10 years ago. Now, of course, more legions of young
Americans are preparing to fight in Iraq -- an appropriate time, it
seemed, to revisit Coulterville and the memory of Thom Jenkins.</TE>
<TE>   A tiny town, Coulterville sprang to life in the Gold Rush and sits
on the original stagecoach road into Yosemite. It has changed some,
but not much in a decade. The historic Jeffery Hotel has closed,
apparently for want of tourist traffic. Competing routes into the
park have proven to be more popular, though not as picturesque.</TE>
<TE>   The population on the city-limits sign is still listed at 115. But
there are new signs at either end of town. They depict a red, white
and blue outline of the United States and declare: "WE SUPPORT
HOMELAND SECURITY. All suspicious persons and activities are
immediately reported to our Law Enforcement Agency."</TE>
<TE>   In the county park, the names of 15 residents who served in the
Persian Gulf War have been posted on wooden slats. The first name,
and the only one with a cross branded beside it, belongs to Thom
Jenkins.</TE>
<TE>   They also have renamed the VFW hall after Jenkins. Early last
Sunday afternoon, bartender Mildred Alford was holding down the post
alone, watching the Green Bay-Tampa Bay game and taking the
occasional discreet drag on a cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   I asked this friendly woman what most of the clientele, when there
was a clientele, thought about the prospects of fighting again in
Iraq. Did they believe it was the right thing?</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them do," said Alford, 71, speaking through an artificial
voice box, "and some of them don't. And some just don't want to get
into it at all. They don't want to talk about it. They are the ones
who have been there and done all that stuff, and they know how hard
it is." As for herself, she was not ambivalent. "I think they should
go get him, I do," she said of Hussein. "If we don't, he's going to
cause a lot more problems down the line.</TE>
<TE>   "But," she added, "I know it's probably going to take a lot of
lives...."</TE>
<TE>   I had telephoned Tom Jenkins, the father, to see if he would be
willing to talk. Polite but firm and as stoic as ever, he declined.
He didn't want to join the war debate, one way or another.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not political people," he said. "We wouldn't have anything
to add. I'd rather not talk about it at all."</TE>
<TE>   He paused, then added: "We do have a grandchild coming. We're very
excited about it. You can write that if you want to."</TE>
<TE>   There was one last stop. Thom Jenkins is buried in higher country,
in a little cemetery about eight miles from town. Pines and oaks
throw shade over the tombstones, many of which mark the remains of
Coulterville pioneers.</TE>
<TE>   It is a quiet place. Other than the occasional snort from an
unseen horse, or the whining tires of a distant car, the only sound
is that of dried leaves scraping against branches as they fall toward
ground in a breeze.</TE>
<TE>   The Jenkins family has been in Coulterville for many generations,
and Thom Jenkins was buried on a slope alongside several of his kin.
The closest grave to his is that of his mother, who died in an auto
wreck five years after her son was killed. This is what's chiseled on
his tombstone:</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Allen Jenkins</TE>
<TE>   L CPL U.S. Marine Corp</TE>
<TE>   Aug. 11, 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 29, 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Semper Fidelis.</TE>
<TE>   Protect and Serve.</TE>
<TE>   Along with a layer of leaves, the stone marker on this day was
covered with several bouquets of paper roses, a plastic flag, two VWF
emblems, a war medal, a little toy heart with wire arms and legs, a
San Diego Chargers cap, once blue but now weathered brown and flecked
with a light-green moss, and a handwritten note.</TE>
<TE>   The note had been printed on a slip of adhesive memo paper, now
bleached white:</TE>
<TE>   After</TE>
<TE>   All of these years you</TE>
<TE>   Are still on my mind</TE>
<TE>   Happy Birthday</TE>
<TE>   Dad</TE>
<TE>   And it seemed, this simple message, to say all there was to be
said about war's real cost.</TE>

<HD>Merger Makes for a Greater Louisville</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>For decades, the hometown of the Kentucky Derby lagged behind urban
pacesetters in population and prestige.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as it prepares to merge with Jefferson County, Louisville is
hoping to shed its image as a middle-of-the-pack city by becoming the
nation's 16th largest.</LD>
<LD>   "We no longer want to be America's best-kept secret," said Steve
Higdon, head of Greater Louisville Inc., the metro chamber of
commerce.</LD>
<TE>   In a merger approved by voters two years ago, the city and county
governments will dissolve Jan. 6 and be replaced by a unified metro
government.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight, the population will jump from 256,000 -- 66th largest
in the nation -- to nearly 700,000. Greater Louisville will vault
past Baltimore; Memphis, Tenn.; Boston; Seattle and Denver, among
others.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the first city-county consolidation in a major
metropolitan area in years, and other cities will be watching
closely.</TE>
<TE>   "We really are a laboratory of innovation," said Jerry Abramson,
the former Louisville mayor who won nearly three-fourths of the vote
last month to be elected Greater Louisville's first mayor.</TE>
<TE>   At Jay's Restaurant, opinions about the merger varied.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," said owner Frank Foster. "We're not two parts
anymore. We're going to be one whole city."</TE>
<TE>   Isaac Shoulders, pastor of Greater Nazarene Baptist Church, said
the merger would make government more efficient: "Anytime you can
eliminate duplication of anything you are better off. I think this
will have more impact on our city and our quality of life than
anything in the last 35 years."</TE>
<TE>   But Renee Campbell-Mapp frets about the merger's effect on the
social services agency she runs. Demand for job training and
child-care services will stay strong, but she doesn't know if funding
will stay constant. "I'm worried that I don't know what it's going to
mean," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some blacks worry the merger will weaken their voice in city
government, since one in three Louisville residents is black, while
in the county the figure is fewer than one in five.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson County Commissioner Darryl Owens, a leading opponent of
the merger, said that fear was realized when only six blacks were
elected to the 26-seat Metro Council. "I think it was the only group
in the community that was asked to make a sacrifice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Louisville seemed stuck in the shadows of neighbors
such as Indianapolis and Nashville, two cities that accomplished
mergers years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But signs of renewal have taken root in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   A waterfront park draws people to the banks of the Ohio River. The
airport was expanded. A trendy skate park draws youngsters in droves.
A museum honoring native son Muhammad Ali is planned near the
waterfront.</TE>
<TE>   The city is home to corporate heavyweights. Two Ford plants roll
out SUVs. A United Parcel Service air hub is a beehive of activity.
And General Electric chose Louisville for its lighting and appliances
businesses.</TE>

<HD>Memorial Service Held for Missionary Gunned Down at Clinic
in Lebanon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LYNDEN, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Gary Witherall says he's already forgiven the man who killed his wife
at a Christian clinic in Saida, Lebanon, last month.</LD>
<LD>   It's part of his faith, he told nearly 300 people Saturday at a
memorial service for Bonnie Witherall.</LD>
<LD>   "If Jesus exists, he exists more in me today," Witherall said.</LD>
<TE>   Bonnie Witherall, 31, was shot three times in the head Nov. 21 as
she opened the door of the Unity Center clinic. She had been working
as a nurse's assistant in the prenatal clinic and had started
visiting a Palestinian refugee camp in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Her killer has not been caught, and the motive for the killing is
not clear.</TE>
<TE>   Ministers called her a martyr Saturday, and said she died because
of her beliefs, the Bellingham Herald reported.</TE>
<TE>   "My prayer is that Bonnie's death and the image of Christ's death
will lead many back to the cross and to heaven," said Joseph Stowell,
president of Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, where Witherall
studied.</TE>
<TE>   Witherall grew up in Vancouver, Wash. She graduated from Fort
Vancouver High School in 1990 and went on to attend Bodenseehof Bible
School in Germany and the Moody Institute, where in 1996 she received
a bachelor's degree in international missions.</TE>
<TE>   She married Gary Witherall in 1997 and moved to Portland, Ore.,
where they worked at a bank before moving to Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   She was not political, said Grant Porter, a leader with the
missionary team Witherall worked with in Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   "That was Bonnie," Porter said. "She would much rather talk about
people.... But she was caught in a world that distrusts pure
motives."</TE>
<TE>   A representative for the Alliance Church in Lebanon read a letter
from its president, Radwan Dagher, saying the hall where Witherall
was shot will be renamed in her memory.</TE>

<HD>Space Station Task Completed After Stalled Trolley Is Freed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>NASA got a scare Saturday when a $190-million trolley car needed to
finish construction of the international space station stalled on the
tracks before it could complete a 55-foot run.</LD>
<LD>   A spacewalking astronaut was sent to investigate and discovered
the trolley was hung up on an antenna that was still in its cradled,
prelaunch position.</LD>
<LD>   Astronaut John Herrington grabbed a power tool and deployed the
antenna so that it no longer rubbed against a cable reel on the
railcar.</LD>
<TE>   Almost six hours after it halted, the trolley completed the
remaining 10 feet of its journey.</TE>
<TE>   The trolley runs along a mini-railroad that is part of a lengthy
truss segment under construction on the space station. Its primary
task is to move the station's six-story robot arm from one work site
to another.</TE>
<TE>   The two-ton "mobile transporter" came to an abrupt halt about 10
minutes into its run. An attempt to restart it using computer
commands did not work.</TE>
<TE>   This was the first operational use of the trolley, which is
critical to the remainder of the space station's construction
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first glitch in the mission since Endeavour arrived at
the station five days earlier.</TE>

<HD>More Tax Cuts on Bush Agenda</HD>
<DH>The president wants to act quickly, seeking political
dividends in 2004. Some question the economic benefit or necessity of
such moves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Buoyed by the midterm elections -- and with an eye on the next
campaign -- President Bush and GOP congressional officials plan to
use their new clout to push for early action on legislation to cut
taxes and promote economic growth.</LD>
<LD>   Some analysts question whether such measures are needed to boost
an economy that shows signs of recovering. But the Bush
administration wants to plow ahead -- and fast.</LD>
<LD>   The White House has its political antennas tuned as much to the
economy of November 2004 as of January 2003, Republicans close to the
administration say. At the least, Bush and his aides want to ensure
that he cannot be accused of benign neglect toward the economy -- a
criticism that helped topple his father's administration in 1992.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a huge clamor" for an economic growth
package, said a senior House Republican leadership aide. "But they
are not doing it for two months from now; they are doing it for two
years from now."</TE>
<TE>   Among the options under review are proposals that speed up
scheduled reductions in income tax rates, boost the child tax credit
from $600 to $1,000 and cut taxes on dividends from investments.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Congress doesn't return until January, White House
officials are moving aggressively to lay the groundwork for action
early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's chief economic advisor, Lawrence Lindsey, met last week
with senior GOP congressional aides to strategize. Representatives of
major business groups went to the White House on Tuesday to discuss
tax cuts and the economy with Lindsey and Bush's chief political
advisor, Karl Rove. Bush's economic advisors gave him options to
review over the holiday weekend at his ranch near Crawford, Texas,
GOP sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The momentum behind new economic measures is one of the most vivid
examples of how Washington's policy landscape has been transformed by
the 2002 elections. With Republicans grabbing control of the Senate
and expanding their House majority, they can contemplate passing tax
cuts that were unthinkable as long as Democrats controlled the
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one thing you can bet on in 2003: There will be more tax
relief," said Mark Isakowitz, a lobbyist with close ties to the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Other White House-backed economic initiatives include a renewed
push to make permanent the 2001 tax cut -- a $1.35-trillion measure
that expires at the end of 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spotlighted that issue as he barnstormed for GOP candidates
this fall.</TE>
<TE>   But many economists -- including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan -- argue that such a change would do little to stimulate
the economy in the short term.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also is expected to develop a proposal to
fundamentally overhaul the tax code. But congressional action is far
less likely on that front.</TE>
<TE>   "This election solidified the previous tax cut, and we can argue
we have a mandate that legitimizes making [it] permanent," said
Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a
conservative lobbying group. "We did not ask for [a mandate] or get
one in terms of fundamental tax reform."</TE>
<TE>   Proposals to spur the economy are gathering steam despite some
positive economic indicators.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew
at a surprisingly strong rate in the third quarter of 2002. The
Conference Board recently reported that consumer confidence was up in
November.</TE>
<TE>   New orders for durable goods rose 2.8% in October, after falling
for two previous months. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National
Assn. of Manufacturers, called that report "evidence that the
manufacturing recovery is getting back on track."</TE>
<TE>   But other indicators -- such as the rocky stock market -- remain
troublesome, and many Republicans worry that the recovery is too slow
and unsteady.</TE>
<TE>   They also are concerned about public perceptions. In an October
CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll, 51% of those surveyed said they believed
the economy was getting worse; 71% rated economic conditions as poor
or fair.</TE>
<TE>   Against that backdrop, Republicans are wary of letting the economy
muddle along -- especially given the experience of Bush's father.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that can derail George W. Bush's success is a
recession," said Steve Moore, head of the Club for Growth, an
anti-tax advocacy group. "It makes sense politically and economically
to take out some anti-recession insurance."</TE>
<TE>   Tax cut proposals still face formidable hurdles in the Senate,
where Democrats retain the power to block bills by filibuster. And
many Democrats view the party's election losses as a sign they need
to be more aggressive in challenging Bush's economic policies.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy to support short-term stimulative tax cuts; we're not
as enamored of permanent tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy," a
senior Senate Democratic aide said.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans are aiming to craft legislation in ways that will
attract enough Democratic votes to break a filibuster. For example,
they are considering provisions to temporarily suspend payroll taxes
-- a policy that appeals to Democrats because it provides relief to
working-class people who benefit less from income tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Reaching consensus about what to put in a bill is a challenge that
Republicans did not face in 2001, when their script was written for
them. They pushed through, largely intact, the tax proposal Bush had
campaigned on.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in contrast, Bush and the GOP are writing tax policy on a
blank sheet of paper.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has made no decision yet about the size of the package -- and
how it fits in with other administration priorities, such as
providing a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, the cost of a
potential war against Iraq and holding down the budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Senate Republican aide predicted the package would be in
the range of $100 billion to $150 billion over 10 years -- a fraction
of the 2001 tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   A key policy question is the balance between tax breaks for
businesses and individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts argue that individual tax cuts to boost consumption
are more important, because consumer spending has been helping to
shore up the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Others argue that the biggest problem with the economy is
insufficient business investment, and they argue for new tax
incentives to change that.</TE>
<TE>   Republican strategists say the package is likely to be more
heavily weighted to individual breaks -- in part because the
political climate, in the wake of the recent business scandals, is
more favorable to that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Tax Cut Possibilities</TE>
<TE>   Among the options being discussed to cut taxes and promote
economic growth:</TE>
<TE>   * Accelerated income tax cuts: Republicans are considering faster
implementation of the income tax rate cuts called for by the 2001
law. Several Republicans want to put more money in taxpayers' pockets
by having the full cuts take effect in 2003, rather than being phased
in through 2006.</TE>
<TE>   * Family tax breaks: Provisions in the 2001 law to ease the tax
code's so-called marriage penalty, in which some couples pay more
than if they filed as individuals, have not taken effect. Also, the
child tax credit is scheduled to rise in stages from $600 to $1,000
in 2010. Republicans believe a bill to make those tax cuts effective
in 2003 would be politically difficult for Democrats to resist.</TE>
<TE>   * Payroll tax relief: Some Republicans -- and many Democrats --
support temporary suspension of the Social Security payroll tax. But
skeptics warn that such a change is counterproductive at a time when
Congress should be trying to shore up Social Security, not drain it
of revenues.</TE>
<TE>   * Tax break on dividends: There is growing GOP interest in easing
what critics call the "double taxation" of dividends, which occurs
when businesses pay taxes on their profits, and stockholders pay
income tax on the same money when they receive it as dividends.
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill is a leading supporter of
eliminating one of those taxes.</TE>
<TE>   * Investor tax breaks: House Republicans may revive an effort that
stalled last year to provide new tax incentives to individual
investors: an increase in the annual contributions to individual
retirement accounts and 401(k) retirement plans, and an increase in
the amount of investment losses that can be written off.</TE>

<HD>United's Attendants OK Cost-Cutting Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>United Airlines flight attendants ratified a cost-cutting deal with
the nation's No. 2 carrier Saturday, one day after the company's
stock tanked as analysts called bankruptcy nearly inevitable.</LD>
<LD>   Assn. of Flight Attendants spokeswoman Dawn Deeks said 87% of the
flight attendants who voted signed off on the deal. United's 24,000
flight attendants had been widely expected to approve the $412
million in wage concessions.</LD>
<LD>   But their OK means little as long as the airline's mechanics
continue to resist proposed reductions of $600 million in wages and
benefits.</LD>
<TE>   Wage-cutting agreements accepted by United's pilots and other
employee groups expire Dec. 31 unless mechanics sign on. United is
asking for $5.2 billion in companywide labor cuts over 5 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   The airline says its application for a $1.8-billion federal loan
guarantee is imperiled if all unions cannot agree on wage
concessions. A ruling is expected any day on the guarantee, which
cash-poor United says it must have to obtain $2 billion in private
loans.</TE>
<TE>   Without the loan guarantee, United has said it would have no
choice but to file for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   In a message to employees recorded after the mechanics' vote and
before the attendants' approval, United Chief Executive Glenn Tilton
warned that a bankruptcy filing could dramatically alter a
"cooperative" negotiation process: "We all must then follow a
prescribed course that is both unpredictable and potentially
adversarial."</TE>
<TE>   A bankruptcy is likely to have no immediate effect on passengers.
United said it will continue flying its normal schedule, as US
Airways has been doing since its Chapter 11 filing in August.</TE>
<TE>   United and the International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers were scheduled to meet today to discuss the mechanics'
rejection. Union spokesman Frank Tiberi said the flight attendants'
vote would have no effect on those negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in United parent UAL Corp. plunged $1.12, or 31%, in
holiday-shortened trading Friday to close at $2.51 on the New York
Stock Exchange. That was the first trading day since the mechanics'
vote was announced.</TE>
<TE>   The stock has lost 92% of its value since before last year's
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   United has struggled since the attacks to reverse daily
multimillion-dollar losses. It has reduced service and laid off
20,000 workers because of the weak economy and reduced spending by
business travelers.</TE>
<TE>   With hefty debt payments and other challenges looming, United has
little time to find the financial backing it needs to avoid filing
for bankruptcy-court protection.</TE>

<HD>Bush Appeals for Volunteers to Assist Needy, Ill</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Saturday called on Americans to take time during
the holiday season to help those less fortunate through volunteer
work at soup kitchens or visiting the sick at hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, spending the Thanksgiving weekend at his Texas ranch, used
his weekly radio address to plug his USA Freedom Corps and his call
for Americans to donate two years of their lives to community
service, the equivalent of 4,000 hours.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope you'll consider joining the armies of compassion, and
dedicating time and energy and service to others," he said. "Every
time you reach out to a neighbor in need you touch a life; you
improve your community and you strengthen our nation."</LD>
<TE>   The program acts as a clearinghouse for volunteer projects and
includes a new Citizen Corps to fight terrorism at the local level,
an expanded Peace Corps for overseas service, a Senior Corps for
older Americans and continued support for AmeriCorps, a Clinton
administration-era program.</TE>
<TE>   The Peace Corps has received more than 100,000 requests for
applications since January, an almost 40% jump over last year, while
52,000 have signed up online for the Citizen Corps since February,
according to the USA Freedom Corps.</TE>

four of its next five games at home. Foul trouble has plagued the
Matadors, who lost to No. 9 Oregon, 86-77, in their last outing. Six
Northridge players scored in double figures. Howard Coach Frankie

<LD>It took five days for 13 specialists to construct the clay tennis
court used for the Davis Cup final between France and Russia in
Paris. And within hours of the conclusion of the final match today,
the 350 tons of limestone and crushed brick will be broken up by a
bulldozer.</LD>
<LD>   By Tuesday the court must be turned back into an ice rink that
earlier in the month was the site of a figure skating event.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   More Davis Cup: On this day in 1991, France won the Davis Cup for
the first time in 59 years behind Guy Forget's four-set victory over
Pete Sampras of the United States, giving France an insurmountable
3-1 lead. And France is close to another Cup, taking a 2-1 lead over
Russia after Saturday's doubles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the oldest active player in the NFL?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No French judges: Jamie Sale and David Pelletier will be skating
with -- not against -- Olympic pairs co-champions Elena Berezhnaya
and Anton Sikharulidze as part of the Stars on Ice tour.</TE>
<TE>   "We like skating with them," Sale said. "We won't be competing as
to who's got the better number."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Uh, not really: Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News says
Houston Rocket center Yao Ming reminds him of Shaquille O'Neal --
sort of.</TE>
<TE>   "If Shaq were a little taller. And Chinese. And if his jokes were
told, mostly, through a translator. And if he were only occasionally
dominating and still finding his way in a new culture, on a new team,
under a coach who is decidedly conservative in his use of new and
occasionally dominating players. But I think you get the point."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Yao: Kawakami was thankful of one thing: " ... Surely, oh
Lord, please, Yao Ming won't rap like Shaquille O'Neal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pay to play: The U.S. Olympic Committee, in an effort to raise
money, has turned to EBay.</TE>
<TE>   Auctions are underway for two days of training with the Olympic
luge team, batting practice with the softball team, diving
instruction from gold medalist Laura Wilkinson and curling
instruction from a member of the curling team.</TE>
<TE>   What, no ski jumping?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Papal blessing: Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post speculates
on what Pope John Paul II told New York Met catcher Mike Piazza when
they met recently at the Vatican: "Actually, he said two things: 1)
'Agghh, you should have whacked [Roger] Clemens.' And 2) 'Where did
[Manager Bobby] Valentine get that stupid fake mustache? He looked
like Father Guido Sarducci.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By the numbers: Tony Stewart won the Winston Cup title with 4,800
points, 312 fewer than Jeff Gordon's winning total in 2001.</TE>

<HD>Minnesota Finally Wins a Close One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After letting a late lead slip away in five of its losses last
season, Minnesota was thrilled to win a close game.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Bauer's three-pointer rolled in at the buzzer Saturday to
give the 24th-ranked Golden Gophers a 72-69 victory over No. 17
Georgia at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Bauer, who missed two practices this week because of a sprained
shoulder and couldn't shoot without pain until Friday, scored 10
points for Minnesota (2-0).</LD>
<TE>   "Fans were trying to pat me on the shoulder," Bauer said, "and it
hurt a little bit. But it was worth it."</TE>
<TE>   Jarvis Hayes, who scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half,
helped Georgia (1-3) rally from a six-point deficit with 1:40 left.
He converted a three-point play to cut the lead to 68-66 with 50.5
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Rickert, who had 12 points, was fouled and made one of two
free throws with 34.3 seconds left. But Hayes swished a three-pointer
to tie the score at 69 with 14.7 seconds to go.</TE>
<TE>   "This just showed we're a different team than we were last year,"
said Minnesota's Moe Hargrow, who had 15 points. "Last year, our body
language would've been negative, and we would've been like, 'He hit
that shot. How are we going to win this game?' "</TE>
<TE>   The Gophers' misfortunes in the final minutes of games last season
cost them an NCAA tournament bid, but this victory might do a lot for
their confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Their best player, Rickert, missed all five of his second-half
shots, and they displayed the patience and discipline on offense that
wasn't always there last season.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Burleson made four three-pointers and scored 14 points for
Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Ezra Williams had 13 points and Chris Daniels and Rashad Wright 11
each for Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   "I think games like this make you better," Georgia Coach Jim
Harrick said. "I just think it helps you more than it hurts you."</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs have played without center Steve Thomas, who is
suspended because of academic troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "He's our middle man, our heart and soul," Harrick said. "We hope
to get him back in a couple games.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't, we're going to have a mediocre kind of year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Texas 78, Seton Hall 61 -- Deginald Erskin scored 22 of his
career-high 24 points in the second half and T.J. Ford added 19 for
the Longhorns (4-0) in a Space City Classic game at Reliant Stadium
in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   J.R. Morris led Seton Hall (1-1) with 12 points and Andre Barrett
added 11.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Pittsburgh 89, Arkansas-Pine Bluff 49 -- The Panthers (3-0)
withstood another poor shooting night by star Brandin Knight as Chevy
Troutman came off the bench to score 15 points in the win in
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Toree Morris, who finished with 10 points, scored seven
consecutive points in an 18-point first-half run that broke open an
unexpectedly tight game. Billy Hall scored 15 points for
Arkansas-Pine Bluff (0-4), which is one of the nation's worst
Division I teams, having lost 11 in a row and 30 of 32 since last
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Oklahoma 75, Prairie View 63 -- Hollis Price scored 13 of
Oklahoma's final 18 points, leading the Sooners (3-1) to a
tougher-than-expected victory at Norman, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   Price and Ebi Ere each had 16 points for Oklahoma. Prairie View
(1-1) was led by Malachi Thurston with 16 points and Gregory Burks
with 15.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State 64, No. 9 Michigan State 61 -- Victor Williams, who
had 14 points, hit six free throws in the final two minutes and
Oklahoma State upset the Spartans for third place in the Great Alaska
Shootout at Anchorage.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys' Tony Allen blocked a shot by Alan Anderson with 10
seconds remaining and Oklahoma State leading, 62-61. After Williams
made two free throws, Rashi Johnson missed a three-pointer at the
buzzer that would have tied it for Michigan State (2-2), which lost
for the second consecutive night.</TE>
<TE>   Melvin Sanders led Oklahoma State (3-1) with 18 points. Ivan
McFarlin scored 15 points and pulled down seven rebounds before
fouling out with 6:21 left. Aloysius Anagonye finished with 21 points
and eight rebounds for Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Oregon 88, Pacific 69 -- Luke Ridnour had 24 points and
seven assists and the Ducks (3-0) won their 19th game in a row at
Eugene, four short of the school record.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Joseph and James Davis added 14 points each for the Ducks,
who cruised to victory despite getting only eight points from star
forward Luke Jackson, who made two of 13 shots but had a career-high
12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Myree Bowden led Pacific (1-2) with 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Maryland 89, Duquesne 39 -- Drew Nicholas scored 19 points
and Ryan Randle added a career-high 16 for the Terrapins, who
extended their nonconference home winning streak to 87 games with the
rout in College Park.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas scored all of his points before halftime, helping
Maryland (3-0) build a 31-point lead. No player for Duquesne (1-3)
scored more than seven points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 Missouri 81, Austin Peay 46 -- Rickey Paulding had 14
points and nine rebounds and Jimmy McKinney had eight points in 14
minutes in his return from a broken bone above his right eye to lead
the Tigers at Columbia, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Johnson had 16 points and three steals, and Ricky Clemons
had nine points and eight assists for Missouri (2-0). Corey Gipson
had 15 points, making four of 10 three-point shots, for Austin Peay
(2-1).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dayton 75, No. 21 Cincinnati 69 -- Keith Waleskowski scored 18

<HD>Return Trip for 'Journey</HD>
<DH>In what may have been his final race, Good Journey becomes
the second repeat winner of the Citation Handicap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Mieszerski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Good Journey ran his last race Saturday, the 6-year-old Nureyev
horse went out in style.</LD>
<LD>   With jockey Pat Day aboard, the even-money favorite and 123-pound
high-weight became only the second repeat winner of the $500,000
Citation Handicap at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Although Breeders' Cup Turf winner High Chaparral is the likely
winner of the Eclipse award as the top male turf performer, a case
can certainly be made for Good Journey.</LD>
<TE>   In beating 15-1 shot Seinne by 1 1/4 lengths in 1:41 2/5 for the 1
1/16 miles, Good Journey earned his fourth win in five starts in
2002. Three of his victories came in graded stakes, and his only
defeat came when he was third, beaten by less than a length by
longshot Domedriver in the Breeders' Cup Mile.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Wally Dollase, who owns a piece of the chestnut along
with half a dozen partners, Good Journey will be sold as a stallion
if the right offer is made. Otherwise, he could return to race in
2003.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to sell him as a stallion now," said Dollase, whose
horse was close to the slow pace Saturday. "He's impeccably bred and
would make one heck of a sire. I'm not going to worry about the
Eclipse award. I was lucky to win one with Itsallgreektome [in 1990],
but it's kind of unfair. [High Chaparral] won one race here and this
horse was so consistent.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a special horse. I've been around a lot of good ones and he
and Itsallgreektome have the two best minds of any horses I've been
around."</TE>
<TE>   A winner of the 2001 Citation by half a length over Decarchy, who
was a troubled fourth Saturday as the 3-1 second choice, Good Journey
joined Forlitano, who won in 1987-88, as a two-time winner of the
Grade II.</TE>
<TE>   "He did it very nicely," Day said after his fourth Turf Festival
win. "I'd have to think his name would be in the thick of the race
for the Eclipse award."</TE>
<TE>   Seinne finished a head in front of 9-1 shot White Heart and it was
a neck to Decarchy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel drew closer to the record for earnings by a
stable in a year when Peace Rules, the 5-2 second choice, led most of
the way en route to winning the $200,000 Generous Stakes at Hollywood
Park.</TE>
<TE>   A tough-luck loser to Man Among Men in the Pinjara on Oct. 24 at
Santa Anita in his California debut, the 2-year-old Jules colt and
jockey Victor Espinoza beat 7-2 third choice Lismore Knight by 1 1/4
lengths. He completed the mile on turf in 1:35 2/5.</TE>
<TE>   The Frankel barn has banked $17,241,228 in 2002, leaving him
$601,130 shy of the mark of $17,842,358 set by Wayne Lukas in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very, very strong horse," Espinoza said. "Bobby called
me before the race [from New York] and told me to just let him do
whatever he wanted to do. When I turned for home, my horse really
kicked on. He finished very strong."</TE>
<TE>   Man Among Men, the 2-1 favorite who was unbeaten in his two
previous starts on the grass, finished fourth, a little more than two
lengths behind the winner.</TE>
<TE>   "He never really felt comfortable," jockey Alex Solis said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After going 0 for 2 for Frankel in 2-year-old stakes at Aqueduct,
jockey Jerry Bailey won the day's richest race for trainer Bob
Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   Riding Congaree for the first time since they finished third in
the 2001 Preakness, Bailey and the 4-year-old Arazi colt rolled to an
easy victory in the $350,000 Cigar Mile.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Robert and Janice McNair's Stonerside Stable, Congaree,
the 9-2 fourth choice in the field of eight, stalked the pace set by
Bonapaw, then took over early in the stretch and went on to win by 5
1/2 lengths in 1:33.</TE>
<TE>   It was the seventh win in 14 starts for Congaree but his first in
a Grade I.</TE>
<TE>   For Bailey, it was his 64th stakes win of 2002, leaving him three
shy of the record set by Mike Smith in 1994. He also increased his
purse earnings to $22,542,509, $315,211 less than the record of
$22,857,720 he set a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Congaree was awesome," Baffert said. "He destroyed some really
good horses today."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Bailey was ninth on the Frankel-trained Summer Scene in
the $200,000 Demoiselle, which was won wire-to-wire by 5-2 second
choice Roar Emotion, and the Hall of Fame rider was third with
favored Empire Maker, also for Frankel, in the $200,000 Remsen.</TE>
<TE>   In that Grade II, Toccet, making his third start since Oct. 26 for
owner Daniel Borislow and trainer John Scanlan, won by a little more
than two lengths over Bham in 1:50 2/5 for the 1 1/8 miles. It was
the fifth victory in seven starts for the son of Awesome Again who
was the 8-5 second choice under jockey Jorge Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   "This colt can do it all," Scanlan said. "He can win on the front,
back or sideways. I was confident he would win when I entered him."</TE>
<TE>   Empire Maker, a half-brother to stakes winners Decarchy, Chester
House and Honest Lady, was a distant third in his second career
start. Frankel indicated he could show up in the $200,000 Hollywood
Futurity on Dec. 21.</TE>

<LD>If a college football recruiter wants to meet with receiver Rudy
Burgess of Desert High, getting past a soldier armed with an M-16
rifle is the first step.</LD>
<LD>   Desert is a public high school in the middle of Edwards Air Force
Base, which is a sprawling 301,000 acres and has its own Burger King,
Pizza Hut, bowling alley and 18-hole golf course.</LD>
<LD>   Once through the gate of Edwards, where America's fighter planes
are tested, coaches begin to understand where Burgess receives his
inspiration for speed.</LD>
<TE>   On any given day, look up and there's a B-1B bomber gliding like
an eagle or an F-117 stealth fighter swooping across the Antelope
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Testing is underway for the F/A-22 "Raptor," the Air Force's
newest jet fighter, so if football practice is disrupted by an
occasional glance upward, no one is surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "It's real cool," Burgess said of attending high school on an Air
Force base. "We see so much it kind of gets old. I know if someone
else came out to the base, they'd be in awe looking at the planes."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches can be in awe watching Burgess, a 5-foot-10, 165-pound
senior with 4.4 40-yard speed and unquestionable athletic skills.</TE>
<TE>   He leads Desert in tackles, has caught six touchdown passes,
scored seven touchdowns as a running back, returned two punts for
touchdowns, returned a kickoff for a touchdown, returned two fumble
recoveries for touchdowns and returned an interception for a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   In track last season, he finished fourth in the state long jump,
won the Southern Section Division IV 100 meters and has bests of 6-8
in the high jump, 10.80 seconds for the 100, 24-8 1/4 in the long
jump and 47-10 in the triple jump.</TE>
<TE>   He lived in New York, Mississippi and England before arriving at
Edwards Air Force Base in 1994. His father is a retired Air Force
staff sergeant.</TE>
<TE>   Before Burgess enrolled at Desert as a freshman, the football team
had three consecutive 0-10 seasons. People told his father it would
be better to send his son to another school.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people said, 'You're only going to get noticed if you go
to a big school,' " Burgess said. "I figured if you're good enough,
you'll get noticed. It's up to you to get that exposure."</TE>
<TE>   Burgess helped Desert win the High Desert League title, finish the
regular season 10-0 and earn a No. 2 seeding in the Division XII
playoffs. The Scorpions have advanced to the semifinals after a 61-8
victory over Los Angeles Salesian and a 42-32 victory over North
Hills L.A. Baptist.</TE>
<TE>   He has made recruiting trips to Washington State and Oregon State,
with visits set up for Oregon, Washington and Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   Burgess has attended public schools on military bases all his life
and wasn't going to change, though he lives only a couple of blocks
from Rosamond High.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his friends are sons and daughters of military personnel.
He knows they can be at school one day and be gone the next, only to
return a year or two later, depending on deployment papers.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know who you're going to meet again in the future," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Desert running back Jason Napoleon was one of Burgess' best
friends when the two were living in England. The Air Force
transferred Burgess' father to Edwards, then Napoleon's father
followed.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the Air Force, Burgess has visited France, Italy,
Belgium, Holland and Germany. The Eiffel Tower in Paris made a
memorable impression.</TE>
<TE>   "Going up all the way to the top is a real experience," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So is the thrill of watching a space shuttle land at Edwards when
the weather prevents it from landing in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "You sit there in the bleachers, wait until the sonic boom comes
and you see it coming out of space," he said. "It's weird. You feel
excited, then it lands and you're amazed."</TE>
<TE>   While Burgess has interests in computer graphics and animation,
his ability to run fast will earn him a college scholarship. And his
everyday environment of watching fast planes streak above serves as a
reminder what speed means in football.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel kind of privileged," he said. "It's like watching 'Top
Gun' and seeing Maverick do the maneuvers."</TE>

<LD>The Long Beach Wilson girls' volleyball team made up for lost time
Saturday night. The visiting Bruins defeated Los Alamitos in a
five-game Southern California semifinal match to get back on track
for their ultimate goal of winning a state title.</LD>
<LD>   The 15-7, 11-15, 13-15, 15-3, 15-7 victory also made up for a
five-game loss to Los Alamitos (30-8) a week earlier in the Southern
Section Division I-AA championship.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we stayed more focused this time," Wilson Coach Susan
Pescar said. "When you lose to somebody, you want to come back and do
your best."</LD>
<TE>   The Bruins (35-3) looked determined from the start, building an
11-1 lead before Emily Hendrickson finished the game by spiking an
errant Los Alamitos pass.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson lost its focus in the second and third games, letting a 6-0
lead get away in Game 2 and a 12-8 lead slip away in Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins came alive in the fourth game, scoring seven
consecutive points to take an 11-2 lead. In the final game, Wilson
reeled off five consecutive points in the rally-scoring format to
take an insurmountable 11-4 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Barboza had 26 kills and seven blocks to lead the Bruins.
Brett Quirarte contributed 23 kills for Wilson, including four in the
fifth game.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson will play Clovis Buchanan on Tuesday in the regional final.</TE>

<TE>   Los Angeles Marymount d. Flintridge Sacred Heart, 15-7, 15-1,
13-15, 16-14 -- The top-seeded Sailors had already beaten Sacred
Heart in the Southern Section Division IV-AA championship eight days
earlier, but Stesha Selsky made sure Marymount wasn't going to rest
on its laurels.</TE>
<TE>   The junior had 28 kills, 10 digs and six aces for the host Sailors
(28-4), who withstood furious rallies by the Tologs in the fourth and
fifth games of the Southern California Division IV semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   The Tologs (21-6) took their first lead of the match, 1-0, in the
third game and extended it to 8-2 before Marymount battled back to
take a 10-9 advantage. Flintridge Sacred Heart setter Jillian Davis,
who was stymied by Marymount in the section final, recorded six kills
in the fourth game to avoid a sweep.</TE>
<TE>   The teams exchanged leads throughout the fourth game, but
Marymount capitalized on four of Sacred Heart's 15 service errors to
open a 13-10 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Nancy Tinkham called a timeout so the Tologs could regroup.
They scored four consecutive points for a 14-13 lead, but Selsky
recorded two of the Sailors' next three kills for the decisive
margin.</TE>
<TE>   Davis finished with 18 kills, including nine in the fifth game,
and seven blocks and Katheryn Gorsh had 14 blocks for the Tologs.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Levanas had 21 kills and seven blocks and Jenny Dykstra
had 27 assists for Marymount, which plays San Juan Capistrano St.
Margaret's, a 15-7, 15-7, 15-10 winner over San Diego Parker, in the
regional final on Tuesday.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles Loyola, a cross-country team that began the season with a
goal of advancing to the state championships for the first time, won
the Division I title Saturday at Woodward Park.</LD>
<LD>   The Cubs, led by third-place Mark Matusak and eighth-place David
Torrence, totaled 80 points to win the Division I race by a
comfortable margin on a cool and overcast day. Chino Don Lugo was
second with 103 points and Dana Point Dana Hills was third with 104
in a race in which the top six teams were from the Southern Section.</LD>
<LD>   "Finishing second [in the team sweepstakes race of the Mt. San
Antonio College Invitational] was a turning point for us," Matusak
said. "That race made us think we had a chance to win a section
title."</LD>
<TE>   Loyola finished second to Long Beach Poly in the Mt. SAC
Invitational on Oct. 26, but the Cubs defeated top-ranked Poly and
four other teams ranked among the top six in the state in winning the
Southern Section title at Mt. SAC on Nov. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Section runners won seven of a possible 10 titles in the
boys' meet as Barstow won its second consecutive Division III
championship, Oak Park won its first Division IV title and La Canada
Flintridge Prep won its third Division V championship in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Runners from the Southern Section won three individual titles as
senior Michael Poe of Etiwanda ran 15:06 in the Division I race,
senior Phillip Reid of Oxnard Rio Mesa clocked 15:01 in the Division
II race and junior Mohamed Trafeh of Duarte timed 15:13 in the
Division IV final.</TE>
<TE>   Poe's time gave him a victory margin of 16 seconds, which equaled
the largest recorded in the Division I race of the state meet, which
began in 1987. Reid's time was the fastest of the meet, broke the
Division II record of 15:06 set by Matt Farley of Carmichael Jesuit
in 1993 and gave him a victory against the strongest field of the
meet.</TE>
<TE>   Trafeh's time gave him a 43-second margin of victory, the largest
in meet history at any level.</TE>

<LD>Murrieta Valley's claim to the girls' team time record at Woodward
Park lasted a little over two hours Saturday in the state
cross-country championships, thanks to Hesperia Sultana.</LD>
<LD>   Murrieta Valley, the No. 11-ranked team in the nation by Harrier
magazine, won its first state title with a 61-68 victory over
Thousand Oaks in the Division I race. In the process, the Nighthawks'
top five runners posted a cumulative time of 93 minutes 1 second over
the 5,000-meter course to break the previous best of 93:04 set by
Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula in the 2000 state meet.</LD>
<LD>   But Sultana annihilated that mark four races later when it posted
a team time of 91:56 in winning the Division II title by a record 85
points. It was the best performance by a girls' team since the state
meet began in 1987.</LD>
<TE>   "The kids ran an unbelievable time," said Coach John Mahr of
Sultana, ranked No. 3 in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Kelsey Delagardelle finished second in 17:54 and freshman
Danielle Varela was fourth in 18:05 for Sultana, which defeated
Ventura, 59-144, for its second title in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Murrieta Valley had four of the top 14 finishers in the Division I
race. Junior Liza Pasciuto ran 18:05 to finish second as expected for
Murrieta Valley. But the Nighthawks got an unexpected fifth place
from senior Bonghabih Shey, who had placed 17th in the Southern
Section championships a week earlier. "I just felt like I had nothing
to lose," said Shey, who ran 18:20. "I told myself, 'This is my last
[high school cross-country race] and I have nothing to lose.' "</TE>
<TE>   Southern Section runners won three other titles as Oak Park won
its second consecutive Division IV girls' title and seniors Laura
Meyers of Pasadena Maranatha and Bessie Hatch of Ojai Thacher won the
Division IV and V races, respectively. Meyers clocked 18:21 and Hatch
ran 18:58.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Twice in the last three years, trainer Bobby Frankel has swept the
Matriarch and the Hollywood Derby.</LD>
<LD>   He won the Derby with Super Quercus in 1999 the same day
Happyanunoit took the Matriarch. Last year, he took the Matriarch
with Starine and the Derby with Denon.</LD>
<LD>   Frankel, the country's leading trainer, has a chance for another
such double today. He is scheduled to have two entries in both Grade
I races. In the $500,000 Matriarch, he'll send out the Juddmonte
Farms-owned entry of Banks Hill and Tates Creek. Royal Gem and
Inesperado will be his runners in the $500,000 Derby.</LD>
<TE>   Both races are at 1 1/8 miles on the grass and are the final legs
of Hollywood Park's $2.1 million Turf Festival.</TE>
<TE>   The one to beat in the Matriarch is Golden Apples. She had a rough
trip as the 5-2 favorite in the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf but
can probably earn herself an Eclipse award as the nation's top female
turf performer with a win this afternoon. Starine, who was retired
after a Breeders' Cup victory, didn't accomplish anything else this
year, and a win would be the third Grade I score of the year for
Golden Apples.</TE>
<TE>   The Derby, which is part of a pick six that has a $1 million
guaranteed pool, includes Johar and Rock Opera, who finished a nose
apart in the Oak Tree Derby on Oct. 13; Century City, a troubled
third in his U.S. debut in the Bay Meadows Derby on Nov. 3, and
shipper Union Place.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Critical Eye, a hard-knocking, New York-bred
mare, will try to go over $1 million in earnings in today's $75,000
Montauk Handicap at Aqueduct. The 5-year-old daughter of Dynaformer
has won 13 of 36 for owners Herbert and Carol Schwartz and trainer
Scott Schwartz.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Bill Mott. The trainer won with nine of his first 21
starters at Calder.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Colum O'Brien. The New York-based trainer is one for 56
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Inesperado, Johar, Century
City, Rock Opera and Royal Gem in the eighth, singling Excaper in the
ninth and using Golden Rahy, Academy Spy and Value Play in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 6/45. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $37.80/$252.80. Total money bet: $322.</TE>

<HD>Jets All the Way?</HD>
<DH>New York is thinking playoffs after its recovery from 2-5
start</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Being a losing team anywhere is a drag, but it's especially hard in
New York. Just ask the Jets, who stumbled out of the gate with four
losses in five games and were subject to scathing criticism,
relentless second-guessing and ruthless scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   Not to mention what was being said outside the locker room.</LD>
<LD>   "The ship is sinking," Curtis Martin said after a loss to
Jacksonville.</LD>
<TE>   "We're real predictable," John Abraham said after a loss to
Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   "We stunk," Josh Evans said, looking back at a 2-5 start.</TE>
<TE>   Even Gang Green alumni were grousing. During a stop in Los
Angeles, legendary quarterback Joe Namath told The Times he couldn't
believe the Jets had the second-highest payroll in the league.</TE>
<TE>   "How? Why? How did they get in that position?" asked Namath, whose
critique made headlines in New York such as "Broadway Schmoes" and
"Namath Blue over Green."</TE>
<TE>   Even if some Jets gave up on the season, the season never gave up
on them. San Diego was the first to fall, then Miami, Detroit and
Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Just like that -- bada bing, bada boom! -- the Jets were back in
the playoff race. They are on a four-game winning streak, one game
behind the first-place Dolphins in the AFC East.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets (6-5), who play Monday night at Oakland, have adopted a
mantra first uttered by third-year quarterback Chad Pennington, who
replaced Vinny Testaverde four games into the season: "Why not us?"</TE>
<TE>   Explained Pennington, "We've always had the attitude of, why not
us? Even when we were 2-5, it was, why not us? Why can't we make
history? Now that we're 6-5 it's, why not us? Why can't we finish it
off and make the playoffs?"</TE>
<TE>   The Jets are 10-3 on the road since the arrival of Coach Herman
Edwards, and that's a good sign, considering three of their final
five games are away from the Meadowlands.</TE>
<TE>   Martin is coming off consecutive games in which he rushed for more
than 100 yards, and Pennington has directed an offense that has
averaged 29.8 points during the winning streak. The Jet defense has
held opponents to 12.5 points a game over that span.</TE>
<TE>   The same Jet defense that averaged 13 missed tackles in its first
five games has averaged only three in its last six. Early in the
season, that defense surrendered 200 yards rushing in three
consecutive games. In the last six games, no team has rushed against
the Jets for more than 108.</TE>
<TE>   Four games into the season, Pennington replaced Testaverde after a
three-game losing streak in which the Jets had been outscored,
102-13. Although his relationship with offensive coordinator Paul
Hackett has been strained at times, Testaverde accepted the benching
with typical grace.</TE>
<TE>   "As you get older, you tend to understand why certain things
happen," the 38-year-old quarterback told reporters. "I'm not going
to sit here and tell you I'm getting a raw deal."</TE>
<TE>   The lift Pennington provided was immediate and obvious. In his
first start, at home against Kansas City, he made an impression
during introductions by head-butting teammates as he ran onto the
field. The Jets lost that game, 29-25, but they showed flashes of the
offensive pyrotechnics in the offing. Running back Martin sensed
something good was happening, telling reporters: "I definitely don't
think the season's lost."</TE>
<TE>   Pennington was even more optimistic, saying he envisioned the team
going 10-6 or better. People around him -- reporters, and maybe even
some players -- stifled guffaws and dismissed the comment as youthful
enthusiasm run amok.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets got back on track with a victory over Minnesota, then
took a step back by frittering away an 18-point lead to Cleveland and
losing, 24-21. Many people point to that as the low point of the
season. It certainly had a desperate feel to Jet General Manager
Terry Bradway, who has a weekly radio show on which he fields calls
from fans. It's a true test of his patience.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a glutton for punishment," Bradway joked. "With the exception
of that [post-Cleveland] week, it's gone pretty well. The listeners
do appreciate the fact that I take their calls and try to answer
their questions. But that night, they wanted to fire me, fire Herm,
fire the equipment guy. Anybody wearing a Jets shirt, they wanted to
fire."</TE>
<TE>   A funny thing happened to the Jets when they hit rock bottom. They
bounced. They washed away the Cleveland loss by crushing then-hot San
Diego, 44-13, then maintained the momentum with victories over the
Dolphins, Lions and Bills.</TE>
<TE>   "We dug ourselves such a deep hole at the beginning of the
season," Bradway said. "We feel like we're still in that hole and
we're still digging."</TE>
<TE>   In Pennington's seven starts, he has a completion mark of 73.7%
with 11 touchdown passes and three interceptions, and a quarterback
rating of 108.8. During that seven-game stretch, he has not thrown
three consecutive incomplete passes.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about Chad is, he knows how to play the game," Bradway
said. "He doesn't get frustrated or flustered, even when things
aren't going well."</TE>
<TE>   But the switch to Pennington cannot entirely explain the
turnaround. Was it a coaching breakthrough during the bye week after
the loss to Kansas City? The move to more of a two-back, ball-control
offense -- vastly different from the spread offense the team ran with
Testaverde? Was it that the defense, which has six new starters this
season, needed time to come together? The improving condition of
Martin, who had been slowed by a sprained ankle earlier in the
season?</TE>
<TE>   These days, the Jets aren't caught up in trying to find an
explanation. They're only concern with one question:</TE>
<TE>   Why not us?</TE>

<LD>There will be no $1 million bonus for Morning Snow.</LD>
<LD>   On a night when heavy rain and wind hampered the horses who ran in
the later trials for the $1,313,700 Los Alamitos Million, Morning
Snow, who was eligible for the bonus because of earlier wins in the
Kindergarten and Ed Burke Memorial futurities, wasn't among the 10
fastest qualifiers Friday night. So she won't run in the Million on
Dec. 13.</LD>
<LD>   Another star who failed to qualify was All American Futurity
winner AB What A Runner. The filly won her heat to remain unbeaten in
four starts, but her time wasn't swift enough.</LD>
<TE>   Meteoric, who has won eight of nine, qualified and will be heavily
favored in the Million. The rest of the field: Special Queen Sa,
Royal Miracle Dip, The Blues Man, Lotta Bang, Lock To Load, Xterra,
Dealadash, Corona Caliente and First Place Queen. John Bassett trains
half the qualifiers.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Fly Savannah Fly. 2. Fleet Year. 3. Swift Intruder.
4. Azuzenas De Amoy. 5. La Classique. 6. Frolic's Flash. 7. Onwego
Desert Music. 8. Otra Fracaso. 9. Coronetta.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use This Chicks A Dasher and Fly Savannah Fly in the first,
single Fleet Year in the second, Meters Honor, Swift Intruder and the
Real Nice Dasher-Bedazzled You in the third and Azuzenas De Amoy,
Streakin Ronas Star, Royal Tolltac and Murietta Red in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Fly By A Nose drops into a claimer in the
fifth. Ken Mars Secret is better than his last would indicate and
could bounce back in the eighth.</TE>

<HD>Dorsey, Hurricanes Make a Solid Statement</HD>
<DH>Quarterback energizes his Heisman campaign with 345 yards
passing and No. 1 Miami improves to 11-0 with 49-7 rout of Syracuse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shav Glick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SYRACUSE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Californian Ken Dorsey, whose Heisman Trophy campaign had stalled in
the last two games, put his name back in focus Saturday by riddling a
porous Syracuse secondary for 345 yards passing and two touchdowns in
Miami's 49-7 Big East rout under the Carrier Dome.</LD>
<LD>   The victory solidified the Hurricanes' No. 1 standing with an 11-0
record and left them one game -- against Virginia Tech next Saturday
-- removed from a national championship match with undefeated Ohio
State in the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   It also extended Miami's undefeated streak to 33, the longest
since Toledo won 35 straight from 1969-71.</LD>
<TE>   Dorsey started the season as the Heisman favorite after finishing
third last year, but when he passed for only 163 yards last week
against Pittsburgh and had only one touchdown in each of the last two
games, his status slipped.</TE>
<TE>   Against the hapless Orangemen, it wasn't so much that he toyed
with them -- after all, their pass defense ranks 115th among 117
Division I-A teams -- as the way he did it. The 6-foot-5, 200-pound
senior from Orinda looked as if he should be throwing for the Miami
Dolphins instead of the Hurricanes as he completed his first 10
passes for a 21-0 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Dorsey made a statement today," Miami Coach Larry Coker said. "He
is special. You can use all those cliches you want, but in our
opinion, he is the best player in the country, and as good as any of
the great quarterbacks we've had."</TE>
<TE>   That would include Heisman winners Vinny Testaverde and Gino
Torretta, plus Jim Kelly, Bernie Kosar, George Mira and Steve Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   As he has all season, Dorsey deflected attention from himself and
warned, "We can't have a letdown; Virginia Tech is going to come in
with a lot of energy."</TE>
<TE>   Flanker Andre Johnson was Dorsey's favorite target, hauling in six
passes for 181 yards that included a four-yard touchdown across the
middle from a spread formation.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of my best games, catching and blocking," said
Johnson, a junior who was co-player of the game with Dorsey in
Miami's 37-14 national championship win over Nebraska in the Rose
Bowl. "I was proud of some of the blocks I made on big runs today."</TE>
<TE>   An uncanny ability to convert third-down plays has become Dorsey's
hallmark. He did it seven of 10 times Saturday, including precision
strikes to Kellen Winslow on a deep pass for 33 yards and a crossing
pattern for 19. This season Dorsey has converted 63 of 103 third-down
passes for 757 yards, with nine touchdowns and no interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "The line does a great job blocking and guys picking up blitzes,"
said Dorsey, who did not play most of the fourth quarter. "Experience
comes into play; [our linemen] just have an understanding of the
situation."</TE>
<TE>   To prove he was human, he was sacked twice and fumbled once on
third down, but recovered the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Willis McGahee, Miami's other Heisman candidate, had an
unusual day. He had scoring runs of 61 and 51 yards, the first coming
on the Hurricanes' second offensive play, but in his other 12 carries
he gained only 22 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not the No. 1 team in the nation for nothing," said
Syracuse tailback Walter Reyes, who ran for 120 yards. "They came in
here and we knew we would have to play 60 minutes very hard. They are
a great team, and unfortunately we kind of sputtered today."</TE>
<TE>   With the score 35-7 in the fourth quarter, what was left of the
crowd of 45,679 booed loudly when Miami punter Freddie Clapshaw
surprisingly threw a wobbly pass to Sean Taylor, who ran 47 yards for
an unexpected -- and almost unwanted -- touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "That was regrettable coming at that time in the game," Coker
said. "It was an automatic that we had in our game plan, that if the
receiver is not covered, we go to him, but unfortunately I had
forgotten to call it off."</TE>

<HD>Rix Gets Second Chance, Leads Florida State to Win</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Rix used his second chance to make a bad week much better for
Florida State.</LD>
<LD>   Rix threw two touchdown passes to Anquan Boldin and rushed for 83
yards Saturday night to help No. 23 Florida State defeat No. 15
Florida, 31-14, at Tallahassee, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Freshman tailback Leon Washington rushed for 134 yards, and all of
the sudden, a week of turmoil and a season of disappointments didn't
seem so bad for the Seminoles (9-4).</LD>
<TE>   They did, after all, win the Atlantic Coast Conference. They will
play in a major bowl game -- probably the Sugar. And they punctuated
the regular season by beating their biggest rival for the fourth time
in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Florida Coach Ron Zook had no more luck in his first year than
Steve Spurrier did in 12 seasons when it comes to winning at Doak
Campbell Stadium. The Gators (8-4) still haven't won in Tallahassee
since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Rix, who completed 13 of 29 passes for 194 yards, won the starting
job by default when Adrian McPherson was kicked off the team last
week after a police investigation led to his arrest on a charge of
felony grand theft. McPherson's final game was a dreadful 17-7 loss
to North Carolina State on Nov. 23 that had Seminoles fans howling.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott McBrien threw for 257 yards and two touchdowns in the first
half, helping 25th-ranked Maryland (10-3, 6-2) to a 32-14 victory
over Wake Forest (6-6, 3-5) in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at
College Park, Md. With the victory, the Terrapins earned a berth in
the Peach Bowl and recorded a second straight 10-win season for the
first time in school history.... Micky D'Angelo threw for 208 yards
and a touchdown and backup quarterback Dustin Almond ran for a
touchdown as Southern Mississippi (7-5, 5-3) finished the regular
season with a 24-7 victory over East Carolina (4-7, 4-3) in a
Conference USA game at Hattiesburg, Miss.... Ryan Schneider threw
four touchdown passes to Doug Gabriel and ran for another score as
Central Florida (7-5, 6-2) pulled away for a 42-32 victory over Ohio
(4-8, 4-4) in a Mid-American Conference game at Orlando, Fla....
Dwone Hicks rushed for 169 yards and two touchdowns to lead Middle
Tennessee (4-8) to a 45-28 victory over Utah State (4-7) at
Mufreesboro, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EAST</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia (9-3, 6-1) turned two Rod Rutherford turnovers into
touchdowns and the visiting No. 24 Mountaineers, possibly headed to
the Gator Bowl, held on for a 24-17 victory over No. 17 Pittsburgh
(8-4, 5-2) in a Big East Conference game. Rasheed Marshall ran for a
touchdown, threw for another and set up a score with a 25-yard
reception as West Virginia beat Pitt for the eighth time in 11
years.... Lee Suggs rushed for two touchdowns and No. 22 Virginia
Tech (9-3) found its defense, shutting down Matt Schaub and beating
rival Virginia (8-5) for the fourth consecutive year, 21-9, in a
nonconference game at Blacksburg, Va. The Hokies ended a three-game
losing streak by holding the Cavaliers to 203 yards and getting a
touchdown from their special teams to go with Suggs' 51st and 52nd
career touchdowns.... Byron Leftwich passed for 401 yards to become
the Mid-American Conference's career offense leader as Marshall (9-2,
7-1) rolled to a 38-14 victory over Ball State (6-6, 4-4) at
Huntington, W.Va. Marshall will play host to Toledo in the MAC
championship game next Saturday. In a late Heisman Trophy push,
Leftwich completed 35 of 42 passes and had his fourth 400-yard game
this season. He has 11,408 career yards of total offense, surpassing
the 11,081 set by Western Michigan's Tim Lester from 1996 to '99....
Derrick Knight rushed for 205 yards and one touchdown and caught a
52-yard pass for another score as Boston College (8-4, 3-4) rolled to
a 44-14 victory over Rutgers (1-11, 0-7) at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MIDWEST</TE>
<TE>   DeMarco McCleskey caught two touchdown passes and ran for another
as Cincinnati (6-6, 5-2) kept its bowl hopes alive with a 31-23
victory over visiting Alabama Birmingham (5-7, 4-4) in a Conference
USA game.... Brian Jones threw for three touchdowns and Trinity
Dawson ran for three more as Toledo (9-3, 7-1) rolled to a 42-24
victory over Bowling Green (9-3, 6-2) at Toledo, Ohio, to win the
Mid-American Conference's West Division title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SOUTHWEST</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Lonta Hobbs rushed for 287 yards and three touchdowns,
the last one with 38 seconds left, as Texas Christian (9-2, 6-2)
prevailed, 27-20, over Memphis (3-9, 2-6) at Fort Worth to earn a
berth in the Liberty Bowl by winning a share of the Conference USA
title. Hobbs, who had his fifth consecutive 100-yard game, set TCU
freshman records for rushing yards in a game, yards in a season (952)
and touchdowns in a season (10).... Joffrey Reynolds rushed for 149
yards to set the Conference USA single-season record (1,545 yards)
and caught two touchdown passes to lead Houston (5-7, 3-5) to a 27-10
victory over visiting Louisville (7-5, 5-3). Reynolds recorded his
conference-record eighth 100-yard game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WEST</TE>
<TE>   Larry Croom rushed for 222 yards and a touchdown, and DeJhown
Mandley caught a 29-yard touchdown pass with 46 seconds left as
Nevada Las Vegas (5-7, 3-4) came back for a 36-33 upset over No. 16
Colorado State (10-3, 6-1) in a Mountain West Conference game at Fort
Collins, Colo. The Rebels had 390 yards rushing to beat Colorado
State for the first time since 1982, a span of seven games....
DonTrell Moore scored five touchdowns and became the first New Mexico
back in six years to rush for over 1,000 yards as the Lobos (7-6,
5-2) clinched their second bowl bid in 41 years with a 49-20 victory
over Wyoming (2-10, 1-6) in a Mountain West Conference game at
Albuquerque. New Mexico finished second in the conference and will go
to either the Las Vegas Bowl or San Francisco Bowl.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler  / ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Don't Look for Seismic Shift in 2003</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now for the once eagerly awaited summer of '03 ...</LD>
<LD>   Once, it looked as if it would rival the summer of 1996, when
Shaquille O'Neal went west, reconfiguring the NBA. Now, apparently,
the present configuration will hold.</LD>
<LD>   In the new, sober NBA, the salary cap just went down for the first
time and it won't go back up fast, with the new national TV contract
increasing by only about 1% a year.</LD>
<TE>   Players are less whimsical, so even if they pine for brighter
lights, as Chris Webber did, they may find themselves signing
themselves into Sacramento for life.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the ballyhooed 1998 draft class, the first on the
five-year rookie scale, which was to hit the market next summer. By
last summer, prudent ownership had locked up Dirk Nowitzki, Paul
Pierce, Vince Carter, Mike Bibby, Raef LaFrentz and Antawn Jamison,
so if the Clippers weren't still dangling Michael Olowokandi, there
wouldn't be much for the rest of the league to look forward to.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how it shapes up:</TE>
<TE>   * Olowokandi, Clippers -- They still think they can sign him. Of
course, what do they ever know?</TE>
<TE>   Futile negotiations hardly increased their chances, nor would a
disappointing season. Last summer, they were bidding against
themselves and Olowokandi was so eager to stay, he completely forgot
about that misunderstanding, in which they fined him a whopping
$50,000 for popping off.</TE>
<TE>   By next summer, a disappointed Olowokandi will have expressed his
skepticism about Donald T. Sterling a bunch of times, which will make
Sterling even less willing to come up with the money.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, as far as the Clippers are considered, we're
talking big longshot.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone else understands that, as the only athletic young
7-footer on the horizon, he's next summer's No. 1 free agent. The
Clippers can't go anywhere without some opposing coach, such as
Miami's Pat Riley or Denver's Jeff Bzdelik, drooling all over
Olowokandi, stopping just this side of tampering.</TE>
<TE>   Last week in Denver, the press corps lined up to find out if
Olowokandi would deign to play for $100 million in a burg as small
(not to mention a hole as deep). Graciously, he noted, "I don't know
if Denver is your typical Middle America. It's cosmopolitan. I've
been downtown a couple times. I used to come here when I was in
college. There is a lot more here going on."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, such as losing basketball games. Of course, he'll have a lot
more suitors (see below).</TE>
<TE>   * Tim Duncan, San Antonio -- When he decided not to go to Orlando
in 2000, he got an opt-out, just in case. However, speculation that
he'd leave lessened last season, when Tony Parker arrived out of the
blue and started an unforeseen youth movement.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs will be $15 million under the cap when David Robinson
retires, so San Antonio, not Denver, is considered the favored hamlet
in the race for Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   * Jason Kidd, New Jersey -- Still refuses to say he'll stay. He's
thinking about joining his friend, Duncan. The Spurs will do whatever
Duncan says, but as long as Shaq is around, they need two 7-footers,
not one.</TE>
<TE>   A lot depends on how the Nets do, but they're struggling to
realize their preseason hype, while Kidd's strong-willed wife,
Joumana, makes no secret of the fact that her opinion will count.
This one is up in the air.</TE>
<TE>   * Gary Payton, Seattle -- SuperSonic owner Howard Schultz, the
Starbucks magnate, schmoozed Kidd personally while pointedly refusing
to extend Payton's contract, infuriating Payton, who is pals with
Kidd. Nevertheless, if Kidd stays in Jersey, Payton may have a hard
time finding a better situation.</TE>
<TE>   * Jerry Stackhouse, Washington -- The Pistons didn't think he was
a max player but the Wizards, having acquired him, have committed
themselves to paying him.</TE>
<TE>   * Jermaine O'Neal, Indiana -- Team President Donnie Walsh, who
braved storms for breaking up the old 2000 finalists, turned them
into today's young comers. Happily for them, O'Neal likes that
they've re-signed Ron Artest, Jonathan Bender and Al Harrington, and
sounds as if he intends to stay.</TE>
<TE>   * Brad Miller, Indiana -- Underrated, solid big man who turned
Pacers from marginal to full size. A country type from Purdue, he's
also expected to command a big price, and to stay.</TE>
<TE>   * Reggie Miller, Indiana -- Unhappily for the Pacers, they have
only $16 million in annual salary to distribute without triggering
the luxury tax. Reggie, the pride of Riverside and Westwood, likes
Indy so much, he doesn't even come back here summers. Walsh insists
he can work it out and keep everyone.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   Rebuilding, it's not as much fun as it looks (cont.): Exasperated
Bull Coach Bill Cartwright is quick-hooking his big kids, Eddy Curry
and Tyson Chandler. Meanwhile, 6-7 rookie Lonny Baxter, a No. 2 pick
with less stature but lots more fight, continues to get time. Said
Curry, showing that at least one of the kids doesn't get it: "It
looks to me like we get the first two or three minutes of the game
and, depending on how we're playing, that determines our whole night.
You have two minutes to get warm, work out your pregame jitters and
really get to playing. I'm just confused. I don't know what's going
on."</TE>
<TE>   Comebacks, they're not as fun as they look, either: Michael
Jordan, showing the strain of trying to carry the mediocre Wizards,
finally said he was 100% certain he won't be back next season. Jordan
is also junking Coach Doug Collins' plan to limit his minutes and
save him. Said Jordan, after the Wizards became the first team to
lose to Memphis: "There's no reason to save it for next year."</TE>
<TE>   The Jail Blazers' last ride: After years of embarrassments and
supposed reformations, the program is in flames after the arrests of
Damon Stoudamire and Rasheed Wallace on misdemeanor drug charges, and
Ruben Patterson for spousal abuse. General Manager Bob Whitsitt, who
brought in the Wild Bunch, says he's done gambling on character.
Coach Mo Cheeks said, "I'm not necessarily equipped to handle this."
... Not that these guys are cavalier about the law but Stoudamire,
who just beat a felony marijuana charge, asserting an illegal search,
and Wallace were arrested for smoking in Damon's yellow Humvee, which
a friend was driving late at night, at 84 mph, on I-5 from Seattle
back to Portland.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey's Kenyon Martin on reminiscences by the Timberwolves'
Kendall Gill about helping to rebuild the Nets: "Why? Because he
left?" ... Never mind: Before his new team began struggling, and his
old team, the 76ers, turned into one of the surprises of the young
season, New Jersey's Dikembe Mutombo said the difference was "the
enthusiasm we've got on this team," adding, "There's no player who
has come in saying that, 'Hey guys, you've got to make sure I score
20.' " ... Said Mutombo's old coach, Larry Brown: "I love the guy,
but he has brain damage."</TE>
<TE>   Riley, whose Heat will be about $8 million under the salary cap
next summer: "It started with Alonzo [Mourning] and ended with him.
That's why we're starting again. We need to get the anchor.... I
can't be it. I'm a good leader but we need to get a player, an
anchor, and create a hope again with the people because a lot of our
fans have probably lost hope." A lot of their fans lost hope years
ago, a trend confirmed by attendance figures.</TE>
<TE>   Bull forward and University of Cincinnati alumnus Corie Blount, on
college basketball: "Everybody keeps saying, 'Well, you're getting an
education.' But a lot of people who play sports aren't going there
for an education. They're getting recruited to play basketball."</TE>

<LD>MARK HEISLER'S NBA RANKINGS AND COMMENTS:</LD>
<LD>   GAME OF THE WEEK</LD>
<LD>   DALLAS AT LAKERS</LD>
<TE>*--*
Rank  Team (record)         Comment (last week's position)
1     DALLAS  (15-1)        Zone with Bradley guarding hoop takes
                            Mavericks from No. 28 to 11 on defense.
                            (1)
2     SACRAMENTO  (13-5)    Barbaric but deep: Without Bibby, Kings
                            still have six guys averaging 9.7 or
                            more. (2)
3     INDIANA  (13-2)       Reggie waits until nine-game winning
                            streak ends to return and helps start new
                            one. (6)
4     PHILADELPHIA  (14-4)  Despite talk about others in East,
                            Cavaliers' Lucas calls 76ers best he has
                            seen. (8)
5     DETROIT  (12-5)       East still East: After losing by 39 in
                            Dallas, Pistons lose to Mavericks at home
                            by 20. (4)
6     SAN ANTONIO  (11-7)   Duncan, who averaged 25-13 as MVP last
                            season, only at 21-12 in this one. (3)
7     NEW JERSEY  (11-6)    Better rethink trade: Lost in offense,
                            Mutombo plays only 25 minutes a game. (5)
8     NEW ORLEANS  (11-5)   Not like getting Shaq back, but Elden's
                            return makes Hornets big and deep again.
                            (7)
9     HOUSTON  (9-6)        Yao Ming back to being a rookie, gets 34
                            in four games after 76 in previous four.
                            (10)
10    UTAH  (9-8)           Mailman's helper: Matt Harpring breaks
                            out, averaging 20 as Jazz goes 5-0. (15)
11    SEATTLE  (9-8)        Old story for perimeter teams, when the
                            three-pointers stop dropping, you drop.
                            (11)
12    BOSTON  (10-5)        Thanks: While sale pends, Gaston has
                            organization on shoestring budget. (9)
13    LAKERS  (6-11)        On the bright side, they're only three
                            games out of last playoff slot. (12)
14    MINNESOTA  (9-8)      It's already a struggle: At this point
                            last season, Timberwolves were 12-5. (13)
15    PHOENIX  (8-7)        Imagine that: Tired of passing, Marbury
                            has to be himself, drops 43 on Spurs.
                            (14)
16    ORLANDO  (10-7)       Rivers trots out Magic's preferred
                            lineup: McGrady, Mike Miller and Grant.
                            (19)
17    PORTLAND  (7-8)       Trail Blazers are paying $105 million for
                            this? Beginning of end for the Wild
                            Bunch. (16)
18    CLIPPERS  (6-11)      Too good to fall apart, too distracted to
                            hang together when things get tough. (22)
19    MILWAUKEE  (8-8)      No Allen, U.S. players rip Karl for Indy
                            debacle. Friends better watch George.
                            (18)
20    ATLANTA  (8-9)        RIP: New arena, rebuilt team, just drew
                            three crowds in a row under 8,000. (17)
21    TORONTO  (5-10)       1-1 with Carter. At least he's not on
                            stage at concerts as Raptors lose on road
                            now.(21)
22    WASHINGTON  (6-10)    On the other hand, what did Wizards have

<LD>The cushion that the UCLA men's soccer team built was so soft that
Cal nearly bounced back. But after dominating the first half, the
Bruins hung on tight for a 3-2 victory over the Golden Bears in a
third-round NCAA tournament game Saturday night in front of 1,036 at
Drake Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   With the victory, the Bruins (15-3-3) advance to the playoffs'
quarterfinals for the 16th time. UCLA will play host Saturday to the
winner of a third-round game today between Penn State (15-7-0) and
William &amp; Mary (15-7-1). Junior forward Cliff McKinley had a goal and
an assist as the Bruins seized control early and then withstood a Cal
comeback in the last nine minutes.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins' Aaron Lopez scored first, converting from 15 yards
after an assist from McKinley, who had taken a tap off Jimmy
Frazelle's free kick in the 20th minute.</LD>
<TE>   McKinley gave UCLA a 2-0 lead when he converted his sixth goal, a
35-yard shot from the right side after taking a ball from Frazelle,
in the 28th minute. Matt Taylor's seventh goal of the season in the
51st minute assured the Bruins they would get the better of the
Golden Bears, despite goals in the 81st and 82nd minutes by Carl
Acosta of Cal (14-6-2).</TE>

<LD>**** Makings of a classic</LD>
<LD>   *** Smash-mouth football</LD>
<LD>   ** Good for an end around</LD>
<TE>   * Strictly fantasy fodder</TE>
<TE>   ** Miami (7-4) at Buffalo (5-6), 10 a.m., KNX (1070): The last
time Ray Lucas played the Bills, he completed only 13 of 33 passes,
threw four interceptions and lost two fumbles, calling it "the worst
game in history." No argument here. LINE: Miami by 2  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Chicago (3-8) at Green Bay (8-3), 10 a.m., Channel 11: Brian
Urlacher had better be alert this week. There's no telling if Packer
Coach Mike Sherman is ready to take his postgame confrontations to
the next level. LINE: Green Bay by 9  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Tennessee (6-5) at New York Giants (6-5), 10 a.m.: Running back
Tiki Barber says, "It's not quite desperate, but it's as close to
desperate as you can get." He was talking about the playoff race, not
the prospect of watching this on TV. LINE: New York by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Arizona (4-7) at Kansas City (5-6), 10 a.m.: Cardinal Coach
Dave McGinnis says, "Losing five in a row, it makes me sick." We'd
hate to see the kind of shape he'd be in if he were Dick LeBeau.
LINE: Kansas City by 9  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore (5-6) at Cincinnati (1-10), 10 a.m.: Bengals have
amassed more than 350 yards of offense in five consecutive games. The
last time they had such a streak was 1988 ... the year they went to
the Super Bowl. LINE: Baltimore by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Carolina (3-8) at Cleveland (6-5), 10 a.m.: We'll see if these
Browns are more focused than last year's. In 2001, Cleveland was 6-5,
but closed with a 1-4 record to miss the playoffs. LINE: Cleveland by
8.</TE>
<TE>   *** Pittsburgh (6-4-1) at Jacksonville (5-6), 10 a.m.: Not that
you'd want to rush Tommy Maddox back from a serious injury, but
Kordell Stewart usually doesn't play well against the Jaguars, having
thrown 10 interceptions for a 68.8 passer rating. LINE: Pittsburgh by
3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Atlanta (7-3-1) at Minnesota (3-8), 10 a.m.: Last time the
Falcons went to the Metrodome, they upset the Vikings and made it to
the Super Bowl. But this is the same underachieving Viking team that
defeated visiting Green Bay two weeks ago. LINE: Atlanta by 3  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Houston (3-8) at Indianapolis (7-4), 1 p.m.: The week after
each of their last two victories, the Texans suffered their two worst
losses. The suddenly hot Colts are trying their hardest to ignore
this fact. LINE: Indianapolis by 11  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   **** Denver (7-4) at San Diego (7-4), 1 p.m., Channel 2: This AFC
West December clash might turn out to be an elimination game between
two of the three division teams with the same records and
realistically still in line for the playoffs. LINE: Denver by 3.</TE>
<TE>   *** St. Louis (5-6) at Philadelphia (8-3), 1:15 p.m., Channel 11,
KNX (1070): Eagles turn to No. 3 QB A.J. Feeley, who quickly inspires
confidence by saying, "I'm not going to do anything out of the
ordinary for me." Is that why he's a No. 3? LINE: St. Louis by 2
1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Seattle (4-7) at San Francisco (7-4), 1:15 p.m.: Seahawk John
Randle declares the team is way past Sharpie-gate, saying players
don't want to "lose track of what we're trying to do here." At 4-7,
it seems they already have. LINE: San Francisco by 9.</TE>
<TE>   **** Tampa Bay (9-2) at New Orleans (7-4), 5:30 p.m., ESPN,
KLSX-FM (97.1): Buccaneers can start putting away their two NFC South
division foes and inching closer to earning home-field advantage
throughout the playoffs. Next week, it's Atlanta. LINE: Pick.</TE>
<TE>   *** New York Jets (6-5) at Oakland (7-4), Monday, 6 p.m., Channel
7, KNX (1070): Raiders exacted playoff revenge on the Patriots
recently and now it's time for the Jets to get their crack at the
team that sent them packing from the playoffs less than a year ago.
LINE: Oakland by 6.</TE>

<LD>It is December in the NFL. Goosebump time. Chills down the spine.
Snow banks in New England, tundra in Green Bay, frozen mud in
Cleveland, surfers in wetsuits on the waves near San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   It is the time of the season when the only way to keep warm is to
keep changing one's mind. And from the first of September to the
first of December, during one of the most illogical and unpredictable
NFL seasons on record, the new kindling just keeps coming.</LD>
<LD>   What we thought we knew then, what we think we know now....</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 1: They claim they're the reigning Super Bowl champions.
Nobody's buying it.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 1: They are underdogs in their first three games and they win
them all. Finally, the bookmakers believe -- they favor the Patriots
over the Chargers in Week 4. Chargers 21, Patriots 14.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 1: They are 0-4 since opening the season 3-0. Knew it all
along.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 1: They are 7-5 after winning four of their last five, but
they close the season against Buffalo, Tennessee, the Jets and Miami.
Don't know what to think.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ST. LOUIS RAMS</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 1: Couldn't win an exhibition game. But everyone knows
exhibition games are meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 1: Couldn't win a game in September. Maybe the exhibition
season was trying to tell us something.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 1: Couldn't win until injuries to Kurt Warner and Jamie
Martin forced Mike Martz to turn it over to Marc Bulger. You know,
Bulger looked pretty decent during the exhibition season.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 1: Couldn't beat Washington in the game they had to win. Now
waiting for next exhibition season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OAKLAND RAIDERS</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 1: Too old. Washed up. Over the hill.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 1: An unstoppable offensive force. The best team in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 1: Too old. Washed up. Over the hill.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 1: An unstoppable offensive force. The best team in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SAN DIEGO CHARGERS</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 1: They lost their last nine games of 2001. They just hired
out-of-touch retread Marty Schottenheimer. They can't sign top draft
pick Quentin Jammer. If this is the future of professional football
in Los Angeles, thanks, but no thanks.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 1: They're on the move. They're 4-0. Schottenheimer -- kind
of reminds of Chuck Knox, circa 1973, wouldn't you say?</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 1: They're 6-1 after back-to-back victories over Kansas City
and Oakland. Drew Brees -- does that sound like an El Lay kind of
quarterback or what?</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 1: They've lost three of last four, two by 28 points or more.
They might have lost all four had the 49ers cut kicker Jose Cortez
sooner. Are the Colts still available?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ATLANTA FALCONS</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 1: Could finish last in the NFL's worst division.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 1: Two losses in three games by a total of four points. Same
old Falcons.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 1: That Michael Vick is something. Too bad he doesn't have
much around him.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 1: On a 6-0-1 streak. Taking on the 3-8 Vikings today. The
Super Bowl? Why not?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STEVE SPURRIER</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 1: "Shane Matthews is my guy!"</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 1: "Patrick Ramsey is my guy!"</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 1: "Shane Matthews is my guy!"</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 1: "Danny Wuerffel is my guy!"</TE>
<TE>   (Special sneak preview: Jan 1: "The first quarterback we can sign
or draft is my guy!")</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EMMITT SMITH</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 1: Needs 540 yards to break Walter Payton's rushing record.
In the old days, Emmitt would have that many by Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 1: Emmitt has 236 yards, averaging 59 a game. At this rate,
he'll barely get record by Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 1: Emmitt has his record, courtesy of 109 yards against
Seattle's league-worst rushing defense. Now Troy Hambrick wants his.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 1: Emmitt coming off 144-yard performance against Washington.
Cowboys coming off back-to-back victories for the first time in 2002.
This could be the start of a beautiful relationship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DREW BLEDSOE</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 1: What were the Bills thinking, trading a first-round draft
choice for him?</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 1: What were the Bears, Bengals and Redskins thinking, not
wanting to trade a first-round draft choice for him?</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 1: What were the Patriots thinking, trading him and keeping
the wrong quarterback?</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 1: What do you think about getting Bledsoe a defense some
time before next September?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TOMMY MADDOX</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 1: Good to see him drawing a payback after that whole XFL
thing.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 1: Good to see him starting, having seen enough of Kordell
Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 1: Good to see a good guy making good with a second chance.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 1: Good to see him out of the hospital and standing upright
again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JAY FIEDLER</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 1: He's no Dan Marino. Too bad the Dolphins couldn't lure
Troy Aikman out of retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 1: He's holding it together, but he's only as good as his
defense.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 1: He broke his thumb and backup Ray Lucas just threw four
interceptions in his first replacement start. But, could be just a

<HD>Oklahoma Again Feels Pain of Loss</HD>
<DH>Oklahoma State upsets Sooners for second year in a row,
38-28.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>STILLWATER, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Rashaun Woods and Josh Fields did it to Oklahoma again.</LD>
<LD>   One year after ruining the Sooners' postseason plans with a late
touchdown at Norman, Fields and Woods connected for three touchdowns
as Oklahoma State upset No. 3 Oklahoma, 38-28, on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Woods had 12 catches for a school-record 226 yards, and Fields
completed 18 of 27 passes for 357 yards and four touchdowns against
the nation's ninth-ranked defense.</LD>
<TE>   "We played our best opponent; we played our best football," Cowboy
Coach Les Miles said. "Considering all of our big wins this year,
this was undoubtedly our best one."</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys, 7-5 overall and 5-3 in the Big 12 Conference, beat
Nebraska and Oklahoma in the same season for the first time. As the
last seconds ticked off the clock, orange-clad Oklahoma State
students and fans ran onto the field and tore down the goal posts.</TE>
<TE>   In beating the Sooners for the fifth time in eight years, Oklahoma
State enhanced its chances of going to its first bowl game since
1997. The Cowboys also never let Oklahoma take the lead, something no
team had done against Bob Stoops in his first 49 games as Oklahoma's
coach.</TE>
<TE>   "We just wanted to prove that last year wasn't a fluke," said
tight end Billy Bajema, who had a 58-yard catch on a second-quarter
scoring drive. "It will improve our bowl destination, but that's not
what we were thinking coming in. Playing Oklahoma was enough
motivation."</TE>
<TE>   Last year's 16-13 stunner by Oklahoma State cost Oklahoma a trip
to the Big 12 title game, where a victory would have sent the Sooners
to the national title game. Oklahoma (10-2, 6-2) came into this game
with the South Division title sewn up, but the Sooners have no shot
of playing for a national title.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no excuses," Stoops said. "They did an excellent job
all around -- their coaches and players -- and just beat us."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma, which will play No. 13 Colorado for the Big 12 title
next week in Houston, had no answer for Woods.</TE>
<TE>   He caught touchdown passes of 41, 60 and 13 yards in the first
half and had three catches on the Cowboys' first drive of the third
quarter, when they took a 35-6 lead. Woods then had two more
receptions on a clinching fourth-quarter drive that led to a field
goal and a 38-21 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We are on the rise," Woods said. "It's obvious now that we are a
program on the rise."</TE>

<LD>I'm not sure which Times columnist will suggest it this week, but I
would imagine by week's end one of them will contend the Trojans will
be getting a raw deal if they're not allowed to play in this season's
Super Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   USC has finished the regular season 10-2 after demonstrating what
the oddsmakers and most football fans pretty much knew -- the
Fighting Irish were frauds at 10-1 coming into Saturday's hyped
confrontation in the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   Good for the Trojans, congratulations and now will somebody please
tell the USC marching band to stop playing that annoying ditty.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WITH A week to go before the final BCS standings are released,
it's going to be up to the analysts to pass the time, and if last
week's newspaper and radio gush-a-thon is any indication of what to
expect, I worry now just how far our homers will go.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Trojans tangled with Notre Dame, the argument was
already being made on the radio that USC with its two losses should
be playing in the national championship game in place of undefeated
Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Now you know me, I don't like to mention names or point the finger
at someone for being so far off base ... although this might be a
good time to recommend to Christmas shoppers that they purchase Bill
Plaschke's new book, which is a fine collection of his touching
columns with all proceeds benefiting charity -- especially if it will
put you in a bookstore and out of earshot of anything outlandish the
USC homer might say on the radio while subbing for Jim Rome.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was another sports columnist for this newspaper who
suggested last week scrapping the rules entirely and placing the
Trojans in the Rose Bowl if they defeated the Irish, although
Washington State beat USC and is currently in position to represent
the Pacific 10 Conference in the game. I wouldn't even expect such a
suggestion from someone writing for the Daily Trojan.</TE>
<TE>   Now you know me, I don't like to mention names or point fingers --
and I know it's newspaper law a columnist is entitled to write
whatever she thinks, no matter how silly -- but it was also suggested
in the same column that USC wouldn't be out of place in the Fiesta
Bowl against Miami, apparently leaping over Ohio State, Iowa, Georgia
and, at the time, Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Hello, is anybody home? Or is that what this is all about --
telling the locals just what they want to hear even though it defies
common sense? Maybe it's all about receiving love letters from Trojan
fans. I'm sorry, I wouldn't know anything about that.</TE>
<TE>   A strong finish might mean something if you are a wild-card team
in baseball or football, but without a playoff system in college
football, to suggest anything different than Ohio State playing an
undefeated Miami in the Fiesta Bowl is just home-town cheerleading.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IN FACT, if I were a Trojan fan I'd be upset with the columnists
now who are going to spend the next week pushing for Sugar or Orange
Bowl consideration. The columnists will be outraged, of course, like
most Trojan fans, because Notre Dame might get more favorable Orange
Bowl consideration than USC, even after losing to the Trojans. I
guess they have homers working on their behalf, too.</TE>
<TE>   But why not let Notre Dame play in Florida, and then hop in the
car and make the Holiday Bowl drive to San Diego for another Trojan
tailgating opportunity? Why send the Trojans to the other side of the
country when the faithful can join them for a fun-filled finish to
the season just down the road?</TE>
<TE>   The only differences between the Orange, Sugar and Holiday bowls
are prestige and the financial payoff to the Pac-10, which both UCLA
and USC will share along with everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   Does prestige -- playing in Miami or New Orleans in a BCS game --
mean something more than filling Qualcomm Stadium with Trojan spirit
a few days earlier for the Holiday Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   Do you really care what the split between Pac-10 teams is after
the Sugar, Orange and Holiday bowls have divvied up the loot? A
rematch with Kansas State in the Holiday Bowl might really prove how
much progress the Trojans have made this season. A game against Texas
or Oklahoma in San Diego, as I understand it, is also possible and
offers just as much challenge and excitement.</TE>
<TE>   At the risk of being accused of being a homer, USC might even beat
those teams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE MOVE locally now will be to not only give the Heisman Trophy
to Carson Palmer, but immediately induct him into the Pro Football
Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   There is no question Palmer has improved as the season has
continued, with Coach Pete Carroll and offensive whiz Norm Chow
giving him every opportunity to pile up the stats down the stretch,
and the prediction here is he wins a trip to New York for the Heisman
ceremonies and finishes fifth behind Miami's Ken Dorsey, Penn State
running back Larry Johnson, Iowa quarterback Brad Banks and Miami
running back Willis McGahee.</TE>
<TE>   There's no telling how many Heisman votes Palmer lost because
voters turned off Saturday's game early, tired of hearing that
annoying song over and over.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Grandpa Dave:</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth, I'm not fond of your column, but you got
my full attention because you wrote something nice about my alma
mater and that special grandson of mine, Lyle, the tuba player. Now
if you could persuade Lyle to give up thoughts of becoming a Bear or
Bruin, or heaven forbid, a Fighting Irish and become a staunch
Trojan, I might become a faithful reader."</TE>
<TE>   By the looks of it, Notre Dame needs Lyle more than I need you.</TE>

<HD>Everybody's a Winner at Skins Game</HD>
<DH>Changes are validated when Mickelson wins $100,000 on one
hole, and Couples breaks through on No. 9.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>INDIO</DL>
<LD>Some critics can argue that at the age of 20, the Skins Game is
simply another televised golf show drifting aimlessly in a sea of
off-season events that now number nearly a dozen.</LD>
<LD>   Or that there's nothing quite like watching four privileged guys
who have won a combined $81 million on the PGA Tour trying to divide
a paltry $1 million.</LD>
<LD>   Or that they're all wearing microphones to showcase sparkling
personalities and the funniest thing that happens is when a
representative from Toyota has to hand over the keys to one of his
company's new cars to a guy wearing a shirt with a Ford logo on the
front.</LD>
<TE>   Now, that was hilarious. Anyway, the Skins Game may have reached a
milestone birthday Saturday when the first nine holes were played at
Landmark Golf Club, but the way things turned out, it may never have
been closer to what it was supposed to be when they drew it up the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 11 birdies got racked up, Tiger Woods hit a 340-yard
drive on the seventh hole and everybody won money, which did wonders
for peoples' dispositions, especially Phil Mickelson's.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't say a word the first seven holes, then he wins one and
he wore everybody out," Couples said of Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   So Couples immediately pinned a new nickname on Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   "Chirpy," Couples said.</TE>
<TE>   With nine more holes to play today, the accounting shows that
Mickelson won $100,000, Woods and Mark O'Meara won $75,000, and
Couples won $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, you would have to say that the Skins Game got a facial
and looked pretty good again.</TE>
<TE>   Let's start with the money. As far as the dough, it was a lot more
interesting result than last year's first day, when nobody won
anything. The reason for that was the validation rule that meant a
player who won a skin didn't really win it unless he won the next
hole or tied for the low score on the next hole.</TE>
<TE>   The validation rule was a disaster and discarded for this year,
basically because Woods didn't like it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody understood what was going on," Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Meara started the cash flow at the par-three third, when he hit
a seven-iron to two feet and made the putt for a birdie, a carry-over
worth $75,000. Woods took his turn next on the par-three fifth. Woods
knocked a four-iron 10 feet from the hole, rolled in the putt for
$50,000 and added a birdie at the par-five sixth hole for another
$25,000.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the holes doubled in value to $50,000 and Mickelson
collected two skins at the par-three eighth. Mickelson hit an
eight-iron to four feet and made the putt to win the hole. Woods had
a chance, putting first, but his 25-footer brushed past the hole.</TE>
<TE>   And because he was closest to the hole, Ford-endorser Mickelson
won a Toyota Avalon, which he will donate to charity.</TE>
<TE>   Couples, who endorses Cadillac, was shut out at that point and
reflected on that at the ninth tee.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought there would be an eagle out there," he said. "I
certainly didn't think it would be me."</TE>
<TE>   He was wrong. His second shot on the 507-yard par-five was a
five-iron from 192 yards out of the left rough and Couples stopped
the ball just five feet from the hole. When his putt went in, it was
worth $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Skins Game is no longer all about money, with the possible
exception of those who collect it, so it must be noted that Couples'
Skins Game total is now a record $2.15 million.</TE>
<TE>   More important numbers will be the Nielsen ratings that come out
next week. Last year, ABC's two-day ratings of 4.3 were 72% higher
than the all-time low of 2.5 from 2000 -- and the highest since a 4.9
in 1997 when Woods made his debut.</TE>
<TE>   It would be safe to say that something in the 4s would make IMG,
the people who produce the Skins Game, happy again.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Puts Out a Champion's Effort</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Georgia will play for the Southeastern Conference championship next
weekend. And who knows, the Bulldogs might just get a shot at the
biggest game of all.</LD>
<LD>   The fifth-ranked Bulldogs sure played like champions Saturday,
building a big halftime lead against Georgia Tech and cruising to a
51-7 victory at Athens, Ga. -- Georgia's most lopsided win in the
series, which began in 1893. The Bulldogs won 47-8 in 1968.</LD>
<LD>   While blowing out the Yellow Jackets, Georgia (11-1) learned that
No. 3 Oklahoma had lost to Oklahoma State, 38-28, eliminating another
Fiesta Bowl contender.</LD>
<TE>   Now, the Bulldogs must hope No. 1 Miami loses to Virginia Tech
next Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be rooting for the Hokies, that's for sure," quarterback
David Greene said. "But we've got to take care of our business or it
doesn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   For Georgia, the next order of business is the SEC championship
game against Arkansas. The Bulldogs will be trying to win their first
conference title since 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know we haven't won a championship in 20 years," said
Coach Mark Richt, whose team ensured its first 11-win season since
1982. "That's enough motivation right there."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia can expect to move up to third place when the new bowl
championship series standings are released Monday. No. 2 Ohio State
already has completed a perfect regular season, but the other spot
could be wide open if Virginia Tech upsets the Hurricanes at the
Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "We all hope to have a shot at playing for the national
championship," Richt said. "The only way we can have a shot is to win
next week. But it's certainly in the back of our mind. We know
there's a chance we can go to the Fiesta Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech (7-5), which trailed, 34-0, at halftime, doesn't have
to worry about such lofty goals after enduring its worst defeat since
a 49-3 rout by Florida State in 1996. The Yellow Jackets are eligible
for their sixth straight bowl appearance, but they'll probably have
to settle for a return trip to the Seattle Bowl.</TE>

<HD>Gloger Steps Up for Irvine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Irvine freshman point guard Jeff Gloger learned he would get his
first start during practice earlier in the week. While the
inexperience of only three collegiate games showed at times, Gloger
played like a seasoned veteran when the Anteaters needed him Saturday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Gloger scored all 11 of his points in the second half to help
Irvine to a 74-69 victory over a short-handed Pepperdine squad in
front of 1,866 at Firestone Fieldhouse.</LD>
<LD>   The Anteaters (1-2) got their first win by relying on their
youngsters down the stretch. Freshman guard Mike Efevberha had a key
tip-in and two free throws in the last 2:05 and Gloger's layup with
54 seconds left gave Irvine a 70-66 lead.</LD>
<TE>   "I was certainly nervous at first," Gloger said. "As the game went
on, my nerves went away and I got into the flow of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Reserves Matt Okoro and Greg Ethington combined for 12 points and
13 rebounds against a Pepperdine squad still reeling from the loss of
Will Kimble, its junior center who fainted in practice on Tuesday.
Kimble may not play again after being diagnosed with hypertropic
cardiomyopathy or excessive thickening of the heart muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Without the 6-foot-10 Kimble, their only true inside presence, and
injured 6-9 forward Glen McGowan, the Waves were forced to play 6-7
forward Boomer Brazzle out of position. Irvine got 12 of its 16
second-half field goals inside of five feet.</TE>
<TE>   "They got everything they needed inside in the last six to eight
minutes," Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal said.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves (0-2) were led by Jimmy Miggins, who had 17 points but
made only five of 13 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an obvious inside advantage, Irvine's big men didn't play
big. Center Adam Parada was in foul trouble all night and finished
with nine points in 18 minutes. Starting forward Stanislav Zuzak went
scoreless in 14 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Anteaters managed to lead most of the game on the strength of
Mike Hood's outside shooting and Efevberha's offensive play off the
bench. Hood led the Anteaters with 17 points and Efevberha had 12.</TE>

<TE>   San Diego 84, UC Riverside 64 -- Jason Keep and Jason Blair each

game.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Nate Carter scored 16 points for Riverside (0-2).</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara 70, San Francisco 47 -- Branduinn Fullove scored
19 points and Nick Jones had 16 and 10 rebounds for the Gauchos (2-2)
in a victory at Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos held the Dons (0-3) to under 30% shooting in each half
and never trailed.</TE>

<HD>Pauley Court to Be Named for Wooden</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>On the flight to the Wooden Tradition, UCLA officials decided to move
ahead with naming their home floor "John Wooden Court at Pauley
Pavilion," to honor the coach who led the Bruins to 10 national
championships in the 1960s and '70s.</LD>
<LD>   The idea has been discussed for several years, but administrators
believe there is no reason to wait any longer.</LD>
<LD>   Wooden, 92, attends most home games. On Saturday, he was at
Conseco Fieldhouse to award trophies to Duke and Purdue for their
victories.</LD>
<TE>   However, he would not comment on the performance of UCLA, which
was defeated by Duke, 84-73.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to give advice," Wooden said. "That would make me
sound critical, and I'm not going to be critical."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   T.J. Cummings and Ray Young were late to the same team meeting
Friday night, but for different reasons. Coach Steve Lavin benched
them for the first eight minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Young said he set the clock in his hotel room to Central rather
than Eastern time.</TE>
<TE>   "I was an hour off," he said. "I nodded off after dinner and woke
up late. I let my team down and I feel horrible."</TE>
<TE>   Cummings said he was late because he took too long in the
bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UP NEXT</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 8 vs. Long Beach State (1-1), 1 p.m. -- This game is the
beginning of what appeared to be the breather portion of the Bruin
schedule -- home games against the 49ers, Portland and Northern
Arizona. However, UCLA (0-2) has not proved it can beat anyone.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Junior forward Jerry Dupree, who is nursing a sore right heel while
serving a six-game suspension, came off his crutches earlier than
expected last week and is aiming to begin practicing with the Trojans
at the semester break, which starts Dec. 18.</LD>
<LD>   "My foot feels a lot better, so I've just been walking around on
it, putting more pressure on it," said Dupree, who was diagnosed with
a deep bruise. "There was so much swelling around the bone, I'm just
glad it wasn't a stress fracture. I'm getting ready for my comeback."</LD>
<LD>   Trojan Coach Henry Bibby suspended Dupree in an effort to help him
concentrate on his academics and said that the suspension could be
reduced if Dupree made enough progress off the court.</LD>
<TE>   Dupree insists his grades have improved.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's a health issue," he said. "My school work is excellent,
no worries there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore starters Errick Craven and Rory O'Neil played the
unusual role of spectators Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby suspended them for one game for violating an unspecified
team rule, though all parties involved agreed it was minor. They
might play Tuesday at UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a mistake and we've got to pay the consequences," O'Neil
said with a smile. "But I can guarantee it won't happen again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bibby and USC senior associate athletic director Daryl Gross will
meet Monday to discuss the Rhode Island loss.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby thinks a technical foul should have been called after Rhode
Island players, cheerleaders and fans stormed the court with 2.2
seconds remaining in the Rams' 73-71 overtime victory Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UP NEXT</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday at UC Santa Barbara (2-2), 7 p.m. -- USC (2-1) has never
lost to the Big West Conference favorite Gauchos, going 11-0, the

two games at the Thunderdome by a combined eight points.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Get Back on Track</HD>
<DH>USC rebounds from its controversial loss at Rhode Island
with a 39-point defeat of overmatched Morris Brown. Six players score
in double figures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They didn't need to go to the videotape this time.</LD>
<LD>   Four days after losing a disputed game at Rhode Island when
replays showed USC junior Desmon Farmer still holding the ball as
time expired before he made a three-point shot, the Trojans took out
their frustrations on outmanned Morris Brown on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   USC swamped the Wolverines early, limited them to 20 first-half
points and rode the momentum to an ego-soothing 93-54 win in front of
3,252 at the Sports Arena.</LD>
<TE>   And the Trojans did it without two starters -- sophomore shooting
guard Errick Craven and sophomore center Rory O'Neil -- who were
benched for the day by Coach Henry Bibby for violating an unspecified
team rule.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that [the Wolverines] weren't a top-program team and that
we'd probably win," said Farmer, who had a game-high 23 points with
seven rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "But it allowed people to show that they can step up like Coach
always talks about, whenever the opportunity comes up."</TE>
<TE>   Among those who took advantage of extra minutes were centers
Kostas Charissis and Jonathan Oliver.</TE>
<TE>   "Kostas stepped up and played like a 7-footer who weighs 260
pounds should play," Bibby said. "And Jonathan Oliver, that was the
best I've seen him play."</TE>
<TE>   Charissis, a senior who was slowed by a sore left ankle during
preseason workouts, got the start in O'Neil's absence and earned his
first career double-double with a career-high 10 points and a career
high-tying 10 rebounds in 22 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Oliver, a lithe 7-foot junior college transfer who has had a rough
time making the transition to the more physical Division I game, came
off the bench to get 19 points, on eight-for-nine shooting from the
field, seven rebounds and two blocks in 24 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a lot more comfortable in there," said Oliver, who was held
out of the Rhode Island game by Bibby because of the physical nature
of the contest.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach told me to wait for the game to come to me. It's going to
take a little more time than I expected, but he wants me to be more
aggressive out there, to be the guy no one likes on the court."</TE>
<TE>   USC (2-1) had six players score in double figures. Sophomore power
forward Nick Curtis also got his first double-double (13 points,
career-high 11 rebounds). Junior guard Roy Smiley, who took a nasty
fall in the second half but walked off the court under his own power,
finished with 12 points, and senior point guard Robert Hutchinson had
10 points.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Bibby was satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to work on certain things in our game," he said. "We had
holes in our press and we need to work on our free throws."</TE>
<TE>   USC converted 17 of 33 free-throw attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "But it was good to see different people play different
positions," Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   Morris Brown (1-3), an independent team from Atlanta in its second
season as a Division I program, was led by sophomore forward Akiem
Claborn's 11 points and nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolverines, though, shot a woeful 29% from the field, 6.7%
(one for 15) from three-point territory, and committed 24 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Morris Brown's woes helped the Trojans get their biggest margin of
victory since beating Northwestern, 85-44, on Dec. 29, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't really a competitive game but especially after the
Rhode Island loss, it feels good to get back on the 'W' side," said
Curtis, who also had career highs with three blocks and four steals.
"Plus it gives us confidence. We're a pretty confident team, but you
could always use a little more confidence."</TE>

exploded for the second straight game Saturday as the Bruins defeated
Northwestern State, 82-74, in the first game of the Lady Rebel
Shootout at Nevada Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Greco, a senior guard, was ably backed by freshman forward Julia
Pitts, who had 16 points and a game-high 11 rebounds. Freshman guard
Nikki Blue added 15 points and seven rebounds.</LD>
<LD>   The win improved UCLA to 2-1. Northwestern State, which got a
career-high 25 points from sophomore guard Diamond Crosby, fell to
1-1.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA, which never trailed, held the Demons without a field goal in
the final 6:43 of the first half and used a 19-3 run over that
stretch to take a 43-26 halftime lead. Bruin junior guard Gennifer

the spurt.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins reached their biggest lead, 51-28, at the 17:39 mark of

with 50 seconds remaining. But UCLA guard Natalie Nakase made four
free throws in the final half-minute to seal the win.</TE>

<LD>What do you call a final score of USC 44, Notre Dame 13?</LD>
<LD>   The luck of the Irish.</LD>
<LD>   It shouldn't have been that close.</LD>
<TE>   Statistically, this game was as lopsided as Shaq and Kobe on a
seesaw.</TE>
<TE>   The only reason Traveler didn't get a couple of furlongs' worth of
running was because the sidelines were too crowded to let him loose.
(And with all of those alums, recruits and boosters, I do mean
crowded. There haven't been that many people on the Coliseum floor
since the Olympic closing ceremonies in 1984.)</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame squeezed every last drop of milk from its bowl of Lucky
Charms and still couldn't make this a game. The Irish got a trifecta
of miscues from USC's special teams (missed field goal, fumble,
blocked punt), benefited from Carson Palmer's two worst passes of the
season, and the best they could come up with was this?</TE>
<TE>   44-13?</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go home and throw up," Notre Dame offensive tackle
Jordan Black said.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish, the seventh-ranked team in the Associated Press poll,
looked like frauds. Even worse, they resembled that Bob Davie-led
outfit that lost to Oregon State, 41-9, in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 1,
2001.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't what we had come to expect from the Irish under new
Coach Tyrone Willingham.</TE>
<TE>   "What we were hoping for was that at some point we'd hit stride
and get our offense flowing and take the pressure off our defense,"
Willingham said. "We were unable to do that."</TE>
<TE>   As offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick said, reminiscent of an old
Garry Shandling line, "I think it's a step back for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   You know it's bad when two Notre Dame writers are debating which
was worse: Notre Dame's four first downs -- total -- in the game, or
the fact that one play into fourth quarter the Irish had minus-one
yard of offense for the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame didn't score an offensive touchdown, but that's nothing
new. The Irish won their first two games without an offensive player
crossing the goal line. They got here with a stingy defense and a few
breaks.</TE>
<TE>   They got plenty of breaks Saturday, and even that wasn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame is the most storied program in college football, but
there's no amount of lore that can overcome a 501-yard difference in
total offense.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, quarterback Carlyle Holiday probably wasn't able to throw the
ball properly after injuring his thumb in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But USC was so dominant in scheme and execution, I'm not sure Joe
Montana at full strength would have moved the ball against the
Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't ever get anything untracked. We couldn't get anything
going," Diedrick said.</TE>
<TE>   It could have been worse.</TE>
<TE>   On USC's first drive, Palmer barely overthrew Mike Williams when
Williams had no one between him and the end zone. (The Trojans went
on to miss a field goal).</TE>
<TE>   Williams dropped another pass in the end zone in the second
quarter, and Palmer threw two end zone interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   When the high-powered USC offense comes away with only three
points instead of seven, it's a bonus for the other team.</TE>
<TE>   And when the Irish turn a fumbled USC kickoff return into a field
goal, and score a touchdown off a blocked Trojan punt, it looks like
another one of those lucky victories that makes people dislike Notre
Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, after the Trojans had outgained them, 358-94, and held
the ball for almost two-thirds of the first 30 minutes, the Irish had
a 13-10 lead with 1:07 left in the half</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we had momentum on our side," said inside linebacker
Carlos Pierre-Antoine, who blocked the punt and recovered the ball
for Notre Dame's go-ahead touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "If one side of the ball is struggling, the other side has to pick
it up. We find a way to win."</TE>
<TE>   Except this time, USC found it faster. Palmer moved the Trojans 75
yards in just over a minute, connecting with Williams on a 19-yard
touchdown pass to give the Trojans the lead again. Palmer was on his
way to a 425-yard passing game.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish might be on their way out of the bowl championship
series, if that thing has any validity left at all.</TE>
<TE>   "After the way we played, we don't deserve to play in the Orange
Bowl," Black said.</TE>
<TE>   USC, the hottest team in the country, deserves the best possible
bowl destination, be it Rose or Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Now they need outside help. That was the only thing the Trojans
didn't have in their favor Saturday. For 60 minutes, these 60
minutes, simply being the better team was enough.</TE>

<HD>Chargers Can Set Move to New City in Motion</HD>
<DH>Beginning today, they have 60 days to trigger escape clause
in stadium lease. L.A. may be in running.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>New stadium or bust.</LD>
<LD>   That's the unspoken credo of the San Diego Chargers, who in the
coming days could begin a process that will either get them new digs
in San Diego or a new city to call home -- possibly Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning today, the Chargers have 60 days to trigger an escape
clause in their Qualcomm Stadium lease, the first step toward
potential relocation. The clause can be activated if certain
financial conditions are met, and several sources say that will
happen.</LD>
<TE>   The Chargers' relationship with the San Diego community has become
increasingly strained in recent years, not only because the team has
fared poorly, but because of a controversial ticket guarantee. The
provision, agreed to in the afterglow of San Diego's only Super Bowl
appearance, promises the Chargers revenue equivalent to 60,000
general admission seats for every home game in the first 10 years of
the lease, signed in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of last season, the city had spent $25.3 million on
unsold tickets since 1997, almost offsetting the $28.9 million in
rent collected during that span. The San Diego Union-Tribune recently
reported the city has been billed for hundreds of nonexistent seats
per game, seats removed to comply with the Americans with
Disabilities Act.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an amazing situation," said George Mitrovich, president of
the City Club of San Diego, a non-partisan public forum. "The hard
truth is that if you look at the city's deal with the Chargers and
compare it to other cities' deals with their NFL teams, it's not so
bad. The real bone in the throat is the ticket guarantee."</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating matters, San Diego is hosting the Super Bowl
on Jan. 26, leading some people to believe the Chargers will wait
until a day after the game to activate their out clause.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers have informed San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy they are
willing to do away with the current lease -- ticket guarantee
included -- and sign a two-year deal to stay. That would clear the
way to put a new stadium and development of the Qualcomm site on the
November 2004 ballot. The caveat to that deal, though, is the city
can't throw up any legal roadblocks if the Chargers want to leave
after the 2004 season.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy, who declined to be interviewed for this story, has said
he's waiting for a report from the 15-member Citizens' Task Force on
Chargers Issues, a group formed by the City Council in July. That
report will be finished at earliest in mid-February -- after the
triggering period -- and so far things have not gone smoothly. Task
force members say the team is making their job harder by withholding
the new stadium proposal and crucial financial documents. The
Chargers say their proposal needs more fleshing out and opening their
books takes time.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, it's yet another vexing turn for a community that
seems more and more ambivalent about hanging onto its NFL franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "About 20% of the people here really want to keep the Chargers,
and another 20% would really like to see them go," said Ron Fowler,
chairman of the San Diego Super Bowl host committee. "The other 60%,
the silent majority, is on the fence about the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the Chargers activate their escape clause, assuming
they can, they are free to shop around for offers from other cities.
When the clause is triggered, the clock starts ticking on a 90-day
negotiating period between the Chargers and San Diego. But if plans
for a new stadium are not already in the pipeline, it's unlikely much
will be accomplished during that three-month span.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers have as long as 18 months after the negotiating
period to come back with an offer from another city -- although, in
theory, that offer could come immediately after the triggering event
-- and San Diego has 60 days to match.</TE>
<TE>   "Our basic position is we need to start talking soon," said Mark
Fabiani, the Chargers' point man on new stadium issues. "We need to
get rid of the things that irritate people here -- the trigger, the
ticket guarantee -- if there's going to be a realistic chance for
this city to keep the team.... By the spring, we'll have a pretty
good idea of what's possible and what's not possible."</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers already plan to move part of their operation to L.A.
Beginning in July, they will stage training camp at the Carson sports
complex being built by billionaire Philip Anschutz, a conspicuous
relocation considering the team's La Jolla-based camp has long been
the envy of the league. Charger officials say the move to Carson will
reduce distractions and help make the team more competitive.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL badly wants to have a team in the nation's second-largest
TV market, and L.A. has been without one since the Raiders and Rams
left after the 1994 season. It's not clear where a team would play,
however, considering neither the Rose Bowl nor the Coliseum is a
suitable long-term solution in its current state.</TE>
<TE>   At the quiet behest of league officials, consultant John Moag
hooked up with Rose Bowl officials in August and now is leading the
push to make that stadium NFL-ready. Moag, chairman of a Maryland
sports investment-banking firm, has experience with NFL relocations.
He paved the way for the Cleveland Browns to relocate to Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the Rose Bowl would need a complete renovation, which
would cost in the neighborhood of $400 million. Presumably, that
money would be generated from several sources, among them a
$150-million loan from the NFL -- via the relocating team -- and the
promise of multiple Super Bowls, which would allow for the sale of
special seat licenses for those championship games.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Bowl officials have retained consultant Max Muhleman and HOK,
a Missouri company that designs and builds stadiums. It's worth
noting the Chargers, too, have hired Muhleman, who helped Charlotte
land the Carolina Panthers and worked with groups in Baltimore,
Nashville, St. Louis and Oakland, and HOK.</TE>
<TE>   Many people in San Diego have questioned why the Chargers need a
new stadium, especially after taxpayers spent $78 million to upgrade
Qualcomm in 1997. Charger task force member Bruce Henderson, a
longtime community watchdog, said the actual cost was between $150
million and $200 million if one were to factor in the cost of the
ticket guarantee and extending the trolley line to the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The main reason NFL owners want new stadiums is the money-making
potential of luxury suites, which generate revenues that a team
doesn't have to share with the other 31 teams in the league. Qualcomm
has 113 of those suites, significantly fewer when compared to newer
NFL stadiums such as Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Heinz Field in
Pittsburgh and Washington's FedEx Field.</TE>
<TE>   In a presentation to the task force three months ago, NFL
consultant Rick Horrow presented figures showing the Chargers' local
revenue ranked 24th of the 31 teams playing in 2001. He said the
Chargers were projected to fall to 27th this year, to 28th in 2003,
and to 29th in 2004 and 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chargers will be economically uncompetitive without a new
revenue-generating facility," Horrow told the task force.</TE>
<TE>   That concept does not necessarily leave San Diegans reaching for
their wallets.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see the Chargers stay," said Bill Adair, vice
president of a San Diego realty company that has purchased Charger
season tickets since 1961. "It would be a sad commentary not to have
a team here. I could see spending some more money on Qualcomm
Stadium, but I can't see building a new stadium for them."</TE>
<TE>   Although there has been no formal presentation to this effect, the
Chargers envision splitting the cost of a new stadium with the city,
and building the venue on the current 166-acre Qualcomm site. Fabiani
said the city could use part of that land for open space, a park
along a beautified river, and mixed-use development that would
generate tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Mitrovich, president of the City Club, cannot imagine civic
leaders rushing to endorse any plan that taps into the general fund.</TE>
<TE>   "Who is there that really wants to put their political fortunes on
the line for the Chargers?" he said. "I don't know that there's
anyone."</TE>

<LD>With Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom on the injured list for at least
the next month, the starting small forward spot has gone to Marko
Jaric almost by default. Jaric, a 6-foot-7 rookie from Yugoslavia,
responded with his best game in the NBA during the Clippers' loss
Friday against the Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<LD>   He had 19 points on eight-for-15 shooting in 35 minutes, looking
more confident in his drives to the basket and on his outside jump
shots. Coach Alvin Gentry has been forced to play three guards --
Jaric, Andre Miller and Eric Piatkowski -- in the last three games
because of injuries to Maggette (knee) and Odom (ankle).</LD>
<LD>   At least one former teammate believes Jaric will eventually excel
at the point guard position for the Clippers.</LD>
<TE>   "He's going to be good," said King center Vlade Divac, who played
with Jaric on the Yugoslav team that won the gold medal at the World
Championships. "He's a good defender and he's strong. When he played
point guard for our national team, he really understood the position
by getting everybody involved, and he saw the floor well."</TE>

<LD>USC crunched Notre Dame, 44-13, at the Coliseum on Saturday night,
but now comes the really hard part -- crunching the bowl championship
series numbers.</LD>
<LD>   USC's victory, combined with No. 3 Oklahoma's earlier loss, had
officials and conference commissioners almost paralyzed with
possibilities.</LD>
<LD>   "That Oklahoma loss complicated the hell out of it," Clark Cook,
the Orange Bowl's football chairman, said in the Coliseum press box.</LD>
<TE>   The Trojans won an important game on the field, but they still
don't know where they're going to play after the holidays or which
team they're going to be playing.</TE>
<TE>   USC's list of possible bowls has been narrowed to ... Fiesta,
Rose, Orange, Sugar or Holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Seriously.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are, conceivably, two losses (Miami and Georgia) from
playing in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship yet, without
playing another game, could drop all the way to the Holiday Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   USC goes to the Rose Bowl if UCLA beats Washington State on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   USC goes to the Orange Bowl if it gets an automatic BCS bid and
the Orange Bowl has no choice but to take the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   USC goes to the Sugar if it gets an automatic bid, the Orange
takes another at-large team, and USC is forced to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   USC goes to the Holiday if Washington State wins the Rose Bowl bid
and USC does not get an at-large selection -- a remote possibility,
but it could happen.</TE>
<TE>   Before it considers any or all of this conundrum, USC should send
flowers to Oklahoma State for upsetting Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon result could vault USC to No. 4 in Monday's BCS
standings and, if the standings held up through the final rankings on
Dec. 8, would guarantee the Trojans no worse than an at-large berth
in a BCS game.</TE>
<TE>   How?</TE>
<TE>   USC ranked No. 6 in last week's standings, .94 behind No. 5 Iowa.
With Oklahoma's loss, USC might be able to leapfrog Iowa for No. 4.</TE>
<TE>   There's no telling if the Trojans can overtake Iowa, which
finished its season Nov. 16, but it appears USC could pick up BCS
ground in the poll average and computer component elements.</TE>
<TE>   If USC gets to No. 4 and Washington State defeats UCLA to win the
Rose Bowl bid, either the Sugar or Orange Bowl must take the Trojans,
breaking a long tradition of those bowls not hosting West Coast
teams. (No Pac-10 school has ever played in the Sugar Bowl and only
one school, Washington, has appeared in the Orange.)</TE>
<TE>   "USC would be a great draw for our bowl," Sugar Bowl president
Oscar Gwin said, although even he wasn't sure how the Trojans would
land in the Jan. 1 New Orleans game.</TE>
<TE>   If Washington State loses to UCLA, of course, the at-large
question is moot, as USC would win the Pac-10 title and go to the
Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   If USC gets the No. 4 spot, and Washington State goes to the Rose
Bowl, the Orange Bowl could get squeezed into a difficult decision.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, the Orange Bowl would get the first at-large pick if it
loses No. 1 Miami to the Fiesta Bowl. In this scenario, the Orange
Bowl could choose from a pool of Iowa, USC, Notre Dame or the Big 12
champion (Oklahoma or Colorado).</TE>
<TE>   If the Orange Bowl takes two-loss Notre Dame, it would knock 11-1
Iowa out of the BCS. If the Orange takes Iowa, it would greatly
displease the Pac-10 and the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "The Orange Bowl would be discouraged from taking Iowa," Pac-10
Commissioner Tom Hansen said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But what's the Orange to do? It could be left no choice but to
take USC, even though the Orange Bowl's future in the BCS might be
tied to being able to sell out its game.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very complicated choice this year," the Orange Bowl's
Cook said, "but that doesn't mean we won't make the right choice."</TE>
<TE>   The Orange Bowl's nightmare scenario would be resolved if UCLA
beats Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   That would put USC in the Rose Bowl, and leave the Orange Bowl to
take Notre Dame and allowing Iowa to play in Pasadena in an almost
dream matchup of top-five teams.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this is provided Saturday's lopsided loss does not
knock the Irish out of the BCS top 12 (not likely), which would make
them BCS ineligible.</TE>
<TE>   Despite USC's dominant performance Saturday, it still is not
entirely in the BCS clear.</TE>
<TE>   How's that?</TE>
<TE>   If Miami and Georgia win next week, and USC does not jump Iowa in
the BCS, Iowa will get the automatic at-large bid at No. 4, leaving
the Orange Bowl to choose between two-loss Notre Dame and two-loss
USC.</TE>
<TE>   This seems a ridiculously obvious choice in that USC just pounded
Notre Dame, but the Orange Bowl may still take the Irish because of
their national drawing power.</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, the Orange Bowl has nothing but nice things to say about
USC.</TE>
<TE>   The reality, though, is that the game would be loath to stage a
possible USC-Florida State matchup.</TE>
<TE>   "SC has done all it can to protect itself, sending athletic
department officials to South Florida to lobby on the Trojans'
behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen said Saturday his conference is willing to put $500,000
toward subsidizing a possible USC trip to the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The Pac-10 is very interested in not getting shortchanged in this
deal.</TE>
<TE>   "Our athletic directors have told us to take a very aggressive
stance on getting a second [BCS] team in," Hansen said.</TE>
<TE>   A second team in the BCS would mean an additional $4.5 million to
be distributed to conference schools on top of the $13-million BCS
bowl payout.</TE>
<TE>   It is a byproduct of the BCS system that vested interests should
be so varied.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl is rooting for a USC-Iowa matchup, while it is in
the Pac-10's financial interest to have Washington State in the Rose
Bowl and USC in the Sugar or Orange.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange Bowl will be huge UCLA fans next week, if only to
extricate itself from a politically sensitive decision.</TE>
<TE>   Other than that, it was just another USC-Notre Dame game.</TE>

<LD>There are a couple of ways to view the Mighty Ducks' situation. But
the hard fact is, a point a game will not get them in the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "We understand that," Duck center Matt Cullen said. "We let some
points get away, losing leads in the last 10 minutes. We're not
satisfied. The attitude here now is we want to win."</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks have managed ties in their last three games. But they
blew two-goal leads in two of them.</LD>
<TE>   They have 25 points through 24 games, but it took 94 points to
make the playoffs last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have lost only once in regulation during the last 11
games. But they have won only twice in the last nine games.</TE>
<TE>   "You can look at it any way you want," Coach Mike Babcock said. "I
would like to be in first place. We're not. We've played 24 games and
won only eight.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago, they would have thrown a parade [to be where we are
now]. No one thinks like that any more. I'm a glass-is-half-full kind
of guy. We're a better team and we're in every game."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Babcock did acknowledge one important thing.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to win a game, though," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck and King officials have moved forward with plans for a rookie
tournament before training camp next season. Plans are for a six-team
tournament that would also involve the Phoenix Coyotes, Vancouver
Canucks and Calgary Flames.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of interest in this," Duck General Manager Bryan
Murray said. "We're looking into where to hold it now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NHL has not cleared Chicago forward Theo Fleury to play, but
he could be in the lineup tonight when the Blackhawks play the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Fleury, suspended indefinitely for violating terms of his
substance-abuse aftercare program, arrived late for practice Friday
after oversleeping.</TE>

<HD>No Rest for Irish Defense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The offense was woefully inept, but it wasn't the offense that made
Notre Dame's reputation.</LD>
<LD>   It was the defense, and USC sliced it to pieces.</LD>
<LD>   Notre Dame cornerback Shane Walton strode up the Coliseum tunnel
carrying his bag, but not any answers.</LD>
<TE>   "They outplayed us. They deserved to win the game. There's not
much more you can say."</TE>
<TE>   Nose guard Cedric Hilliard was willing to try, but quickly
realized he had no explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I can help you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   USC scored 20 more points against Notre Dame in its 44-13 victory
Saturday than any other team did this season -- and more than any
Trojan team against the Irish since the famous 1974 55-24
come-from-behind victory.</TE>
<TE>   But there were far more remarkable numbers than those.</TE>
<TE>   No team ever ran up more yards on the Irish than the Trojans' 610.</TE>
<TE>   And no quarterback ever passed for more yards against the Irish
than Carson Palmer's 425. (Miami's Steve Walsh passed for 424 in
1988.)</TE>
<TE>   "He was able to pick us apart as a defense," linebacker Courtney
Watson said. "We weren't able to slow him down -- him or the wide
receivers."</TE>
<TE>   This was a defense that was third in the nation in scoring
defense, giving up little more than 13 points a game, and fifth in
total defense, giving up less than 271 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Two opponents -- a top-25 Maryland team and a Rutgers team that
hung with Miami for three quarters -- didn't score at all against the
Irish.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State, with all its speed and skill, scored 24.</TE>
<TE>   USC scored almost at will.</TE>
<TE>   Vontez Duff, Notre Dame's big-play cornerback, became just another
guy for Mike Williams and Keary Colbert to beat.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't play good. We made some mistakes, and they
capitalized," Duff said.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame hadn't given up more than 418 yards in a game this
season, and Palmer accounted for 419 alone, with 425 passing and
minus-6 rushing.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't quite the quarterback Notre Dame Coach Tyrone
Willingham remembers from his days at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say he is vastly improved in his understanding of himself
and his system," Willingham said.</TE>
<TE>   "He has great control of himself and the system. Even when we were
able to get pressure on him, he responded with some nice throws and
well-timed plays.... I think you'd have to say he played the best
we've seen this year."</TE>
<TE>   Before stopping the pass, Notre Dame's bread-and-butter is
stopping the run -- seven of 11 teams they played before USC didn't
manage 100 yards.</TE>
<TE>   But Justin Fargas ran for 120, and USC finished with 185.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish offense, with its four first downs, didn't help, but
it's hard to say if anything would have.</TE>
<TE>   "What we hoped for was at some point we'd get our offense into a
flow to take some of the pressure off our defense," Willingham said.
"We were unable to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "We faced a good football team that took it to us, and we weren't
able to stay with the pace they set for us."</TE>

<HD>Smolinski's Spot Secure Despite Slump</HD>

<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although King center Bryan Smolinski has scored merely one goal in
his last 10 games and two in his last 17, Coach Andy Murray hasn't
even considered taking the veteran center off the first line or
cutting his playing time.</LD>
<LD>   "He's a good player in so many ways," Murray said. "We'd like to
see more production, but I still think his game is good. Sometimes
you get players who struggle and you say, 'What are they doing?'
That's not the case with him.</LD>
<LD>   "We rate our players, and Bryan has had very few average or below
average [grades]. I wouldn't say he's always been exemplary, but he's
usually been on the plus side."</LD>
<TE>   Smolinski continues to kill penalties and play the power play,
averaging 18 minutes 43 seconds' ice time per game in the Kings'
first 23 games. In that span, he took a team-high 66 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say it's a lack of chances. That's one thing I'd be
worried about if that were the case," he said. "I'd say I could
probably have seven or eight goals now, yeah. I couldn't find the net
early. But I'm very happy with the way I'm playing.</TE>

<HD>It Takes Kings Just a Second</HD>
<DH>Armstrong, Belanger get goals 27 seconds apart as L.A.
scores four times in middle period and beats the Blackhawks, 4-1.</DH>

<LD>The Kings are doing more than merely treading water while they wait
for Jason Allison and Adam Deadmarsh to recover from injuries.</LD>
<LD>   They've stayed afloat in the Western Conference playoff scramble
by emphasizing defense and tenacity, and both characteristics proved
valuable in their 4-1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Saturday
night before a sellout crowd of 18,118 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   First-line left wing Erik Rasmussen scored their first goal, but
support players Mike Cammalleri, Derek Armstrong and Eric Belanger
produced the other three goals during a second-period surge.</LD>
<TE>   The Blackhawks' 13 shots on Felix Potvin were the fewest given up
by the Kings this season, part of a total and totally necessary
effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we played a solid game. We're finally getting everything
together," defenseman Jaroslav Modry said. "We realize we've got to
get the job done, no matter who's in the lineup or who's not. We're
not looking for excuses. We've got to find a way to win and play
solid."</TE>
<TE>   They accomplished that Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably our best defensive and offensive game this
year," said Belanger, making a strong turnaround from a minus-three
defensive performance against the Panthers on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of guys have stepped up," added Belanger, who has scored
goals in successive games after going 18 games without a goal. "We've
had a tough schedule the last month, and we knew if we came back from
[their eight-game, 17-day] trip about .500 we'd be in good shape the
rest of the year, and that's what happened."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings made things happen against the Blackhawks, who are 1-5
on a seven-game trip that ends today at Anaheim against the Mighty
Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been a little bit offensively challenged, but we found a
way to score goals," King Coach Andy Murray said. "A lot of it was
not fancy plays. We were going to the net, getting our sticks on some
deflections or redirections."</TE>
<TE>   After a scoreless first period, the tempo and action picked up in
the second period. Scoring three times in a span of 4 minutes 44
seconds, the Kings built a 4-1 lead and drove Blackhawk Coach Brian
Sutter to pull goalie Jocelyn Thibault and throw rookie Craig
Andersson in for his NHL debut.</TE>
<TE>   Thibault had little help preventing the Kings' goals. Rasmussen
capped off a fine passing play by eluding defenseman Steve Poapst and
scoring his second goal of the season, at 4:50. Bryan Smolinski made
it possible by sliding a pass to his left to Ziggy Palffy before two
Chicago defenders converged on him. Palffy found Rasmussen with a
pass to the slot, and the big left wing redirected the puck past a
helpless Thibault.</TE>
<TE>   However, the lead didn't last long. King defenseman Chris McAlpine
was sent off for roughing at 5:59, and the Blackhawks -- who had
enjoyed merely three seconds of power play time in the first period
-- capitalized on the advantage. Center Alex Zhamnov, skating up the
left side, slid the puck toward Eric Daze, but Daze couldn't get his
stick on it. Kyle Calder pounced on it and beat Potvin at 6:21.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings cashed in on the power play at 8:20. Thibault stopped
the first shot, by Modry, but the rebound flew upward and into the
slot. Cammalleri batted it past Thibault with a waist-high swipe,
below the height of the crossbar and therefore legal.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings killed a penalty against Mathieu Schneider and took a
3-1 lead at 12:37, after Armstrong redirected a shot by Schneider
past the beleaguered Thibault. Belanger's close-range backhander at
13:04 was the 27th and last shot Thibault faced.</TE>
<TE>   Although he started all but three of Chicago's previous 22 games
and ranked among the NHL leaders in minutes, wins and shutouts, he
was hard-pressed to stop the Kings once they got into the slot area
for high-percentage shots.</TE>
<TE>   "It was as good an effort as we've had all year," Potvin said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been five games since Shaquille O'Neal returned from surgery, so
every win since (three) has been a sign the Lakers have returned to
their championship form and every defeat (two) more evidence they
lack the depth to extend their run of championships to four.</LD>
<LD>   The analyses are further muddled by injury, first O'Neal's, then
the rest -- Devean George, Samaki Walker, Robert Horry, et al -- and
so the Lakers concluded their first month 6-11, without a quality win
and with a raft of losses to the likes of last-place Cleveland and
Miami.</LD>
<LD>   If it is consolation, they don't like it, either. These aren't
quite the shrug-and-go Lakers of past seasons, where losses pass with
hardly an eyebrow raised. Kobe Bryant has been quick to scold, and so
distraught was O'Neal after Wednesday's loss at Orlando that he
observed, "We're playing like when Del Harris coached us; no fire."</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers held a short practice Saturday mostly for reserves
after the four-hour, late-night flight from Memphis. They soothed
their injured -- Horry's sore left foot is the new concern, but
George is expected to come off the injured list -- and play the
Minnesota Timberwolves tonight.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, there is no rhythm to their season.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, we're just kind of grinding it out," Laker
guard Derek Fisher said. "Fortunately, we did what was necessary
[Friday] to win. We're not playing consistent basketball. It's going
to take time."</TE>

Shaquille O'Neal averaged 27.5 points in the two wins last season, 28
in the two losses.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Jordan made his first start this season but couldn't come up
with one last clutch play.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan had an offensive rebound, an assist and blocked a shot in
the last minute, but his pass to Bryon Russell with five seconds to
play was stolen, depriving the Washington Wizards of a chance at a
game-winning shot in a 95-94 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on
Saturday night at Washington.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he took one extra dribble," Wizard Coach Doug Collins
said. "I think he probably wishes he would have pulled up."</LD>
<TE>   Said Jordan: "It was one of those situations where you cannot not
get a shot off.... I thought Russell was open underneath the basket."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Coach Larry Brown credited Keith Van Horn with making
the defensive stop.</TE>
<TE>   "We all knew that the ball was going to Michael," Van Horn said.
"We as a team just did a good job of collapsing when he drove with
the ball."</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the 76ers' seventh in a row. The Wizards have lost
six in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson scored 12 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter,
making long jumpers despite tight defense from rookie Juan Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Stackhouse kept the Wizards in the game, scoring 25 of his
38 points in the second half. Jordan scored 16 points on 8-for-20
shooting in a season-high 37 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 103, Chicago 90 -- Nick Van Exel returned from a nine-game
injury absence and had 17 points and seven assists for the Mavericks
at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Playing for the first time since their 14-0 start was stopped at
Indiana, Dallas never trailed and used an 11-0 run to regain control
after Chicago got within five points late in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   It was Don Nelson's 200th victory as coach of the Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 93, Portland 86 -- Jason Kidd had 28 points and eight
rebounds, and the Nets withstood a fourth-quarter rally by the Trail
Blazers at Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   The defending Eastern Conference champion Nets had lost their six
previous games at Portland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 107, Utah 85 -- Stephen Jackson scored 17 points at
San Antonio and the Spurs held Karl Malone to 1-for-16 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The loss was Utah's 10th in a row to the Spurs. The Jazz had a
six-game winning streak ended.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 117, Atlanta 92 -- Tracy McGrady scored his 28 points in
the first three quarters at Orlando, Fla., and the Magic won its
third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic closed the second quarter with a 21-5 run for a 69-50
lead. The onslaught continued in the third quarter, when the Magic
made its first eight field goal attempts to push the lead to 31
points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami 85, Cleveland 79 -- Rookie Caron Butler scored six of his
team-high 16 points in the last two minutes at Miami and the Heat
held on to hand the Cavaliers their 14th consecutive loss .</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 92, New Orleans 86 -- Allan Houston recovered from a
scoreless second half to make a clinching jumper with 13 seconds left
at New York, and the Knicks beat the Hornets in the third overtime
game between the teams this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 109, Detroit 86 -- Sam Cassell scored 24 points and Tim
Thomas had 21 to lead the Bucks at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons had defeated the Bucks, 96-91, on Friday at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee led by as many as 28 points in the fourth quarter.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It didn't take Sergei Samsonov long to get back involved in the
Boston Bruins' play-making.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruin forward, who sat out 18 games because of a sprained
right wrist, returned to the lineup Saturday night and set up one of
linemate Joe Thornton's two goals and scored a third-period goal to
help the Bruins beat the Pittsburgh Penguins, 3-2, at Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   "Not bad, huh? It's nice to have him back," said Thornton, who
scored his 12th and 13th goals and assisted on Samsonov's goal at
2:02 of the third period. "It's so nice to have that speed on the
left side. For his first game back, he looked pretty good out there."</LD>
<TE>   The loss ended a four-game winning streak for the Atlantic
Division-leading Penguins. The Northeast Division-leading Bruins are
9-1-1 in their last 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, we've got some good players," said Thornton, who has three
goals and 11 points in a five-game scoring streak. "I don't think a
lot of people realize that. This is not surprising to any of the guys
in here, and it's been a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 5, Florida 2 -- Matt Cooke scored a short-handed goal,
and the Canucks had three power-play goals at Sunrise, Fla., to

<TE>   Toronto 3, Buffalo 1 -- Alexander Mogilny had a goal and two

<TE>   Toronto's Ed Belfour turned aside 19 shots and has given up only
14 goals in his last nine games.*</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 1, Colorado 0 -- Tommy Salo made 22 saves and Daniel
Cleary scored his first goal this season, and the host Oilers
extended their unbeaten streak to six games.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second shutout for Salo and the 32nd of his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 4, Columbus 2 -- Erik Cole scored two second-period goals

<LD>It's back.</LD>
<LD>   The tradition, the tingle, the grass-stained Trojan who stalks to
the middle of the Coliseum field and refuses to leave.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm pitching a tent, right here, right now," guard Zach Wilson
said Saturday night, pointing up to a flickering, fabulous
scoreboard. "Look at that up there! Just look at that! Would you want
to go home?"</LD>
<TE>   It's back.</TE>
<TE>   The roar that shakes the Hollywood sign, the band still in full
conquest an hour after the final tackle, the old men in cardinal and
gold and tears.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I understand," said Darrell Rideaux, two decades of emotion
spilling across the muddy turf around him. "Now I understand what it
means to play USC football."</TE>
<TE>   It's back, strong enough to bite the thorns off a rose, blustery
enough to burst into the BCS, good enough Saturday to hit the
nation's seventh-ranked team square in its Knute while knocking it
flat on its Rockne.</TE>
<TE>   The final score was USC 44, Notre Dame 13.</TE>
<TE>   The final plays were handoffs from a backup quarterback to a
backup running back because the Trojans didn't want to rub it in.</TE>
<TE>   The final verdict is unimpeachable.</TE>
<TE>   USC football, in all its 1960s and '70s glory, has returned.</TE>
<TE>   The startling offense. The numbing defense. The guy who should win
the Heisman Trophy, darn it.</TE>
<TE>   The 91,432 fans turning the ancient Coliseum into the definition
of college football cool again.</TE>
<TE>   The index finger and middle finger being shaken until both are
numb again.</TE>
<TE>   "A beautiful, beautiful thing," said defensive end Omar Nazel, the
crowd roaring and chanting around him as he walked haltingly and
reluctantly off the field.</TE>
<TE>   "When they were recruiting me, they told me, this is what it is.
And today I see, they were right."</TE>
<TE>   While the Trojans had won six consecutive games and hinted at such
greatness, this was the night it returned.</TE>
<TE>   This was when many thought they would finally stumble.</TE>
<TE>   This was, instead, the night when they leaped into history.</TE>
<TE>   As in, the Trojans' 610 total yards were the most ever against a
Notre Dame team in that school's 90-year football history.</TE>
<TE>   As in, Notre Dame's four first downs marked the school's worst
offensive output in 65 years.</TE>
<TE>   It was so bad, the Gipper would have sued them for malpractice.</TE>
<TE>   It was so bad, Rudy would have played the entire fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   It was so bad, the Trojans knew they had won the game at halftime,
and they only led by four points.</TE>
<TE>   They knew because of the tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   Coming off the field, stinging from a 75-yard Trojan touchdown
drive in the final 1:07, the Irish were in front of the Trojans as
both teams came up the tunnel toward their locker rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "And they were walking," Allmond said. "They were looking
frustrated and tired and walking. They didn't look like a team that
wanted to come out in the second half."</TE>
<TE>   So what did USC do? What USC did the entire game, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "We never walk up that tunnel, we run up that tunnel," Allmond
said. "So we ran right past them."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the suddenly famous Tyrone Willingham said to his Irish
players in that locker room, next time he might want to keep it to
himself.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the second half, Notre Dame gained four yards in
three plays. The Trojans countered by gaining 55 yards in four plays,
scoring another touchdown to clinch the game on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   With about two hours left.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we made it look it easy, but it really wasn't," said
Allmond, smiling. "Seriously."</TE>
<TE>   He's going to have to do better than that.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish were the most poorly prepared, poorly executing team
that the Trojans have played.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish wouldn't finish in the top five in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   If Willingham turned in this sort of performance at USC, his
honeymoon would be immediately over.</TE>
<TE>   All of which makes you wonder.... All these East Coast "experts"
who have been hyping Notre Dame all year, are these the same folks
who will be voting on the Heisman?</TE>
<TE>   The ballots are due Dec. 11.</TE>
<TE>   After going 32 for 46 for 425 yards and four touchdowns with two
interceptions on his biggest national stage of the year, how can
Carson Palmer not win it?</TE>
<TE>   Ken Dorsey and Willis McGahee had nice games for Miami on
Saturday, but nothing like this. Brad Banks played well at Iowa, but
never like that. Larry Johnson ran great at Penn State, but stumbled
in all the big games.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer -- and I swear, this is the end of my three-column Heisman
campaign on his behalf -- was at his best after he was at his worst.</TE>
<TE>   It came after he threw a silly pass into end zone coverage that
resulted in his first interception in more than a month. It was late
in the second quarter, ruining USC's chance to improve on a lead.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Palmer threw the ball again, the Trojans had given up
a blocked punt for a Notre Dame touchdown and lost that lead, now
trailing, 13-10.</TE>
<TE>   This was when a younger Palmer might have folded. But this was
when he showed again why he deserves that trophy, by completing five
of six passes while leading the Trojans to that late touchdown that
led to the Irish tunnel walk.</TE>
<TE>   One of those passes was a screen to Justin Fargas that he threw
while being dragged down. The final was a 19-yard touchdown pass to
Mike Williams that went over one defender and around another
defender.</TE>
<TE>   And now the Trojans will either go over Iowa or around Washington
State and into the sort of bowl game they deserve. With the sort of
team they remember.</TE>

<LD>Once again, Neil Gilman will scour the sports section this morning,
eagerly turning the pages in search of schools that won big football
games. Then he'll place a call to their athletic departments.</LD>
<LD>   It won't necessarily be a congratulatory call. It will be strictly
business.</LD>
<LD>   Gilman is president of Gilman Gear, the nation's largest
manufacturer of goal posts. He loves to read stories or see TV
highlights of goal posts getting ripped down. Then he goes and builds
them back up.</LD>
<TE>   Business has been brisk this season for Gilman -- he has received
at least nine midseason orders and might be getting more after
Oklahoma State fans destroyed the goal posts Saturday after a 38-28
victory over Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become the fashionable thing to do," Gilman said.</TE>
<TE>   The recent rash of ripped-down posts at colleges across the
country has the Gilman, Conn., company closing in on a sales record
of 16 sold during the 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   Fans have shown little remorse for the safety of fellow revelers,
much less the cost of replacing goal posts, to the dismay of athletic
department officials.</TE>
<TE>   After Utah defeated Brigham Young on Nov. 23, Utes fans stormed
the field, tore down the aluminum goal posts and carried them to the
top of Rice-Eccles Stadium, redefining the concept of a costly
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "You're looking at spending $5,800 because a couple of students
thought it'd be funny to take them down," Utah event and facilities
coordinator Steve Pyne told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Utah isn't the only place where people have been downright rude to
the uprights.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Iowa fans stormed the field after the Hawkeyes
defeated Minnesota, tearing down one of the goal posts and parading
around the Metrodome with it for a couple of victory laps. They then
broke the post into smaller, easier-to-manage pieces so they could
carry the remnants up the stairs and out of the dome.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, the posts are rarely bothered by UCLA or USC fans.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, when USC beat UCLA to end an eight-game losing streak to
the Bruins, some fans rushed the field and a few had confrontations
with police. The same thing occurred last season, when USC ripped the
Bruins, 27-0.</TE>
<TE>   But the goal posts are usually spared, as they were Saturday after
the Trojans' 44-13 victory over Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "Trojan fans are pretty mellow," said John Henderson, USC
assistant athletic director in charge of operations and game
management. "But a lot of fans have been mellow across the country
until this year and it's created a problem. The alcohol pregame and
during the game contributes to a lot of it."</TE>
<TE>   Gilman's company makes goal posts for about 9,000 high schools,
900 colleges and most NFL teams. The top-of-the-line goal post, a
30-foot aluminum model, costs $5,600 and is used by NFL teams and
many major colleges. A less-expensive 20-foot model, used by high
schools and some colleges, costs $4,600.</TE>
<TE>   Gilman's goal posts are made to withstand wind and weather, but
not a mob of crazed fans, so about 20 schools have switched from
aluminum to steel goal posts designed to withstand rowdy fans.</TE>
<TE>   After Ohio State beat Michigan on Nov. 23 in Columbus to secure a
spot in the national championship game, fans stormed the field but
were unable to rip down the steel posts.</TE>
<TE>   "We choose to pay for safety," said Don Patko, assistant athletic
director for facilities at Ohio State. "The decision has worked out
for us."</TE>
<TE>   The steel posts aren't indestructible, but they can buy security
an extra 30 minutes to get fans off the posts before they start to
fall.</TE>
<TE>   At $30,000, the steel posts cost as much as six times as much as
the aluminum ones, but it doesn't stem their popularity -- they are
installed at several other Big Ten schools and at Notre Dame,
Stanford and Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   Schools are striking back in other ways, figuring out how to
regain money spent on new goal posts ... and then some.</TE>
<TE>   Take North Carolina State, which lost a post after a 17-7 victory
over Florida State on Nov. 23, but will gain economically by selling
175 one-foot pieces of the posts.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolfpack finished the regular season with a 10-3 record. The
cost of each piece: $103.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Times of Turmoil</TE>
<TE>   Used to be that the winner of the Florida State-Florida game was
one step closer to a national title.</TE>
<TE>   Now the winner is simply known as the Turmoil Bowl champion.</TE>
<TE>   The teams met Saturday with seven combined losses, two coaches
feeling the heat and a host of touchy quarterback issues. Not to
mention that neither team was ranked in the top 10 for this game for
the first time since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, there was besieged first-year Florida Coach Ron Zook,
who had lost home games to Miami and LSU by a combined 54 points and
had been blamed for Rex Grossman's fall from Heisman Trophy candidate
to forgotten quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Things weren't much better in Tallahassee, where the Seminoles
were far from the team that started the season ranked No. 3 in the
Associated Press poll. More recently, the Seminoles were jolted by
last week's dismissal of quarterback Adrian McPherson, arrested on
charges of stealing a blank check and receiving nearly $3,500 after
it was cashed.</TE>
<TE>   The Seminoles can call themselves the titans of turmoil: They
defeated Florida, 31-14.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not OK in Oklahoma</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops seemed obsessed with cutting down
Oklahoma State after the Sooners' loss last season to their in-state
rival cost them a shot at the national championship. On two
occasions, Stoops made light of programs that were "satisfied with
four wins," a shot at Oklahoma State's 4-7 record last season.</TE>
<TE>   Fast forward to Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State led the Sooners, 31-6, on the way to a 38-28
victory that wiped out what was left of Oklahoma's national title
hopes. Again.</TE>
<TE>   Stoops seemed remorseful this time, after Oklahoma State rolled up
506 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no excuses," he said. "They did an excellent job all
around -- their coaches and players -- and just beat us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Backyard Fun</TE>
<TE>   There's a reason it doesn't have a cute name like the Apple Cup or
the Old Oaken Bucket game.</TE>
<TE>   The annual game between Pittsburgh and West Virginia is called the
Backyard Brawl with good reason. A short bus ride through hilly,
sparsely populated countryside separates two schools that have turned
the perception of cultural differences into a lively rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh represents big-city elitism in the eyes of Mountaineer
fans, while Pittsburgh fans feel West Virginians are a bunch of
people biding their time until the start of hunting season.</TE>
<TE>   This year's meeting, the 95th between the teams, was particularly
important because both brawlers were ranked going into the game for
the first time since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Score one for the hunters: West Virginia defeated Pittsburgh,
28-21.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning this is [big] because it means we're 9-3 and going to a
bowl -- and Pitt always is the team we want to beat," said West
Virginia running back Quincy Wilson.</TE>

<HD>Bruins Still in a Blue Period</HD>
<DH>Duke is also inexperienced, but it drops UCLA to 0-2 for
first time since 1961 with a decisive 84-73 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>UCLA center T.J. Cummings sat in a near-empty locker room thumbing
through the index of his pocket Bible until he found a list of
readings under a word that described his day: "Trials."</LD>
<LD>   "I'll study these all the way home," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Answers to Bruin tribulations ranging from tardiness to torpor are
elusive. But perhaps a few were uncovered during an 84-73 loss to
Duke on Saturday in the John R. Wooden Tradition before 18,345 at
Conseco Fieldhouse.</LD>
<TE>   At first glance, the No. 14 Bruins seem far from measuring up to
any portion of the legacy established by the event's namesake, but
starting 0-2 for the first time in 41 years actually is in the Wooden
tradition -- he was the UCLA coach the last time it occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last six years, something of a Steve Lavin tradition has
developed, far less glorious and pristine than that of Wooden, but a
tradition, nonetheless. It goes as follows:</TE>
<TE>   Hard knocks early lead, haltingly, maddeningly, yet inevitably, to
greater glory late.</TE>
<TE>   So the contrition expressed by Cummings and guard Ray Young for
being late for a team meeting Friday night and being held out of the
starting lineup might lead to a semblance of accountability from a
team with questionable work habits.</TE>
<TE>   The first real contribution from freshman centers Ryan Hollins and
Michael Fey, who combined for six points and eight rebounds with no
turnovers, might prompt Lavin to move the slender Cummings back to
his natural forward position and spare him any more pummeling in the
paint.</TE>
<TE>   And experiencing firsthand the suffocating defensive intensity and
offensive precision of a Duke team that is every bit as inexperienced
as UCLA might inspire the Bruins to adopt those characteristics.</TE>
<TE>   "They played solid team defense for 40 minutes," Young marveled.
"They did nothing extra-special. They just played so solid the entire
game."</TE>
<TE>   Although Hollins and guard Jon Crispin started instead of Cummings
and Young, the Bruins took a 12-2 lead. Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski
called timeout, made wholesale substitutions and the sixth-ranked
Blue Devils scored the next 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   "The four kids coming off the bench did an incredible job of
turning the game around," Krzyzewski said.</TE>
<TE>   Once Duke (3-0) seized control, it applied a vice grip, not
relinquishing the lead over the last 33 minutes. The margin grew to
21 points in the second half and was never less than five after
freshman guard J.J. Redick's three-point basket with 7:48 left in the
first half.</TE>
<TE>   Redick, one of six Blue Devil freshmen, scored a game-high 20
points, making five three-point shots. Forward Shavlik Randolph, the
most impressive first-year player in victories over Army and
Davidson, was scoreless, but Krzyzewski simply called on others.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Chris Duhon had 14 points, eight assists and set the
tone with nonstop defensive pressure that enabled Duke to produce 20
points on fastbreaks.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Devils were stronger inside as well, outscoring the
Bruins in the paint, 42-22. Power forward Nick Horvath scored 16
points close to the basket and had his way with Cummings.</TE>
<TE>   "We just had more energy," Duhon said. "We were more aggressive on
defense, which opened up easy opportunities. We like to get out and
run and we were able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Jason Kapono led UCLA with 19 points, but most came with
the outcome already determined. In the first half, he made only one
of five shots and was held to three points.</TE>
<TE>   "They were grabbing, tugging and pushing me the whole game," he
said. "They wanted to shadow me and take me out of the picture."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Dijon Thompson scored 10 of the first 12 UCLA points,
making his first four shots, but he picked up two fouls, sat out the
last nine minutes of the half and never regained his touch.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat for a long time, and when you are hot it seems even
longer," he said. "I told [Lavin], 'Let me foul out. Just keep me in
there.' "</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Hollins and Fey were on the floor together for stretches,
never embarrassing themselves but rarely making an impact. Young (13
points) and point guard Cedric Bozeman (11) tried to pick up the
scoring slack, but Duke answered every challenge.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA employed a full-court press in the last few minutes and
forced turnovers on three consecutive Duke possessions. But it was
too little, too late.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin locker room afterward was subdued. The players freely
acknowledged Duke's superiority in every regard except talent.</TE>
<TE>   They long to become like the Blue Devils -- fundamentally sound,
unselfish with the ball, defensively rigorous. Yet they are uncertain
how to get there.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a problem with patience," Kapono said. "We shoot the ball
too quick and we don't play defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody says stuff, and Coach says stuff. What it comes down to
is, when is it going to happen and who is going to do it?"</TE>

<HD>Trojan (Domi)Nation</HD>
<DH>After first sweep of UCLA and Notre Dame since 1981,
Trojans expect big things in bowls</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC started and ended the regular season on a perfect stage.</LD>
<LD>   A prime-time national television audience that included bowl
championship series officials and Heisman Trophy voters watched
Saturday as the sixth-ranked Trojans played seventh-ranked Notre
Dame.</LD>
<LD>   USC put on a show worthy of the spotlight, completing the toughest
schedule in the nation with a 44-13 rout of the Fighting Irish before
91,432 at the Coliseum.</LD>
<TE>   "I hope everyone was paying attention and saw the score,"
quarterback Carson Palmer said. "They need to know that we're for
real now. We are definitely worthy of being a BCS team."</TE>
<TE>   BCS officials will have a hard time ignoring a USC team that
rolled over the nation's fifth-best defense for a season-high 610
yards, the most ever given up by Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   The USC defense was even more overpowering. The Trojans (10-2)
limited the Fighting Irish to 109 yards and four first downs to
complete their first 10-win season since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "This one is the sweetest of the season because it doesn't get any
bigger than Notre Dame," linebacker Melvin Simmons said. "We just
dominated them. We're still rolling."</TE>
<TE>   USC, which defeated Auburn in a prime-time season opener on Labor
Day, has won seven consecutive games since losing to Washington State
in overtime Oct. 5. The Trojans, coming off a 52-21 rout of UCLA,
defeated their two rivals in the same season for the first time since
1981 and the first time in consecutive games since 1978.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so hard to get this done against such a challenging
schedule," said USC Coach Pete Carroll, who remained undefeated in
November games. "But it didn't matter who they were or what color
their jerseys were. It has always been about us."</TE>
<TE>   USC overcame a 13-10 deficit late in the second quarter and scored
34 unanswered points en route to its ninth consecutive home victory
and its first victory over Notre Dame or any top-10 team since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer led the way, passing for 425 yards and four touchdowns, two
to freshman wide receiver Mike Williams, who had 10 receptions for
169 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer completed 32 of 46 passes and had two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely had some bad plays tonight, two in particular," said
Palmer, who still set a school record with 32 touchdown passes this
season. "But as far as the offense was concerned, we were really
clicking."</TE>
<TE>   It did not look as though it would be an easy night for most of
the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The Fighting Irish (10-2) took a 13-10 lead with 1:07 left in the
second quarter when Carlos Pierre-Antoine broke through the line and
blocked a punt by Tom Malone that he recovered in the end zone for a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   USC got the ball back at the 25 and moved downfield on Palmer
completions of 18 yards to Williams and nine, 12 and 16 yards to
Justin Fargas, who rushed for 120 yards in 20 carries.</TE>
<TE>   On first and 15 from the Notre Dame 19, Palmer found Williams on a
post route with five seconds left in the half to give the Trojans a
17-13 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   "To move down field like we did and click like we did -- it
propelled us the rest of the game," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   USC scored on its first three possessions of the third quarter on
a 15-yard touchdown reception by fullback Malaefou MacKenzie and 27-
and 29-yard field goals by Ryan Killeen to go ahead, 30-13.</TE>
<TE>   Sultan McCullough scored on an 11-yard run and MacKenzie had a
10-yard touchdown reception in the fourth quarter to complete the
biggest scoring day against the Fighting Irish this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they had great skill," Notre Dame Coach Tyrone Willingham
said. "They schemed us well and executed well. They're probably as
good of an offense as we've seen."</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Darrell Rideaux, safety DeShaun Hill and linebacker
Mike Pollard intercepted passes for the Trojans, who limited the
Fighting Irish to 70 passing yards and 39 rushing yards.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame was 0 for 13 on third-down conversions.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no explanation for it," Willingham said.</TE>
<TE>   Trojan players believe that BCS officials will have some
explaining to do if the Trojans do not garner serious consideration
for the Orange, Sugar, or -- if Miami or Georgia fall -- Fiesta
bowls.</TE>
<TE>   Their regular season complete, the Trojans will root this week for
UCLA when the Bruins play ninth-ranked Washington State at the Rose
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   USC already clinched a share of the Pacific 10 Conference
championship, and can win the conference outright and play in the
Rose Bowl if UCLA defeats Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   If Washington State wins and goes to the Rose Bowl, the Trojans
expect a BCS berth.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll play anybody and I can't imagine how anybody wouldn't want
us to play in their game," Carroll said. "Although I know that some
people might not want to play us."</TE>

<LD>Gary Klein's keys to the game, and how the Trojans measured up:</LD>
<LD>   1. Establish the running game. Sultan McCullough played the first
series, but Justin Fargas came on and gained 120 yards in 20 carries.
Fargas set up the Trojans' first touchdown with a 47-yard run, his
longest of the year. The Trojans finished with 185 rushing yards.</LD>
<LD>   2. Avoid turnovers. The Trojans, who had not committed a turnover
in two consecutive games, had three against the Irish. Carson Palmer
had two passes intercepted and Hershel Dennis lost a fumble on a
kickoff return.</LD>
<TE>   3. Neutralize Notre Dame special teams. Carlos Pierre-Antoine of
Notre Dame blocked a punt by Tom Malone and recovered it in the end
zone to give the Fighting Irish a 13-10 lead late in the second
quarter. Vontez Duff returned a punt 52 yards and Arnaz Battle
averaged slightly more than 20 yards for four kickoff returns.</TE>

<HD>Williams Delivers for USC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC freshman receiver Mike Williams said he received a valuable bit
of advice from Coach Pete Carroll on Saturday morning:</LD>
<LD>   Stop thinking about your bruised thigh.</LD>
<LD>   "He said, 'Just go out there and compete; let things happen,' "
Williams said. "I went out there carefree. And things definitely
happened."</LD>
<TE>   Williams, who appeared a step slow the previous two weeks in
victories over Arizona State and UCLA, put his injury behind him with
a dominating performance in the Trojans' 44-13 victory over Notre
Dame.</TE>
<TE>   He signaled his return to form by catching 10 passes for 169 yards
and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big night for me," Williams said. "I wanted to have a
big game last week against UCLA, but having a big night against Notre
Dame, that's even better."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' 19-yard touchdown reception from Carson Palmer with five
seconds left in the first half allowed USC to regain the lead, 17-13,
a minute after Notre Dame had gone ahead on a blocked punt that was
recovered in the end zone for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the quarter, Williams caught a six-yard scoring pass
from Palmer to give USC its first lead, 7-6. The 6-foot-5,
223-pounder lingered in the end zone after the touchdown, taking a
long look into the stands filled with cheering fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to appreciate the moment," he said. "Let it all
absorb in."</TE>
<TE>   Williams is USC's first 1,000-yard receiver since Keyshawn Johnson
had 1,434 yards in 1995, becoming the fifth player in school history
to reach that milestone. Williams has 75 catches for 1,066 yards and
13 touchdowns, all Pacific 10 Conference freshman records.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior cornerback Darrell Rideaux intercepted a pass and deflected
another that was caught by USC teammate DeShaun Hill for an
interception in a turnover-plagued stretch of the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Rideaux, a 5-8 senior, intercepted a pass by Notre Dame
quarterback Carlyle Holiday and returned it 29 yards to the Irish 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the guy with the worst hands on defense, but the play slowed
down for me," Rideaux said.</TE>
<TE>   Two plays later, Rideaux jumped with receiver Omar Jenkins for a
long pass from Holiday, with the ball deflecting to Hill. The free
safety caught it for the third interception in four plays, giving USC
possession at its 36.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball hit me in the helmet, but who better to go to than a guy
I grew up with," Rideaux, who played with Hill at Long Beach Poly
High. "We couldn't ask for a better way to end the season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior receiver Kareem Kelly had three catches to tie Johnnie
Morton for the USC reception record with 201. Kelly has caught a pass
in 47 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Palmer became the Pac-10 all-time leader in total offense with
11,314 yards, surpassing Cade McNown of UCLA (11,285).</TE>
